We questioned whether a similar phenomenon could occur prenatally, in chicken embryos at mid- (Ell, out of 20.5 days) or near end(E18) incubation. (V) over dot(O2) was measured with an open-flow system in the sequence of normoxia-normothermia (21%O- (2), 37 degrees C, 30 min), hypoxia in normothermia (Hx-NT, either 18, 15, 12 or 9% O-2, 37 degrees C, 1 hour), hypoxia in hyperthermia (Hx-HT, up to 43 degrees C, 1 hour) and return to normoxia-normothermia (30 min). During Hx-NT (V) over dot(O2) invariably decreased in a [O-2]-dependent fashion. The hypoxic drop in (V) over dot(O2) did not require a post-hypoxic payment of the O-2-debt, implying that the decrease in (V) over dot(O2) reflected hypometabolism. (V) over dot(O2) did not differ significantly between Hx-HT and Hx-NT for [O-2] = 15% or less, as expected by O-2-conformism. Differently, with milder hypoxia (18% O-2), (V) over dot(O2) during Hx-HT significantly exceeded that in Hx-NT, meaning that the value of (V) over dot(O2)( )in Hx-NT was not limited by O-2 supply.

Extracting spatial and temporal joint, partially-joint, and individual sources of multi-subject datasets is of significant importance to analyze common and cross information of multiple subjects. New method: We present a new framework to extract these three types of spatial and temporal sources in multisubject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. In this framework, temporal and spatial independent component analysis are utilized, and a weighted sum of higher-order cumulants is maximized. Results: We evaluate the presented algorithm by analyzing simulated data and one real multi-subject fMRI dataset. Our results on the real dataset are consistent with the existing meta-analysis studies. We show that spatial and temporal jointness of extracted joint and partially-joint sources in the theory of mind regions of brain increase with the age of subjects. Comparison with existing method: In Richardson et al. (2018), predefined regions of interest (ROI) have been used to analyze the real dataset, whereas our unified algorithm simultaneously extracts activated and uncorrelated ROIs, and determines their spatial and temporal jointness without additional computations. Conclusions: Extracting temporal and spatial joint and partially joint sources in a unified algorithm improves the accuracy of joint analysis of the multi-subject fMRI dataset.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'How do common and rare genetic polymorphisms contribute to quantitative traits or disease risk and progression? Multiple human traits have been extensively characterized at the genomic level, revealing their complex genetic architecture. However, it is difficult to resolve the mechanisms by which specific variants contribute to a phenotype. Recently, analyses of variant effects on molecular traits have uncovered intermediate mechanisms that link sequence variation to phenotypic changes. Yet, these methods only capture a fraction of genetic contributions to phenotype. Here, in reviewing the field, it is proposed that complex traits can be understood by characterizing the dynamics of biochemical networks within living cells, and that the effects of genetic variation can be captured on these networks by using protein-protein interaction (PPI) methodologies. This synergy between PPI methodologies and the genetics of complex traits opens new avenues to investigate the molecular etiology of human diseases and to facilitate their prevention or treatment.'},\n",

Optical microcavities are excellent candidates for constructing powerful microlasers and label-free biosensors, owing to their low optical losses and small size. However, most of these microcavity syntheses rely on sophisticated fabrication methods and cannot be manipulated easily. To achieve facile and versatile microcavity fabrication, we present a robust microfluidics method for monodispersed self-coupling optical microcavity fabrication with a fine tunability. The microcavity polydispersity was less than 3%. The optical microcavity size could be varied from 10 to 30 mu m with a steady quality factor (Q) of approximately 1000. The lowest laser threshold that we obtained was 0.82 mu J with a microcavity size of 20 mu m. The doped fluorescent dye concentration can be tuned precisely from 0.001 to 0.05 wt% to explore an optimized fluorescent background. The experimental results and theoretical simulation match well in terms of Q and the electrometric resonance field intensity. Compared with previous precise and practical fabrication methods, we have demonstrated a facile approach for versatile optical microcavity fabrication. This method can vary the microcavity materials, size, doped fluorescent dye concentration, WGM resonance spectrum, Q factor, and laser threshold easily to adapt to various circumstances and specific applications.'},\n",

In order to further the development of MES207 as a NPFFR1 probe, an UPLC-MS/MS bioanalytical method was developed and validated to quantify MES207 in rat plasma for a linearity range of 3-200 ng/mL. The method was applied in the analysis of the plasma, brain, and urine samples collected during pharmacokinetic studies in healthy male and female Sprague Dawley rats. The animals were dosed through oral gavage (50 mg/kg) and intravenously (2.5 mg/kg). Test samples were analyzed using the validated bioanalytical method to generate plasma concentration-time profiles. The results were further subjected to non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix 6.4 (R). MES207 exhibits a large volume of distribution (1.2 +/- 0.6 L), high clearance (0.8 +/- 0.1 L/h), and a poor oral bioavailability (1.7 +/- 0.4%).

There has a great body of research focusing on examining phosphorus fractions, which provide fundamental data that facilitate understanding the risk of P-induced eutrophication. Here, we have extracted the data of P fractions from 484 sediment samples residing in 48 lakes mainly in EU, China and USA. NH4Cl-P and total phosphorus (TP) displayed a well linear relationship, but not applicable to all lakes. Six groups were categorised as per the slope and intercept by using the clustering analysis. Specific measures were recommended to curb P release risk by considering the characteristics of each group. For instance, TP controlling is deemed as a priority in group with steep linear dependence of NH4Cl-P on TP. A significant correlation was determined between TP and NaOH-P (r(2) = 0.63). Among other findings, larger lake area significantly contributes to lower all P pools. Deeper depth could only pronouncedly influence the BD-P, HCl-P. Additionally, we found lakes in Germany have pronounced higher averaged P pools than other regions.

The close structural relationship suggested that one might be transformed to the other. Accordingly, we tested whether the cyclopentanone of PGD(2) can be expanded to the delta-lactone of 11d-TxB(2) in a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Oxidation of PGD(2) with two standard oxidants showed that 11d-TxB(2) was formed only with H2O2 but not with peracetic acid. Byproducts of the H2O2-mediated oxidation were hydroperoxide derivatives and isomers of PGD(2). Chemical oxidation of PGD(2) to 11d-TxB(2) may be a model for an equivalent enzymatic transformation, suggesting a possible link in the metabolism of PGD(2) and thromboxane A(2).'},\n",

Automatic sampling can reduce experimental bottlenecks by enabling overnight reactions or a higher degree of parallelization. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we performed batch-PEGylation of lysozyme with varying conditions by changing the molar excess of the PEG reagent. We used analytical cation-exchange chromatography to analyze the samples taken during the batch reaction, determining the concentrations of the individual species present at each time step.

       "  'content': 'A method is described whereby net rate constants can be directly inferred from the progress curves of enzyme intermediates without the need for model specification, numerical analysis, curve fitting, or the steady-state approx-imation. Specifically, if an enzyme intermediate in an ultimately irreversible serial subsequence is perturbed from and returns back to its equilibrium state as the substrate is consumed, then its net rate constant is given by the ratio of the total substrate consumed and the area under the progress curve for the enzyme intermediate. A rigorous analysis demonstrates this result to hold independent of the complete enzymatic reaction in which the subsequence is embedded, making it broadly applicable to a very wide range of kinetic mechanisms, including those complicated by inhibition. As a theoretical consequence, it is shown that traditionally steady-state parameters such as k(cat), k(cat)/K-M, and net rate constants can be expressed as limiting ratios of averages without requiring the steady-state hypothesis. Finally, a mock data set is generated for a system of contemporary interest that can serve as both an example of how the methodology would be used in practice and a proof of concept.'},\n",

We found that the staining index (SI) of the multimer reagent provided the best direct correlation with the value of a given fluorochrome for T cell detection studies. The SI is dependent on flow cytometer settings and chosen antibody panel; hence, the optimal fluorochrome selection may differ from lab to lab. Consequently, we describe a strategy to evaluate performance of the detection channels and optimize the SI for selected fluorescent molecules.

However, the role of PU.1 in lipopolysaccharide-dependent microglial activation has yet to be investigated. So, this study was conducted to determine the effects of PU.1 in LPS-induced activation of microglial cells. Methods We knocked out PU.1 in murine BV-2 cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to investigate the role of PU.1 in the expression of immune-related genes. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of PU.1 KO and BV-2 cells to analyze the gene expression patterns in PU.1 KO cells and compare them to those in wild-type BV-2 cells. The validation of differential expressions was achieved by qRT-PCR. To explore this regulatory role of PU.1, ChIP sequencing for PU.1 and H3K27Ac was performed. The sequencing result was further confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. Results RNA sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed that the expression of most of the immune-related genes was suppressed in the absence of PU.1. Proinflammatory chemokine genes were differentially expressed in LPS-treated PU.1 KO cells. The ChIP sequencing result followed by ChIP-qPCR revealed a LPS-mediated increase in the enrichment of PU.1 binding in pro-inflammatory chemokine gene promoters and enhancer regions in wild-type BV-2 cells. There was no enrichment of PU.1 in PU.1 KO cells.

In the case of colicins, the pore-forming domain of colicin A (ColA-P) has been shown both to undergo a clear acidic unfolding transition and to require acidic lipids in the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas its close homologue colicin N shows neither behavior. Compared to that of COlN-P, the COlA-P primary structure reveals the replacement of several uncharged residues with aspartyl residues, which upon replacement with alanine induce an unfolded state at neutral pH. Here we investigate COlA-P's structural requirement for these critical aspartyl residues that are largely situated at the N-termini of alpha helices. As previously shown in model peptides, the charged carboxylate side chain can act as a stabilizing helix N-Cap group by interacting with free amide hydrogen bond donors. Because this could explain COlA-P destabilization when the aspartyl residues are protonated or replaced with alanyl residues, we test the hypothesis by inserting asparagine, glutamine, and glutamate residues at these sites. We combine urea (fluorescence and circular dichroism) and thermal (circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry) denaturation experiments with H-1-N-15 heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of COlA-P at different pH values to provide a comprehensive description of the unfolding process and confirm the N-Cap hypothesis.

       "  'content': \"Background A fundamental problem in RNA-seq data analysis is to identify genes or exons that are differentially expressed with varying experimental conditions based on the read counts. The relativeness of RNA-seq measurements makes the between-sample normalization of read counts an essential step in differential expression (DE) analysis. In most existing methods, the normalization step is performed prior to the DE analysis. Recently, Jiang and Zhan proposed a statistical method which introduces sample-specific normalization parameters into a joint model, which allows for simultaneous normalization and differential expression analysis from log-transformed RNA-seq data. Furthermore, an l(0) penalty is used to yield a sparse solution which selects a subset of DE genes. The experimental conditions are restricted to be categorical in their work. Results In this paper, we generalize Jiang and Zhan's method to handle experimental conditions that are measured in continuous variables. As a result, genes with expression levels associated with a single or multiple covariates can be detected. As the problem being high-dimensional, non-differentiable and non-convex, we develop an efficient algorithm for model fitting. Conclusions Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy when a large fraction of genes are differentially expressed in an asymmetric manner, and the performance gain becomes more substantial for larger sample sizes. We also apply our method to a real prostate cancer RNA-seq dataset to identify genes associated with pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients.\"},\n",

For any given DHA fluxes at the bordering membranes, analytical and numerical solutions yield the DHA concentration profile within the ST. We find that in order to comply with adequate DHA delivery to the fetus and with physiological DHA concentrations in the maternal and fetal circulations, it is essential to have a significant rise of DHA concentration at the microvillus membrane, MVM and a rapid dissociation of the DHA from the FABP. The model establishes the relations between the concentrations of the FABPs in the ST, their equilibrium dissociation constant from the DHA, and the placental DHA metabolic degradation rate, hitherto unknown. We conclude that the bound (to the protein) DHA molecule is degraded at a rate of 0.3-0.45 s(-1).'},\n",

Short peptide inhibitors are used to competitively suppress the enzymatic activity of hsPLA(2). Here, Ca2+ effect on the intermolecular recognition and interaction between hsPLA(2) and its peptide inhibitors is investigated systematically by using molecular modeling and bioinformatics analysis. Dynamics simulations reveal that the hsPLA(2) structure bound with Ca2+ is rather stable and has low thermal motion; removal of Ca2+ considerably increases structural flexibility and intrinsic disorder of the protein. Energetics calculations suggest that presence of Ca2+ can effectively promote the interaction of hsPLA(2) with peptide inhibitors. In particular, the local substructures of hsPLA(2) such as helix H1, loop L2 and double-stranded beta-sheet DS that participate in peptide recognition are involved in or nearby Ca2+-coordinating site and can be directly stabilized by the Ca2+. In addition, a significant concentration-dependent effect of Ca2+ on peptide -hsPLA(2) binding is observed in vitro, that is, a little of Ca2+ can largely improve peptide binding affinity, but high Ca2+ concentration does not increase the affinity substantially. The correlation between calculated free energy and experimental binding affinity over different peptide inhibitors is improved considerably by adding Ca2+ to hsPLA(2). Specifically, the FLSYK peptide can generally bind to Ca2+-bound hsPLA(2) with a moderate or high affinity (K-d ranges between 56 and 210 mu M), but have only a modest affinity or even nonbinding to Ca2+-free hsPLA(2) (K-d > 400 mu M or = n.d.).

PLK1 contains a conserved polo-box domain (PBD) as well as a kinase domain (KD), like other members of the PLK family. The PBDs of the PLK family interact with phosphopeptides that contain highly conserved Ser-pSer/pThr (S-pS/T) motifs and play significant roles in substrate recognition and subcellular localization. The PBD of PLK1 has been regarded as a promising therapeutic target for cancer therapy. In this study, we investigated whether the phosphopeptide derived from NCAPG2 has a high binding specificity for the PLK1 PDB over those other highly similar PBDs, including PLK2, PLK3, and PLK5. We showed that the PBDs of PLKs have different binding affinities against CDC25c-, PBIP-, and NCAPG2-derived phosphopeptides using the fluorescence polarization binding assay. Unlike CDC25c-phosphopeptide, NCAPG2-phosphopeptide specifically bound to the PLK1 PBD with nanomolar affinity (K-d 48.68 nM), and its specificity was similar to that of the PBIP-derived phosphopeptide. Some of these phosphopeptide-PBD interactions can be explained by calculating the binding free energies using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA). Additionally, NCAPG2-phosphopeptide suppressed the proliferation of cancer cells. The NCAPG2-derived phosphopeptide can be applicable to the discovery of highly selective protein-protein interaction inhibitors targeting the PBD of PLK1.'},\n",

In vertebrates, MT gene activation is mediated by the metal-transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) binding to metal response elements (MREs). In invertebrates, the mechanisms of MT gene activation seems to be more diverse. In some invertebrate species, MTF-1 orthologues as well as their ability to activate MT genes via MREs have been uncovered. Although earthworm MTs have been well studied, a MTF-1 orthologue has not yet been described and MT gene activation mechanisms are largely unknown. Analyses of the earthworm wMT2 promoter by reporter gene assays have been performed. We could show that the wMT2 promoter was active in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) as well as in mouse MTF-1(-/-)cells (DKO7). The presence of mouse MTF-1 (mMTF1) led to a significant increase in reporter gene activity. We observed that cadmium as well as zinc had an effect on promoter activity. In the presence of zinc, promoter activity doubled in NIH cells, however, we did not observe a significant effect in the DKO7 cell line. Cadmium decreased promoter activity in DKO7 cells, but this effect could be reversed by providing mMTF1 in a co-transfection experiment. We suggest that MT gene expression in the earthworm is not entirely dependent on a MRE binding protein. Interestingly, the shortest promoter fragment including MRE1 showed the highest promoter activity under control conditions.'},\n",

For a successful cancer immunotherapy the different features of therapeutic antibodies such as binding affinity should be improved. Increased affinity enhances the biological action of the antibody, which in turn improves the therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the increased antibody affinity can reduce the therapeutic dose of the antibody, resulting in lower toxicity and handling cost. Considering the importance of this issue, using in silico analysis, we aimed to find the important amino acids of the Bevacizumab antibody, and then replaced these amino acids with others to improve antibody binding affinity.

Materials and methods: Thirty one patients with myocarditis and 30 healthy controls of similar age and gender without a history of chronic disease were included in the study. All 31 patients were clinically myocarditis. In some of these patients, the cause of myocarditis is acute rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease. Serum samples of the patients were taken during diagnosis in order to analyze serum IL-9 and IL-17 levels and sedimentation rate, CRP, ASO, proBNP, CK-MB, and Troponin-I tests were performed. Results: It was found that IL-17 levels were statistically significant in all acute rheumatic fever, Myocarditis and Kawasaki patients compared to the control group (p = 0.001) and that cut-off was 4.30 pg/mL.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of additives on the stability of Mtb antigens expressed in E. coli. Methods: Immunodominant Mtb antigens, i.e., CFP-10, Rv3872, TB7.7, and TB9.7, were cloned, and recombinant proteins overexpressed in E. coli were gradually degraded in a time-dependent manner by incubation at 37 degrees C.

The hypothesis was that Mn gluconate produces pancreatic enhancement similar to that seen previously with mangafodipir and Mn chloride, with greater enhancement following glucose challenge vs saline challenge. 18 Wistar rats were imaged at 7 T and normalised plateau pancreatic enhancement over baseline was compared for saline vs glucose challenge, calculated from a sigmoid fit to the enhancement curve. For saline vs glucose challenge, mean increases in plateau height +/- sd were: 22 +/- 18% for Mn chloride, 31 +/- 29% for mangafodipir and 41 +/- 17% for Mn gluconate. A paired t-test indicated that enhancement was greater for glucose vs saline (p = 0.01) and that there was no significant difference in the percentage enhancement between any of the compounds (p > 0.2).

New method: Utilizing a figure-of-eight coil and anatomy-specific models of the magnetic stimulation system, we developed a novel technique that enables probing corticospinal excitability at the cervical spinal level. Magnetic stimulation was performed in 9 healthy subjects at C2-C6 spinal levels using a figure-of-eight coil and a coil tracking system. MEPs were recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The functioning of the coil tracking system was tested with an estimated electric field maximum (eEFM) above the Cl cervical level (group 1) and below (group 2). Motor-evoked potential (MEP) reproducibility was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The use of coil location control in cervical level focal magnetic stimulation enabled the recording of highly reproducible MEPs. Within one co-registration, the ICC 95% confidence interval (CI) in group 1 was 0.89-0.99 and in group 2 was 0.24-0.85. Comparison with existing methods and conclusions: This method can be used for accurate maintenance and retrieval of the focal coil position at the cervical level with low spatial variability during stimulation. Existing methodologies employ determination of the coil location based on external landmarks, which makes the procedure cumbersome. This technique can optimize existing stimulation protocols and facilitate development of navigated spinal stimulation.'},\n",

Like the human form, mouse Cdkn2a encodes two distinct proteins-p16(Ink4a), which blocks cyclin-dependent kinase activity, and p19(Arf), which is best known as a positive regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor-and their functions have been well-studied in genetically engineered mouse models. Relatively little is known about how expression of the two transcripts is controlled in normal development and in certain disease states. To better understand their coordinate and transcript-specific expression in situ, we used a transposase-aided approach to generate a new BAC transgenic mouse model in which the first exons encoding Arf and Ink4a are replaced by fluorescent reporters. We show that mouse embryo fibroblasts generated from the transgenic lines faithfully display induction of each transgenic reporter in cell culture models, and we demonstrate the expected expression of the Arf reporter in the normal testis, one of the few places where that promoter is normally expressed. Interestingly, the TGF beta-2-dependent induction of the Arf reporter in the eye-a process essential for normal eye development-does not occur. Our findings illustrate the value of BAC transgenesis in mapping key regulatory elements in the mouse by revealing the genomic DNA required for Cdkn2a induction in cultured cells and the developing testis, and the apparent lack of elements driving expression in the developing eye.'},\n",

Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is involved in the response to such pathogenic infections. However, the mechanism by which IL-1 beta is secreted during C. pseudotuberculosis infection remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying IL-1 beta secretion by macrophages infected with C. pseudotuberculosis. Herein, we firstly revealed that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and caspase-1 (Casp1) play critical roles in IL-1 beta secretion rather than IL-1 beta precursor (pro-IL-1 beta) expression in C. pseudotuberculosis-infected macrophages. Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) is partially involved in IL-1 beta secretion, while absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) is not involved in IL-1 beta secretion by C. pseudotuberculosis-infected macrophages. In addition, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) inhibitors almost attenuated IL-1 beta secretion, implying that NF-kappa B and p38MAPK pathway are involved in IL-1 beta secretion in C. pseudotuberculosis-infected macrophages. Furthermore, C. pseudotuberculosis were significantly more numerous in Nlrp3(-/-), Asc(-/-), and Casp-1(-/-) macrophages than in WT macrophages at 24 h after infection (P < 0.05), indicating that NLRP3 inflammasome components limit C. pseudotuberculosis replication in macrophages.

To understand the nature of such \"gene expression noise,\" we followed the dynamics of the MET3pr-GFP expression inserted into ribosomal DNA (rDNA) using time-lapse microscopy. We found that the noisy \"on\" state is comprised of multiple substable states with discrete expression levels. These intermediate states stochastically transition between each other, with \"up\" transitions among different activated states occurring exclusively near the mitotic exit and \"down\" transitions occurring throughout the rest of the cell cycle. Such cell cycle dependence likely reflects the dynamic activity of the rDNA-specific RENT complex, as MET3pr-GFP expression in a telomeric locus does not have the same cell cycle dependence. The MET3pr-GFP expression in rDNA is highly correlated in mother and daughter cells after cell division, indicating that the silenced state in the mother cell is inherited in daughter cells. These states are disrupted by a brief repression and reset upon a second activation. Potential mechanisms behind these observations are further discussed.'},\n",

For 614 of these, both the IE and PA are known; this enables a study of the relationships between these quantities for a wide variety of molecules. From the IE and PA values, the hydrogen atom affinities (HA) of molecular ions M center dot+ may also be assessed. The PA may be equated to the heterolytic bond energy of [MH](+) and HA to the homolytic bond energy. Plots of PA versus IE for these substances show (in agreement with earlier studies) that, for many families of molecules, the slope of the ensuing line is less negative than -1, i.e. changes in the PA are significantly less than the concomitant opposite changes in IE. At one extreme (high PA, low IE) are the metals, their oxides and hydroxides, which show a slope of close to -1, at the other extreme (low PA, high IE) are the hydrogen halides, methyl halides and noble gases, which show a slope of ca. -0.3; other molecular categories show intermediate behaviour. One consequence of a slope less negative than -1 is that the changes in ionic enthalpies of the protonated species more closely follow the changes in the enthalpies of the neutral molecules compared with changes in the ion enthalpies of the corresponding radical cations. This is consistent with findings from ab initio calculations from the literature that the incoming proton, once attached to the molecule, may retain a significant amount of its charge. These collected data allow a comparison of the thermodynamic stability of protonated molecules in terms of their homolytic or heterolytic bond cleavages. Protonated nitriles are particularly stable by virtue of the very large hydrogen atom affinities of their radical cations.'},\n",

However, few well-characterized protein-turnover pathways have been identified because traditional methods to measure protein half-life are time and labor intensive. To overcome this barrier, we developed a protein stability probe and high-content screening pipeline for novel regulators of short half-life proteins using automated image analysis. Our pilot probe consists of the short half-life protein c-MYC (MYC) fused to Venus fluorescent protein (MYC-Venus). This probe enables protein half-life to be scored as a function of fluorescence intensity and distribution. Rapid turnover prevents maximal fluorescence of the probe due to the relatively longer maturation time of the fluorescent protein. Cells expressing the MYC-Venus probe were analyzed using a pipeline in which automated confocal microscopy and image analyses were used to score MYC-Venus stability by two strategies: assaying the percentage of cells with Venus fluorescence above background, and phenotypic comparative analysis. To evaluate this high-content screening pipeline and our probe, a kinase inhibitor library was screened by confocal microscopy to identify known and novel kinases that regulate MYC stability. Compounds identified were shown to increase the half-life of both MYC-Venus and endogenous MYC, validating the probe and pipeline. Fusion of another short half-life protein, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), with Venus also demonstrated an increase in percent Venus-positive cells after treatment with inhibitors known to stabilize MCL1.

We previously reported the inaugural structure of a DUF3349 superfamily member, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv0543c. Here, we report the structures determined for three additional DUF3349 proteins: Mycobacterium smegmatis MSMEG_1063 and MSMEG_1066 and Mycobacterium abscessus MAB_3403c. Like Rv0543c, the NMR solution structure of MSMEG_1063 revealed a monomeric five alpha-helix bundle with a similar overall topology. Conversely, the crystal structure of MSMEG_1066 revealed a five alpha-helix protein with a strikingly different topology and a tetrameric quaternary structure that was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography. The NMR solution structure of a fourth member of the DUF3349 superfamily, MAB_3403c, with 18 residues missing at the N-terminus, revealed a monomeric alpha-helical protein with a folding topology similar to the three C-terminal helices in the protomer of the MSMEG_1066 tetramer. These structures, together with a GREMLIN-based bioinformatics analysis of the DUF3349 primary amino acid sequences, suggest two subfamilies within the DUF3349 family. The division of the DUF3349 into two distinct subfamilies would have been lost if structure solution had stopped with the first structure in the DUF3349 family, highlighting the insights generated by solving multiple structures within a protein superfamily. Future studies will determine if the structural diversity at the tertiary and quaternary levels in the DUF3349 protein superfamily have functional roles in Mycobacteria and Rhodococcus species with potential implications for structure-based drug discovery.'},\n",

YspD has sequence, secondary structure and three-dimensional structure similar to other hydrophilic translocators. All hydrophilic translocators lack transmembrane region and possess intramolecular coiled-coil region. Disordered regions are mostly clustered at the N-terminal. Large loops provide flexibility, allowing conformational changes during oligomerization and protein-protein interaction. LcrV and PcrV have globular N-terminal and C-terminal domains, connected by intramolecular coiled-coil region. YspD, IpaD, SipD and BipD lack globular N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Their N-terminal and C-terminal domain have a bundle like structure connected by the intramolecular coiled-coil. The intramolecular coiled-coil regions (helix-5&9) of YspD showed maximum conservation, followed by helices at N-terminal. Polar interactions are mainly involved during dimerization of YspD, involving polar residues from helix-9 of both the YspD molecules. A methionine forms the boundary of interaction between the two YspD molecules. The two YspD molecules are arranged in antiparallel fashion to form the dimer. N-terminal of YspB interacted with C-terminal of YspD molecule to form a pentameric complex, consisting four YspD molecules and one YspB molecule. Sequence, structural similarity and presence of specific motifs in YspD (like chaperone protein) indicate the ability of N-terminal domain to show self-chaperoning activity and regulate folding and conformational state of YspD during its journey from the bacterial cytoplasm to the needle tip. Structural analysis of YspD and its mechanism of interaction with other proteins would enable us to design drugs against this hydrophilic protein to combat Yersinia infection.'},\n",

Upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), deprotonated amide-sulfonamides mainly underwent either an elimination of the amine to form the sulfonyl anion and amide anion or a benzoylamide derivative to provide sulfonamide anion bearing respective substituent groups.

However, despite the enormous potential of this species for use in medical research, its regeneration mechanisms remain largely unknown. Methods To identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during the early stages of lobed fin regeneration in P. senegalus, we performed a differential proteomic analysis using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach based quantitative proteome from the pectoral lobed fins at 3 time points. Furthermore, we validated the changes in protein expression with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis. Results The experiment yielded a total of 3177 proteins and 15,091 unique peptides including 1006 non-redundant (nr) DEPs. Of these, 592 were upregulated while 349 were downregulated after lobed fin amputation when compared to the original tissue. Bioinformatics analyses showed that the DEPs were mainly associated with Ribosome and RNA transport, metabolic, ECM-receptor interaction, Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, DNA replication, and Regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first proteomic research to investigate alterations in protein levels and affected pathways in bichirs' lobe-fin/limb regeneration.

The analysis using kinetic study was carried out under mesophilic conditions (37 +/- 2 degrees C) and influent COD concentrations (1000-4000 mg L-1), to prove its practicability towards RPME treatment. First-order kinetic model was used to clarify the behavior of RPME anaerobic digestion under different OLRs (0.14-4.00 g COD L-1 d(-1)) and HRT (1-7 d). The result shows that the highest COD removal efficiency and methane production rate were recorded to be 98.07% and 2.2223 L CH4 d(-1), respectively. This result was further validated by evaluating the biokinetic coefficients (reaction rate constant (k) and maximum biogas production (y(m))), which gave values of k = 0.57 d(-1) and y(m) = 0.331 L d(-1). This kinetic data concludes that MAHB presented satisfactory performance towards COD removal with relatively high methane production, which can be further utilized as on-site energy supply.'},\n",

However, the computational technologies for inferring biologically important evolutionary events are not sufficiently developed. Results : We present algorithms to estimate the evolutionary time (tMRS) to the most recent substitution event from a multiple alignment column by using a probabilistic model of sequence evolution. As the confidence in estimated tMRS values varies depending on gap fractions and nucleotide patterns of alignment columns, we also compute the standard deviation of tMRS by using a dynamic programming algorithm. We identified a number of human genomic sites at which the last substitutions occurred between two speciation events in the human lineage with confidence. A large fraction of such sites have substitutions that occurred between the concestor nodes of Hominoidea and Euarchontoglires. We investigated the correlation between tissue-specific transcribed enhancers and the distribution of the sites with specific substitution time intervals, and found that brain-specific transcribed enhancers are threefold enriched in the density of substitutions in the human lineage relative to expectations. Conclusions : We have presented algorithms to estimate the evolutionary time (tMRS) to the most recent substitution event from a multiple alignment column by using a probabilistic model of sequence evolution.

Height from crown to the last liguled leaf and dry weight decreased with increasing sowing density showing that these traits are suitable to measure early competition responses. However, specific leaf area, a common-measured trait to study competition was not affected by sowing density at early stages.

Differential expression analysis identifies global changes in transcription and enables the inference of functional roles of applied perturbations. This approach has transformed the discovery of genetic drivers of disease and possible therapies. However, differential expression analysis does not provide quantitative predictions of gene expression in untested conditions. We present a hybrid approach, termed Differential Expression in Python (DiffExPy), that uniquely combines discrete, differential expression analysis with in silico differential equation simulations to yield accurate, quantitative predictions of gene expression from time-series data. Results: To demonstrate the distinct insight provided by DiffExpy, we applied it to published, in vitro, time-series RNA-seq data from several genetic PI3K/PTEN variants of MCF10a cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor. DiffExPy proposed ensembles of several minimal differential equation systems for each differentially expressed gene. These systems provide quantitative models of expression for several previously uncharacterized genes and uncover new regulation by the PI3K/PTEN pathways. We validated model predictions on expression data from conditions that were not used for model training.

However, when more than two genomes are considered, we have new challenging problems. Studying such problems from a combinatorial point of view has been shown to be a useful tool to approach such problems, for example, the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. We focus on genome rearrangement problems related to graph convexity. Such an approach is in connection with some other well-known studies on multigenomic models, for example, those based on the median and on the closest string. We propose an association between graph convexities and genome rearrangements in such a way that graph convexity problems deal with input sets of vertices and try to answer questions concerning the closure of such inputs. The concept of closure is useful for studies on genome rearrangement by suggesting mechanisms to reduce the genomic search space. Regarding the computational complexity, and considering the Hamming distance on strings, we solve the following problems: decide if a given set is convex; compute the interval and the convex hull of a given set; and determine the convexity number, interval number, and hull number of a Hamming graph. All such problems are solved for three types of convexities: geodetic, monophonic, and P-3.

In T3, the rabbits (n = 15), allocated into 5 equal groups, vaccinated with proscillaridin-BSA, bufalin-BSA, epoxyscillirosidine-KLH, epoxyscillirosidine-BSA and BSA respectively, using Montanide adjuvant, developed antibodies against the administered immunogens, with epoxyscillirosidine-KLH inducing the highest immune response. Proscillaridin and bufalin antibodies cross-reacted with epoxyscillirosidine in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The conjugation methodology will be adjusted in the future to target optimal conjugation efficiency. Additional vaccination will be conducted in search of neutralizing antibodies against the yellow tulp toxin. The cross-reactivity of proscillaridin and bufalin antibodies with epoxyscillirosidine could be studied in future to explore the potential to prevent yellow tulp poisoning.\"},\n",

The calculation of a protein M-r based on its amino acid residue sequence is performed by many software applications. Unfortunately, many of the results do not agree with each other. Reasons for this lack of consensus may include the use of rounded values, calculation errors, or alternative calculation methods, and it is often not possible to distinguish the source of the differences. Additionally, the result is provided without an estimate of precision. This would imply that the M-r is perfectly known when in fact it is not because the basis for the calculation, either the relative atomic masses or the standard atomic weights, are themselves provided as estimates. Until the release of the NIST Mass Calculator, there were no applications available to provide both an M-r value and an associated uncertainty value. Furthermore, the full disclosure of the computation methods and elemental values allows for independent verification of the results. The uncertainty is obtained via Monte Carlo simulation and is now a useful feature in light of the ,high resolution capability now available in the mass spectrometry of intact proteins.'},\n",

The CopR protein consists of a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain in the amino-terminal region and a TRASH domain that is assumed to be involved in metal ion-sensing in the carboxyl-terminal region. The CopR protein was most strongly bound to a region between its own gene promoter and a counter directional promoter region for copper efflux system CopA. When the divalent metals such as nickel, cobalt, copper, and iron were present, the CopR protein was dissociated from the target promoters on electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The highest sensible ion is copper which affected protein releasing under 10 mu M concentrations. CopR recognizes a significant upstream region of TATA box on CopR own promoter and acts as a transcriptional repressor in an in vitro transcription assay. Through site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA-binding domain, R34M mutant protein completely lost the DNA-binding activity on target promoter. When the conserved cysteine residues in C144XXC147 motif 1 of the TRASH domain were mutated into glycine, the double cysteine residue mutant protein alone lost the copper-binding activity. Therefore, CopR is a copper-sensing transcriptional regulator and acts as a repressor for autoregulation and for a putative copper efflux system CopA of T. onnurineus NA1.'},\n",

Our method is to record the series of absorption images by using different exposure time of the camera, transform each image into the frequency domain to remove the low frequency, and then superimpose each filtered spatial frequency signal and inverse Fourier transform back into the air domain, and the transformed image is normalized to obtain a high dynamic image. The high dynamic absorption projection image is obtained at each projection angle, and then reconstructed by a filtered back projection algorithm to obtain highly dynamic three-dimensional structure information.

Among the known factors, genetic mutations in human growth hormone (hGH) remain the most frequent cause of IGHD, which influence the binding of hGH to its cognate receptor (hGHbp). Although previous studies have systematically investigated the residue importance at hGH-hGHbp complex interface, the molecular role of IGHD-associated residue mutations in the complex function still remains largely unexplored. Here, a total of 21 known hGH naturally-occurring missence mutations that have been clinically observed to be involved in IGHD disorder are collected and confirmed by original literature; they effects on the conformation, energetics and dynamics of hGH-hGHbp recognition and interaction are dissected at molecular level by using atomistic dynamics simulations, binding energy calculations and fluorescence spectroscopy assays. A systematic profile of hGH-hGHbp binding response to these clinical missence mutations is created, based on which it is revealed that (i) most mutations have appreciably unfavorable effect on the binding, which potentially destabilize the complex interaction, while only very few are predicted as moderate stabilizers for the complex system, and (ii) these disease-related mutations can locate either at complex interface or in hGH protein interior far away from the interface; both can influence the complex binding through either direct interaction or indirect allostericity. Two mutations, ElOOK (non-interface) and G146R (interface), are identified to address potent destabilization effect on hGH-hGHbp complex system; they can reduce the complex binding affinity by 8-fold (K-d changes from 0.76 to 5.9 nM) and 46-fold (K-d changes from 0.76 to 34.7 nM), respectively.

However, these large datasets can only be efficiently explored using bioinformatics analyses requiring huge data storage and computational resources adapted for high-performance processing. High-performance computing allows for efficient handling of large data and tasks that may require multi-threading and prolonged computational times, which is not feasible with ordinary computers.

This has demonstrated that it is possible to construct high-performance computing capacity capable of analyzing large NGS data from relatively low-cost hardware and entirely free (open-source) software, even in resource-limited settings.

Comparative homology modelling may have the potential to close this gap by predicting protein structure in target sequences using existing experimentally solved structures as templates. This paper presents the first use of force-directed graphs for the visualization of sequence space in two dimensions, and applies them to the choice of suitable RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) target-template pairs within human-infective RNA virus genera. Measures of centrality in protein sequence space for each genus were also derived and used to identify centroid nearest-neighbour sequences (CNNs) potentially useful for production of homology models most representative of their genera. Homology modelling was then carried out for target template pairs in different species, different genera and different families, and model quality assessed using several metrics. Reconstructed ancestral RdRP sequences for individual genera were also used as templates for the production of ancestral RdRP homology models. High quality ancestral RdRP models were consistently produced, as were good quality models for target-template pairs in the same genus. Homology modelling between genera in the same family produced mixed results and inter-family modelling was unreliable. We present a protocol for the production of optimal RdRP homology models for use in further experiments, e.g. docking to discover novel anti-viral compounds. (219 words) (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The majority of recent research focuses on identifying protein complexes as a whole and seldom studies the inner structures within complexes. In this study, we propose a computational framework to predict direct contacts and substructures within protein complexes. In this framework, we first train a supervised learning model of l(2)-regularized logistic regression to learn the patterns of direct and indirect interactions within complexes, from where physical subunit interaction networks are predicted. Then, to infer substructures within complexes, we apply a graph clustering method (i.e., maximum modularity clustering (MMC)) and a gene ontology (GO) semantic similarity based functional clustering on partially- and fully-connected networks, respectively. Computational results show that the proposed framework achieves fairly good performance of cross validation and independent test in terms of detecting direct contacts between subunits.

Among those, two are overrepresented, GNRA and UNCG tetraloops. Recent surveys of RNA structures deposited in the PDB show that GNRA and UNCG tetraloops can adopt tertiary folds that are very different from their canonical conformations, characterized by the presence of a U-turn of a Z-turn, respectively. Crystallographic data from both a lariat-capping (LC) ribozyme and a group II intron ribozyme reveal that a given UUCG tetraloop can adopt a distinct fold depending on its structural environment. Specifically, when the crystal packing applies relaxed constraints on the loop, the canonical Z-turn conformation is observed. In contrast, a highly packed environment induces \"squashing\" of the tetraloop by distorting its sugar-phosphate backbone in a specific way that expels the first and fourth nucleobases out of the loop, and falls in van der Waals distance of the last base pair of the helix, taking the place of the pair formed between the first and fourth residues in Z-turn loops. The biological relevance of our observations is supported by the presence of similarly deformed loops in the highly packed environment of the ribosome and in a complex between a dsRNA and a RNase III. The finding that Z-turn loops change conformation under higher molecular packing suggests that, in addition to their demonstrated role in stabilizing RNA folding, they may contribute to the three-dimensional structure of RNA by mediating tertiary interactions with distal residues.'},\n",

That basis was not orthogonal and highly redundant, requiring the application of singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain an orthogonal basis with a significantly lower dimensionality. The first mode is the OTF of the perfect system, and hence the modal representation, is highly compact for well-corrected optical systems, and vice-versa. The second objective is to apply this modal representation to the OTFs of a large population of human eyes for a pupil diameter of 5 mm. This permits an initial strong data compression. Next, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to obtain further data compression, leading to a compact statistical model of the initial population. In this model each OTF is approximated by the sum of the population mean plus a linear combination of orthogonal eigenfunctions (eigen-OTF) accounting for a selected percentage (90%) of the population variance.

Using this framework, we WA the role of RCD in speciation of two cricket species endemic to Anatolian mountains by quantifying patterns of character displacement, rates of evolution and adaptive divergence. Our results show differing patterns of character displacement between species for reproductive vs. non-reproductive characters and strong patterns of asymmetric divergence. We demonstrate diversification results from rapid divergence of reproductive traits towards multiple optima under the dual influence of strong drift and selection.

Through batch and continuous experiments, it was found that all silica in the cathode phase of a reaction device could be removed if the necessary amounts of magnesium and calcium were present. This occurs because a silica-magnesium-calcium compound is produced via a polymerization reaction with cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by electrolysis. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows that this material has the formula 2CaO-5MgO-8SiO(2)-H2O, and thus is likely generated by the reaction proposed by Sheikholeslami et al. (2019). Increasing the current sent through the reaction solution subsequently produces calcium carbonate. This technique for the separation of silica and calcium from aqueous solutions can be operated continuously without channel clogging, which indicates the possibility of practical applications. However, overly high currents promote the migration of protons from the anode to cathode phases, which inhibits the formation of precipitates due to a neutralization reaction. The proposed method is an effective approach for removing silica from a solution in geothermal binary power generation; although, a means of suppressing the effects of proton generation will be necessary if the process is also to be used to remove calcium ions.'},\n",

Then, differentially expressed genes and differential alternative splicing events were identified throughout 7 tissues. Furthermore, the comparison between leaves and flowers was taken as an example to display the corresponding biological functions. In this study, the tissue specificity of gene expression and alternative splicing in Arabidopsis was systematically investigated. It's helpful for elucidating gene expression mechanism in plant genome.\"},\n",

Exposure to low-dose ultraviolet radiation (like that in sunlight) suppresses the development of obesity in mice; however, the nature of the associations between sun exposure and adiposity is not well understood in humans. The present study characterized cross-sectional relationships between sun exposure and adiposity in a convenience cohort of breast (n = 269; mean age = 58 years) and prostate (n = 78; mean age = 69 years) cancer patients. Participants were enrolled in a 3-month exercise program in Perth, Australia. Self-reported questionnaires measured time spent outdoors (previous week, winter and summer), sex, age, treatment received and physical activity levels. Adiposity measures included body mass index, waist-hip ratio and body fat percentage (measured via DXA). In unadjusted models, greater time spent outdoors across all times was significantly associated with lower waist-hip ratio, while greater time spent outdoors in the last winter was associated with lower body fat percentage, but not when stratified by sex. There were no statistically significant associations between time spent outdoors and adiposity after adjusting for sex, age, treatments received and physical activity.

Therefore, it is important to understand which metabolic processes are affected by which cellular impairment. Because genome-wide screening of mutant collections (haploid/diploid deletion library) provides important clues for the understanding of conserved biological processes and for finding potential target genes, we screened the haploid mutant collection of Schizosaccharomyces pombe with wortmannin that inhibits phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling. Using genome-wide screening, we determined that 52 mutants were resistant to this chemical. When 52 genes that are deleted in these mutants were grouped in 41 different biological processes, we found that 37 of them have human orthologues and 4 genes were associated with human metabolic disorders. In addition, when we examined the pathways in which these 52 genes function, we determined that 9 genes were related to phosphorylation process. These results might provide new insights for better understanding of certain human diseases.'},\n",

One hundred and eighty (180) fingerlings with ten fish per tank having an average weight of 9.8 +/- 0.5 g were randomly distributed within six treatments in triplicates following a completely randomised design. The amylase and lipase activities in the whole intestine did not vary significantly (P > 0.05), but protease activity varied significantly with respect to DORB level in the diet. At higher (53 and 58%) inclusion level of DORB, the protease activities were lower. T33, T38 and T43 groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity compared to the other groups, whereas lowest activity was recorded in the group fed with highest inclusion level (58%). The oxidative stress enzyme like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione-S-transferase exhibited significantly higher activities in liver of T58 group of L. rohita. However, the activity of catalase and SOD showed no significant variation in gill tissue. The haematological parameter values such as red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), haemoglobin (Hb) and packed cell volume (PCV) were lower in the highest DORB fed group (T58) as compared to their lower DORB inclusion counterparts. No change in NBT value was recorded irrespective of DORB inclusion level in the diet. Hence, from these results, it can be concluded that the dietary inclusion of DORB up to 43% in the diet of L. rohita at 26% crude protein and 7% lipid level is best for the optimal activity of digestive, metabolic and haematological parameters.'},\n",

In RSDE, the structure of the loop region is improved by the following: loop-based cross operator, which interchanges configuration of a randomly selected loop region between individuals, and loop-based mutate operator, which considers torsion angle feature into conformational sampling. A stochastic ranking selective strategy is designed to select conformations with low energy and near-native structure. Moreover, the conformational resampling method, which uses previously learned knowledge to guide subsequent sampling, is proposed to improve the sampling efficiency.

Identifying avenues for overcoming the challenges associated with using virions as screening reagents is paramount given the difficulties associated with obtaining high-purity virus-associated proteins that retain the conformation exhibited on the virion surface. Results Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of 1.5 x 10(7) clones taken from a naive yeast surface-displayed human fibronectin domain (Fn3) against whole virions yielded two unique binders to Zika virions. Construction and FACS of site-directed binding loop mutant libraries based on one of these binders yielded multiple progeny clones with enhanced Zika-binding affinities. These affinity-matured clones bound Zika virions with low double- or single-digit nanomolar affinity in ELISA assays, and expressed well as soluble proteins in E. coli shake flask culture, with post-purification yields exceeding 10 mg/L. Conclusions FACS of a yeast-displayed binding domain library is an efficient method for de novo isolation of virion-binding domains. Affinities of isolated virion-binding clones are readily enhanced via FACS screening of mutant progeny libraries. Given that most binding domains are compatible with yeast display, the approach taken in this work may be broadly utilized for generating virion-binding domains against many different viruses for use in passive immunotherapy and the prevention of viral infection.'},\n",

Absorption titration experiments of the enantiomers showed significant hypochromism with red shift indicating a strong perturbation of the DNA on the intra-ligand (IL) and the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions of the complexes, and fluorescence titration curves indicate strong binding. LD spectra for the B-enantiomers bound to DNA were qualitatively similar to spectra for the well-studied intercalator [Ru(phen)(2)dppz](+2), indicating intercalation of the phenyl-imidazophenanthroline part of the complex.

The resulting mixed repertoire was used to transform different auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains, each lacking an enzyme with a phosphate-containing substrate.

The negative values of the thermodynamic data demonstrated that van der Waals and hydrogen bonds played a major role in the binding at all pHs value. This binding was maximal at acidic conditions due to ionic interactions between the protonated His of gTTR with the negatively charged sulfate groups of HSPG.

The nanovectorization of TTR with SWCNT thus stabilized the TTR tetramer structure and decreased the amyloid formation of TTR.

The results showed that level of alpha-type protein kinase C (PKC alpha),cell membrane to cytoplasm ratio of PKC alpha, cell membrane to cytoplasmic ratio of beta I-type protein kinase C (PKC beta I) and level of Phosphor-PKC alpha (P-PKC alpha) were significantly reduced in diabetes rat antral smooth muscle samples. The content of tetraphosphate inositol (IP4) in gastric antral smooth muscle of diabetic rats reduced, and the content of diacyl-glycerol (DG) was unchanged. CNP significantly decreased the content of IP4 and DG, this effect was more obvious in diabetic rats. Subsequent to the addition of protein kinase A (PKA) blocker N-[2- (p-Bromocin-namylamino)ethyl]-5 -isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride (H-89) before CNP treatment, the inhibitory effect of CNP was reduced; subsequent to the addition of protein kinase G (PKG) blocker KT5823 before CNP treatment, the inhibitory effect of CNP was also reduced. With the addition of the combination of H-89 and KT5823 before CNP treatment, the inhibition by CNP could be offset. These results were concluded that CNP inhibited the activity of PKC family in rat smooth muscle and reduced the levels of IP4 and DG through the PKG/PKA-PLC beta pathways, causing inhibited muscular contractions, which may be a key pathogenetic factor for diabetic gastroparesis.'},\n",

N-acetyl tryptophan was analyzed using a reversed-phase gradient elution after treatment under acidic, basic, oxidative, hydrolytic and thermal stress conditions. Linearity in the calibration curve was obtained at a concentration range of 10-100 mu gmL(-1) (R-2 = 0.9916). The lower limits of detection and quantification were 3.53 and 10.69 mu gmL(-1). The degradation of NAT was observed maximum under oxidation stress (52.84%) and minimum under thermal stress (10.22%). Three major degradation products were formed under acidic and basic stress conditions, of which tryptophan was the major one. Thermal stress yielded a single major impurity at m/z 230. Water hydrolysis could form dihydroxy-N acetyl tryptophan at m/z 279. Oxidation stress led to the formation of seven major degradation products. The most effective stress condition was found to be oxidative which leads to 52.84% degradation of the drug followed by acidic stress (34.64%) and basic stress (15.66%). The present study showed an accurate, precise and sensitive LC-MS-MS method for the systematic investigation of NAT and its impurities in formulations. Graphic'},\n",

There are a number of proteins to be eliminated which are not pre-ubiquitinated for their recognition by the regulatory subcomplex of the 26S proteasome, but which directly interact with the 20S proteasome core particle (20S proteasome). The obligatory precondition for such interaction consists in existence of disordered (hydrophobic) fragments in the target protein. In this study we have investigated the interaction of a number of multifunctional (moonlighting) proteins (glyceral-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), aldolase, pyruvate kinase) and neurodegeneration-related proteins (alpha-synuclein, myelin basic protein) with 20S proteasome immobilized on the SPR-biosensor chip and stabilized by means of a bifunctional agent dimethyl pimelimidate (in order to prevent possible dissociation of this subcomplex). Only two of the investigated proteins (aldolase and pyruvate kinase) interacted with the immobilized 20S proteasome (K-d of 8.17 x 10(-7) M and 5.56 x 10(-7) M, respectively). In addition to earlier detected GAPDH ubiquitination, mass spectrometric analysis of the studied proteins revealed the presence of the ubiquitin signature (Lys-epsilon-Gly-Gly) only in aldolase. Oxidation of aldolase and pyruvate kinase, which promotes elimination of proteins via their direct interaction with 20S proteasome, caused a 2-3-fold decrease in their K-d values as compared with this parameter obtained for the intact proteins. The results of this study provide further evidence for direct interaction of both ubiquitinated proteins (aldolase), and non-ubiquitinated proteins (pyruvate kinase) with the 20S proteasome core particle (20S proteasome). The effectiveness of this interaction is basically equal for the ubiquitinated proteins and non-ubiquitinated proteins.'},\n",

As the first step in directing cell-surface proteins to internal cellular compartments, and in many cases degradation, Vpu binds a subset of its target proteins through their transmembrane domains. Each of the known targets of Vpu are synthesized in the ER, and must traverse the different membrane environments found along the secretory pathway, thus it is important to consider how membrane composition might influence the interactions between Vpu and its targets. We have used Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the oligomerization of Vpu with the transmembrane domains of target proteins in model membranes of varying lipid composition. Our data show that both lipid bilayer thickness and acyl chain order can significantly influence monomer-oligomer equilibria within the Vpu-target system. Changes in oligomerization levels were found to be non-specific with no single Vpu-target interaction being favored under any condition. Our analysis of the influence of the membrane environment on the strength of helix-helix interactions between Vpu and its targets in vitro suggests that the strength of Vpu-target interactions in vivo will be partially dependent on the membrane environment found in specific membrane compartments.'},\n",

The advent of faster microdialysis measurements promises to aid in behavioral research on awake animals. However, microdialysis with awake animals generally employs a fluidic commutator (swivel). The swivel's volume is inimical to the time resolution of the measurements. New method: Animals can be housed in rotating cages so that the swivel is not required, but rotating operant chambers are not available. Here we describe the design and construction of a rotating operant chamber with microdialysis capability. We modified a rotating cage by adding operant behavior testing components to the side of the bowl-shaped cage. A modular on-board controller facilitates operant component/computer communication. A battery provides power to the controller and the operant components. The battery and controller rotate with the cage, and the controller communicates with the computer wirelessly. Results: The rotating operant chamber can be used to train a rat to retrieve a sucrose pellet following a cue. Microdialysis and online liquid chromatography can be used to measure dopamine at one minute intervals while the rat moves freely and interacts with operant behavior testing components. Comparison with existing method(s): We are not aware of one-minute dopamine measurements in awake animals in an operant chamber. Conclusions: Rotating cage modifications are straightforward.

In this paper, we investigated the response of yeast to the loss of a single copy of ARH1, an oxidoreductase of the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is among the few mitochondrial proteins that is essential for viability in yeast. The phenotypic, transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolic landscape indicated that Saccharomyces cerevisiae successfully adapted to this loss, displaying an apparently dosage-insensitive cellular response. However, a considered investigation of transcriptional regulation in ARH1-impaired yeast highlighted that a significant hierarchical reorganisation occurred, involving the iron assimilation and tyrosine biosynthetic processes. The interconnected roles of the iron and tyrosine pathways, coupled with oxidative processes, are of interest beyond yeast since they are involved in dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease.

In other cell types, a decrease in Glutl is mediated by the thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), which is induced in IL-3-dependent myeloid cells when growth factor is removed. We mutated Atg5 and Txnip by CRISPR/Cas9 and found that Atg5-dependent autophagy was not necessary for the long-term viability of cycling or arrested Bax(-/-) Bak1(-/-) cells, and that Txnip was not required for the decrease in Glutl expression in response to IL-3 withdrawal. Surprisingly, Atg5-deficient Bax/Bak1 double mutant cells survived for several weeks in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), without high concentrations of added glucose or glutamine. When serum was withdrawn, the provision of an equivalent amount of glucose present in 10% FBS (similar to 0.5 mM) was sufficient to support cell survival for more than a week, in the presence or absence of IL-3.

Except PpFabG4, the other homologs have the conserved catalytic activity sites and N-terminal cofactor binding sites. So the paper used different methods, including the genetic complementary, catalytic activity analysis in vitro, gene deletion in vivo, and mutant characteristic analysis, to study the biological functions of the six homologs. The results showed that only PpfabG1, PpfabG3 and PpfabG5 could restore the growth of E. coli fabG temperature-sensitive mutant CL104 at 42 degrees C, and the complementary strain of PpfabG1 grew weakly. While in vitro analysis, PpFabG1, PpFabG3 and PpFabG5 also showed the catalytic activities in the initial and extension reactions of fatty acid synthesis, although the activity of PpFabG1 was really weak.

DNA damage of leukocytes with comet assay and RAPD-PCR was detected in LPS treatment group. The levels of micronucleus and apoptosis percentage were increased significantly at the end of 6 hr. VE and/or SS protected the LPS-induced erythrocytes and leukocytes against damage as they have caused amelioration of rats by altering the results. As a result, the co-administration of VE and/or SS against LPS-induced damage provides protection. VE and/or SS in patients and animal models with sepsis must be taken in the diet because they are protective against the cellular degradation caused by oxidative damage. Practical applications LPS obtained from E. coli is used more frequently in experimental sepsis studies. When LPS is administered to experimental animals, interstitial pneumonia, adult respiratory fatal syndrome, acute tubular necrosis, and fatal effects such as coagulopathy and hypoglycemia may be seen in these animals. The co-treatment of VE and SS may be more effective than using them alone against LPS.\"},\n",

It is difficult to isolate GM1 in industry scale from the brains directly. In this work, a simple and highly efficient method with high yield was developed for the isolation, conversion, and purification of GM1 from a pig brain. Gangliosides (GLS) were first extracted by supercritical CO2 (SCE). The optimum extraction time of GLS by SCE was 4 h, and the ratio of entrainer to acetone powder from the pig brain was 3:1 (v/w). GM1 was then prepared from GLS by immobilized sialidase and purified by reverse-phase silica gel. Sodium alginate embedding was used for the immobilization of sialidase. Under the optimized method, the yield of high-purity GM1 was around 0.056%. This method has the potential to be applied in the production of GM1 in the industry.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Our previous work with fragment-assembly methods has demonstrated specific deficiencies in conformational sampling behaviour that, when addressed through improved sampling algorithms, can lead to more reliable prediction of tertiary protein structure when good fragments are available, and when score values can be relied upon to guide the search to the native basin. In this paper, we present preliminary investigations into two important questions arising from more difficult prediction problems. First, we investigated the extent to which native-like conformational states are generated during multiple runs of our search protocols. We determined that, in cases of difficult prediction, native-like decoys are rarely or never generated. Second, we developed a scheme for decoy retention that balances the objectives of retaining low-scoring structures and retaining conformationally diverse structures sampled during the course of the search. Our method succeeds at retaining more diverse sets of structures, and, for a few targets, more native-like solutions are retained as compared to our original, energy-based retention scheme. However, in general, we found that the rate at which native-like structural states are generated has a much stronger effect on eventual distributions of predictive accuracy in the decoy sets, as compared to the specific decoy retention strategy used. We found that our protocols show differences in their ability to access native-like states for some targets, and this may explain some of the differences in predictive performance seen between these methods. There appears to be an interaction between fragment sets and move operators, which influences the accessibility of native-like structures for given targets. Our results point to clear directions for further improvements in fragment-based methods, which are likely to enable higher accuracy predictions.'},\n",

To elucidate the structural basis of the EOLA1 function, we determined its crystal structure at 1.71 angstrom resolution and found that EOLA1 is structurally similar to an activating signal cointegrator-1 homology (ASCH) domain with a characteristic beta -barrel fold surrounded by alpha -helices. Despite its low sequence identity with other ASCH domains, EOLA1 retains a conserved 'GxKxxExR' motif in its cavity structure. The cavity harbors aromatic and polar residues, which are speculated to accommodate nucleotide molecules as do YT521-B homology (YTH) proteins. Additionally, EOLA1 exhibits a positively charged cleft, similar to those observed in YTH proteins and the ASCH protein from Zymomonasmobilis that exerts ribonuclease activity. This implies that the positively charged cleft in EOLA1 could stabilize the binding of RNA molecules. Taken together, we suggest that EOLA1 controls protein expression through RNA binding to play protective roles against endothelial cell injuries resulting from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation responses.\"},\n",

Earlier diagnosis based on such warning symptoms theoretically would improve the clinical prognosis. However, it is still not clear whether the prognosis is correlated with early warning symptoms. Here, we reviewed warning symptoms and other predictive factors in the emergency room (ER) setting and examined their correlations with mortality. Methods: Ninety saccular aneurysmal SAH cases were reviewed in a single medical center between January 2011 and December 2013. We examined differences in mortality rate related to warning symptoms, SAH scales, onset-to-ER time, hydrocephalus, and aneurysm size, location, and complexity.

The blood-brain barrier is a selective permeation barrier, most of the central nervous system drug candidates have poor permeability in the blood-brain barrier. The disadvantages of drug screening experiments in laboratory animals are high cost, long cycle, and low accuracy. Besides, directly test in the human body is unethical. But establishing a reliable model of extracorporeal blood-brain barrier can simplify the experimental process, shorten the test period, and make the experimental results easier to determine. Therefore, the establishment of an in vitro BBB model can greatly accelerate the development of central nervous system drugs. The models that have been studied can be divided into three categories: single culture, co-culture, and triple culture. These models range from simple to complex, and more similar to blood-brain barrier in vivo.

The proposed analytical procedure consists of few steps: dilution of urine or drug in distilled water, centrifugation for 2 min (12,000g), separation by MEKC and ultraviolet-absorbance detection of NKD at 260 nm. The background electrolyte used was 0.035 mol/L pH 9 borate buffer with the addition of 0.05 mol/L sodium dodecyl sulfate and 6.5% ACN. Effective separation was achieved within 5.5 min under a voltage of 21 kV (~90 mu A) using a standard fused-silica capillary (effective length 51 cm, 75 mu m i.d.). The determined limit of detection for NKD in urine was 1 mu mol/L (0.18 mu g/mL). The calibration curve obtained for NKD in urine showed linearity in the range 4-280 mu mol/L (0.71-49.90 mu g/mL), with R-2 0.9998. The RSD of the points of the calibration curve varied from 5.4 to 9.5%.

Despite its many functions, the central event in the complement system is the proteolytic activation of the 185 kDa complement component 3 (C3) into its opsonin and anaphylatoxin fragments known as C3b (175 kDa) and C3a (10 kDa), respectively. The C3 protein is comprised of thirteen separate structural domains, several of which undergo extensive structural rearrangement upon activation to C3b. In addition to this, the C-terminal C345c domain found in C3, C3b, and the terminal degradation product, C3c (135 kDa), appears to adopt multiple conformations relative to the remainder of the molecule. To facilitate various structure/function studies, we designed two C3 analogs that could be activated to a C345c-less, C3c-like state following treatment with Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. We generated stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines that secrete approximately 1.5 mg of the highest-expressing C3 analog per liter of conditioned culture medium. We purified this C3 analog by sequential immobilized metal ion affinity and size exclusion chromatographies, activated the protein by digestion with TEV protease, and purified the resulting C3c analog by a final size exclusion chromatography. The conformations and activities of our C3 and C3c analogs were assessed by measuring their binding profiles to known C3/b/c ligands by surface plasmon resonance. Together, this work demonstrates the feasibility of producing a C3 analog that can be site-specifically activated by an exogenous proteolytic enzyme.'},\n",

The structure of the nucleosome is highly conserved across several eukaryotic species, and molecular replacement has been the primary phasing method used to solve nucleosome structures by X-ray crystallography. However, there is currently no simple, widely applicable experimental phasing method for the nucleosome. In the present study, it is demonstrated that selenomethionine-incorporated histones H3, H2A and H2B can be reconstituted into nucleosomes and crystallized for structural determination. Unexpectedly, it was found that the nucleosome can be phased with a relatively small number of Se atoms. The structures of nucleosome core particles containing 12 and 16 Se atoms were solved by SAD phasing at 2.5 and 2.4 angstrom resolution, respectively.

The thermodynamic formation potentials of all measured residues are derived including Ucells. An empirical method was used to calculate the entropy of formation ( increment S-f) for all residues and Ucells. Krevelen plots show residue molar ratios of oxygen and hydrogen to carbon (H/C, O/C) are linearly correlated with HHV and formation potentials ( increment (f)G', increment H-f', increment S-f') with strong statistical coefficients of determination (R-2).

This study investigates the association between genetic risk scores (GRS) for four lipid components (high-density lipoprotein [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein [LDL-C], triacylglycerols [TAG], and total cholesterol [TC]) with risk for PTB. Subjects included 954 pregnant women from California for whom second trimester serum samples were available, of which 479 gave birth preterm and 475 gave birth at term. We genotyped 96 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which were selected from genome-wide association studies of lipid levels in adult populations. Lipid-specific GRS were constructed for HDL-C, LDL-C, TAG, and TC. The associations between GRS and PTB were analyzed using logistic regression. A higher HDL-C GRS was associated with increased risk for PTB overall and spontaneous PTB. Higher TAG and TC GRS were associated with decreased risk for PTB overall and spontaneous PTB. This study identifies counter-intuitive associations between lipid GRS and spontaneous PTB.

Among the many possible causes are changes in species composition (taxon sampling) that could influence phylogenetic accuracy of the methods by altering the relative weight of the evolutionary histories of each individual species. This effect would be stronger in clades that are represented by few lineages, which is common in many prokaryote phyla. Indeed, phyla with fewer taxa showed the most discordance among recent TOL studies. We implemented an approach to systematically test how the identity of taxa among a larger dataset and the number of taxa included affected the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction. Results: Utilizing an empirical dataset within Terrabacteria we found that even within scenarios consisting of the same number of taxa, the species used strongly affected phylogenetic stability. Furthermore, we found that trees with fewer species were more dissimilar to the tree produced from the full dataset. These results hold even when the tree is composed by many phyla and only one of them is being altered. Thus, the effect of taxon sampling in one group does not seem to be buffered by the presence of many other clades, making this issue relevant even to very large datasets. Our results suggest that a systematic evaluation of phylogenetic stability through taxon resampling is advisable even for very large datasets.'},\n",

Taking this observation into account, we structurally modified an indolylpyrimidylpiperazine (IPP) scaffold, 1 (a non-selective adenosine receptors' ligand) into a modified IPP (mIPP) scaffold by switching the position of the carbonyl group, resulting in the formation of both ketone and tertiary amine groups in the new scaffold.

We have shown that a base excision DNA repair (BER)-specific parasite TcAP1 endonuclease is involved in the resistance to H2O2. However, a putative TcAP1 negative dominant form impairing TcAP1 activity in vitro did not show any in vivo effect. Here, we show that a negative dominant form of the human APE1 apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease (hAPE1DN) induces a decrease in epimastigote and metacyclic trypomastigote viability when parasites were exposed to H2O2. Those results confirm that TcAP1 AP endonuclease activity plays an important role in epimastigote and in infective metacyclic trypomastigote oxidative DNA damage resistance leading to parasite persistence in the insect and mammalian hosts. All along its biological cycle and in its different cellular forms, T. cruzi, the etiological parasite agent of Chagas' disease, is under the attack of reactive species produced by its mammalian and insect hosts. To survive, T. cruzi must repair their oxidative damaged DNA. We have previously shown that a specific parasite TcAP1 AP endonuclease of the BER is involved in the T. cruzi resistance to oxidative DNA damage. We have also demonstrated that epimastigotes and cell-derived trypomastigotes parasite forms expressing a putative TcAP1 negative dominant form (that impairs the TcAP1 activity in vitro), did not show any in vivo effect in parasite viability when exposed to oxidative stress. In this work, we show the expression of a negative dominant form of the human APE1 AP endonuclease fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP; hAPE1DN-GFP) in T. cruzi epimastigotes. The fusion protein is found both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of noninfective epimastigotes but only in the nucleus in metacyclic and cell-derived trypomastigote infective forms. Contrarily to the TcAP1 negative dominant form, the ectopic expression of hAPE1DN-GFP induces a decrease in epimastigote and metacyclic trypomastigote viability when parasites were exposed to increasing H2O2 concentrations. No such effect was evident in expressing hAPE1DN-GFP cell-derived trypomastigotes. Although the viability of both wild-type infective trypomastigote forms diminishes when parasites are submitted to acute oxidative stress, the metacyclic forms are more resistant to H2O2 exposure than cell-derived trypomastigotes.Those results confirm that the BER pathway and particularly the AP endonuclease activity play an important role in epimastigote and metacyclic trypomastigote oxidative DNA damage resistance leading to parasite survival and persistence inside the mammalian and insect host cells.\"},\n",

Here, we report a novel methionine tag for S-35-labelling added to the C-terminus of its prepro-form, which has no methionine and cysteine residue other than the initiation methionine that enables analyses of the molecular mechanism of its dual localization without the effects of the reporter proteins. Mutational analyses including insertion of a glycosylation site for the tagged PTHrP revealed that the evolutionarily conserved regions in the signal peptide and the pro-region facilitate the redirection of ppPTHrP from the secretory pathway to the nuclear targeting pathway.'},\n",

Morphology and size studies indicate that the colloids are solid and well-packed. Using Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, elastic compliance of the protein on quartz surface has been monitored. Properties of the protein from solution and as colloids assembled from method 2 are similar in elastic compliance (65.53 +/- 12 and 73.5 +/- 1.1 GPa(-1) respectively) due to polar/non-polar interactions at the solid surface. For particles from method 1, irregular desolvation of water on the particle surface results in higher compliance (104.3 +/- 13 GPa(-1)). Change in work of adhesion from contact angle profiles shows optimal adhesion for colloids from method 1 whereas the protein solution and as colloids from method 2, show subnormal adhesion. The work shows the role of extensive H-bonding with the hydrodynamically coupled water leading to a fluid like system in protein colloids from method 1 whereas those from method 2 behaved more like the pure protein adsorbing from solution.

Molecular docking followed by MD simulations identified a stable and reactive binding mode, of which the calculated binding free energy was in good agreement with the experimental reports. Furthermore, binding modes of six analogs of APHS were also analyzed to study the effects on binding affinity of the triple bond, heteroatom and length of alkyl chain.

The two-dimensional mass cluster plot method (2D m/z cluster plot method) significantly improves separation visualization by measuring the retention time, t(R), and peak width-at-base, w(b), of each analyte peak on a per mass channel, m/z, basis and plotting w(b) versus t(R) as a single point for each peak. Additional selectivity is provided by the peak width dimension, allowing for the differentiation of \"pure\" or selective m/z and shared or overlapped m/z. Analyte clusters in the 2D mass cluster plot are defined based on clustering of individual points, representing the selective m/z for those analytes, and encompassed by a box of user-specified size. The method is applied to simulated chromatographic data with a random, independent distribution of analyte peaks and constant peak w(b). Two levels of chromatographic saturation factor, alpha, and two sets of analyte mass spectra with varying spectral similarity are studied to assess method performance. The percentage of analyte clusters found relative to the number of analytes simulated in the chromatogram increases as the box size (analogous to chromatographic resolution, R-s) is decreased, resulting in an R-s limit of 0.05 for the method. Additionally, the percentage of analyte clusters discovered also increases with lower alpha and greater dissimilarity between analyte mass spectra, demonstrating the immense benefit of improving the chromatographic separation and chemical selectivity in analyte discovery, identification, and quantification.

The last similar to 30 amino acids of Ncd head play a crucial but still poorly understood role in this process. Here, we used accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to explore the conformational dynamics of several systems built upon two crystal structures of Ncd, the asymmetrical T436S mutant in pre-stroke/post-stroke conformations of two partner subunits and the symmetrical wild-type protein in pre-stroke conformation of both subunits. The results revealed a new conformational state forming following the inward motion of the subunits and stabilized with several hydrogen bonds to residues located on the border or within the C-terminal linker, i.e. a modeled extension of the C-terminus by residues 675-683. Forming of this new, compact Ncd conformation critically depends on the length of the C-terminus extending to at least residue 681. Moreover, the associative motion leading to the compact conformation is accompanied by a partial lateral rotation of the stalk. We propose that the stable compact conformation of Ncd may represent an initial state of the working stroke.\"},\n",

Real-time PCR that amplified the active site (exons 7-8) of cFXIII-A showed increased cFXIII-A mRNA in the retina after ONI, whereas the PCR that amplified the activation peptide (exons 1-2) showed no change. RT-PCR analysis that amplified exons 1-8 showed two bands, a faint long band in the control retina and a dense short band in the injured retina. Therefore, we conclude that activated cFXIII-A mRNA after ONI is shorter than that of the control retina. Western blot analysis also confirmed an active form of 65 kDa cFXIII-A protein in the injured retina compared to the control 84 kDa protein. 5'-RACE analysis using injured retina revealed that the short cFXIII-A mRNA lacked exons 1, 2 and part of exon 3.

To date, the structure and function of hGas7 SH3 domain are still unclear. Here, we reported the solution NMR structure of hGas7 SH3 domain (hGas7-SH3), which displays a typical SH3 beta-barrel fold comprising five beta-strands and one 3(10)-helix. Structural and sequence comparison showed that hGas7-SH3 shares high similarity with Abl SH3 domain, which binds to a high-affinity proline-rich peptide P41 in a canonical SH3-ligand binding mode through two hydrophobic pockets and a specificity site in the RT-loop. However, unlike Abl-SH3, only six residues in the RT-loop and two residues adjacent to but not in the two hydrophobic pockets of hGas7-SH3 showed significant chemical shift perturbations in NMR titrations, suggesting a low affinity and a non canonical binding mode of hGas7-SH3 for P41. Furthermore, four peptides selected from phage-displayed libraries also bound weakly to hGas7-SH3, and the binding region of hGas7-SH3 was mainly located in the RT-loop as well. The ligand identifications through structural similarity searching and peptide library screening in this study imply that although hGas7-SH3 adopts a typical SH3 fold, it probably possesses distinctive ligand-binding specificity.

This technique, called thanatopraxy, allows the preservation of corpses from decomposition, the destruction of a maximal number of micro-organisms, and the presentation of the body with a natural appearance to the family. Unfortunately, when thanatopraxy is performed before the collection of biological specimens, the toxicological results are not representative of the time of the death.

Sigma-1 receptors are known to interact and form complexes with a number of ion channels aiding the delivery of the channel protein to the plasma membrane. Drugs that bind the Sigma-1 receptor are hypothesized to affect this process and reduce the delivery of the channel protein to the plasma membrane, in turn reducing the metastatic potential of the cells. Methods: Human colon cancer cell line SW620 was utilized as a model to investigate the interaction between the neonatal VGSC (nNav1.5) and the Sigma-1 receptor. This was accomplished using drugs that bind the Sigma-1 receptor, Sigma-1 receptor silencing, and antibodies that bind and block the nNav1.5 channel. Results: Sigma-1 receptor drugs SKF10047 and dimethyl tryptamine were found to alter (reduce) the adhesion of these cells by 46-54% at a 20 mu M drug concentration. In a similar manner, gene silencing of the Sigma-1 receptor had a similar effect in reducing the adhesion of these cells to collagen-coated plates by 30%. The Sigma-1 receptor was found to be in a complex with nNav1.5 in SW620 cells, and Sigma-1 drugs or gene silencing of the Sigma-1 receptor results in a reduction of the surface expression of nNav1.5 by similar to 50%. Culture of SW620 cells under hypoxic conditions resulted in upregulation of the Sigma-1 receptor and nNav1.5. In addition, surface expression of nNav1.5 protein increased under hypoxic culture conditions and this was inhibited by the application of SKF10047. Conclusions: It is proposed that in colon cancer cells, upregulated Sigma-1 receptor expression in hypoxia led to increased nNav1.5 protein expression at the plasma membrane and resulted in the cells switching to a more invasive state.'},\n",

New method: Conventional DBSCAN clustering methods for MR tractography data use each fiber's start and end point as well as the distance between start and end points. Instead, in this study, we extracted and used a fiber-distance matrix generated for all fiber combinations from the tractography dataset in DBSCAN clustering.

Results: Performing the proposed CSI-optimized DBSCAN-based clustering method on MR tractography data of the superior longitudinal fasciculus generated 6 robust, non-overlapping, clusters that are neuroanatomically related.

Unfortunately, most of the tumours are refractive to the differentiation cues. The aim of this investigation was to analyse the effects of prolonged treatment with retinoic acid on two cell lines of neural origin refractive to differentiation. Cells were also treated with retinoic acid in combination with a poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor because PARP1 is a known chromatin modulator and can influence the process of differentiation. The main methods comprised tumour cell line culturing and treatment; analysis of RNA and protein expression after cell treatment; as well as analysis of urokinase activity, migration, and proliferation. Both cell lines continued to proliferate under the prolonged treatment and showed increase in urokinase plasminogen activator activity. Analysis of gene expression and cell phenotype revealed different mechanisms, which only in neuroblastoma H4 cells could indicate the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The data collected indicate that the activity of the urokinase plasminogen activator, although belonging to an extracellular protease, does not necessary lead to epithelial-mesenchymal reprogramming and increase in cell migration but can have different outcomes depending on the intracellular milieu.'},\n",

Despite the increasing number of studies reporting microbial co-occurrence patterns, only a few attempts have been made to challenge them in experimental or theoretical frameworks. Here, we tested the hypothesis that observed variations in co-occurrence patterns can be explained by taxonomy, relative abundance, and physiological traits of microbial species. We used PCR amplicon sequencing of taxonomic markers to assess distribution and co-occurrence patterns of bacterial and fungal species found in 25 chia (Salvia hispanica L.) samples originating from eight different sources. The use of nutrient-rich and oligotrophic media enabled isolation of 71 strains encompassing 16 bacterial species, of which five corresponded to phylotypes represented in the molecular survey. Tolerance to different growth inhibitors and antibiotics was tested to assess the physiological traits of these isolates. Divergence of physiological traits and relative abundance of each pair of species explained 69% of the co-occurrence profile displayed by cultivable bacterial phylotypes in chia.

According to the residual molecules and chemical reaction, the proposed modulation scheme adaptively adjusts the number of emitted molecules, thereby guaranteeing that the number of molecules that arrived at the receiver remains at a stable level. The authors evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by comparing it with the conventional binary molecule shift keying (BMoSK), BMoSK with power adjustment (BMoSK-PA), and ideal BMoSK (without ISI) modulation techniques via diffusion.

To date, low repetition rate laser sources with over half a millijoule per pulse have been required in order to provide the high peak power densities for effective two-photon excitation over the large area. However, this configuration suffers from reduced signal intensity due to the low repetition rate, saturation effects due to increased excitation fluences, as well as faster photobleaching of the fluorescence probe. In contrast, with the recent advent of high repetition rate, high pulse energy laser systems could potentially provide the advantages of high repetition rate systems that are seen in traditional two-photon microscopes, while minimizing the negatives of high fluences in WF-TeFo setups to date. Here, we use a 100 microjoule/high repetition rate (50-100 kHz) laser system to investigate the performance of a WF-TeFo two-photon microscope. While using micro-beads as a sample, we demonstrate a proportionate increase in signal intensity with repetition rate, at no added cost in photobleaching. By decreasing pulse intensity, via a corresponding increase in repetition rate to maintain fluorescence signal intensity, we find that the photobleaching rate is reduced by similar to 98.4%. We then image live C. elegans at a high repetition rate for 25 min. as a proof-of-principle. Lastly, we identify the steady state temperature increase as the limiting process in further increasing the repetition rate, and we estimate that repetition rate in the range between 0.5 and 5 MHz is ideal for live imaging with a simple theoretical model. With new generation low-cost fiber laser systems offering high pulse energy/high repetition rates in what is essentially a turn-key solution, we anticipate increased adoption of this microscopy technique by the neuroscience community.'},\n",

After rigorous screening, five mutations (T4M, V17M, V44M, R50W, and M59R) were finally selected, of which two have been previously reported to be deleterious.

Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing immunotherapy and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells.

An extensive immunohistochemical examination revealed no specific lines of differentiation. Immunohistochemical positivity was observed only to MIB-1 (high Ki- 67 proliferation index), vimentin and CD68 antibodies. The diagnosis was compatible with UPS/MFH.

However, traditional WB technique involves many manual steps, it is difficult to set up standard operational protocols. In most of the cases, it is used only within same WB analysis for the abundance investigation of target proteins qualitatively or relative quantitatively, while problematic to carry out comparison among different laboratories. In the current paper, after a summarized historical review of WB development, the concept of advance version of WB (WB 2.0) was proposed. The key components for the design and practical steps including digitalization, standardization, automation, micro-quantification, high through-put, reference-based normalization and database establishment were presented. In perspective, the application of WB 2.0 will activate the establishment of a public accessible protein expression database, which will be another supporting platform for life science succeeding the recognized genome and transcriptome databases.'},\n",

Kupffer's vesicle (KV) is a spherical left-right organizer during zebrafish embryogenesis and is derived from a cluster of dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs). Cadherin1 is required for collective migration of a DFC cluster and failure of DFC collective migration by Cadherin1 decrement causes KV malformation which results in defective heart laterality. Recently, loss of function mutation of A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) is reported as a high-risk gene in congenital heart disease patients. In this study, we demonstrated the role of akap12 beta in asymmetric heart development. The akap12 beta, one of the akap12 isoforms, was expressed in DFCs which give rise to KV and akap12 beta-deficient zebrafish embryos showed defective heart laterality due to the fragmentation of DFC clusters which resulted in KV malformation. DFC-specific loss of akap12 beta also led to defective heart laterality as a consequence of the failure of collective migration by cadherin1 reduction. Exogenous akap12 beta mRNA not only restored the defective heart laterality but also increased cadherin1 expression in akap12 beta morphant zebrafish embryos. Taken together, these findings provide the first experimental evidence that akap12 beta regulates heart laterality via cadherin1.\"},\n",

They rapidly respond to antigen challenge and can activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. To study the role of antigen presentation in NKT cell activation, previous studies have developed several anti-CD1d antibodies that block CD1d binding to T-cell receptors (TCRs). Antibodies that are specific to both CD1d and the presented antigen can only be used to study the function of only a limited number of antigens. In contrast, antibodies that bind CD1d and block TCR binding regardless of the presented antigen can be widely used to assess the role of TCR-mediated NKT cell activation in various disease models. Here, we report the crystal structure of the widely used anti-mouse CD1d antibody 1B1 bound to CD1d at a resolution of 2.45 angstrom and characterized its binding to CD1d-presented glycolipids. We observed that 1B1 uses a long hydrophobic H3 loop that is inserted deep into the binding groove of CD1d where it makes intimate nonpolar contacts with the lipid backbone of an incorporated spacer lipid. Using an NKT cell agonist that has a modified sphingosine moiety, we further demonstrate that 1B1 in its monovalent form cannot block TCR-mediated NKT cell activation, because 1B1 fails to bind with high affinity to mCD1d. Our results suggest potential limitations of using 1B1 to assess antigen recognition by NKT cells, especially when investigating antigens that do not follow the canonical two alkyl-chain rule.'},\n",

In the case of normal sequences, the primary position of Guanine oxidations by one-electron oxidants such as carbonate radical anions, BPT(7,8,9,10-tetrahydroxytetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene), and riboflavin are 5 '-G in GG doublets and the central G in a GGG triplet. According to results, the properties of guanine oxidation on abasic site containing sequences are independent from the position of AP(apurinic/apyrimidinic) site in the presence of carbonate radical anions under a short irradiation time, although this radical is exposed to solvent by the existence of an abasic site. The lack of abasic site effect on guanine oxidative damage by the carbonate radical may be due to a sequence-independent property of the initial electron transfer rate in the hole injection step, or may relate to an electron transfer mechanism with large reorganization energy dependency. Consequently, the carbonate radical anions may easily migrate to another single G in the charge re-distribution step. Meanwhile, there is a strong dependency on the presence of an AP(apurinic/apyrimidinic) site in the cleavage patterns of guanine oxidations by physically large oxidizing agents, such as BPT(7,8,9,10-tetrahydroxytetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene) and riboflavin.

The essential components of the bone marrow include mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which play a key role in protecting, regenerating, and proliferating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This feature is vital for HSC after exposure to myelotoxic anticancer agents; nevertheless, the effects of nutlin-3 on MSCs remain to be disclosed. The present research study was conducted to examine the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effectiveness of nutlin-3 in bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs). Materials and Methods Human-derived BMSCs were cultured for different durations, that is, 24, 48, and 72 hours, and treated using various concentrations of nutlin-3, including 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mu M. To investigate the effect of nutlin-3 on the apoptosis, cell vitality and proliferation in BMSCs, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide, propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V assay, as well as real-time polymerase chain reaction, were used. Results BMSCs viability significantly decreased (P < .05) in the cells treated at concentrations of 50 and 100 mu M for 24 hours and concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 mu M for 48 hours and at all concentrations for 72 hours. The apoptosis of BMSCs (TUNEL positive) was significantly more visible at concentrations of 25 and 50 mu M compared with that in the controls (P < .05), while this increased through dose-dependent processes.

Such bioconjugation reactions can be facilitated by engineering proteins with chemically activated amino acids at strategically chosen sites. The incorporation of these unnatural amino acids (uAAs) can be achieved by using the nonsense suppression technique. This requires an aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase (aaRS) that exclusively recognizes the uAA and loads it to the corresponding tRNA. Appropriate (aaRS) mutants can be found through reverse engineering using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain MaV203. This strain contains a counterselectable, Gal4p-inducible SPAL10::URA3 fusion and deletions in the endogenous GAL80 and GAL4 genes. Therefore, it has been used extensively for the screening of aaRS mutant libraries. It is generally assumed that the SPAL10 promoter actively represses the URA3 gene in the absence of Gal4p, resulting in MaV203 cells with a Ura(-) phenotype. The current contribution reveals that in a small fraction of MaV203 cells, a basal expression of the URA3 gene occurs. The unexpected URA3 expression is reported for the first time, and the nature of the mutation causing this expression was identified as a spontaneous recessive mutation in a single gene of a protein involved in the repression of the SPAL10 promoter. The basal URA3 expression causes aaRS mutants to be missed, which affects the outcome of the library screening. It is demonstrated that the use of diploid cells can circumvent the MaV203 Ura(+) phenotype, allowing for an optimization of S. cerevisiae library screening.'},\n",

However, an a priori estimate of trait tractability from the perspective of gene expression is unavailable. Motivated by the concept of entropy in a thermodynamic system, we here propose such an estimate (S-T) by gauging the number (N) of expression states that underlie the same trait abnormality, with large S-T corresponding to large N. By analyzing over 200 yeast morphological traits, we show that S-T predicts the tractability of an expression-trait relationship. We further show that S-T is ultimately determined by natural selection, which builds co-regulated gene modules to minimize possible expression states.

Algorithms have been developed to estimate absolute methylation level from read coverage generated by affinity enrichment-based techniques, but the most accurate one for MBD-seq data requires additional data from an SssI-treated Control experiment. Results Using our previous characterizations of Methyl-CpG/MBD2 binding in the context of an MBD pulldown experiment, we build a model of expected MBD pulldown reads as drawn from SssI-treated DNA. We use the program BayMeth to evaluate the effectiveness of this model by substituting calculated SssI Control data for the observed SssI Control data. By comparing methylation predictions against those from an RRBS data set, we find that BayMeth run with our modeled SssI Control data performs better than BayMeth run with observed SssI Control data, on both 100 bp and 10 bp windows. Adapting the model to an external data set solely by changing the average fragment length, our calculated data still informs the BayMeth program to a similar level as observed data in predicting methylation state on a pulldown data set with matching WGBS estimates. Conclusion In both internal and external MBD pulldown data sets tested in this study, BayMeth used with our modeled pulldown coverage performs better than BayMeth run without the inclusion of any estimate of SssI Control pulldown, and is comparable to - and in some cases better than - using observed SssI Control data with the BayMeth program. Thus, our MBD pulldown alignment model can improve methylation predictions without the need to perform additional control experiments.'},\n",

After scarifying the rats, BBB disruption was assessed by determining albumin extravasation and tight junction integrity (claudin 3, claudin 5, and occludin) using Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. In addition, by applying zymography, expression of pro-metalloproteinase-9 (pro-MMP-9) was analyzed. No differences were found regarding infarct size and BBB dysfunction between stimulated and unstimulated animals 24 h after induction of stroke. Our results indicate that MLR-HFS neither improves nor worsens the damaged BBB after stroke. Attenuating cytokines/chemokines in the perilesional area, as mediated by MLR-HFS, tend to play a less significant role in preventing the BBB integrity.'},\n",

Most of the non-imprinted ASM regions observed both within and outside of the CpG island show a strong correlation with DNA polymorphisms. However, what polymorphic cis-acting elements mediate non-imprinted ASM of the CpG island remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of polymorphic GT microsatellites within the gene promoter on non-imprinted ASM of the local CpG island in goldfish. We generated various goldfish heterozygotes, in which the length of GT microsatellites or some non-repetitive sequences in the promoter of no tail alleles was different. By examining the methylation status of the downstream CpG island in these heterozygotes, we found that polymorphisms of a long GT microsatellite can lead to the ASM of the downstream CpG island during oogenesis and embryogenesis, polymorphisms of short GT microsatellites and non-repetitive sequences in the promoter exhibited no significant effect on the methylation of the CpG island. We also observed that the ASM of the CpG island was associated with allele-specific expression in heterozygous embryos. These results suggest that a long polymorphic GT microsatellite within a gene promoter mediates non-imprinted ASM of the local CpG island in a goldfish inter-strain hybrid.'},\n",

Understanding the immunosuppressive mechanisms between ectoparasites and their hosts will provide new strategies to develop potential immunosuppressive drugs against immune disorder diseases. Previously, we have discovered that a small peptide, immunoregulin HA, from the horsefly (Hybomitra atriperoides) may play an immunosuppressive role in rat splenocytes. However, the targeting cells and detailed mechanisms of immunoregulin HA in immunosuppressive reactions are not well defined. Here, we show that immunoregulin HA reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Interestingly, we discover that the major cytokines repressed by immunoregulin HA are secreted by macrophages, rather than by T cells. Furthermore, immunoregulin HA inhibits macrophage maturation and phagocytosis. Mechanically, the activations of c-JUN N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase upon LPS stimulation are decreased by immunoregulin HA. Consistently, immunoregulin HA treatment exhibits an anti-inflammatory activity in a mouse model of adjuvant-induced paw inflammation. Taken together, our data reveal that immunoregulin HA conducts the anti-inflammatory activity by blocking macrophage functions.'},\n",

The enzyme is important in some forms of chemotherapy, and it has been implicated in resistance to antifolate antibiotics. A co-crystal structure of the enzyme (1U3G) and primary sequence analysis were used to select highly conserved amino acids in close proximity to bound 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. The amino acids were then investigated using site directed mutagenesis and kinetics. Y123, E55, and F118 were concluded to be important for binding 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in the active site and/or for substrate turnover of the enzyme. Replacement of E55 or Y123 with alanine resulted in no detectable activity. The more subtle replacement of E55 with glutamine was also inactive suggesting an ionic interaction with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Mutations to F118 resulted in substantial increases in apparent K-m for both 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and ATP, but did not substantially affect catalytic turnover. Outside the active site, the replacement of Q144 with alanine yielded an enzyme that bound the substrates of ATP and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate with higher apparent K-m values than the wild-type enzyme, but demonstrated a 3.1 fold increase in k(cat).'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson diseases by utilizing high-frequency stimulations (HFS) of electrical pulses with constant inter-pulse-intervals (IPI). To develop new stimulation paradigms for treating more brain diseases, HFS with varying IPI (i.e., varying-frequency) has been investigated. Previous studies have shown that the efficacy obtained by varying-frequency is different from that obtained by constant-frequency even with a same mean frequency. We hypothesized that small changes in IPI during HFS could substantially change the effect of HFS on neurons. To test this hypothesis, HFS sequences with constant IPI (IPI = 10 or 7.5 ms for a frequency of 100 or 133 Hz) and varying IPI (IPI = 5-10 ms with a mean frequency of 133 Hz) were alternately applied at afferent axon fibers of pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal CA1 region. The evoked potentials of downstream neurons were recorded and analyzed to quantitatively evaluate the neuronal responses to stimulations with constant IPI and varying IPI. The results showed that during persistent stimulation with constant IPI, the responses of downstream neurons changed from initial synchronized firing of population spikes (PS) into non-synchronized firing (i. e., unit spikes). However, once the stimulation switched to the sequence with varying IPI, synchronized firing reappeared with large PS events. Additionally, the amplitude of PS and the synchronization degree of firing induced by varying IPI were similar to those induced by single pulses at baseline. However, the incidence of PS was only similar to 7% of the pulse frequency, indicating a cumulative action of multiple pulses for generating such synchronized firing of neurons by stimulations with varying IPI. In addition, the appearance of PS was related to the length of proceeding IPI. Presumably, nonlinear responses of neuronal axons and synapses to high-frequency stimulation might cause the synchronized activity induced by varying-frequency. These results indicate that tiny differences in intervals of varying-frequency stimulation may generate a modulation effect on neurons very different from that of constant frequency stimulation. The present study shows important results for revealing the mechanisms of brain stimulation and for advancing the development of new stimulation paradigms to treat various brain diseases.'},\n",

Many of these tools also incorporate robust functionality for modelling the ordered water molecules that are found in nearly all macromolecular crystal structures. However, no current tools focus on differentiating these ubiquitous water molecules from other frequently occurring multi-atom solvent species, such as sulfate, or the automated building of models for such species. PeakProbe has been developed specifically to address the need for such a tool. PeakProbe predicts likely solvent models for a given point (termed a 'peak') in a structure based on analysis ('probing') of its local electron density and chemical environment. PeakProbe maps a total of 19 resolution-dependent features associated with electron density and two associated with the local chemical environment to a two-dimensional score space that is independent of resolution. Peaks are classified based on the relative frequencies with which four different classes of solvent (including water) are observed within a given region of this score space as determined by large-scale sampling of solvent models in the Protein Data Bank. Designed to classify peaks generated from difference density maxima, PeakProbe also incorporates functionality for identifying peaks associated with model errors or clusters of peaks likely to correspond to multi-atom solvent, and for the validation of existing solvent models using solvent-omit electron-density maps. When tasked with classifying peaks into one of four distinct solvent classes, PeakProbe achieves greater than 99% accuracy for both peaks derived directly from the atomic coordinates of existing solvent models and those based on difference density maxima. While the program is still under development, a fully functional version is publicly available. PeakProbe makes extensive use of cctbx libraries, and requires a PHENIX licence and an up-to-date phenix. python environment for execution.\"},\n",

A Support Vector Machine classifier is developed using the feature set extracted from a meta-path-based parameter, Association Index derived from the HIN. Performance of the model is validated using standard statistical metrics and it generated an AUC value of 0.87, which is better than the existing methods in the literature. Results are further validated using the recent literature and many of the predicted lncRNA-disease associations are identified as actually existing.

SFTI-1 and its adjacent albumin are both processed into separate, mature forms by asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP). Here to determine whether the evolution of SFTI-1 in a latent region of its precursor was critical, we used a transgene approach in A. thaliana analysed by peptide mass spectrometry and RT-qPCR.

SFTI production was possible with the adjacent albumin, but peptide levels dropped greatly without the albumin. The ability for SFTI to be processed from multiple sequence contexts and different proteins suggests that to make peptide, it was not crucial for the genetic expansion that gave rise to SFTI and its family to be within a latent protein region. Interstitial peptides, evolving like SFTI within existing proteins, might be more widespread and as a mechanism, SFTI exemplifies a stable, new, functional peptide that did not need a new gene to evolve de novo.\"},\n",

Our objective was to determine the effects of supplemental Zn sources, in excess of minimal requirements, on markers of mammary epithelial integrity in blood and in milk as well as the heat stability of milk in mid-lactation cows. Twelve multiparous Holstein cows (132 +/- 21days in milk and 51 +/- 3kg/day milk) were blocked according to milk yield and enrolled in a replicated 3x3 Latin square experiment. Experimental periods were 21days, with 17days allowed for diet adaptation and 4days for sampling. Treatment sequences were randomly assigned to animals and treatments were as follows: (1) 0.97g Zn/day provided as ZnSO4 (34.5mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 30-ZS), (2) 1.64g Zn/day provided as ZnSO4 (56.5mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZS), and (3) 0.55g Zn/day provided as ZnSO4 plus 1.13g Zn/day provided as a zinc-methionine complex (58.2mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZM). Treatments were administered once daily as an oral bolus containing all supplemental trace minerals. Rumen-bypass methionine was also included in the 30-ZS and 60-ZS boluses to provide metabolizable methionine equivalent to that provided in 60-ZM rations. Milk samples were assessed for electrolytes, somatic cell transcript abundance of genes related to zinc metabolism, and heat coagulation time. Whole blood samples were analyzed for Na and K concentrations, and plasma samples were analyzed for lactose concentration. Cows fed 60-ZS or 60-ZM had greater zinc intake compared to 30-ZS. Dry matter intake and milk fat content tended to be greater in 60-ZS and 60-ZM cows compared to 30-ZS. Somatic cell linear score was similar among treatments. Treatments neither affected markers of mammary epithelial integrity in blood nor in milk of cows, including plasma concentration of lactose, milk concentrations of Na+ and K+, and SLC30A2 and CLU transcript abundance. Treatments had no effect on milk N fractions or heat coagulation time. This study provided no evidence that supplemental Zn above the established requirements can improve blood-milk epithelial barrier or heat stability of milk in healthy mid-lactation dairy cows.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Several studies have pointed out that the tight correlation between genes' evolutionary rate is better explained by a model denoted as the Universal PaceMaker (UPM) rather than by a simple rate constancy as manifested by the classical hypothesis of molecular clock (MC). Under UPM, each gene is associated with a single pacemaker (PM) and varies its evolutionary rate according to this PM ticks. Hence, the relative rates of all genes associated with the same PM remain nearly constant, whereas the absolute rates can change arbitrarily according to the PM ticks. A consequent question to that mentioned is finding the gene-PM association only from the gene sequence data. This, however, turns to be a nontrivial task and is affected by the number of variables, their random noise, and the amount of available information. To this end, a clustering heuristic was devised by exploiting the correlation between corresponding edge lengths across thousands of gene trees. Nevertheless, no theoretical study linking the relationship between the affecting parameters was done. We here study this question by providing theoretical bounds, expressed by the system parameters, on probabilities for positive and negative results. We corroborate these results by a simulation study that reveals the critical role of the variances.\"},\n",

Hence, 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) has been shown to be an indicator for oxidative DNA damage. This study aimed to determine the relative telomere length (RTL) and 8-OHdG levels in neoplastic tissues, adjacent non-neoplastic tissues, and blood leukocytes of musculoskeletal (MS) tumor patients. Neoplastic tissues were compared to adjacent non-neoplastic tissues in MS tumor patients (n=46). Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) of MS tumor subjects were compared to those of age-matched healthy controls (n=107). RTL was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and 8-OHdGlevels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The RTL in neoplastic tissues was significantly shorter than that in non-neoplastic tissues [1.12 (0.86-1.46) vs 1.45 (1.25-1.65), P=0.001]. PBLs had lower RTL than non-neoplastic tissues in MS tumor patients [1.04 (0.85-1.13) vs 1.45 (1.25-1.65), P<0.001]. However, there was no significant difference between RTL in PBLs and in neoplastic tissues. In addition, PBLs of MS tumor patients had higher RTL than those of the controls [1.04 (0.85-1.13) versus 0.78 (0.68-0.90), P<0.001]. The 8-OHdG levels in neoplastic tissues were remarkably higher than those in non-neoplastic tissues [8.14 (6.81-11.37) nM/mu g/mu l vs. 3.79 (2.53-6.17) nM/mu g/mu l, P<0.001]. Furthermore, plasma 8-OHdG levels in MS tumor patients were markedly greater than those in the controls [102.50 (73.16-133.50) nM vs. 41.09 (6.81-11.37) nM, P<0.001]. Area under the curve (AUC) was 0.7536 (95% confident interval (CI) 0.6602-0.8469) when the cut-off value of RTL in PBLs was 0.97. Also, plasma 8-OHdG levels depicted that when the cut-off value was 38.67nM, the AUC was 0.7723 (95% CI 0.6920-0.8527). Moreover, ROC curve analysis showed that both RTL and 8-OHdG appeared to improve the sensitivity (85.68%) and specificity (70.91%) with the AUC 0.8639 (95% CI 0.7500-0.9500). This study suggested that blood leukocyte RTL and plasma 8-OHdG could serve as promising non-invasive biomarkersto differentiate between MS tumor patients and healthy controls. Additionally, telomere attrition and increased oxidative DNA damage might play contributory roles in the pathogenesis of MS tumors.\"},\n",

Materials and methods: Pubmed literature database was scanned up to June 2017 by using the keywords \"polysomy 17 breast cancer\" and 141 studies were accessed. Ultimately four of the reviewed papers have been found to be appropriate for examining the effect of P17 on lymph node involvement and tumor grade. Prior to meta-analysis, publication bias and heterogeneity of the studies was examined. Results: Meta-analysis in the examining the effect of polysomy 17 on lymph node involvement (OR = 1.708, 95% CI: 1.068-2.733), on grade [3]/[3,1] (OR = 3.402, 95% CI: 1.726-6.707), on grade [3]/[3, 2] (OR = 2.581, 95% CI: 0.778-8.559) and on grade [2]/[2,1] (OR = 1.854, 95% CI: 0.531-6.468) was determined in those with HER2 amplification.

We explored the plasma pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and excretion of mHA11 in rats using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Next, we identified the metabolites of mHA11 and assessed the influence of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes on mHA11 metabolism. We also examined the in vitro stability in rat plasma and rat liver microsomes (RLMs), the blood-to plasma (B/P) ratio, and the inhibitory effect on CYP isozyme activities. After oral administration at 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg, mHA11 was absorbed and eliminated rapidly. There was a linear correlation between the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) and the dose (R-2 = 0.983). The bioavailability of mHA11 was 4.1% at the oral dose of 15 mg/kg mHA11 was extensively distributed in various tissues and exhibited a high penetration into the brain. No significant parent drug was detected in urine or bile, and only 0.74% was recovered in feces, whereas two demethylated metabolites, M1 and M2, were found in the urine and feces, and further studies showed that CYP2C19 primarily contributed to metabolites formation. mHA11 was stable in rat plasma but degraded significantly in RLMs; its B/P ratio was 1.05 in rat blood. In addition, mHA11 dose-dependently inhibited the activities of rat CYP isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C6, CYP2C11, CYP2D2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A2.

Our results showed that the conditioned media-culturing HUVECs with PEAR1 knockdown partially suppressed the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. The proteomics analysis was performed by using the iTRAQ technique, and a total of 215 DAPs (124 protein was upregulated and 91 protein were downregulated) were identified. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that proteins related to platelet alpha granule, adenosine triphosphate metabolic process, and endocytosis were significantly enriched. Further, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis also identified the significant enrichment of endocytosis-related pathways. The real-time polymerase chain reaction assay confirmed that the expression of P2Y(12), mitochondrial carrier 2, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur protein 3, and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein are significantly downregulated in the HUVECs with PEAR1 knockdown. In conclusion, our in vitro results implicated that DAPs induced by PEAR1 knockdown might contribute to the platelet aggregation.

One of the most commonly used biomarkers for detecting FD is Lyso-GB3, a globotriaosylsphingosine, which is usually analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS), because of its high specificity and sensitivity. Due to the complexity of LC-MS/MS technology, efficient and reliable diagnosis of FD by LC-MS/MS was unavailable in most hospitals in China. Therefore, patients' samples need to be prepared at local hospitals and then sent to central laboratories for LC-MS/MS analysis. As a result, samples undergo a lengthy shipment and storage process, potentially compromising sample quality and thus precision of diagnosis. We first established and validated a novel LC-MS/MS-based method and to guarantee FD sample quality, we studied the effects of pre-analytical variables on the analysis of Lyso-GB3. These pre-analytical variables include storage temperature and time of plasma, freeze-thaw cycles of plasma, degree of hemolysis of plasma, storage temperature and time of whole blood, and centrifugation temperature. Finally, we analyzed 86 FD samples and 100 normal human samples and made correlation studies on the relationship between Lyso-GB3 level and FD classification. Results showed Lyso-GB3 level started decreasing post 4 days when plasma was stored at 20 degrees C. In addition, hemolysis significantly influenced the FD sample quality and severe hemolysis caused the Lyso-GB3 level decreased by 57.8%. Other pre-analytical variables have little impact on FD sample quality. Under the conditions of the standard operational procedures before analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for screening FD is 100%, which ensures the accuracy of the method. Furthermore, we used plasma Lyso-GB3 level to distinguish classical FD patients from non-classical FD patients. When we set the cut-off value as 55.15 mu g/L, the sensitivity and the specificity were 71% and 100%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83. Our findings can help standardize the operational procedures in medical labs to guarantee high FD sample quality and provide a reference for identification of Chinese FD classification.\"},\n",

Previously, we proposed, downstream of RTKs, that the phosphorylation state of Grb7SH2 domain tyrosine residues could control Grb7 dimerization, and dimerization may be an important regulatory step in Grb7 binding to RTKs. In this manner, additional dimerization-dependent regulation could occur downstream of the membrane-bound kinase in RTK-mediated signaling pathways. Extrapolation to the full-length (FL) Grb7 protein, and the ability to test this hypothesis further, has been hampered by the availability of large quantities of pure and stable FL protein. Here, we report the biophysical characterization of the FL Grb7 protein and also a mutant representing a tyrosine-phosphorylated Grb7 protein form. Through size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation, we show the phosphorylated-tyrosine-mimic Y492E-FL-Grb7 protein (Y492E-FL-Grb7) is essentially monomeric at expected physiological concentrations. It has been shown previously the wild-type FL Grb7(WT-FLGrb7) protein is dimeric with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 11 mu M.

In case of the terminal oxyfunctionalization of linear alkanes by the AlkBGT monooxygenase the excess alkane substrate is often used as a second phase to extract the alcohol, aldehyde, and acid products. However, the selection of other carrier phases or surfactants is complex due to a large number of parameters that are involved, such as biocompatibility, substrate bioavailability, and product extraction selectivity. This study combines systematic high-throughput screening with chemometrics to correlate physicochemical parameters of a range of cosolvents to product specificity and yield using a multivariate regression model. Partial least-squares regression shows that the defining factor for product specificity is the solubility properties of the reaction substrate and product in the cosolvent, as measured by Hansen solubility parameters. Thus the polarity of cosolvents determines the accumulation of either alcohol or acid products. Whereas usually the acid product accumulates during the reaction, by choosing a more polar cosolvent the 1-alcohol product can be accumulated. Especially with Tergitol as a cosolvent, a 3.2-fold improvement in the 1-octanol yield to 18.3 mmol L-1 is achieved relative to the control reaction without cosolvents.'},\n",

This is necessary for users to produce richly annotated data that can be efficiently reused and make underlying workflows easily reproducible. A programming library that abstracts over the data and metadata models of the different formats and allows supporting all of them in one step would significantly simplify the development of new and the extension of existing software to address the need for better metadata annotation.ResultsWe developed the Java library JPhyloIO, which allows event-based reading and writing of the most common alignment and tree/network formats. It allows full access to all features of the nine currently supported formats. By implementing a single JPhyloIO-based reader and writer, application developers can support all of these formats.

Interestingly, bioinformatics is a useful tool for the identification of such new sequences of enzymes. The Avena saliva phospholipases could be identified by functional proteomics and bioinformatics analysis with the aid of database searches. Based upon Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequences, predicted genes were identified for Avena sativa PLO, PLA, and PLC, and assigned as AsPLD1, AsPLA2_1, and AsPiPLC1, respectively. Insights into the structural characterization of the oat predicted enzymes were analyzed using in silico approaches.

However, variant combinations might be key players in some diseases as variants that are neutral on their own can become deleterious when associated together. GEMPROT is a new analysis tool that allows, from a phased vcf file, to visualize the consequences of the genetic variants on the protein. At the level of an individual, the program shows the variants on each of the two protein sequences and the Pfam functional protein domains. When data on several individuals are available, GEMPROT lists the haplotypes found in the sample and can compare the haplotype distributions between different sub-groups of individuals. By offering a global visualization of the gene with the genetic variants present, GEMPROT makes it possible to better understand the impact of combinations of genetic variants on the protein sequence.

The proposed filtration method consisted of a main channel (depth: 1 mm) and shallow channels (depth: 400 mu m) in which the precursor mixture was injected. The filtration performance of the proposed device was evaluated by injecting a fluorescent dye that moved toward the centerline of the main channel. The respective rejection rates of CaCl2, NaCl, CaSO4, and Na2SO4 were 3.16%, 30.13%, 43.74%, and 36.32%, respectively. This trend can be explained by the mechanism of Donnan exclusion theory. The focusing of charged species toward the centerline of the main channel was caused by highly charged surfaces. The proposed filtration method exhibited a migration of charged microparticles toward a certain direction. This particle migration behavior was consistent with the simulation data. These results suggested that the proposed filtration method had strong potential for desalinating brackish water or salty surface water without an external power supply.'},\n",

These additional sites may be viewed as potential drug carrying sites that could be exploited for targeted drug delivery. The pharmacological effects of quercetin (QN) have already been studied. However, its molecular mechanism of interactions with lectin has not yet been addressed. The extending novelty provokes us to unravel the binding profile of QN with Spatholobus parviflorus lectin (SPL) using a combination series of biophysical and computational approaches. The UV absorption studies revealed an intense SPL-QN complex formation, indicating a hyperchromic effect. The fluorescence spectroscopic analysis using sugar-free SPL and sugar saturated SPL (ssSPL) revealed that QN binding significantly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of SPL. The thermodynamic parameters maintained uniformity with the binding stoichiometry (n = 4) of both SPL and ssSPL, hence it may be assumed that the sugar binding onto the SPL would not have been influenced with QN binding. The molecular docking analysis also maintained consistency with the in vitro results. It could be concluded from SPL-QN interactions without altering unique carbohydrate specificities, leave SPL unrestricted for other molecular recognition events.

Biological incorporation of Silicon (Si) into Sp increases its bioavailability for potential food supplement applications. This work aimed at determining the effects of Sp and Si-enriched Sp (Sp+Si) on metabolic syndrome features in Zucker fatty rats. Thirty Zucker fatty rats were divided into three groups and supplemented with placebo or Sp or Sp+Si croquettes for 12 weeks. Food consumption, glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and mitochondrial and oxidative stress were determined. Zucker fatty rats exhibited several hepatic metabolic alterations as well as mitochondrial and oxidative stress perturbations. The intake of Sp increased plasma TG levels and decreased the hepatic NADPH oxidase activity and ameliorated transitorily the glucose intolerance. However, Si-spirulina does not appear to have more beneficial effects than spirulina alone. Other experiments with different species of rats/mice, different diets, or durations of diet intake should be undertaken to confirm or infirm these results. Practical applications Glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis, two major components of metabolic syndrome, are increasing and becomes a major public health issue. Use of Spirulina platensis (Sp) as a functional food was suggested as a protein-dense food source. Bioavailable silicon (Si) may be an essential nutrient for higher animals, including humans. Sp but not Sp+Si decreased liver NADPH oxidase activity and improved transitorily glucose tolerance.

The activation of the NF-kappa B signal pathway is dependent on the degradation of the I kappa B kinase beta (IKK beta) complex. IKK beta is the key kinase in the NF-kappa B activation pathway. After inhibition, it can block the activation of NF-kappa B. IKK beta is a key regulator of NF-kappa B activation, also an early regulator of inflammation in all stages of the immune response. This study aimed to investigate the effect of IKK beta-siRNA lentivirus vector treatment for hepatic fibrosis of rats. An IKK beta-siRNA expression plasmid was constructed and injected in the tail vein of rats. Then, IKK beta-siRNA distribution in the liver was observed by immunofluorescence, and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect inflammation-related and fibrosis-related factors. IKK beta-siRNA lentiviruses could be delivered to the liver and significantly decrease carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis.

However, BiP also has other extracellular and intracellular functions. As it is unclear whether peripheral BiP has a signal and/or ER retention sequence, here we produced and biochemically characterised four variants of BiP. The variants differed depending on the presence or the absence of signal and ER retention peptides. Proteins were purified using nickel affinity chromatography, and variant size and quality were confirmed using SDS/PAGE gels. The thermal denaturing temperature of these proteins was found to be 46-47 degrees C. In addition, we characterised nucleotide binding properties in the absence and the presence of divalent cations. Interestingly, in the absence of cations, ADP has a higher binding affinity to BiP than ATP. The presence of divalent cations results in a decrease of the K-d values of both ADP and ATP, indicating higher affinities of both nucleotides for BiP. ATPase assays were carried out to study the enzyme activity of these variants and to characterise the kinetic parameters of BiP variants. Variants with the signal sequence had higher specific activities than those without. Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ efficiently stimulated the ATPase activity of these variants at low micromolar concentrations, whereas calcium failed to stimulate BiP ATPase. Our novel findings indicate the potential functionality of BiP variants that retain a signal sequence, and also reveal the effect of physiological concentrations of cations on the nucleotide binding properties and enzyme activities of all variants.'},\n",

Currently, two splice variants (v1 and v2) of murine PRMT5 have been deposited in the NCBI sequence database, in which PRMT5-v1 and -v2 contain different 33 and 16 amino acids at the N-terminal sequences, respectively. Here we showed that murine PRMT5-v1 is stable, but PRMT5-v2 is constantly degraded through both the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagic-lysosomal pathway (ALP) in an N-terminal sequence-dependent manner. Furthermore, inhibition of UPS and ALP elevated the stability of PRMT5-v2 that made it localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In addition, PRMT5-v2 exhibited the enzyme activity to catalyze histone H2A and H4 methylation. Notably, we found that the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 specially recognizes the N-terminal sequence of PRMT5-v2 and the carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) is required for poly-ubiquitination and the degradation of PRMT5-v2. These results suggest that Hsp70/CHIP chaperone-mediated protein degradation system is crucial in the regulation of PRMT5-v2 turnover, which has the potential to balance the symmetrical arginine dimethylation in cells.

The antigenetically variant genotypes of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) and their subsequent infections are challenging to tackle with traditional vaccination. In such scenario, neutralizing antibodies might provide an alternate solution to manage the FMDV infection. Thus, we have analysed the interaction of the mAb 4C4 with a synthetic G-H loop of FMDV-VP1 through in silico mutagenesis and molecular modelling. Initially, a set of 25,434 mutants were designed and the mutants having better energetic stability than 4C4 were clustered based on sequence identity. The best mutant representing each cluster was selected and evaluated for its binding affinity with the antigen in terms of docking scores, interaction energy and binding energy. Six mutants have confirmed better binding affinities towards the antigen than 4C4. Further, interaction of these mutants with the natural G-H loop that is bound to mAb SD6 was also evaluated. One 4C4 variant having mutations at the positions 2034(N -> L), 2096(N -> C), 2098(D -> Y), 2532(T -> K) and 2599(A -> G) has revealed better binding affinities towards both the synthetic and natural G-H loops than 4C4 and SD6, respectively. A molecular dynamic simulation for 50 ns was conducted for mutant and wild-type antibody structures which supported the pre-simulation results.

In the present paper, we use the quenching by a heavy atom (Br or I), situated at a known location along a phospholipid chain, as a probe of the location of a fluorescent moiety. We have synthesized various phospholipids with bromine (or iodine) atoms substituted at various locations along the lipid chain. The latter halolipids were intercalated in turn with various fluorophores into DMPC liposomes, biomembranes and erythrocyte ghosts. The most effective fluorescence quenching occurs when the heavy atom location corresponds to that of the fluorophore. The results show that generally speaking the fluorophore intercalates the same depth independent of which lipid bilayer is used. KBr (or KI) is the most effective quencher when the fluorophore resides in or at the aqueous phase.

Here we assessed UAHR by direct measurement of swelling of the nasal mucosa induced by intranasal methacholine (MCh) using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Micro-CT analysis was performed in both naive and ovalbumin-induced AR mice following intranasal administration of MCh. The nasal cavity was segmented into two-dimensional horizontal and axial planes, and the data for nasal mucosa were acquired for the region of interest threshold. Then, a ratio between the nasal mucosa area and nasal cavity area was calculated as nasal mucosa index. Using our novel method, nasal cavity structure was clearly identified on micro-CT, and dose-dependent increased swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed upon MCh treatment. Moreover, the nasal mucosa index was significantly increased in AR mice compared to controls following MCh treatment, while ovalbumin administration did not affect swelling of the nasal mucosa in either group. This UAHR following MCh treatment was completely reversed by pretreatment with glucocorticoids. This novel approach using micro-CT for investigating UAHR reflects a precise assessment system for swelling of the nasal mucosa following MCh treatment; it not only sheds light on the mechanism of AR but also contributes to the development of new therapeutic drugs in AR patients.'},\n",

These changes are accompanied by clinically and histologically manifested corneal inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and exudation of the anterior chamber of the eye. According to results of mass spectrometric analysis, the UV-induced corneal damage is associated with pronounced changes in the tear lipid composition, including a decrease in the amount of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin E-2 and an increase in the concentrations of prostaglandin D-2 and its derivative 15d-PGJ(2). In addition, it is accompanied by changes in the levels of hydroxyeicosate tetraenic acids, including a decrease of 12-HETE and an increase of 5-HETE. These changes suggest activation of metabolic pathways involving 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenases 1 and 2, and prostaglandin D synthase. These findings contribute to understanding mechanisms of UV-induced keratitis and point to feasibility of selective anti-inflammatory therapy for improving corneal regeneration after iatrogenic UV damage.'},\n",

It includes a coordination complex consisting of the radioisotope 99 m technetium bound to six copper tetramibi tetrafluorborate ligands, and is mainly used to image the myocardium via scintigraphy. As radiopharmaceuticals are regarded as drugs, they are subject to the same regulations; therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a quantification method for the active pharmaceutical ingredient before their complexation with the radioisotope by employing high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methodology. A simple and efficient method (retention time = 2.5 min) was developed and validated for copper tetramibi tetrafluorborate in the final product using a buffer and organic solvent mixtures (ACN-methanol-ammonium sulfate buffer) and a C-18 column. The analytical protocol was fast, taking around 30 min until evaluation of results. The validation parameters were evaluated with satisfactory results: in terms of linearity r > 0.99 (160-240 mu g/mL) and no deviation was observed.

During this stage, the proton originally bound to the C-alpha atom of the substrate is transferred to the leaving group, which is eliminated as a water molecule. As a result, the basic group that had accepted the C-alpha proton at the previous stage has to be involved in the catalytic stage following the elimination in its basic form. On the other hand, when the substrate contains a good leaving group (beta-chloro-L-alanine), general acid catalysis is not needed at the elimination stage and cannot be implemented, because there are no functional groups in enzymes whose acidity is strong enough to protonate the elimination of a base as weak as Cl- anion. Consequently, the group that had accepted the C-alpha proton does not lose its additional proton during the elimination stage and should take part in the subsequent stage in its acidic (not basic) form. To shed light on the mechanistic consequences of the changes in the ionic state of this group, we have considered the pH dependencies of the main kinetic parameters for the reactions of TIL with L-serine and beta-chloro-L-alanine and the kinetic isotope effects brought about by replacement of the ordinary water used as a solvent with (H2O)-H-2. We have found that in the reaction between TIL and beta-chloro-L-alanine, the aminoacrylate hydrolysis stage is sensitive to the solvent isotope effect, while in the reaction with L-serine it is not. We have concluded that in the first reaction, the functional group containing an additional proton fulfills a definite catalytic function, whereas in the reaction with L-serine, when the additional proton is absent, the mechanism of hydrolysis of the aminoacrylate intermediate should be fundamentally different. Possible mechanisms were considered.\"},\n",

Uniformly sized Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) with an average diameter of 16 nm were decorated on the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass through the connection of hydrolyzed 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS) serving as a sensor substrate. Then, the surface was covered with a poly-l-lysine thin film, where mouse macrophage cells were successfully cultured. The morphology of the electrodes obtained was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, and their electrochemical properties were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A linear response was observed from the AuNPs/APTMS/ITO substrate with a sensitivity of 0.465 units per mg/l of H2O2, and a higher sensitivity of 207 units per mg/l of zymosan. Thereafter, a factor of 84 molecules of H2O2 produced by a single glycogen was estimated. The results demonstrated that the ECL response of this cell-based sensor quantitatively correlated with yielded ROSs during cell oxygen metabolism under the stimulation of zymosan. This work suggests that the prepared sensing matrix is efficient for monitoring the oxygen metabolism of living cells and can be applied in biological and clinical fields to provide significant information on the regular or abnormal function of cells.

The most important application area of fuzzy sets theory is the fuzzy logic controllers. Their operation slightly differs from the operation of common controllers.

Development of an adaptive control system for diesel engine testing process based on fuzzy logic allows to simplify system's structural components and to provide discrete control procedure with some uninterruptible properties, which could improve the control and reduce the scope of the knowledge database. Fuzzy logic makes it fairly simple to input a priory information about an object in the form of fuzzy control rules into the adaptive control system.

The objectives of this study was to measure and correlate maternal serum hPL with free beta hCG, maternal age, maternal age related risk ratio and calculated risk ratio of first trimester screening. After obtaining permission from the Institutional Ethics Committee, hPL and free beta hCG were measured from the serum of 84 pregnant women aged 20-40years in 11-13th weeks+6days of gestation who underwent dual test during their antenatal check-up. Independent t test, Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation, Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA were used wherever appropriate. A significant positive correlation between maternal serum hPL, maternal age related aneuploidy risk ratio (p value<0.001) and aneuploidy risk ratio at the time of delivery (p value<0.001) was observed. Also maternal age was negatively correlated with maternal serum hPL (p value<0.001) and positively correlated with maternal serum free beta hCG (p value 0.023).

The three-dimensional structure of SBP shows that it is composed of two distinct domains, each consisting of a mixed beta-sheet flanked by helices. The substrate, Met, is bound in the central part of the interface between the two domains. The overall structure of SP_0149 resembles those of SBPs from other reported bacterial Met and Gly-Met dipeptide transporters.

Although it is well known that NO preconditioning has cardioprotective effects, but its mechanism remains unsatisfactory.Methods: To induce NO preconditioning, H9c2 cells were treated with low NO concentration and subsequently induced apoptosis by high NO. The signalling and anti-apoptotic effects of NO preconditioning were monitored by Western blotting, facs analysis.Results: Sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced cytotoxicity was inhibited by low SNP (0.3 mM) preconditioning. Furthermore, low SNP phosphorylated Akt/FoxO1 in the presence of high SNP (1.5 mM), while phosphorylated Akt/FoxO1 and viability were reversed by PI3K inhibitor. Also, low NO-induced CREB phosphorylation with high NO was inhibited by PKA inhibitor, indicating that NO preconditioning protects NO-induced cytotoxicity in PKA dependently. Apoptotic inhibition with NO preconditioning was accompanied with increased Bcl-2, decreased Bax, and caspase3 activation, which was all reversed by LY294002.Conclusion: Our results indicate that low NO preconditioning prevent subsequent high NO-induced apoptosis via Akt/PKA/CREB activation in H9c2 cells.'},\n",

They account for similar to 27.7% of the primate genome. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that the retrotransposition rate of Alu elements is nine times higher in baboons than in humans.ObjectiveThe expansion of Alu copies could be dependent on the activity of L1-encoded proteins. Thus, we aimed to investigate full-length baboon-specific L1s and characterize structurally and functionally intact baboon-specific L1s (ORF1p/ORF2p and ORF2p only) that could induce trans-mobilization of Alu elements in the baboon genome.ResultsA total of 673 baboon-specific L1 candidates (>4kb) were identified through the comparative genomic analysis. Applying the baboon-specific correction value obtained from the experimental validation, it demonstrated that approximately 446 baboon-specific L1s (>4kb) were present in the baboon reference genome (papAnu2). In addition, we observed phylogenetic relationship of the baboon-specific L1s through the neighbor-joining method and they diverged from the L1PA6 consensus sequence. Finally, we identified 36 full-length baboon-specific L1s that were intact both ORF1p and ORF2p.ConclusionThe number of baboon-specific full-length L1s is fewer than the number of human-specific full-length L1s. Therefore, there is possibility that the L1 master gene or L1 source gene is more abundant in the baboon genome, or that in trans retrotransposition activity of baboon-specific L1s is relatively stronger than in the other genomes.'},\n",

Based on high-throughput tumor genomic analysis, each missense mutation can potentially give rise to multiple neopeptides, numerous false positive neoantigens will be produced, experimental verification would require immense time and experience. Specific identification of immunogenic candidate neoantigens is consequently a major challenge. Here we introduce a workflow to predict and filter neoantigens of breast cancer with proteogenomic methodology, which can be beneficial to high quality identification of neoantigens. We found that C2 (IFN - gamma dominant) immunophenotype possessed the most number of neoantigens. C2 immunophenotype shows the highest M1/M2 macrophage polarization, a strong CD8 signal and the greatest T cell receptor(TCR) diversity, which may lead to more neoantigen number than in other immunophenotypes of breast cancer. In addition, we also observed that there is a positive linear relationship between neoantigen number and tumor mutation burden. By further screening for predicted tumor mutant peptides using mass spectral data of breast cancer, we found that more than 20 000 predicted neoantigens were reduced to dozens of mutant peptides in protein expression level, the corresponding mutant genes could be further analyzed. Finally, in order to define which neoantigens were more likely to be immunogenic, TCR recognition probability was calculated using blastp method. In this study, proteomics data was used to further screen the predicted neoantigens, which improved the prediction accuracy of neoantigens, and could greatly reduce the validation scope of potential subsequent experiments.

The hypothetical protein encoded by the mgl2 gene was found to be similar to methyltransferases (MTases). Protein homology and template-based modeling facilitated prediction of the Mgl2 structure, which greatly resembled class I MTases with a S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding cleft. The Mgl2 protein was engaged in exopolysaccharide, but not lipopolysaccharide, synthesis. The mgl2 deletion mutant produced exopolysaccharide comprised of only low molecular weight fractions, while overexpression of mgl2 caused overproduction of exopolysaccharide with a normal low to high molecular weight ratio. The deletion of the mgl2 gene resulted in disturbances in biofilm formation and a slight increase in motility in minimal medium. Red clover (Trifolium pratense) inoculated with the mgl2 mutant formed effective nodules, and the appearance of the plants indicated active nitrogen fixation. The mgl2 gene was preceded by an active and strong promoter. Mgl2 was defined as an integral membrane protein and formed homodimers in vivo; however, it did not interact with Pss proteins encoded within the Pss-I region.

Because lysine side chains often balance the negative charge of RNA in ribonucleoprotein complexes, the method is especially useful for detecting changes in protein-RNA interactions. By probing the E. coli 30S ribosome subunit, we established that the reactivity pattern of lysine residues quantitatively reflects structure models derived from X-ray crystallography. We also used the strategy to assess differences in three conformations of purified human spliceosomes in the context of recent cryo-electron microscopy models.

This, however, is a computationally challenging task. This task is further complicated as biological interactions depend on limited resources, i.e., a reaction takes place if the reactant molecule concentrations are above a certain threshold level. This biochemical property implies that network edges can participate in a limited number of motifs simultaneously. Existing motif counting methods ignore this problem. This simplification often leads to inaccurate motif counts (over- or under-estimates), and thus, wrong biological interpretations.ResultsIn this paper, we develop a novel motif counting algorithm, Partially Overlapping MOtif Counting (POMOC), that considers capacity levels for all interactions in counting motifs.ConclusionsOur experiments on real and synthetic networks demonstrate that motif count using the POMOC method significantly differs from the existing motif counting approaches, and our method extends to large-scale biological networks in practical time. Our results also show that our method makes it possible to characterize the impact of different stress factors on cell's organization of network. In this regard, analysis of a S. cerevisiae transcriptional regulatory network using our method shows that oxidative stress is more disruptive to organization and abundance of motifs in this network than mutations of individual genes.

The majority of these techniques have been only focused on the prediction of beta-turn location in proteins. We developed a hybrid approach for analysis and prediction of different types of beta-turn. Results A two-stage hybrid model developed to predict the beta-turn types I, II, IV and VIII. Multinomial logistic regression was initially used for the first time to select significant parameters in prediction of beta-turn types using a self-consistency test procedure. The extracted parameters were consisted of 80 amino acid positional occurrences and 20 amino acid percentages in beta-turn sequence. The most significant parameters were then selected using multinomial logistic regression model. Among these, the occurrences of glutamine, histidine, glutamic acid and arginine, respectively, in positions i, i+1, i+2 and i+3 of beta-turn sequence had an overall relationship with 5 beta-turn types. A neural network model was then constructed and fed by the parameters selected by multinomial logistic regression to build a hybrid predictor. The networks have been trained and tested on a non-homologous dataset of 565 protein chains by nine fold cross-validation. It has been observed that the hybrid model gives a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.473 and 0.124, respectively, for beta-turn types II and VIII which are best among previously reported results. Our model also distinguished the different types of beta-turn in the embedded binary logit comparisons which have not carried out so far. Availability Available on request from the authors.'},\n",

To clarify the cytotoxic mechanism of MA1, we screened for the genes involved in the cytotoxicity of MA1 in monocytoid U937 cells by using a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide knockout library. Screening was performed by positive selection for cells that were resistant to MA1 treatment, and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) integrated into MA1-resistant cells were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. As a result of the evaluation of sgRNAs that were enriched in MA1-resistant cells, SQLE, which encodes squalene epoxidase, was identified as a candidate gene. SQLE-depleted U937 cells were viable in the presence of MA1, and squalene epoxidase inhibitor conferred MA1 resistance to wild-type cells.

The energy landscape underscores the inherent nature of proteins as dynamic molecules interconverting between structures with varying energies. In principle, reconstructing a protein's energy landscape holds the key to characterizing the structural dynamics and its regulation of protein function. In practice, the disparate spatio-temporal scales spanned by the slow dynamics challenge both wet and dry laboratories. However, the growing number of deposited structures for proteins central to human biology presents an opportunity to infer the relevant dynamics via exploitation of the information encoded in such structures about equilibrium dynamics. Results: Recent computational efforts using extrinsic modes of motion as variables have successfully reconstructed detailed energy landscapes of several medium-size proteins. Here we investigate the extent to which one can reconstruct the energy landscape of a protein in the absence of sufficient, wet-laboratory structural data. We do so by integrating intrinsic modes of motion extracted off a single structure in a stochastic optimization framework that supports the plug-and-play of different variable selection strategies. We demonstrate that, while knowledge of more wet-laboratory structures yields better-reconstructed landscapes, precious information can be obtained even when only one structural model is available. Conclusions: The presented work shows that it is possible to reconstruct the energy landscape of a protein with reasonable detail and accuracy even when the structural information about the protein is limited to one structure. By attenuating the dependence on structural data of methods designed to compute protein energy landscapes, the work opens up interesting venues of research on structure-based inference of dynamics. Of particular interest are directions of research that will extend such inference to proteins with no experimentally-characterized structures.\"},\n",

In many prokaryotes, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DSBs relies on a two-component machinery constituted by the ring-shaped DNA-binding Ku that recruits the multicatalytic protein Ligase D (LigD) to the ends. By using its polymerization and ligase activities, LigD fills the gaps that arise after realignment of the ends and seals the resulting nicks. Here, we show the presence of a robust AP lyase activity in the polymerization domain of Bacillus subtilis LigD (BsuLigD) that cleaves AP sites preferentially when they are proximal to recessive 5-ends. Such a reaction depends on both, metal ions and the formation of a Watson-Crick base pair between the incoming nucleotide and the templating one opposite the AP site. Only after processing the AP site, and in the presence of the Ku protein, BsuLigD catalyzes both, the in-trans addition of the nucleotide to the 3-end of an incoming primer and the ligation of both ends. These results imply that formation of a preternary-precatalytic complex ensures the coupling of AP sites cleavage to the end-joining reaction by the bacterial LigD.'},\n",

They are produced by solid phase peptide synthesis and share the specific targeting activities of antibodies (IgGs) but are much smaller in size and exploit a different immune-stimulating mechanism. Two ISErs (Y-9 and Y-59) that bind to the cancer cell markers integrin alpha 3 and EphA2, respectively, are analyzed here with respect to their immune cell stimulation. We have previously shown that they activate formyl peptide receptors on myeloid immune cells and induce respiratory burst in neutrophils and myeloid chemotaxis in solution. It remained, however, unclear whether these molecules can stimulate immune cells while bound to tumor cells, an essential step in the hypothesized mode of action. Here, we demonstrate that ISEr Y-9 induced respiratory burst and caused a change in the shape of neutrophils when bound to the surface of protein A beads as a model of tumor cells. More importantly, tumor cell lines carrying receptor-bound Y-9 or Y-S9 also activated neutrophils, evidenced by a significant change in shape. Interestingly, similar activation was induced by the supernatants of the cells incubated with ISEr, indicating that ISErs released from tumor cells, intact or degraded into fragments, significantly contributed to immune stimulation.

Here we deconvolute the role of halogen polarizability vs. substrate pK(a) in defining this specificity, and show how substrate binding compares to the structurally homologous catechol extradiol dioxygenases. The substrates 2,6-dichloro- and 2,6-dibromohydroquinone (polarizable halogens, pK(a1)=7.3), 2,6-difluorohydroquinone (nonpolarizable halogens, pK(a1)=7.5), and 2-chloro-6-methylhydroquinone (polarizable halogen, pK(a1)=9.0) were examined through spectrophotometric titrations and steady-state kinetics. The results show that binding of the substrates to the enzyme decreased pKa1app by about 0.5, except for 2,6-difluorohydroquinone, which showed no change. Additionally, the K-d values of 2,6-dichloro- and 2,6-dibromohydroquinone are about equal to their respective KmAapp. For comparison, with catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (XylE), the substrates 4-methyl- and 3-bromocatechol are bound to the enzyme exclusively in the monoanion form over a wide pH range, indicating a pKa1app of at least -2.9 and -1.2, respectively. The steady-state kinetic studies showed that 2,6-difluorohydroquinone is a poor substrate, with kcatapp/KmAapp approximately 40-fold lower and KmAapp 20-fold higher than 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone, despite its similar pK(a1). Likewise, the pH dependence of kcatapp for 2-chloro-6-methylhydroquinone is nearly identical to that of 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone, despite its very different pK(a1). These results show that (1) it is clearly the halogen polarizability and not the lower substrate pK(a) that determines the substrate specificity of PcpA, and (2) that PcpA, unlike the catechol extradiol dioxygenases, lacks an active site base that assists with substrate deprotonation, highlighting a key functional difference in what are otherwise similar active sites that defines their different reactivity.'},\n",

They significantly increase database search time and can lead to uninformative search results containing similar sequences. Sequence clustering methods have been used to address this issue to group similar sequences into clusters. These clusters form a nonredundant database consisting of representatives (one record per cluster) and members (the remaining records in a cluster). In this approach, for nonredundant database search, users search against representatives first and optionally expand search results by exploring member records from matching clusters. Existing studies used Precision and Recall to assess the search effectiveness of nonredundant databases. However, the use of Precision and Recall does not model user behavior in practice and thus may not reflect practical search effectiveness. In this study, we first propose innovative evaluation metrics to measure search effectiveness. The findings are that (1) the Precision of expanded sets is consistently lower than that of representatives, with a decrease up to 7% at top ranks; and (2) Recall is uninformative because, for most queries, expanded sets return more records than does search of the original unclustered databases. Motivated by these findings, we propose a solution that returns a user-specified proportion of top similar records, modeled by a ranking function that aggregates sequence and annotation similarities. In experiments undertaken on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, the largest expert-curated protein database, we show that our method dramatically reduces the number of returned sequences, increases Precision by 3%, and does not impact effective search time.'},\n",

This was done by performing bioinformatic docking predictions between CD23 and a(X)beta(2) integrin aI domain and SPR spectroscopy analysis of the interaction. This revealed that in the absence of cations, the RKC motif is involved in interaction with the integrin aI domain. However, in the presence of divalent metal cations the interaction showed the involvement of a novel acidic motif within the CD23 protein.

The rising kinetics of the transient absorption band at 1020 nm and the bleaching kinetics of the 545-nm band constructed using the proposed method are adequately fitted by the kinetic equations for sequential electron transfer from the excited primary donor to the B-A (monomeric bacteriochlorophyll) molecule, and then to the H-A (bacteriopheophytin serving as an electron acceptor) molecule with the rate constants of 3.5 +/- 0.2 and 0.8 +/- 0.1 ps, respectively. The kinetics of the bacteriochlorophyll absorption band at 600 nm shows both the ultrafast bleaching of the P-870 dimer and slower bleaching of the B-A monomer due to its transition to the anion radical.

       "  'content': 'Many biological studies involve either (i) manipulating some aspect of a cell or its environment and then simultaneously measuring the effect on thousands of genes, or (ii) systematically manipulating each gene and then measuring the effect on some response of interest. A common challenge that arises in these studies is to explain how genes identified as relevant in the given experiment are organized into a subnetwork that accounts for the response of interest. The task of inferring a subnetwork is typically dependent on the information available in publicly available, structured databases, which suffer from incompleteness. However, a wealth of potentially relevant information resides in the scientific literature, such as information about genes associated with certain concepts of interest, as well as interactions that occur among various biological entities. We contend that by exploiting this information, we can improve the explanatory power and accuracy of subnetwork inference in multiple applications. Here we propose and investigate several ways in which information extracted from the scientific literature can be used to augment subnetwork inference. We show that we can use literature-extracted information to (i) augment the set of entities identified as being relevant in a subnetwork inference task, (ii) augment the set of interactions used in the process, and (iii) support targeted browsing of a large inferred subnetwork by identifying entities and interactions that are closely related to concepts of interest. We use this approach to uncover the pathways involved in interactions between a virus and a host cell, and the pathways that are regulated by a transcription factor associated with breast cancer. Our experimental results demonstrate that these approaches can provide more accurate and more interpretable subnetworks. Integer program code, background network data, and pathfinding code are available at https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/subnetwork_inference Author summary There is a multitude of publicly available databases that contain information about biological entities (i.e., genes, proteins, and other small molecules) as well as information about how these entities interact together. However, these databases are often incomplete. There is a wealth of information present in the text of the scientific literature that is not yet available in these databases. Using tools that mine the scientific literature we are able to extract some of this potentially relevant information. In this work we show how we can use publicly available databases in conjunction with the information extracted from the scientific literature to infer the networks that are involved in specific biological processes, such as viral replication and cancer tumor growth.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Background: Understanding how neuronal signals propagate in local network is an important step in understanding information processing. As a result, spike trains recorded with multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) have been widely used to study the function of neural networks. Studying the dynamics of neuronal networks requires the identification of both excitatory and inhibitory connections. The detection of excitatory relationships can robustly be inferred by characterizing the statistical relationships of neural spike trains. However, the identification of inhibitory relationships is more difficult: distinguishing endogenous low firing rates from active inhibition is not obvious. New method: In this paper, we propose an in silico interventional procedure that makes predictions about the effect of stimulating or inhibiting single neurons on other neurons, and thereby gives the ability to accurately identify inhibitory effects. Comparison: To experimentally test these predictions, we have developed a Neural Circuit Probe (NCP) that delivers drugs transiently and reversibly on individually identified neurons to assess their contributions to the neural circuit behavior. Results: Using the NCP, putative inhibitory connections identified by the in silico procedure were validated through in vitro interventional experiments.

High binding mutations in FimH are related to the adaptive evolution of bacteria. However, additional roles that these allelic variations may play remain elusive. To investigate novel biological functions of the mutations in FimH, we introduced four different variants of FimH by incorporating single amino acid substitutions at specific sites, namely A25P, G73R, A106, and T158P, respectively. In this study, adjuvant potential of FimH variants was evaluated by investigating their ability to trigger innate immune response to DC2.4 and adaptive immunity to improve immunological characteristics. The data revealed that purified A106 and T158P up-regulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules critically involved in DC2.4 activation by interaction with TLR4, whereas A25P and G73R did not induce the phenotypic maturation of DC2.4. Besides, the culture of DC2.4 with A106 and T158P enhanced the release of cytokines and protein phagocytosis. When formulated with PAc, T158P elicited more robust PAc-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses compared to PBS, PAc and PAc +K12 groups and inhibited bacteria colonization.

In Drosophila melanogaster, many of these HD TFs are expressed in the early embryo and control transcription of target genes in development through their interaction with cis-regulatory modules. Previous studies where some of the Drosophila HD TFs were purified required the use of strong denaturants (i.e. 6 M urea) and multiple chromatography columns, making the downstream biochemical examination of the isolated protein difficult. To circumvent these obstacles, we have developed a streamlined expression and purification protocol to produce large yields of Drosophila HD TFs. Using the HD TFs FUSHI-TARAZU (FTZ), ANTENNAPEDIA (ANTP), ABDOMINAL-A (ABD-A), ABDOMINAL-B (ABD-B), and ULTRABITHORAX (UBX) as examples, we demonstrate that our 3-day protocol involving the overexpression of His(6)-SUMO fusion constructs in E. coli followed by a Ni2+-IMAC, SUMO-tag cleavage with the SUMO protease Ulp1, and a heparin column purification produces pure, soluble protein in biological buffers around pH 7 in the absence of denaturants. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirm that the purified HD proteins are functional and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra confirm that the purified HDs are well-folded.

A critical component to understand the interactome of a small molecule is the precise location on a protein where the interaction takes place. Several approaches have been developed that take advantage of bio-orthogonal chemistry and subsequent enrichment steps to isolate peptides modified by small molecules. These methods rely on target identification at the level of mass spectrometry making it difficult to interpret an experiment when modified peptides are not identified. Herein, an approach in which fluorescence-triggered two-dimensional chromatography enables the isolation of small molecule-conjugated peptides prior to mass spectrometry analysis is described. In this study, a bromocoumarin moiety has been utilized that fluoresces and generates a distinct isotopic signature to locate and identify modified peptides.

In this study, we found that isolated recombinant cardosin A attached to human epithelial cells A549, mediated by the binding of its RGD motif to cell surface integrins. The cell bound cardosin A was internalized to endosomes and lysosomes and triggered the permeability of lysosomal membrane leading to apoptosis of the epithelial cells. These events are identical to those observed for three RGD-containing aspartic proteases, Saps 4-6, secreted by Candida albicans. Such a process, which has been called the Trojan Horse mechanism, is believed to benefit the invasion of C. albican into the epithelium of the host. The location of the RGD motifs of cardosin A and Saps 4-6 are on the opposite ends of the homologous three-dimensional structures, suggesting that the Trojan Horse mechanism is insensitive to the RGD position. Current finding also suggests that cardosin A may have a defensive function against the ingestion of cardoon flowers by human, insects, and other herbivores.'},\n",

Caldibacillus debilis GB1 is capable of anaerobic growth and can synthesize ethanol while C. debilis Tf cannot. Comparison of the GB1 and Tf genome sequences revealed that the genomes were highly similar in gene content and showed a high level of synteny. At the genome scale, there were several large sections of DNA that appeared to be from lateral gene transfer into the GB1 genome. Tf did have unique genetic content but at a much smaller scale: 300 genes in Tf verses 857 genes in GB1 that matched at <= 90% sequence similarity. Gene complement and copy number of genes for the glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain pathways were identical in both strains. While Tf is an obligate aerobe, it possesses the gene complement for an anaerobic lifestyle (ldh, ak, pta, adhE, pfl). As a species, other strains of C. debilis should be expected to have the potential for anaerobic growth.

The resulting FL intensities were measured by spectrofluorometer at excitation wavelengths of 380nm and emission wavelengths of 500nm. Different reaction conditions such as concentration of sodium periodate, reaction time and pH of the borate buffer were studied to determine the optimum reaction conditions. Linearity was obtained between FL intensity and peptide concentrations from 10 to 160 mu M with a lower detection limit of 10 mu M (S/N=3). Dipeptides containing Ala, Phe, Leu and Val at the N-termini generated significant FL in comparison to the reagent blank (**p<0.005, ***p<0.0005).

Previous work shows that conferred advantages are rare in xenogeneic hybrids, whereas risks of cellular dysregulation are high. Here, we explore the transcriptome of individual xenogeneic hybrids of human mesenchymal stem cells and murine cardiomyocytes soon after fusion and ask whether the process is stochastic or involves conserved pathway activation. Toward this end, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze the transcriptomes of hybrid cells with respect to the human and mouse genomes. Consistent with previous work, hybrids possessed a unique transcriptome distinct from either fusion partner but were dominated by the cardiomyocyte transcriptome. New in this work is the documentation that a few genes that were latent in both fusion partners were consistently expressed in hybrids. Specifically, human growth hormone 1, murine ribosomal protein S27, and murine ATP synthase H+ transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex subunit C2 were expressed in nearly all hybrids. The consistent activation of latent genes between hybrids suggests conserved signaling mechanisms that either cause or are the consequence of fusion of these 2 cell types and might serve as a target for limiting unwanted xenogeneic fusion in the future.-Yuan, C., Freeman, B.

Differential expression analysis was performed to identify messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that were positively and negatively correlated with PSTK. We selected 10 candidate genes identified via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis for further analysis. As expected, PSTK levels were significantly higher in PSTK-overexpressing podocytes and significantly lower in PSTK-knockdown podocytes. PSTK overexpression resulted in the upregulation of 122 genes and downregulation of 372 genes in podocytes. On the other hand, PSTK knockdown resulted in the upregulation of 231 genes and downregulation of 445 genes. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that 11 genes were positively correlated with PSTK, whereas 20 genes were negatively correlated with PSTK. The obtained PSTK-regulated genes were primarily involved in molecular function, biological process, and cellular component, as well as the angiogenesis pathway. The Wnt family member 10A levels were significantly higher after PSTK overexpression, but were significantly lower after PSTK knockdown. In addition, Na+/K+ ATPase subunit -2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels were significantly downregulated after PSTK overexpression, but significantly upregulated upon PSTK knockdown.

These allow an investigation of a potential upper bound and the detection of limitations yielded by automatic relation extraction.ConclusionWe apply one-class SVM and isolation forest anomaly detection algorithms to a set of hidden connections to rank connections by identifying outlying (interesting) ones and show that the approach increases the F-1 measure by a factor of 10 while greatly reducing the quantity of hidden knowledge to manually verify.

Recent research has considered inferring clonal composition of a tumor sample using computational models based on the short read data of the sample generated using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Short reads (segmented DNA parts of different tumor cells) are noisy; therefore, inferring the clones and their mutations from the data is a difficult and complex problem. Existing methods to infer clones from noisy NGS data do not consider the presence of long-range mutational influences. Therefore, we develop a new model, called extended multiple sample tumor heterogeneity prediction by factorial Hidden Markov model (emHetFHMM), based on factorial hidden Markov models to infer clones and their proportions by capturing the long-range mutational influences. In our model, each hidden chain represents the genomic signature of a clone, and a mixture of chains results in the observed data.

Detection of oxidation of LDL-mimetic liposomes using an electrode might serve as a convenient tool in the search of antioxidants for the prevention of atherosclerosis. This report proposes a reaction mechanism between LDL-mimetic liposomes and an acid-treated carbon nanotube (CNT) electrode. Oxidation of the liposomes, mediated by Cu2+, was monitored by the change in electrode potential, and the fluorescence intensity generated by diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine (DPPP) as control. The electrode potential and fluorescence intensity increased concomitantly during oxidation, followed by a gradual decrease. Although the electrical potential peaked faster than the fluorescence intensity, addition of CNT to the DPPP reaction accelerated the latter, suggesting the role of CNT as an accelerator of liposome oxidation. Atomic force microscopy showed increased binding of liposomes to CNT along with liposomal deformation. Further, binding of Cu2+ to the liposome-bound CNT surface was observed by quartz crystal microbalance. In conclusion, the interaction of liposomes with Cu2+ and CNT surface explains the rapid response of the electrode in liposome oxidation. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.'},\n",

This selective response may ultimately influence cortical plasticity and function. The mechanism(s) by which cholinergic receptors are altered following noise exposure remain unknown. However, these data demonstrate noise exposure may differentially influence mAChRs that typically populate interneurons in A1 and RB more than nAChRs that are traditionally located on thalamocortical projections and provide motivation for cholinergic imaging in clinical patient populations of temporary or permanent hearing loss.'},\n",

Unfortunately, the ability of rHuEPO in boosting erythropoiesis, and thus aerobic capacity has led to its abuse in endurance sport. Besides, the expiry of the original rHuEPO patent has resulted in many biosimilars being produced which led to special requirements regarding quality control. As a consequence, there is a huge demand for all rHuEPOs to be well characterized for the ease of identification, differentiation, and detection. Glycoproteomic mass spectrometry, the most current promising approach for rHuEPOs analysis, was employed to characterize 4 rHuEPOs including epoetin-alpha, epoetin-beta, darbepoetin-alpha and Mircera. Via nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS, distinct glycoproteomic profiles of each rHuEPO have been achieved for differential analysis. With two different fragmentation methods, collision-induced dissociation (CID) and higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD), maximum of 75%, 70%, 70%, and 77% protein sequence coverages were attained for epoetin-alpha, epoetin-beta, darbepoetin-alpha and Mircera, respectively. From the peptides/glycopeptides mixture, similar and unique peptides/glycopeptides (biomarkers) for each rHuEPO have been identified. With the discovery of high quality and unique biomarkers, a more standardized and efficient method for quality control and rHuEPO abuse detection can be developed. [GRAPHICS] .'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Background: The immune response of the critically ill after severe trauma is sex-specific and may explain the different progression of the disease. This may be explained by a different gene regulatory program of their peripheral immune cells. We investigated the progression of the transcription profiles of peripheral immune cells of the patients to elucidate their distinct physiological response and clinical course. Methods: We compared transcription profiles of whole blood of male and female patients from a larger longitudinal study of critically ill patients after trauma. We developed a statistical analysis pipeline that synchronized the time lapse of the profiles based on the temporal severity score of each patient. Results: This enabled to categorize the temporal progression of the disease into two pre-acute, an acute and two post-acute phases. Comparing gene regulation of male and female patients at each phase, we identified distinctively regulated molecular processes mainly in the immune response, but also in the regulation of metabolism allowing to cluster these discriminative gene sets into sets of highly related cellular processes. Compared to male patients and healthy controls, female patients showed upregulation of gene sets of innate immunity in the early phase, upregulation of wound healing processes during the acute phase and upregulation of adaptive immunity in the late phase indicating early recovery. In turn, during the pre-acute and acute phase, male patients showed less suppression of gene sets coding for enzymes of energy metabolism and anabolism, most prominently the tricarboxylic acid cycle and beta-oxidation, and cellular maintenance, such as cell cycle, DNA replication and damage response, and RNA metabolism. Conclusions: A stronger innate immune response at the very early phase of the disease may support early clearance of the pathogen and its associated molecular patterns. Upregulation of wound healing processes may explain reduced multiple organ failure during the acute phase. Down regulated energy metabolism during the acute phase may make female patients less susceptible to oxidative stress, the upregulated adaptive immune system reflects an earlier recovery and rebuilding of the adaptive immune system that may protect them from secondary infections. Follow up studies need to be performed confirming these observations experimentally.'},\n",

The overall cohort was divided into infertile (n = 24) and fertile (n = 23) subgroups and compared in terms of genotypic and allelic frequencies. The genotypic distribution followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (chi(2) = 2.21, P = 0.137) and included the GG genotype in 28/47 GT in 14/47, and TT in 5/47 of the samples. Genotypic and allelic frequencies between fertile and infertile women with endometriosis showed that absence of the TT genotype was associated with fertility in endometriosis patients (P = 0.0623).

Commonly, drought and salinity are interrupted by intermittent precipitation or irrigation. It remains unclear whether the delta C-13 values reflect the cumulative duration of intermittent drought or salinity stress. Methods Drought (5% and 10% polyethylene glycol) and salinity (35 mM and 85 mM NaCl) were imposed on annual ryegrass consistently or cyclically; throughout the treatments, the stress duration for cyclic drought/salinity was half that of the corresponding prolonged stress treatment. The shoot delta C-13 values were measured using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Results Prolonged drought restrained growth and increased shoot delta C-13 values relative to the control group. However, the shoot biomass was even lower under cyclic drought than under prolonged drought. Furthermore, the shoot delta C-13 value under cyclic drought was close to that of the control group. The low NaCl concentration treatment actually enhanced shoot growth. The shoot delta C-13 value varied with both duration and intensity of salinity across all groups. Conclusions The shoot delta C-13 value in annual ryegrass did indicate cumulative stress from cyclic low salinity, but not that from cyclic drought, in a manner that was mediated by the effect of re-watering on the mass and allocation of the photosynthates produced during stress.'},\n",

Methods The stable isotopic compositions (delta H-2, delta C-13 and delta O-18 values) of a library of 43 samples of MFA were determined and multivariate models constructed to differentiate samples of different composition. The data from the MFA library were compared with those obtained from MFA extracted from contaminated milk powder (the case samples). The isotopic composition of the extracted samples was measured on dichloroaniline derivatives. Results A wide range of values was found for delta H-2, delta C-13 and delta O-18 of the MFA samples, much greater than the analytical repeatability between subsamples. Stable isotope data, therefore, provide a means of distinguishing samples of MFA. Of the 43 MFA samples tested, all but 6 could be eliminated as potential sources of the contamination, i.e. they had a distinctly different isotopic composition such that they must have had different histories and/or origins. Conclusions Stable isotope measurements of bulk and derivatized MFA provide an effective means of discriminating MFA samples. Three of the library samples that could not be differentiated from the case samples were directly connected to the suspect, and this evidence contributed to the suspect's admission of guilt.\"},\n",

However, the autoantigenicity level of hTPO(163) is higher than that of the full-length glycosylated hTPO (ghTPO(332)). In order to clarify the structural and physicochemical properties of hTPO(163), circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed. CD analysis indicated that hTPO(163) undergoes an induced-fit conformational change (+19.0% for helix and -16.7% for beta-strand) upon binding to the neutralizing antibody TN1 in a manner similar to the coupled folding and binding mechanism. Moreover, DSC analysis showed that the thermal transition process of hTPO(163) is a multistate transition; hTPO(163) is thermally stabilized upon receptor (c-Mpl) binding, as indicated with raising the midpoint (T-m) temperature of the transition by at least +9.5 K. The conformational variability and stability of hTPO(163) indicate that hTPO(163) exists as a molten globule under native conditions, which may enable the induced-fit conformational change according to the type of ligands (antibodies and receptor). Additionally, CD and computational analyses indicated that the C-terminal domain (154-332 residues) and glycosylation assists the folding of the N-terminal domain. These observations suggest that the antibody affinity and autoantigenicity of hTPO(163) might be reduced, if the conformational variability of hTPO(163) is restricted by mutation and/or by the addition of C-terminal domain with glycosylation to keep its conformation suitable for the c-Mpl recognition.'},\n",

The subcutaneous route is considered more immunogenic as it is associated with increased antidrug antibody-positive patients. The skin contains dendritic cells (DCs) and it is unclear whether these contribute to immunogenicity. To assess the effect of IFN beta on skin-resident cells, IFN beta was injected intradermally (i.d.) ex vivo using a human skin explant model or s.c. in vivo in MS patients. Ex vivo, intradermal IFN beta injections reduced migration and enhanced surface CD86 expression of dermal DCs, and an increased expression of HLA-DR+ was observed in skin biopsies taken after subcutaneous IFN beta injection (in vivo). In both models, IFN beta elevated the expression of several inflammatory cytokines when compared to the control biopsies. Our results show that 3 different IFN beta preparations, normalized in dose and injection site, induce similar immune responses, suggesting that the differences in immunogenicity are likely due to the route and frequency of administration.'},\n",

First: PSP modelling exploits the fact that a lot of the cells behave identically at the same time which results in multiple orders of magnitude speed-up. The second speed-up is achieved by using an unconditionally stable, partial differential equation solver which allows big time-stepping by trading off speed with precision.

The homologs to three mammalian nAChR regulators, ubiquilin-1, CRELD2 (cysteine-rich with EFG-like domain 2), and PICK1 (protein interacting with PRKCA 1), were characterized in L.migratoria, and their functions on regulating native nAChRs were investigated via RNAi followed by membrane potential measurement with DiBAC(4)(3) and agonist-evoked macroscopic current recording in cultured L.migratoria DUM neurons. Ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 negatively regulated nAChRs because silencing of ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 both resulted in increased membrane potential and increased inward currents in DUM neurons, while CRELD2 positively regulated nAChRs as decreased membrane potential and inward currents were observed in DUM neurons. In addition, ubiquilin-1 regulated both -Bgt-sensitive and -Bgt-resistant types of nAChRs whereas PICK1 and CRELD2 regulated only the -Bgt-resistant nAChRs. The present study broadened our understanding on the regulation of insect nAChRs and will benefit pest management given the important role of nAChRs in insect neurons and insecticide science.'},\n",

The thinness of main olfactory epithelium (MOE) become thin with ageing, and the gene expression profile alters after AC3 deletion. DNA methylation plays a key role in animal development and regulation of gene expression. In the present study, whether the DNA methylation level of gene promoter, as well as their associations with the expression of the genes in MOE will be altered after AC3 deletion, was investigated by using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation chip (MeDIP-chip), methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and realtime fluorescence quantification PCR. The data showed that the DNA methylation levels of promoters of 1 978 genes were altered in AC3-deficient mice, accounting for 9% of the total number of genes. Of which 727 genes with their promoter's DNA methylation levels were elevated, 1 251 genes with their promoter's methylation levels were lowered. The functions of these genes are mainly involved with olfactory receptor, neurodevelopmental, cAMP signaling pathway, ATP-binding, calcium regulation, acetylation modification, and transcription factors. It was further confirmed by MSP that methylation levels of promoter of the olfactory receptor genes Olfr1153, Olfr231, Olfr378, Olfr651 and Olfr691 were increased, whereas methylation level of the promoters of Cngb1, Pde4a and Olfr1394 were decreased.

In conclusion, the methylation levels of promoters of olfactory receptor genes, neurodevelopmental related genes and cAMP signaling pathways in MOE are modified significantly after AC3 deletion, which affected the transduction of signal pathways such as nucleotide excision and repair, DNA replication and mismatch repair, thus comprehensively regulating the number and level of gene expression in MOE of mice.\"},\n",

Changes of cell proliferation of MCF-10A, BT-549 and SK-BR-3 cells at low and high cell density was explored. Expression of GM1 in different cell density was detected by flow cytometry. Exogenous GM1 at different cell density was added to explore the effect on cell proliferation.

Then, proliferating ability were tested by cell counting and related pathways was assayed by Western blot, in stable-transfected cell lines. Results showed cell proliferation was inhibited and GM1 expression increased at low and high cell density compared with normal density. Exogenous addition of GM1 at low and high density cells inhibited cell growth, but it had no influence on cell growth at normal density. Down regulation of GM1 promoted cell proliferation at low and high cell density, and overexpression of GM1 had the opposite effect.

However, the decrease of thymocytes in PLZF deficient mice was not cell intrinsic. This study adds new information regarding the regulation of the PLZF gene in the development and self-renewal of T cells. Methods: The thymus was isolated from newborn mice, and the two lobes of each thymus were physically separated. Each host received a thymus, two lobes, each placed at one end of the kidney, as described in the literature. Tail vein blood was periodically collected from some of the recipients and analyzed for the presence of peripheral blood T cells. Results: In PLZF-EGFP reporter mice and neonatal thymus transplantation to the kidney, we found that PLZF was highly expressed in DN1 (Lineage(-)CD44(+)CD2(-)) cells of thymic grafts of Rag2/gamma c(-/)(-) recipient mice.

It was initially found through its characteristic interactions with homeodomain proteins. Hipk is involved in a variety of important developmental processes, such as the development of the eye or the nervous system. In the present study, we set Hipk and the Drosophila homeodomain proteins Homeobrain (Hbn), Empty spiracles (Ems), and Muscle segment homeobox (Msh) in an enzyme-substrate relationship. These homeoproteins are transcription factors that function during Drosophila neurogenesis and are, at least in part, conserved in vertebrates. We reveal a physical interaction between Hipk and the three homeodomain proteins in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). In the course of in vitro phosphorylation analysis and subsequent mutational analysis we mapped several Hipk phosphorylation sites of Hbn, Ems, and Msh. The phosphorylation of Hbn, Ems, and Msh may provide further insight into the function of Hipk during development of the Drosophila nervous system.'},\n",

Models of reversible sensory loss are particularly useful for establishing the timeline of various critical periods for cortical plasticity. However, there currently is an absence of adequate methods to produce reversible hearing loss in neonatal and developing rodents. New method: We propose a novel and reversible adaptation of an existing surgical technique-external auditory canal ligation (EACL)-that produces a reliable and moderate hearing loss. Results: Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were used to measure both the magnitude of the hearing loss induced by EACL and the auditory thresholds following hearing restoration. The EACL and reopening procedures, as assessed by visual inspection, had success rates of 81% and 78%, respectively. The average hearing thresholds, as assessed with ABRs, increased by nearly 40 decibels across all tested frequencies. Hearing thresholds returned to normal levels following the reopening procedure. Comparison with existing methods: Our procedure yields similar benefits to other methods, such as producing a reliable and moderate hearing loss that is entirely reversible. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first that can be performed in neonatal rodents, thus allowing researchers the opportunity to assess the effects of sensory loss on behavior and cortical neurophysiology during developmental critical periods. Conclusion: Our modified technique of reversible external auditory canal ligation offers an easy, and reliable method to induce a transient state of hearing loss that mimics naturally occurring congenital conductive hearing loss.'},\n",

Materials and methods: A total of 104 CHC patients aged 20-75 years with available serum insulin data at 0 and 48 weeks, and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA data at 0,12, 24, 48 and 72 weeks were included in the study. All clinical parameters were assessed according to the therapy response. Results: Among 104 patients, sustained virologic response (SVR) was achieved in 55 cases. A statistically significant difference was noted between SVR and non-SVR groups regarding gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), insulin level plus homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score and insulin resistance at week 48, log HCV-RNA and stage of fibrosis. Conclusion: Insulin resistance is accepted to have a negative effect on SVR. Insulin resistance may improve once SVR is achieved. Presence of IR at week 48 has been found associated with SVR. In this context, it can be advocated that insulin resistance at week 48 may be a predictive factor for prediction of SVR at week 72.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"Tuning curves characterizing the response selectivities of biological neurons can exhibit large degrees of irregularity and diversity across neurons. Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or partially random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. Empirical tuning curve distributions can thus be utilized to make model-based inferences about the statistics of single-cell parameters and network connectivity. However, a general framework for such an inference or fitting procedure is lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network models as implicit generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly available or is highly intractable. Recent advances in machine learning provide ways for fitting implicit generative models without the need to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic circuit models in theoretical neuroscience to datasets of tuning curves. This fitting procedure avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, such as the biophysical parameters of, or synaptic connections between, particular recorded cells. Instead, it directly learns generalizable model parameters characterizing the network's statistical structure such as the statistics of strength and spatial range of connections between different cell types. Another strength of this approach is that it fits the joint high-dimensional distribution of tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary statistics picked a priori by the user, resulting in a more accurate inference of circuit properties. More generally, this framework opens the door to direct model-based inference of circuit structure from data beyond single-cell tuning curves, such as simultaneous population recordings. Author summary Neurons in the brain respond selectively to some stimuli or for some motor outputs, but not others. Even within a local brain network, neurons exhibit great diversity in their selectivity patterns. Recently, theorists have highlighted the computational importance of diverse neural selectivity. While many mechanistic circuit models are highly stylized and do not capture such diversity, models that feature biologically realistic heterogeneity in their structure do generate responses with diverse selectivities. However, traditionally only the average pattern of selectivity is matched between model and experimental data, and the distribution around the mean is ignored. Here, we provide a hitherto lacking methodology that exploits the full empirical and model distributions of response selectivites, in order to infer various structural circuit properties, such as the statistics of strength and spatial range of connections between different cell types. By applying this method to fit two circuit models from theoretical neuroscience to experimental or simulated data, we show that the proposed method can accurately and robustly infer circuit structure, and optimize a model to match the full range of observed response selectivities. Beyond neuroscience applications, the proposed framework can potentially serve to infer the structure of other biological networks from empirical functional data.\"},\n",

This semistochastic, identification -first paradigm generates a wealth of peptide-level data without regard to relative abundance. We introduce a data acquisition concept called sequential windowed acquisition of reporter masses (SWARM). This approach performs quantitation first, thereby allowing subsequent acquisition decisions to be predicated on user-defined patterns of reporter ion intensities. The efficacy of this approach is validated through experiments with both synthetic mixtures of Escherichia coli ribosomes spiked into human cell lysates at known ratios and the quantitative evaluation of the human proteome's response to the inhibition of cullin-based protein ubiquitination via the small molecule MLN4924. We find that SWARM-informed parallel reaction monitoring acquisitions display effective acquisition biasing toward analytes displaying quantitative characteristics of interest, resulting in an improvement in the detection of differentially abundant analytes.

These composite quasi-particles are vital structures when it comes to charge transport mechanism in a wide range of semiconducting materials. In the present work, we investigated the drift of an electron and the subsequent polaron formation in impurity-endowed lattices in the framework of a one-dimensional tight-binding model. Primarily, we scrutinized electronic dynamics in lattices containing two sources of disorders: a barrier and a well. The dispersion of the gamma distribution gives an idea of the extension of the disorder region in the lattice. We studied the dynamics of an injected electron interacting with the lattice vibrations where we consider, for a given degree of disorder, different velocities of the incoming particle. Our results show that there are different kinds of propagation/localization for the electron according to the assumed initial velocity.

Recombinant CiApex1 protein complemented the drug sensitivities of an AP endonuclease-deficient Escherichia coli mutant, and exhibited Me dependent AP endonuclease activity, like human APEX1, in vitro. Next, the effects of abnormal AP site repair on embryonic development were investigated. Treatment with methyl methanesulfonate, which alkylates DNA bases and generates AP sites, induced abnormal embryonic development. This abnormal phenotype was also caused by treatment with methoxyamine, which inhibits AP endonuclease activity. Furthermore, we constructed dominant-negative CiApex1, which inhibits CiApex1 action, and found that its expression impaired embryonic growth.

The uPA system consists of several components: serine proteinaseuPA, its receptor uPAR and its two endogenous inhibitors - PAI-1 and PAI-2. The role of uPA, a highly specific protease, consists in triggering the processes performed by the uPA system, which result in destruction of connective tissue matrix (CTM) and basal membranes as well as activation of numerous extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways. uPA converts plasminogen into plasmin and in addition to the regulation of fibrinolysis, it can hydrolyze a number of CTM components and activate zymogens of secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MM?s)pro-MM?s. MM?s can hydrolyze all the main CTM components and thus play a key role in the development of invasive processes, as well as to perform regulatory functions by activating and releasing from CTM a number of biologically active molecules involved in the regulation of the main processes of carcinogenesis. uPA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 not only regulate uPA/uPAR activity; they are also involved in proliferation, apoptosis, chemotaxis, adhesion, migration, and activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways. All the above mentioned processes are aimed at regulating invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis.

Glucosylation of phenolics is one of the molecular mechanisms controlling phenolics homeostasis. However, the relevant glucosyltransferases are largely unknown. In this study, a putative family 1 glucosyltransferase gene OsSGT1 was cloned from rice due to its close homology with the previously reported phenolics-related glucosyltransferases UGT84A1-A4, and the phylogenetic relationship of OsSGT1 with homologs from other species was investigated. Recombinant OsSGT1 protein showed strong activity towards phenolics to form their glucose conjugates. This is the first identified natural phenolics-related glucosyltransferase in rice. In addition, the expression patterns of OsSGT1 in different tissues of rice indicated that OsSGT1 was predominantly expressed in the old leaves and dough grains, suggesting that OsSGT1 might be involved in the maturation process of rice by regulating phenolic metabolism, and thus deepened our understanding on the roles of phenolics in rice growth and environmental adaptation.'},\n",

Using the primers designed according to the PEBP genome sequences, PEBP genes were cloned from 15 representative genomes of Gossypium genus, and the gene structure, CDS sequence, protein sequence and properties were predicted and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Taking PEBP proteins of grape as reference, grouping of orthologous gene, analysis of phylogeny and divergence of PEBPs in nine species were conducted to reconstruct the evolutionary pattern of PEBP genes in plants.ResultsWe identified and cloned 160 PEBPs from 15 cotton species, and the phylogenetic analysis showed that the genes could be classified into the following three subfamilies: MFT-like, FT-like and TFL1-like. There were eight single orthologous group (OG) members in each diploid and 16 double OG members in each tetraploid. An analysis of the expression and selective pressure indicated that expression divergence and strong purification selection within the same OG presented in the PEBP gene family.ConclusionAn evolutionary pattern of duplication and deletion of the PEBP family in the evolutionary history of Gossypium was suggested, and three pairs of genes resulted from different whole-genome duplication events.'},\n",

Often, changes in gene co-expression are investigated across two or more biological conditions defined by categorizing a continuous covariate. However, the selection of arbitrary cut-off points may have an influence on the results of an analysis. To address this issue, we use a general linear model (GLM) for correlated data to study the relationship between gene-module co-expression and a covariate like metabolite concentration. The GLM specifies the gene-pair correlations as a function of the continuous covariate. The use of the GLM allows for investigating different (linear and non-linear) patterns of co-expression. Furthermore, the modeling approach offers a formal framework for testing hypotheses about possible patterns of co-expression. In our paper, a simulation study is used to assess the performance of the GLM. The performance is compared with that of a previously proposed GLM that utilizes categorized covariates. The versatility of the model is illustrated by using a real-life example. We discuss the theoretical issues related to the construction of the test statistics and the computational challenges related to fitting of the proposed model.'},\n",

The biological function of a protein depends on its tertiary structure which is determined by its amino acid sequence via the process of protein folding. We propose a novel fold recognition method for protein tertiary structure prediction based on a hidden Markov model and 3D coordinates of amino acid residues. The method introduces states based on the basis vectors in Bravais cubic lattices to learn the path of amino acids of the proteins of each fold. Three hidden Markov models are considered based on simple cubic, body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) lattices. A 10-fold cross validation was performed on a set of 42 fold SCOP dataset. The proposed composite methodology is compared to fold recognition methods which have HMM as base of their algorithms having approaches on only amino acid sequence or secondary structure. The accuracy of proposed model based on face-centered cubic lattices is quite better in comparison with SAM, 3-HMM optimized and Markov chain optimized in overall experiment. The huge data of 3D space help the model to have greater performance in comparison to methods which use only primary structures or only secondary structures.'},\n",

The formation of chromatin interactions is associated with specific proteins. It has been suggested that CTCF and adhesion proteins are associated with chromatin interactions, but it is still unclear whether other proteins are involved in chromatin interactions. In this paper, we integrated Hi-C and ChIP-seq data to mine transcription factors related to chromatin interaction in both GM12878 and K562 cell lines, and performed the functional analysis of discovered transcription factors. We found that RUNX3, SPI1 and other transcription factors may also be involved in chromatin interaction in chromatin sites where interaction occurs frequently. In addition, using the data mining method of FP-growth, we found that multiple transcription factors may cooperate to participate in chromatin interaction. Our findings will provide prior knowledge for the development of chromatin interaction experiments.'},\n",

The four target compounds were extracted with acetonitrile and purified by Florisil or Florisil with octadecylsilane from the cereals and fruits. Determination of the targets was achieved within 3.5 min by using Shim-pack GIST C18 column connected to an electrospray ionization source (ESI- mode). The method showed excellent linearity (R-2 > 0.9984), and the limits of quantitation were 1 mu g/kg for all compounds. Average recoveries were in the range of 74.6%-108.1%, with an intra-day relative standard deviation between 0.9% and 18.3%. The inter-day relative standard deviation was less than 13.8%. The results demonstrate that this method is convenient for monitoring the residues of saflufenacil and its metabolites in food matrices. Practical applications Saflufenacil controls many common annual broadleaf weed efficiently, it has been developed and launched into the market by domestic enterprises. Consequently, an analysis method for monitoring saflufenacil in food sample will be urgently needed in China over the next few years. This method provides separation with good specificity within 3.5 min, which is less than previous studies. For the five matrixes, the method presented satisfactory validation parameters in terms of good linearity, low limit of quantitations, and satisfactory accuracy and precision.

The results of mRNA expression and activity of NOSs, as well as NO metabolite levels in different tissues of the two lizards indicate that nNOS mRNA levels in cardiac and skeletal muscle were notably elevated in P. erythrurus, and iNOS expression was also increased markedly (up to 4-fold) in cardiac muscle. There was no significant difference in eNOS mRNA level in tested tissues between two species. However, the total NOS activity in skeletal muscle of P. erythrurus was slightly lower than that of P. przewalskii (p < .05) while no difference in other tissues. Similarly, lower iNOS activity (p < .01) was found in cardiac and skeletal muscle in P. erythrurus compared to P. przewalskii. In addition, the NO metabolite levels were dramatically lower in P. erythrurus in all tested tissues.

Due to the importance of C3d-CR2 interaction in the design of vaccines, many studies have indicated the interactions are pH-dependent. Moreover, C3d-CR2 interactions at pH 5.0 are unknown. To investigate the molecular mechanism of pH-regulating C3d-CR2 interaction, molecular dynamics simulations for C3d-CR2 complex in different pH are performed. Our results revealed that the protonation of His9 in C3d at pH 6.0 slightly weakens C3d-CR2 association as reducing pH from 7.4 to 6.0, initiated from a key hydrogen bond formed between Gly270 and His9 in C3d at pH 6.0. When reducing pH from 6.0 to 5.0, the protonation of His33 in C3d weakens C3d-SCR1 association by changing the hydrogen-bond network of Asp36, Glu37, and Glu39 in C3d with Arg13 in CR2. In addition, the protonation of His90 significantly enhances C3d-SCR2 association. This is because the enhanced hydrogen-bond interactions of His90 with Glu63 and Ser69 of the linker change the conformations of the linker, Cys112-Asn116 and Pro87-Gly91 regions.

After surgery, the animals were randomly divided into: control group, MR1 group, anti-B7 group, and co-blocking group (n=12, each group). Subconjunctival injection was first performed on the allograft surgery day until post-surgery day five. Four weeks later, or when immune rejection occurred, the cornea was sampled to detect and analyze the gene spectrum. The survival time in the co-blocking group was significantly longer than that in the other three groups (p < 0.05). Gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of genes associated with immune rejection, interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, and IL-2 was down-regulated in the co-blocking group, while IL-10 was up-regulated, but the changes in nuclear factor-kappa B and interferon-gamma were not significant.

Transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of gene expression, modulating the transcription initiation rate of target genes; they are critical components in signal transduction in response to abiotic stress. Our hypothesis is that genotypes with contrasting tolerance signal water deficit through TFs (10 genes of the DREB family and bZIP) with differing degrees of expression. We believe that these genes will have greater expression in the flooded genotype because drought is an atypical condition in these plants. We tested two rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes: BRS Querencia (flooded) and AN Cambara (dryland).

Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is a conserved multistep process involving several enzymes. Molybdopterin synthase, a hetero-tetrameric enzyme composed of a pair of MoaE-MoaD subunits, catalyzes the generation of the cis-dithiolene group of molybdopterin in the second step of the process. The cis-dithiolene group can covalently bind molybdenum. Most mycobacterial species possess several genes encoding the full pathway of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. In M. smegmatis, the moaD2 and moaE2 genes encode the functional molybdopterin synthase. However, M. tuberculosis has genes encoding several molybdopterin synthase subunit homologs, including moaD1, moaD2, moaE1, moaE2, and moaX, which encodes a MoaD-MoaE fusion protein. Previous studies have shown that moaD2 and moaE2 encode functional molybdopterin synthase. Here, we report the crystal structures of two substrate-free molybdopterin synthases from two different mycobacterial pathogens, M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis, at 2.1 angstrom and 2.6 angstrom resolutions, respectively. The overall structure of both molybdopterin synthases was hetero-tetrameric, consisting of a MoaE2 dimer flanked on either side by single MoaD2 subunits. The carboxyl-terminal domain of MoaD2 inserted into MoaE2, forming the active pocket. A comparison with previously reported molybdopterin synthase structures showed that substrate-binding and catalytic residues were conserved, despite low sequence similarity among these enzymes.

Identifying the combination of sourcing germline genes is critical to understand the process of antibody maturation, which may facilitate the diagnostics and rapid generation of human monoclonal antibodies in therapeutics. Despite of successful efforts in V and J fragment assignment, method in D segment tracing remains weak for immunoglobulin heavy diversity (IGHD).ResultsIn this paper, we presented a D-sensitive mapping method called DSab-origin with accuracies around 90% in human monoclonal antibody data and average 95.8% in mouse data. Besides, DSab-origin achieved the best performance in holistic prediction of VDJ segments assignment comparing with other methods commonly used in simulation data. After that, an application example was explored on the antibody response based on a time-series antibody sequencing data after influenza vaccination. The result indicated that, despite the personal response among different donors, IGHV3-7 and IGHD4-17 were likely to be dominated gene segments in these three donors.ConclusionsThis work filled in a computational gap in D segment assignment for VDJ germline gene identification in antibody research. And it offered an application example of DSab-origin for studying the antibody maturation process after influenza vaccination.'},\n",

This study explores the molecular mechanisms of recognition and activation of two homologous chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, using CXCL8 analogues with residue substitutions in the conserved Glu4LeuSArg6 (ELR) triad. Analysis of the binding of CXCL8 analogues to CXCR1 is consistent with the two-site model for signal recognition of CXCR1, whereas analysis of the binding of CXCL8 analogues to CXCR2 supported a single-site model for signal recognition of CXCR2. The CXCL8-Arg6His analogue stimulated calcium release, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and chemotaxis in cells expressing CXCR1. However, CXCL8-Arg6His failed to stimulate calcium release and chemotaxis in cells expressing CXCR2, although it stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, indicating that CXCL8-Arg6His operated as a classical CXCR2 biased agonist. The CXCL8-Glu4AlaLeuSAlaArg6His analogue was inactive in cells expressing CXCR1 and CXCR2. These findings suggest that the Glu4LeuS motif in CXCL8 is essential for activation of CXCR1 and CXCR2. Importantly, CXCL8-Glu4AlaLeuSAlaArg6His blocked specifically the calcium release and chemotaxis of cells expressing CXCR1 but not of cells expressing CXCR2. CXCL8-Glu4AlaLeuSAlaArg6His was identified as the first specific CXCR1 antagonist. The binding of CXCL8-ELR6H to CXCR1 created a Zn2+ coordination site at the receptor activation domain responsible for calcium release, as ZnCl2 specifically blocked CXCL8-Arg6His-induced calcium release without affecting CXCL8-induced calcium release. This work provides the basis for further exploration of the activation mechanisms of chemokine receptors and will assist in the design of the next generation of modulators of CXCR1 and CXCR2.'},\n",

Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a multifunctional peptide, plays an important role in the establishment and maintenance of healthy pregnancy, prevents an immune attack at peri-implantation period, vasodilation and promotes angiogenesis. In the present study, we enrolled a total of 600 subjects which includes 300 PE patients and 300 healthy pregnant women from South India to analyse two functional polymorphisms (rs4399321A/G and rs4910118C/T) of ADM gene. The genotype frequencies of these two polymorphisms differed significantly between the PE and control groups (p=0.02 and p=0.03). Individuals carrying the AA genotype of rs4399321A/G were slightly higher in controls (40%) compared to patients (28%) and revealed an OR value of (0.69, CI 0.49-0.98; p=0.05) suggests the protective role.

Although RANKL expression has been described in normal T cells, a potential role in T-cell leukemia remains undefined. Here, we used a model of immature T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, the TEL-JAK2 transgenic mice, to assess RANKL expression in leukemic cells and its regulatory mechanisms. We found that Rankl mRNA was significantly overexpressed in leukemic T cells when compared to wild-type thymocytes, their nonmalignant counterparts. Moreover, Rankl mRNA and RANKL surface expression in leukemic cells was induced by T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling activation, dependently on the NFKB signaling pathway. These results indicate that TCR-activated leukemic T cells express high levels of RANKL and are potential inducers of RANK signaling in microenvironmental cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The proband presented with pale skin, jaundice and splenomegaly. Analysis of the thalassemia gene indicated beta(codon 17)/beta(A) (HBB: c.52A>T), while Hb analysis showed significantly increased Hb F levels.

Due to the difference between the phenotype and genotype, next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed and the proband was found to carry a homozygous mutation on the SPTB gene combined with a heterozygous mutation in KLF1. An eosin-5-maleimide binding test (EMA-BT) showed that the mean fluorescence intensity decreased by 47.1%. The proband was finally diagnosed with HS and HPFH complicated with a beta-thal trait and the high percentage of Hb F was believed to be ascribed to the KLF1 gene mutation, which is frequent in areas where thalassemia is prevalent. For patients with a beta gene mutation accompanying significantly high percentage of Hb F, the diagnosis of beta-TI could be warranted, and the influence of the KLF1 gene mutation should be carefully excluded to avoid misdiagnosis of other types of hereditary hemolytic diseases.'},\n",

The second step usually requires a counterselection method, because the efficiency of recombination is not high enough to find recombinants among non-recombinant cells. Most counterselection methods require the introduction of additional mutations into the genome or the use of expensive chemicals. In this paper, we describe the development of a reliable procedure for the removal of an antibiotic resistance marker from the E. coli genome without the need for counterselection. For this purpose, we used dsDNA cassettes consisting of two regions homologous to the sequences that flank the marker on the chromosome. We optimized the length of the homologous regions, the electroporation conditions, and the duration of recovery for the electroporated cells in order to maximize the recombination efficiency. Using the optimal parameters identified, we obtained a rate of 4-6% recombinants among the transformed cells.

Data from the European Biological Variation Study (EuBIVAS) and the recently published Johnson et al. study (ref n 11) were scored using the 14 BIVAC quality items (QI), with alternatives A, B, C and/or D to verify whether the elements required to obtain reliable BV data, were present and appropriately documented. Grade A indicates compliance with all the QIs and D indicates non compliance. The sizes of the confidence interval (CI) around the CVI estimates were also compared. Johnson's study received a BIVAC grade C, EuBIVAS a grade A. EuBIVAS is a large scale study, with 1609 and 1728 results for NSE and S100-beta, respectively. In Johnson's study, only 40 results were available. The EuBIVAS CVI estimates [NSE, 10.9% (10.3-11.5); S100-beta, 10.2% (9.6-10.7)] were clearly lower than Johnson's CV(I)s [NSE, 22.1% (9.9-34.3); S100-beta, 18.9% (8.5-29.4)]. The overlapping CI between the two estimates are caused by Johnson's CI being about 20 times larger than the corresponding EuBIVAS CI. It is likely that studies that do not comply with all BIVAC QI deliver less reliable, and possibly too high, CVI estimates.

Conformational disorder is frequent in protein structures and atoms can have, in protein crystal structures, two or more alternative, equilibrium positions close to each other. Here, a set of protein crystal structures refined at very high resolution (1 angstrom or better) is examined to characterize the conformational disorder of the backbone atoms, which is not infrequent: about 15% of the protein backbone atoms are conformationally disordered and three quarters of them have been deposited with two or more equilibrium positions (most of the others were not detected in the electron density maps). Several structural features have been examined and it was observed that C atoms tend to be disordered more frequently than the other backbone atoms, likely because their disorder is induced by disordered side chains: side-chain disorder is two times more frequent than backbone disorder. Surprisingly, backbone disorder is only slightly more frequent in loops than in helices and strands and this is in agreement with the observation that backbone disorder is a localized phenomenon: in about 80% of the cases, it is observed in one amino acid and not in its neighbors. However, although backbone disorder does not cluster along the polypeptide sequence, it tends to cluster in 3D, since backbone-disordered amino acids distant in sequence are close in the 3D space.'},\n",

SCs estimation is accomplished through LS concept after establishing a database of known object-and-speckle pairs. Image reconstruction is realized by solving an SDP problem to obtain the product of the unknown object image and its Hermitian transposition. Finally, the unknown object image can be reconstructed by extracting the largest rank-1 component of the product.

After reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers, the ion current fluctuations caused by chitohexaose entering the channel were measured in deuterium oxide and in water. Results: The role of hydrogen-bonding in sugar binding was investigated by comparing channel occlusion by chitohexaose in buffers containing H2O and D2O. The BLM results revealed the significant contribution of hydrogen bonding to the binding of chitohexaose in the constriction zone of VhChiP. Replacing H2O as solvent by D2O significantly decreased the on- and off-rates of sugar penetration into the channel.

From our study, it is evident that the termination of Si-surface via the dehydrogenation of aforementioned ethane and NH3BH3 derivatives is more feasible compared to Ge-surface. For ethane, the investigation shows that the substitution of non-participating hydrogens with +I group (electron donating) causes an enhancement in the kinetic and thermodynamic feasibility of the termination process, whereas the implementation of -I substituent (electron withdrawing) makes an adverse effect. While exploring the termination of Si- as well as Ge-surfaces through the dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 and its derivatives, it is noticed that from both the kinetic as well as thermodynamic perspectives, the termination processes are more feasible than that of ethane and its derivatives. We have further examined the detailed mechanism of each termination process by analyzing the geometrical parameters and NPA charges. From bonding evaluation, it is evident that the hydrogen abstraction from ethane by both the surfaces is symmetric in nature, where both the hydrogens show slightly positive charge. But for NH3BH3 the hydrogen abstraction process becomes asymmetric, where the boron associated hydrogen is abstracted as hydride by the electrophilic surface Si (Ge) and the hydrogen bonded with the N-centre is abstracted as proton by the nucleophilic surface Si (Ge).

The heterozygosity for MTHFR C677T was 38%, MTHFR Al 298C was 40% and factor VII G353A was 37%, respectively. Allelic frequencies between males and females were similar. There were no correlations between the genotypes of polymorphisms and the lipid profiles. This study is the first genetic epidemiology study that investigated the allelic frequencies of MTHFR and MI polymorphisms associated with metabolic syndromes. This study proves to be a crucial analysis in order to use these polymorphisms as a predictor of disease development in the Turkish Cypriot community. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

From image stacks obtained with a plurality of different incident angles, a three-dimensional spatial structure of the observed sample can be reconstructed by a Multi-Angle-TIRF (MA-TIRF) algorithm that provides an axial resolution of similar to 50 nm. Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of the TIRF microscopes, we further increase its lateral resolution by introducing a fast deconvolution algorithm into the reconstruction of MA-TIRF data (DMA-TIRF), which is approached in just one step of minimizing the reconstruction function. We also introduce a TV regularization term in the deconvolution algorithm to suppress artifacts induced by the excessive noise. Therefore, based on the hardware of existing MA-TIRF microscopes, the proposed DMA-TIRF algorithm has achieved lateral and axial resolutions of similar to 200 and similar to 50 nm, respectively.

As for the protein surface, we constructed an artificial beta-sheet, composed of poly-alanine residues (Ala-sheet).

During the simulation, all the inhibitors kept interaction with Ala-sheet and had the limited conformational fluctuations compared with in aqueous solution. The representative conformations obtained from the cluster analysis showed that two of hydrophobic inhibitors adopted the extended conformations in aqueous solution and also on Ala-sheet. For the other two hydrophilic inhibitors, the conformations in aqueous solution adopted the bent conformation with two terminal hydrophobic rings closely packed. On Ala-sheet, contrarily, the two hydrophobic rings were open and took the extended conformations, which were placed on the sheet as a foothold. The charged moieties in the hydrophilic inhibitors were protruded into aqueous environment with the extended conformation. The conformational characteristics of the inhibitors in aqueous solution and Ala-sheet varied likely by chemical features or structures of the inhibitors, but each was considered to be physicochemically reasonable.

Identifying post-nerve injury phenomena is key to assessing the merit and timing of surgery as well as to tracking nerve recovery postoperatively. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been investigated in the clinical and research settings as a noninvasive technique to both assess and monitor each patient's unique case of peripheral nerve damage. New method: We identify a MRI-suitable marker for tracking the exact site of either nerve injury or coaptation following surgical repair to aid with DTI analysis. Results: Due to artefact and disruption of tractography, silver wire and microvascular clips were not suitable markers. AxoGuard (R), 4-0 vicryl suture, and 10-0 polyamide suture, although detectable, did not produce a signal easily distinguished from post-surgical changes. Silicone was easily identifiable and stable in both the acute and delayed time points, exhibited negligible impact on DTI parameters, and possessed geometry to prevent nerve strangulation. Comparison with existing method: Prior studies have not assessed the efficacy of other markers nor have they assessed silicone for potential artefact with DTI parameter analysis. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the reliability and compatibility of silicone in the delayed postoperative time period and includes its unique imaging appearance on high-resolution 11.7 MRI. Conclusion: Semi-cylindrical silicone tubing can be used as a safe, reliable, and readily available radiological marker to visualize and monitor a region of interest on a rodent's peripheral nerve for aiding assessments with diffusion tensor imaging.\"},\n",

A popular example are serine proteases, where the peptide cleavage reaction is realized by a configuration of only three residues. Brought to spatial proximity during the protein folding process, such structural motifs are often long-range contacts and usually hard to detect at sequence level. Due to the constantly increasing resource of protein 3D structure data, the computational identification of structural motifs can contribute significantly to the understanding of protein fold and function. Thus, we propose a method to discover structural motifs of high geometrical similarity and desired sequence separation in protein 3D structure data. By utilizing methods originated from data mining, no a priori knowledge is required. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by the identification of the catalytic unit of serine proteases and the ion-coordination center of cupredoxins. Furthermore, large-scale analysis of the entire Protein Data Bank points towards the presence of ubiquitous structural motifs, independent of any specific fold or function.

Here we investigated the first three coiled-coil repeats (R1-R3) of the central domain of dystrophin, a scaffolding protein in muscle cells whose deficiency leads to Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophies. By an atomic description of the hydrophobic interactions, we highlighted (i) that coiled-coil filament conformational changes are associated to specific patterns of inter-helices hydrophobic contacts, (ii) that inter-repeat hydrophobic interactions determine the behavior of linker regions including filament kinks, and (iii) that a non-strict conservation of the heptad patterns is leading to a relative plasticity of the dystrophin coiled-coil repeats.

However, estimation and quantification of MPIO in vivo is still challenging. This limitation mainly arises from smearing and displacement of the negative contrast of the MPIO, so-called blooming, potentially leading to false-positive detection. Further, the bias field induced by the MR coils also hinders visualization and quantification of the MPIO. To mitigate these drawbacks, a positive contrast image can be generated, for example by using a frequency offset technique, which can significantly improve the accuracy of quantification methods. In this research, we introduce the normalized average range (nAR) as a new way to quantify the relative MPIO content within a study. The method compares the average value of test ROIs to that of a control ROI in range filtered images. The nAR can be used on both positive and negative contrast images. The nAR was tested on agar phantoms containing various MPIO concentrations, and on a rostral migration model for MPIO labeled stem cells in mice. The amount of MPIO was quantified for biased and unbiased data, and both for positive and negative contrast images. In addition, the presence of MPIOs in the olfactory bulb was verified by histology. The results show the nAR can indicate the presence and relative content of MPIO for both negative and positive images. However, the nAR showed slightly higher sensitivity in optimized positive contrast images compared to negative contrast images. In all cases, the bias field played a minor role in the quantification, making debiasing less of a concern. The dependency of the nAR values on the MPIO content in the ROI was further validated histologically. Thus, the nAR provides a robust and reliable tool for quantification of MPIO in mice.

CNS involvement significantly reduces survival and there are no effective treatments for CNS involvement. Therefore, an appropriate animal model is required to evaluate the inhibitory effects of novel drugs on the progression of ATL with CNS involvement. Here, we established a mouse model of ATL with CNS involvement using NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ mice inoculated with ATL cells intramuscularly in the postauricular region, and these mice showed paraparesis. Of the 10 mice inoculated with ATL cells intramuscularly (I.M.) at 5 weeks of age, 8 (80%) showed paraparesis, whereas none of the 10 mice inoculated with ATL cells subcutaneously (S.C.) showed paraparesis. In the I.M. group, PCR detected HTLV-1-specific genes in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae; however, in the S.C. group, the vertebrae were negative for HTLV-1 genes. Histological analysis revealed a particularly high incidence of tumors, characterized by accumulation of the injected cells, in the thoracic vertebrae of mice in the I.M. group. Tumor cell infiltration was relatively high in the bone marrow. Spinal cord compression caused by invasion of the tumor mass outside the pia mater was observed in the thoracic vertebrae of the spinal cord.

If the cells are dissociated into single cells, epithelial structures are disrupted, and rapid apoptosis is induced. The low viability of single cells restricts the passaging and expansion of hPSCs. Here, in order to enhance the single cell viability of hPSCs, we adopted an apoptotic strategy using the 30 Kc6 gene which inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis. With the expression of the 30 Kc6 gene in hiPSCs, no issues related to pluripotency or differentiation occurred. The hiPSC-30 Kc6 showed higher viability after the induction of apoptosis compared with control hiPSCs. Furthermore, hiPSC-30 Kc6 formed more colonies when the cells were enzymatically dissociated into single cells.

However, in the present study, a longer construct encompassing residues 63-302 appeared to form a single structural domain. This domain could be considered to adopt a functionally relevant fold, as the known specific binding of a dodecapeptide to this protein was evident. Hence, the residues 63-302 region rather than 63-244 can be regarded as a natively folded structural domain of CP2c. In addition, it was confirmed that zinc ions can bind to this putative DNA-binding domain of CP2c, which resulted in reduced stability of the protein.

The enzyme is of interest as a target of new, potential, narrow-spectrum antibiotics directed against multiresistant E. faecium. The kinetic mechanism of Asl(fm )has not been fully characterized. To determine it, a progress curve analysis of Asl(fm )catalytic process using pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase ATPase detection assay was performed. With an inspection of the shape of measured progress curves and the results of specific qualitative experiments, the Asl(fm )reaction mechanism was singled out. The proposed Asl(fm ) kinetics reaction scheme was evaluated by fitting the parameters of the corresponding differential equations to progress curves using the computer program ENZO. The complete kinetic analysis result is consistent with the substrate binding order 1) ATP, 2) D-Asp, and 3) UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The analysis suggests that slowly establishing non-productive equilibria between the free and ATP-bound enzyme with the participating pentapeptide are responsible for initial reaction burst followed by a steady-state period before the complete depletion of the reactant added in the lowest concentration.

The present work was focused on the structural and cytochemical organization of astrocytes in the SGZ of the rabbit hippocampal dentate fascia as studied by laser confocal microscopy. The study was carried out on the brain of adult Chinchilla rabbits compared to that of adult Wistar rats. Two morphological astrocyte types were identified in the rabbit SGZ: radial gliocyte-like (type I) and atypical fibrous astrocyte-like (type II) cells. By contrast, the rat SGZ exhibited a predominance of type II astrocytes which lacked long unramified processes penetrating through the granular layer and reaching the molecular layer. SGZ astrocytes, both in the rabbit and rat, were characterized by intense immunoreactivity for glutamine synthetase, most pronounced in the processes that formed the perivascular glia limitans. Importantly, the peculiarities of the astrocyte organization in the dentate fascia of the rabbit hippocampus allowed SGZ delimitation, whereas astrocytes in the rat SGZ exhibited no local morphological distinctions.

Here, we evaluated and described a novel approach for identifying filters for inline filtration of protein A eluates at pilot scale. We fractionated the protein A eluates into 0.25 column volume fractions to screen filters under constant pressure or constant flow conditions. We observed that filtration properties for eluate fractions are significantly different from the offline eluate, and the conventional filter sizing study using elution pool is not able to predict inline filtration behavior.

However, in addition to energy exchange, carbohydrates are also necessary for the posttranslational modification of the protein molecules. Cancer cells are often characterized by an enhanced expression of different glycoproteides. Correct glycosylation defines the structure and activity of such molecules. We demonstrated that under the same cultivation conditions, the intensity of glycosylation does not depend on the total number of potential O-glycosylation sites in one molecule. As a model for the investigation, the tandem repeat region (region with variable number of tandem repeats) of the human mucin MUC1, in which each of the repeats carries four potential O-glycosylation sites, was used. An increase of the tandem repeat number in the recombinant protein did not lead to a proportional increase in the level of sLe(a) glycosides. A consequence of this was a reduction in the number of recombinant proteins associated with the cytoplasmic membrane at an overall high expression level. Prolongation of the cultivation duration led to a reduction in the expression level of the recombinant proteins by up to 30% of the initial level, and the intensity of this reduction was in a direct ratio to the number of tandem repeats in the protein molecule.'},\n",

This study provides a method for recombinant gp16 protein synthesis and purification by the E.coli SUMO expression system, and here we report the structural envelope of the C terminal domain of gp16 obtained through small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technology. The gp16 C terminal domain gene was recombinantly expressed using the SUMO tag. The gp16 gene was flanked by an N-terminal 6His-SUMO tag and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. High purity target protein monomer was obtained by size exclusion chromatography. This brings the purity of the target protein to about 95%. Then the concentration of the target protein to 1.3 g/L, and the SAXS data were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) beamline BL19U. The resulting molecular envelop highly resembles the homologous protein FtsK, and the curves calculated by the CRYSOL software are highly coincident with the experimental curves. Through recombinant expression, purification and structure analysis, we obtained the solution structure of the gp16. Structural information derived from this study laid the foundation for future structural and functional research of gp16 C terminal, ultimately targeting the viral mechanisms for infection.'},\n",

However, excessive fear is not only detrimental to the survival of the individual, but also easy to cause mental illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, which seriously affects the quality of life. Clinically, exposure therapy based on behavioral findings is often used to treat fear-related diseases, but these symptoms often recur when the patient break away from the treatment environment. Therefore, the investigation of the information processing in the neural circuits related to fear memory is essential for understanding the occurrence and development of these diseases and establishing new treatments. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the brain regions associated with the extinction of fear memory mainly include the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In the process of fear extinction, these three brain regions show specific patterns of neural oscillations, and their activities are also synchronized, which constitute the neural basis for the successful extinction of fear memory. In the future, non-invasive brain stimulation based on oscillatory entrainment can be used to intervene the neural circuit and promote the extinction of fear memory and avoid the recurrence of fear, which provides new insights into the treatment of clinical fear-related disorders.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"With the development of high throughput technology, it has become feasible and common to profile tens of thousands of gene activities simultaneously. These genomic data typically have sample size of hundreds or fewer, which is much less than the feature size (number of genes). In addition, the genes, in particular the ones from the same pathway, are often highly correlated. These issues impose a great challenge for selecting meaningful genes from a large number of (correlated) candidates in many genomic studies. Quite a few methods have been proposed to attack this challenge. Among them, regularization-based techniques, e.g., lasso, become much more appealing, because they can do model fitting and variable selection at the same time. However, the lasso regression has its known limitations. One is that the number of genes selected by the lasso couldn't exceed the number of samples. Another limitation is that, if causal genes are highly correlated, the lasso tends to select only one or few genes from them. Biologists, however, desire to identify them all. To overcome these limitations, we present here a novel, robust, and stable variable selection method. Through simulation studies and a real application to the transcriptome data, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in selecting highly correlated causal genes. We also provide some theoretical justifications for this feature sampling strategy based on the mean and variance analyses.\"},\n",

However, whether EGR1 is a deleterious or protective factor in the AD is still controversial. In this present study, we constructed an overexpression plasmid, CMV-EGFP-EGR1-Kanamycin, and transfected it into U87MG cells to investigate the effects of EGR1 expression on amyloid-beta (1-40) peptide (A beta 40) levels. U87MG cells transfected by CMV-EGFP-EGR1-Kanamycin and CMV-EGFP-Kanamycin were assigned, respectively, to experimental and control groups. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe transfection efficiencies of the plasmids after 6 hours. EGR1 messenger RNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A beta 40 secretion was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of the amyloid precursor protein, beta-secretase enzyme, and presenilin 1 proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis.

Chemical derivatization was employed to introduce diastereomeric environments to the chiral compounds of interest, resulting in different abundance distribution patterns of fragment ions of the derivatization products of enantiomers in mass spectrometry. The quantitative information of the chiral compounds of interest was extracted from complex mass spectral data by an advanced calibration model derived based on the spectral shape deformation quantitative theory. The performance of the proposed method was tested on the quantitative analysis of R-propranolol in propranolol tablets. Experimental results demonstrated that it could achieve accurate and precise concentration ratio predictions for R-propranolol with an average relative predictive error (ARPE) of about 4%, considerably better than the corresponding results of the mass spectrometric method based on chemical derivatization and the univariate ratiometric model (ARPE: about 12%). The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the proposed method for the concentration ratio of R-propranolol were estimated to be 1.5% and 6.0%, respectively.

Even worse, meticulously assembled flow channels can be used only once for most experiments.

In this paper, we report a novel surface reconditioning strategy termed ERASE (Epitaxial Removal Aided by Strand Exchange) that allows a single flow cell to be used for vast repetition of single-molecule experiments. In this method, biomolecules immobilized to the surface through a nucleic acid duplex are liberated when a competing DNA strand disrupts the duplex via toehold-mediated strand displacement. We demonstrate the wide-range applicability of this method with various common surface preparation techniques, fluorescent dyes, and biomolecules including the bacterial ribosome. Beyond time and cost savings, we also show ERASE can assort molecules based on a nucleic acid barcode sequence, thus allowing experiments on different molecules in parallel.

Domains are the primary building blocks of protein structure and function. Independently, each domain can fulfill a single function, but most proteins (> 80% in Metazoa) exist as multi-domain proteins. Multiple domain units combine in various arrangements or architectures to create different functions and are often under evolutionary pressures to yield new ones. Thus, it is crucial to create gold standards reflecting the multi-domain complexity of real proteins to more accurately evaluate sequence searching tools.

'Active flow technology' (AFT) is known to greatly improve the performance of pristine columns, but is as of yet untested when used on columns that have degraded significantly. In this study AFT was used to regenerate a degraded column, where the reduced plate height and asymmetry values were 3.5 and 1.25 respectively. Once the AFT fittings were fitted to the column outlet and the flow segmentation ratio adjusted to 28% from the radial central exit port, the reduced plate height decreased to 2.0, and the bands were almost perfectly symmetrical with asymmetry factors equal to 1.04. Subsequently, the performance of the degraded column with AFT fittings provided performance that was comparable to that of a new conventional column fitted with traditional end fittings. The separation power of the degraded conventional column and that of the same column fitted with the AFT end fittings was then tested using the separation of oligostyrenes. In AFT mode, detection was undertaken at both the radial central exit port of the column and the peripheral exit port. The resulting separation that was achieved from the radial central exit port was superior to that observed on the conventional column, whereas, the separation observed from the peripheral port was very poor. It was subsequently determined that the reason for the degraded performance of the conventional column was a result of increased heterogeneity associated with the packing material in the wall region of the column.

This isoform, in addition to the enzymatic action common to all SODs, also shows special functional and structural properties, essentially due to the presence of a first leader peptide that allows the protein to enter easily into cells. Among endogenous antioxidants, SOD constitutes the first line of natural defence against pathological effects induced by an excess of free radicals. Here, we firstly describe the effects of our rMnSOD administration on the proliferant and malignant undifferentiated human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cell line. Moreover, we also test the effects of rMnSOD in the all trans retinoic-differentiated SK-N-BE neuron-like cells, a quiescent not malignant model. While rMnSOD showed an antitumor activity on proliferating cells, a poor sensitivity to rMnSOD overload in retinoid-differentiated neuron-like cells was observed. However, in the latter case, in presence of experimental-induced oxidative stress, overcharge of rMnSOD enhanced the oxidant effects, through an increase of H2O2 due to low activity of both catalase and glutathione peroxidase. In conclusion, our data show that rMnSOD treatment exerts differential effects, which depend upon both cell differentiation and redox balance, addressing attention to the potential use of the recombinant enzyme on differentiated neurons. These facts ultimately pave the way for further preclinical studies aimed at evaluation of rMnSOD effects in models of neurodegenerative diseases.'},\n",

We have observed the effects of Azolla in both fresh and dried forms. This work signifies the possible physiological changes of a crop plant by using Azolla as a bioremediator. In brief the herbicide 2,4-D is considered as stressor to rice plants and by applying the fresh and dried Azolla we investigate the changes occurred. The activities of different nitrogen metabolizing enzymes and reactive oxygen species were observed. On the other hand chlorophyll and carotenoids synthesis were retrieved by addition of fresh and dried Azolla mass over 2,4-D toxicity. Thus, the efficiency of fresh and dried Azolla mass was evaluated under herbicidal toxicity in rice. We evaluate the bio remediating role of Azolla plants against 2,4-D stress and conclude this species would also be supporting in supplementation of major nutrients to rice plants.'},\n",

EH are involved in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous epoxides, and thus have application in pharmacology and biotechnology. In this work, we describe the substrates and inhibitors selectivity of an epoxide hydrolase recently cloned from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei QM9414 (TrEH). We also studied the TrEH urea-based inhibitors effects in the fungal growth. TrEH showed high activity on radioative and fluorescent surrogate and natural substrates, especially epoxides from docosahexaenoic acid. Using a fluorescent surrogate substrate, potent inhibitors of TrEH were identified. Interestingly, one of the best compounds inhibit up to 60% of T. reesei growth, indicating an endogenous role for TrEH. These data make TrEH very attractive for future studies about fungal metabolism of fatty acids and possible development of novel drugs for human diseases.'},\n",

The two ligating histidines are of particular interest as they may influence the electronic and redox properties of the metal center. To test for the presence of reactive ligating histidines, a portion of cytochrome c oxidase from the bacteria Thermus thermophilus that contains the Cu-A site (the TtCu(A) protein) was treated with the chemical modifier diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) and the reaction followed through UV-visible, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies at pH 5.0-9.0. A mutant protein (H40A/H117A) with the non-ligating histidines removed was similarly tested. Introduction of an electron-withdrawing DEPC-modification onto the ligating histidine 157 of TtCu(A) increased the reduction potential by over 70mV, as assessed by cyclic voltammetry. Results from both proteins indicate that DEPC reacts with one of the two ligating histidines, modification of a ligating histidine raises the reduction potential of the Cu-A site, and formation of the DEPC adduct is reversible at room temperature. The existence of the reactive ligating histidine suggests that this residue may play a role in modulating the electronic and redox properties of TtCu(A) through kinetically-controlled proton exchange with the solvent. Lack of reactivity by the metalloproteins Sco and azurin, both of which contain a mononuclear copper center, indicate that reactivity toward DEPC is not a characteristic of all ligating histidines.'},\n",

Here we compared the patterns and concentrations found in larvae and pupae of L. anchusae and L. echii with those of the roots of their respective hosts, Symphytum officinale and Echium vulgare (Boraginaceae). PA patterns and concentrations in the roots were complex and variable, whereas those in the larvae and pupae were simpler and more constant. In L. anchusae, intermedine and lycopsamine were the dominant PAs even if they could not be detected in the roots. In L. echii simpler, hydrolized PAs prevailed. Overall, the concentrations of total PAs of larvae and pupae were significantly higher than those of the roots the larvae had been feeding on. Larvae and pupae of both species also had considerably higher PA concentrations than determined previously for field collected beetles. Possibly the rather immobile juvenile stages enjoy a better protection by higher PA concentrations. On the other hand, we could not detect PAs in eggs of either species, indicating that transmission of appreciable amounts of PAs from mother to offspring does not occur.'},\n",

At least 25 athletes have exceeded this concentration and some after inhaling no more than the permitted daily maximum dose of 1600 mu g. However, there is concern that some providing expert evidence and tribunal members hearing such cases are unaware of the occasional unpredictability of the pharmacokinetics of beta-2 agonists. The World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA's) change from 1 March 2018 to allow correction of urinary specific gravity (SG) down to 1.020 for prohibited substances with a urinary threshold is a major advance and will assist in some instances. However, future cases are anticipated to occur when athletes unexpectedly exceed the urinary threshold for salbutamol after inhaling no more than the allowable dose and within WADA's stated time frame. They will then be required to appear before doping tribunals. The rapidity by which salbutamol is inhaled can influence the resultant urinary concentration and is yet to be addressed adequately in WADA's 2019 Prohibited List. The list's recommended pharmacokinetic study fails to replicate the circumstances that prevailed when the athlete was competing and the adverse analytical finding (AAF) occurred. Tribunals, and experts who advise them, need to be cognizant that the urinary concentration of salbutamol does not invariably reflect the inhaled dose and that a high urinary salbutamol concentration is not always ipso facto evidence of super-dosing with inhaled salbutamol.\"},\n",

Input data may originate from various types of spectra, depending on the ultimate goal: these may result from experiments based on triple-resonance pulse sequences, or on TOCSY or NOESY sequences, or mixtures thereof. Flexible refers to the free choice of spectra for the joint decompositions depending on the purpose: assignments, structure, dynamics, interactions. Scalable means that the approach is open to the addition of similar or different experiments, e.g. larger proteins may require a wider selection of triple-resonance based experiments. Central to the proposed approach is the mutual support among the different spectra during the spectral analysis: for example, sparser triple-resonance spectra may help decomposing (separating) spin systems in a TOCSY or identifying unique NOEs. In the example presented, backbone plus side chain assignments of ubiquitin were obtained from the combination of either two or three of the following projection experiments: a 4D HCCCONH, a 4D HNCACO and a 3D HNCACB. In all cases, TOCSY data (4D HCCCONH) proved crucial not only for the side chain assignments, but also for the sequential assignment. Even when total recording time was reduced to about 10 h, nearly complete assignments were obtained, with very few missing assignments and even fewer differences to a reference.'},\n",

Snu114 has a highly conserved domain structure that resembles that of the GTPase EF-2/EF-G in the ribosome. It has been suggested that the regulatory function of Snu114 in activation of the spliceosome is mediated by its C-terminal region, however, there has been only limited characterisation of the interactions of the C-terminal domains.

The role for Emx2 is best understood within the context of the development of the neocortical region of the cortex, where Emx2 is expressed in a high posterior-medial to low anterior-lateral gradient that regulates the partitioning of the neocortex into different functional fields that perform discrete computational tasks. Despite several lines of evidence demonstrating an Emx2 concentration-dependent mechanism for establishing functional areas within the developing neocortex, little is known about how Emx2 physically carries out this role. Although several binding partners for Emx2 have been identified (including Sp8, eIF4E, and Pbx1), no screens have been used to identify potential protein binding partners for this protein. We utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen using a library constructed from embryonic mouse cDNA in an attempt to identify novel binding partners for Emx2.

Previous research using automatic spindle detection algorithms often lacks systematic parameter variations and validations. New Method: We present a method to systematically tune and validate algorithm parameters in automatic spindle detection algorithms using a moderate number of human raters. Results: Comparing a Hilbert transform-based algorithm to a ground truth constructed by six human raters, this method produced a parameter set yielding an F1 score of 0.82 at 10 ms resolution. The algorithm performance fell within the range of human agreement with the ground truth. Both human and algorithm failures arose largely from disagreement in spindle boundaries rather than spindle occurrence. With no additional tuning, the algorithm performed similarly in recordings from different days or rats. Comparison with existing methods: Most spindle detection algorithms do not perform systematic parameter variations and validation using a ground truth. To our knowledge, our study is the first in which rodent spindle data is scored by humans, and in which an automatic spindle detection algorithm is evaluated with respect to this ground truth. The rodent data from this study make it possible to compare our algorithm with others previously tested on human data. Conclusions: We present a general ground truth based approach for the tuning and validation of spindle extraction algorithms and suggest that algorithms aimed at extracting precise spindle timing in rats should use a systematic approach for parameter tuning.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Motivation: For the design of genetic studies, it is necessary to perform power calculations. Although for Mendelian traits the power of detecting linkage for pedigree(s) can be determined, it is also of great interest to determine the probability of identifying multiple pedigrees or unrelated cases with variants in the same gene. For many diseases, due to extreme locus heterogeneity this probability can be small. If only one family is observed segregating a variant classified as likely pathogenic or of unknown significance, the gene cannot be implicated in disease etiology. The probability of identifying several disease families or cases is dependent on the gene-specific disease prevalence and the sample size. The observation of multiple disease families or cases with variants in the same gene as well as evidence of pathogenicity from other sources, e.g. in silico prediction, expression and functional studies, can aid in implicating a gene in disease etiology. MendelProb can determine the probability of detecting a minimum number of families or cases with variants in the same gene. It can also calculate the probability of detecting genes with variants in different data types, e.g. identifying a variant in at least one family that can establish linkage and more the two additional families regardless of their size. Additionally, for a specified probability MendelProb can determine the number of probands which need to be screened to detect a minimum number of individuals with variants within the same gene. Results: A single Mendelian disease family is not sufficient to implicate a gene in disease etiology. It is necessary to observe multiple families or cases with potentially pathogenic variants in the same gene. MendelProb, an R library, was developed to determine the probability of observing multiple families and cases with variants within a gene and to also establish the numbers of probands to screen to detect multiple observations of variants within a gene.'},\n",

For C. lunulatus from Hawaii CYP2 and CYP3 levels were 1 to 20-fold higher than C. lunulatus from Australia, possibly due to their predominant prey in Hawaii (Porities spp.) being richer in allelochemicals. UGT, GST and epoxide hydrolase varied between species and location and did not correspond to any specific dietary preference or location.

In addition, compounds with halogens in the ortho position, such as compounds 2 and 6, and a substitution with an acetyl group in the para position (compound 13) were less active. The role of the ABC efflux pump Bctr B-type as a defense mechanism of B. cinerea against these naphthalentrione derivatives was analyzed. This pump could be involved in the detoxification of compounds 2, 6, and 13. On the contrary, this mechanism would not participate in the detoxification of compounds 1, 7, 9 and 12. Finally, the biotransformation of compound 7 by B. cinerea was studied. A mixture of two biotransformed products was obtained. One of them was compound 7A, which is reduced at C1 and C4, compared to compound 7. The other product of biotransformation, 7B, is oxidized at C7.'},\n",

Targeting small molecules to astrocytes in the presence of the many other cell types in the brain will provide useful tools for their visualization and manipulation. Herein, we explore the functional consequences of synthetic modifications to a recently described astrocyte marker composed of a bright rhodamine-based fluorophore and an astrocyte-targeting moiety. We altered the nature of the targeting moiety to probe the dependence of astrocyte targeting on hydrophobicity, charge, and pK(a) when exposed to astrocytes and neurons isolated from the mouse cortex. We found that an overall molecular charge of +2 and a targeting moiety with a heterocyclic aromatic amine are important requirements for specific and robust astrocyte labeling. These results provide a basis for engineering astrocyte-targeted molecular tools with unique properties, including metabolite sensing or optogenetic control.\"},\n",

The expression levels of PEPCK were remarkably up-regulated in the liver tissues of HBXIP-/- mice. Then, we validated that HBXIP expressions were negatively correlated with those of PEPCK in 30 clinical liver tissues. Mechanistically, luciferase reporter gene assays and ChIP assays showed that HBXIP could inhibit the expression PEPCK at transcription level.

Our hypothesis is that acid quenching of acridine orange by AeBBMVw is predominantly mediated by Na+/H+ antiport via the NHA1 component of the AeBBMVw in the absence of amino acids and ATP. AeNHA1 is a Na+/H+ antiporter that has been postulated to exchange Na+ and H+ across the apical plasma membrane in posterior midgut of A. aegypti larvae. Its principal function is to recycle the H+ and Na+ that are transported during amino acid uptake, e.g., phenylalanine. This uptake is mediated, in part, by a voltage-driven, Na+-coupled, nutrient amino acid transporter (AeNAT8). The voltage is generated by an H+ V-ATPase. All three components, V-ATPase, antiporter, and nutrient amino acid transporter (VAN), are present in brush border membrane vesicles isolated from whole larvae of A. aegypti. By omitting ATP and amino acids, Na+/H+ antiport was measured by fluorescence quenching of acridine orange (AO) caused by acidification of either the internal vesicle medium (Na-in(+) > Na-out(+)) or the external fluid-membrane interface (Na-in(+) < Na-out(+)). Vesicles with 100 micromolar Na+ inside and 10 micromolar Na+ outside or with 0.01 micromolar Na+ inside and 100 micromolar Na+ outside quenched fluorescence of AO by as much as 30%. Acidification did not occur in the absence of AeBBMVw.

Methods: FOLR1 mRNA expression data of ovarian cancer were retrieved from the Oncomine database and further analyzed by comparing tumor to healthy tissue. The prognostic value of FOLR1 in ovarian cancer was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier Plotter, an online survival analysis database. Results A total of 439 studies were included in the Oncomine database in multiple types of cancers. Of the 439 studies, there were 54 with statistical differences for the expression of FOLR1, 19 with increased expression of FOLR1 and 35 with decreased expression comparing ovarian cancer to normal ovary tissue. After searching the Oncomine database, six datasets were discovered comparing the mRNA expression in ovarian tumor to healthy tissue. FOLR1 mRNA expression in ovarian tumor was significantly higher than that of normal ovarian tissue (all p<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier Plotter database analyzed the correlation between FOLR1 expression and ovarian cancer patient's prognosis.

Moreover, the crystal is stationary during the femtosecond pulse, so reflections are generally only partially recorded. Therefore, each XFEL diffraction image must be scaled individually and, ideally, corrected for partiality prior to merging. An additional complication may arise owing to indexing ambiguities when the symmetry of the Bravais lattice is higher than that of the space group, or when the unit-cell dimensions are similar to each other. Here, an automated method is presented that diagnoses these indexing ambiguities based on the Brehm-Diederichs algorithm [Brehm & Diederichs (2014), Acta Cryst.

This method was applied to an XFEL diffraction data set measured from crystals of the neuronal SNARE-complexin-1-synaptotagmin-1 complex.

Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used for separating free sperm proteins and complexes of DNA fragment/sperm proteins. A distinct band was found after Coomassie blue staining, and seven potential proteins were identified by mass spectrometry analysis. An analysis of the physical/chemical properties of the seven proteins revealed that the sperm inner acrosomal membrane protein IAM38 (IAM38) matched the features of the DBPs. Western blotting analysis showed that the IAM38 and CD4 were present in the sperm but not in the seminal plasma. Blocking of the IAM38 impaired the DNA-binding capacity of the sperm. Blocking the CD4 decreased the DNA-uptake capacity of the sperm but did not influence the DNA-binding capacity of the sperm. Moreover, the EGFP-positive embryos and EGFP-positive blastocysts were also decreased after IAM38 blocking or CD4 blocking in comparison with the control group.

Various effectors such as tetracycline (Tc) and doxycycline (Dox) quickly induce or shut down gene expression, but reversing gene expression has not been eligible due to long half-lives of such effectors. Here, we found that procaspase activating compound 1 (PAC-1) rapidly reduces transient expression of TetR-regulated green fluorescent protein (GFP) in mammalian cells. Next, we applied PAC-1 to control of expression of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) protein, whose downstream cellular events can be monitored by cell morphological changes. We observed that PAC-1 quickly reduces TRPM7 expression, consequently affecting cell morphology regulated by TRPM7.

It was based on measuring the CC signal of methanol released from an aqueous solution during the temperature increasing. When the temperature of AKD MP reached, the AKD granules floated on the surface aqueous solution was liquidized and completely isolated the methanol transfer from the solution to the headspace. Thus, a transition point, corresponding to the MP of AKD wax, was observed when plotting the GC signal of methanol vs. the temperature. The results showed that the method has a good measurement precision (RSD <0.68%) and accuracy (the relative differences were < 7.16%, compared to a reference method). The present method is simple, accurate and particularly suitable to be used in the batch sample testing. This new measurement concept can be also adopted to many related applications.

In the current study, in addition to confirming its antiapoptotic function in neuronal survival, we demonstrated that the spatial-temporal expression profile of B23 during development of hippocampal neurons is high in the embryonic stage, down-regulated after birth, and preferentially localized at the tips of growing neuritis and branching points. Overexpression of B23 promotes axon growth with abundant branching points in growing hippocampal neurons, but depletion of B23 impairs axon growth, leading to neuronal death. Following injury to the trisynaptic path in hippocampal slice, overexpression of B23 remarkably increased the number and length of regenerative fibers in the mossy fiber path. Our study suggests that B23 expression in developing neurons is essential for neuritogenesis and axon growth and that up-regulation of B23 may be a strategy for enhancing the reconstitution of synaptic paths after injury to hippocampal synapses.

Dysregulation of these cellular processes is associated with ineffective myofiber repair and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins leading to fibrosis. PI3K/Akt signaling is a critical integrator of intra- and intercellular signals connecting nutrient availability to cell survival and growth. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in skeletal muscle leads to hypertrophic growth and a reversal of the changes in body composition associated with obesity and advanced age. Though the molecular mechanisms mediating these effects are incompletely understood, changes in paracrine signaling are thought to play a key role. Here, we utilized modified RNA to study the biological role of the transient translocation of Akt to the myonuclei of maturing myotubes.

This approach may potentially miss some truly functional genes if both its low and high modes have associations with end-point observation. Such genes act as both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, a scenario that is unlikely but theoretically possible.ResultsWe invented an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to divide patients into low-, middle- and high-expressing groups according to the expression level of a certain gene in both tumor and normal patients. We found one gene, ORMDL3, whose low and high modes were both associated with worse survival and higher tumor grade in breast cancer patients in multiple patient cohorts. We speculate that its tumor suppressor gene role may be real, while its high expression correlating with worse end-point outcome is probably due to the passenger event of the nearby ERBB2's amplification.ConclusionsThe proposed EM algorithm can effectively detect genes having tri-modal distributed expression in patient groups compared to normal genes, thus rendering a new perspective on dissecting the association between genomic features and end-point observations. Our analysis of breast cancer datasets suggest that the gene ORMDL3 may have an unexploited tumor suppressive function.\"},\n",

Labile Hb A(1c) can then undergo slow, largely irreversible, formation of stable Hb A(1c) (the Amadori product). Stable Hb A(1c) is measured to assess diabetic progression after labile Hb A(1c) removal. This study aimed to increase the understanding of the distinctions between labile and stable Hb A(1c) from a mechanistic perspective in the presence of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate is an effector reagent that reversibly binds in the Hb A(1c) pocket and modestly enhances overall NEG rate. The deprotonation of C2 on labile Hb A(1c) in the formation of the Amadori product was previously proposed to be rate-limiting. Computational chemistry was used here to identify the mechanism(s) by which 2,3-BPG facilitates the deprotonation of C2 on labile Hb A(1c). 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate is capable of abstracting protons on C2 and the alpha-nitrogen of labile Hb A(1c) and can also deprotonate water and/or amino acid residues, therefore preparing these secondary reagents to deprotonate labile Hb A(1c). Parallel reactions not leading to an Amadori product were found that include formation of the neutral Schiff base, dissociation of glucose from the protein, and cyclic glycosylamine formation.

The current studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of complex III inhibition in the SH-SY5Y cell line to delineate the molecular and cellular processes, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of HD. Method: We treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with AntA in order to establish an in vitro mitochondrial dysfunction model for HD. Differential proteome analysis was performed by the nLC-MS/MS system. Protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis. Results: Thirty five differentially expressed proteins as compared to the vehicle-treated controls were detected. Functional pathway analysis indicated that proteins involved in ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway were up-regulated in AntA-treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and the ubiquitinated protein accumulation was confirmed by immunoblotting. We found that Prothymosin alpha (ProT alpha) was down-regulated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein expression was co-regulated with ProT alpha expression, hence knockdown of ProT alpha in SH-SY5Y cells decreased Nrf2 protein level. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that complex III impairment might downregulate ubiquitin-proteasome function and NRF2/Keapl antioxidant response. In addition, it is likely that downregulation of Nrf2 is due to the decreased expression of ProT alpha in AntA-treated SH-SY5Y cells.

The resulting copolymers are colored and exhibited high thermal stability as shown from their TGA curves. The investigated copolymers exhibited comparable thermal stability as that of PAN. The AN/itaconic acid Co(NO3)(2) copolymer was considerably the most thermal stable copolymer while that of Ni(II) copolymer was the less stable one. Cu(II) copolymer showed an intermediate stability.

Diagnosis of the BD mechanism was performed by SI Zeeman (mainly from the ground state 1s to 2p+1 and other excitation states) and cyclotron resonance photoelectric spectroscopy (PES) methods in the wide interval of the electric field including the BD region too. The obtained results reveal that the BD electric field epsilon BD does not correlate with K and the carrier's mobility of the samples, which contradict to the well-known impact ionization mechanism (IIM). A serious discrepancy with IIM is that epsilon BD does not almost depend on the magnetic field up to H=6.5T when epsilon though the SI ionization energy increases two times. The cyclotron resonance (CR) measurements show that the line width does not depend on the electric field for epsilon<epsilon BD, indicating the lack of free-carrier (FC) heating in contradiction with IIM. A considerable decrease of the free carriers' capture cross section (CCS) area by ionized SI centers with a subsequent increase in the FC concentration n is observed by means of PES investigation of the 1s?2p+1 and CR lines in the electric fields epsilon epsilon BD and at different magnetic fields, applied along (H close=) the electric field or perpendicular (H perpendicular to epsilon) to the electric field. The slope of the 1s?2p+1 line intensity on the electric field for epsilon > does not depend on the magnetic field, which is valid for epsilon BD too. Various effects determined in the PES measurements at epsilon=epsilon BD, such as a drastic narrowing of the 1s?2p+1 and CR lines, a shift of the CR line to higher magnetic fields, and disappearing of the lines to higher excited SI states, were clarified to be a result of screening of the SI Coulomb potential by free carriers. The FC screening at the BD reduces the potential fluctuation and its influence to the PES line shape of 1s?2p+1 and other excited states. It is shown that an increase in the FC concentration reduces the CCS, which can be assumed as the main factor along with the increase in the ionization coefficient for the SI breakdown in the electric field. The screening length rs of the SI Coulomb potential decreases with the increasing FC concentration, reducing the CCS; the latter seems to vanish completely at rs=aB (aB is the effective Bohr radius), when high screening results in vanishing of all the bound states of the Coulomb potential. Note that this limit is similar to the Mott transition. Many experimental facts and our calculation of the CCS support the suggested mechanism for the SI breakdown. The well-known IIM is valid for samples with SI concentrations N<<1013cm-3 and takes place at very high electric fields.\"},\n",

However, certain unicellular microorganisms, such as Giardia duodenalis, lack these proteins. Thus, other cysteine proteases may play an important role in the parasite apoptosis signaling pathway. Objective: To understand the effect of cathepsin B-like inhibition on the cell viability of Giardia duodenalis and its cell death process. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify apoptotic proteases. Analysis showed that cathepsin B-like protease genes from G. duodenalis were the best candidate. A homology modeling technique was used to explore in silico the inhibitory effect of E-64 against cathepsin B-like proteases from G. duodenalis genome and to examine the effect of curcumin on cathepsin B-like activity regulation. In addition, the effect of E-64 on parasite survival and DNA fragmentation was tested. Results: Eight cathepsin B-like protease coding genes were identified in silico. Interestingly, while these sequences lacked the cathepsin B characteristic occluding loop, they maintained the catalytic active-site responsible for cathepsin B activity, which was evidenced by the increase in the degradation of the Z-RR-AMC substrate, suggesting the upregulation of the activity of these proteins. Additionally, inhibition of E-64 against G. duodenalis trophozoites caused a decrease in DNA fragmentation compared to control cells and had a positive effect on parasite survival after exposure to curcumin. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggested that Giardia duodenalis might have a cell death mechanism in which cathepsin B-like proteases play an important role.'},\n",

In addition in vitro activity of this enzyme was tested in the presence of four different sulfonylureaberbicides and the feedback regulation of enzyme was analyzed in the presence of branched amino acids. Methods: The gene encoding catalytic subunit of rice AHAS (cOsAHAS) without part of the chloroplast transit sequence was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET41a and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as carboxy-terminal extensions of glutathione-S-transferase (GST).The soluble protein was purified using affinity chromatography. The measurement of GST-OsAHAS activity was performed under optimized conditions at present of branched-chain amino acids and sulfonylurea herbicides independently. Results: The optimum pH and temperature for GST-cOsAHAS activity was 8.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The specific activity and Km value of this enzyme toward pyruvate were 0.08 U/mg and 30 mM, respectively.GST-cOsAHAS was inhibited by herbicides tribenuron, sulfosulfuron, nicosulfiiron and bensulfuron while the enzyme was insensitivieto end products. Conclusion: These results suggest that the recombinant form of GST-cOsAHAS is functionally active and carries the binding site for sulfynylurea herbicides.

Using the GPU to accelerate MSA has shown to be an effective approach. Moreover, there is a trend that many bioinformatic researchers or institutes setup a shared server for remote users to submit MSA jobs via provided web-pages or tools. Objective: Given the fact that different MSA jobs submitted by users often process similar datasets, there can be an opportunity for users to share their computation results between each other, which can avoid the redundant computation and thereby reduce the overall computing time. Furthermore, in the heterogeneous CPU/GPU platform, many existing applications assign their computation on GPU devices only, which leads to a waste of the CPU resources. Co-run computation can increase the utilization of computing resources on both CPUs and GPUs by dispatching workloads onto them simultaneously. Methods: In this paper, we propose an efficient MSA system called GMSA for multi-users on shared heterogeneous CPU/GPU platforms. To accelerate the computation of jobs from multiple users, data sharing is considered in GMSA due to the fact that different MSA jobs often have a percentage of the same data and tasks. Additionally, we also propose a scheduling strategy based on the similarity in datasets or tasks between MSA jobs. Furthermore, co-run computation model is adopted to take full use of both CPUs and GPUs. Results: We use four protein datasets which were redesigned according to different similarity. We compare GMSA with ClustalW and CUDA-ClustalW in multiple users scenarios. Experiments results showed that GMSA can achieve a speedup of up to 32X. Conclusion: GMSA is a system designed for accelerating the computation of MSA jobs with shared input datasets on heterogeneous CPU/GPU platforms. In this system, a strategy was proposed and implemented to find the common datasets among jobs submitted by multiple users, and a scheduling algorithm is presented based on it. To utilize the overall resource of both CPU and GPU, GMSA employs the co-run computation model. Results showed that it can speed up the total computation of jobs efficiently.'},\n",

Initially developed for the genome-wide screening of chromosomal imbalances, that is, copy-number variations in tumor cells, both CGH and array CGH have been employed in genotoxicology and most recently in toxicogenomics. The latter allows a multi-end point analysis of how particular genes react to toxic agents, revealing changes in signaling pathways and other underlying molecular mechanisms. This chapter provides background on the use of CGH and array CGH in the context of genotoxicology, and also a protocol for conventional CGH, so that the basic principles of this methodology can be better understood. Conventional and array CGH investigate DNA expression patterns, copy-number variations across the whole genome, and loss of heterozygosity after genotoxic damage. Array CGH is still cost-intensive but produces exponentially more data, requiring suitable analytical algorithms and sophisticated bioinformatic analysis.

The most important factor is the parameters of demand for innovative objects of different nature. It is these parameters that determine the strategy of a small innovative enterprise (MIP) during periods of recession, depression, and economic activity in the country. So, for example, let us ask ourselves what strategy MIP should use during the recession, what products of its activity should it bring to the market? The most common answer to this question is that it is necessary to bring to the market innovations of only incremental nature at extremely low prices. This is explained by a decrease in the level of income of the population due to rising unemployment, bankruptcy of enterprises and other reasons. At the same time, this approach does not take into account the most important factor - the stratification of the population by income level. Having estimated the degree of this stratification, MIP can significantly change its strategy. For such an assessment, you can use the well-known Ginny coefficient. The Ginny coefficient (income concentration index) characterizes the degree of deviation of the actual distribution of monetary incomes of the population from the line of their uniform distribution. The value of the coefficient can vary from 0 to 1, at the same time, the higher the value of the indicator, the more unevenly distributed income in the society. During the recession, the degree of population stratification in the Russian Federation has grown. Thus, according to the data of the State Statistics Committee of the Russian Federation in 2018, the Ginny coefficient indicates an increase in the degree of population stratification by income level, and therefore, in terms of demand parameters for objects of innovation of a different nature.'},\n",

Trace elements (selenium, zinc, iron) were measured in serum samples at the same time, so we got individual data sets for each patient. Results: Patients with normal PA > 5.0 degrees have a significantly better survival (p = 0.016).

The lowest and basically equal K-d values were determined for GAPDH and pyruvate kinase complexes with immobilized A(1-42) and A(25-35). The presence of 100 mu M isatin caused a significant (more than fivefold) increase in the K-d values for GAPDH complexes with all A peptides except A(1-28).

However, there are situations where this method produces suboptimal results. In these cases electrophoresis in the presence of positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) may work considerably better. Methods for electrophoresis and staining of such gels are presented.'},\n",

Their output has also increased substantially and, perhaps most importantly, their significance is now broadly accepted. This growth in the use of methods for applying mechanical strain to bone and its constituent cells and increased awareness of the importance of the mechanical environment in controlling normal bone cell behavior has indeed heralded new therapeutic approaches. We have expanded the text to include additions and modifications made to the straining apparatus and updated the research cited to support this growing role of cell cultures, including co-culture systems and primary cells, tissue engineering, and organ culture models to analyze responses of bone cells to mechanical stimulation. We understand that there are approaches not covered here and appreciate that alternative strategies have their own value and utility.'},\n",

At the global, or \"20,000 ft\" view bioinformatic analyses of NR signaling can measure how the NRs are implicated in human health and disease through the impact of genome-wide significant genetic variation, family-wide NR expression patterns or considering where NRs are significantly identified in other high-dimensional data analyses. With a more NR-centric, or \"2000 ft\" view, bioinformatic approaches can interrogate events downstream of a given NR. Integrative approaches aim to combine multiple NR-centric high-dimensional data both derived in cell models and primary human tissue to reveal how NR-transcriptional networks relate to human health and disease. Bioinformatic approaches to such high-dimensional data are central and require specialist statistical insight and computational skills, coupled with a dexterous understanding of the biological question. A current challenge is determining the optimal mechanism to share such bioinformatic approaches through the biological research community.'},\n",

Alterations in the function or expression of Ca2+-handling proteins are common findings in failing cardiomyocytes, which have been linked to impaired contractility and detrimental remodeling of the cellular structure. For these reasons, the study of intracellular Ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes represents a central method in experimental molecular cardiology.'},\n",

Targeted metabolomics allows for quantitative analysis of metabolites, providing kinetic information of production and consumption rates, an essential step to investigate microbial metabolism. Here, we describe a targeted metabolomics protocol for yeast samples, from sample preparation to mass spectrometry analysis, which enables the identification of metabolic fluxes after xylose consumption. Sample preparation methods were optimized for quenching of yeast metabolism followed by intracellular metabolite extraction, using cold methanol and boiling ethanol protocols. Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) methods using ion pair chromatography (IPC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) allowed for the quantitation of 18 metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle). The protocol here described was successfully applied to quantify metabolites in Scheffersomyces stipitis, Spathaspora passalidarum, Spathaspora arborariae, and Candida tenuis samples after xylose consumption.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'IgG(4) and its role in immune tolerance has been investigated widely. Symptom reduction and improved clinical outcomes in immunotherapy trials are associated with significant increases in allergen-specific IgG(4) antibodies. Natural immune tolerance observed in beekeepers and cat owners has also been associated with elevated levels of bee venom and cat allergen-specific IgG(4), respectively. Functionally, allergen-specific IgG(4) has been shown to reduce the binding of IgE-allergen complexes to B cells, a key step in the initiation of the type 1 hypersensitivity allergic response. In laboratory animal allergy, IgG(4) has been described as a \"protective/blocking\" antibody. However, a consensus on the exact relationship between exposure, IgG(4), and tolerance has yet to be reached. In this chapter, we review the factors that require consideration when developing an ELISA for the quantification of allergen-specific IgG(4).'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The discovery of biomarkers is considered a critical step towards an improved clinical management of psychiatric disorders. Despite the availability of advanced computational approaches, the lack of strong individual predictors of clinically relevant outcomes, combined with the usually high dimensionality, significantly hamper the identification of such markers. Consistent with the often observed lack of diagnostic specificity of biological alterations, research suggests an underlying genetic pleiotropy between psychiatric illnesses and frequently comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular illnesses. As research is transitioning away from conventional diagnostic delineations towards a dimensional understanding of psychiatric illness, gaining insight into such pleiotropy and its downstream biological effects bears promise for identification of clinically useful biomarkers. In this review, we summarize the computational methods for identifying biological markers indexing pleiotropic effects and discuss recent research findings in this context.'},\n",

The study of the regulation and function of ESCRT-III proteins is therefore crucial to understand these events and requires a combination of in vivo and in vitro experimental techniques. Here we describe two protocols for the purification of human and Drosophila ESCRT-III proteins from bacteria and their use in in vitro phosphorylation assays and atomic force microscopy experiments on membrane lipid bilayers. These protocols can also be applied for the purification of other proteins that are insoluble when expressed in bacteria.'},\n",

Protecting flora from the effects of IR released from a nuclear industry of increasing global significance and managing the growth of plants during space flight both necessitate estimating the effects of chronic low dose-rate exposure to IR. In contrast to effects at acute high-dose rates, under chronic low dose-rate exposure it is subtle, progressive, long-term effects on antioxidant systems that it is important to estimate. Here, we outline a method that combines biochemical measurement and mathematical modeling to predict the effects of chronic low dose-rate IR on redox potential in plant cells over time.'},\n",
