Theoretical calculations reveal that the guest encapsulation within MPP5 is spontaneous and the conformer showing X weakly bound to pentyl rim of MPP5 is favoured over its other conformer wherein it interacts with methyl rim of the host. The noncovalent interactions namely C-H-pi, C-H-X and H\\\\-H prevail over C- H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding in the complexes of MPP5. The manifestations of these to vibrational spectra obtained from the present theory are discussed. The strength of host-guest binding further is shown to correlate well with weakening of the C-X bond through natural bond orbital analyses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'},\n",

We questioned whether a similar phenomenon could occur prenatally, in chicken embryos at mid- (Ell, out of 20.5 days) or near end(E18) incubation. (V) over dot(O2) was measured with an open-flow system in the sequence of normoxia-normothermia (21%O- (2), 37 degrees C, 30 min), hypoxia in normothermia (Hx-NT, either 18, 15, 12 or 9% O-2, 37 degrees C, 1 hour), hypoxia in hyperthermia (Hx-HT, up to 43 degrees C, 1 hour) and return to normoxia-normothermia (30 min). During Hx-NT (V) over dot(O2) invariably decreased in a [O-2]-dependent fashion. The hypoxic drop in (V) over dot(O2) did not require a post-hypoxic payment of the O-2-debt, implying that the decrease in (V) over dot(O2) reflected hypometabolism. (V) over dot(O2) did not differ significantly between Hx-HT and Hx-NT for [O-2] = 15% or less, as expected by O-2-conformism. Differently, with milder hypoxia (18% O-2), (V) over dot(O2) during Hx-HT significantly exceeded that in Hx-NT, meaning that the value of (V) over dot(O2)( )in Hx-NT was not limited by O-2 supply. We conclude that a phenomenon of hypoxic (V) over dot(O2)( )downregulation like that observed in postnatal mammals can occur also prenatally, in the chicken embryos. The mechanisms at the basis of the downregulation remain unresolved and could combine physiological and cellular processes.'},\n",

Extracting spatial and temporal joint, partially-joint, and individual sources of multi-subject datasets is of significant importance to analyze common and cross information of multiple subjects. New method: We present a new framework to extract these three types of spatial and temporal sources in multisubject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. In this framework, temporal and spatial independent component analysis are utilized, and a weighted sum of higher-order cumulants is maximized. Results: We evaluate the presented algorithm by analyzing simulated data and one real multi-subject fMRI dataset. Our results on the real dataset are consistent with the existing meta-analysis studies. We show that spatial and temporal jointness of extracted joint and partially-joint sources in the theory of mind regions of brain increase with the age of subjects. Comparison with existing method: In Richardson et al. (2018), predefined regions of interest (ROI) have been used to analyze the real dataset, whereas our unified algorithm simultaneously extracts activated and uncorrelated ROIs, and determines their spatial and temporal jointness without additional computations. Conclusions: Extracting temporal and spatial joint and partially joint sources in a unified algorithm improves the accuracy of joint analysis of the multi-subject fMRI dataset.'}]"
