1,"This letter investigates the optimal tradeoff between user experience and communications and computation resource consumptions in designing efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) systems which are based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and operating in time division duplexing (TDD) mode. First, we establish a communication model for offloading scalable tasks in TDD-OFDMA systems.

5,"China, who was in charge of most of the poloidal field (PF) conductor unit lengths manufacturing for the ITER Project, has supplied all the required PF conductors and finished the PF package successfully. Around 130 t of NbTi strands were supplied and used for the PF conductors. During the package execution process, the Chinese Domestic Agency (CNDA) has organized the verification for the NbTi strand acceptance tests based on the requirements of the ITER procurement arrangement (PA). The verification tasks for NbTi strands were undertaken by the Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP). In total, about 550 billets of NbTi strands have been verified and supplied for the PF conductors. The verification levels fit the ITER PA requirements. The test results showed that the quality of the NbTi strands has been well controlled. In addition, in order to supply essential data for the conductor performance prediction and analysis, a full critical current I-c characterization of the NbTi strands, which requires a measurement of I-c versus field, B and temperature, T, has been obtained using the test facilities from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and ASIPP.

6,"Several deterministic models have been proposed in the literature to solve the machine loading problem (MLP), which considers a set of product types to be produced on a set of machines using a set of tool types, and determines the quantity of each product type to be produced at each time period and the corresponding machine tool loading configuration. However, processing times are subject to random increases, which could impair the quality of a deterministic solution. Thus, we propose a robust MLP counterpart, searching for an approach that properly describes the uncertainty set of model parameters and, at the same time, ensures practical application. We exploit the cardinality-constrained approach, which considers a simple uncertainty set where all uncertain parameters belong to an interval, and allows tuning the robustness level by bounding the number of parameters that assume the worst value. The resulting plans provide accurate estimations on the minimum production level that a system achieves even in the worst conditions. The applicability of the robust MLP and the impact of robustness level have been tested on several problem variants, considering single- vs multi-machine and single vs multi-period MLPs. We also consider the execution of the plans in a set of scenarios to evaluate the practical implications of MLP robustness. Results show the advantages of the robust formulation, in terms of improved feasibility of the plans, identification of the most critical tools and products, and evaluation of the maximum achievable performance in relation to the level of protection. Moreover, low computational times guarantee the applicability of the proposed robust MLP counterpart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Patient video taken at home can provide valuable insights into the recovery progress during a programme of physical therapy, but is very time consuming for clinician review. Our work focussed on (i) enabling any patient to share information about progress at home, simply by sharing video and (ii) building intelligent systems to support Physical Therapists (PTs) in reviewing this video data and extracting the necessary detail. This paper reports the development of the system, appropriate for future clinical use without reliance on a technical team, and the clinician involvement in that development. We contribute an interactive content-based video retrieval system that significantly reduces the time taken for clinicians to review videos, using human head movement as an example. The system supports query-by-movement (clinicians move their own body to define search queries) and retrieves the essential fine-grained movements needed for clinical interpretation. This is done by comparing sequences of image-based pose estimates (here head rotations) through a distance metric (here Frechet distance) and presenting a ranked list of similar movements to clinicians for review. In contrast to existing intelligent systems for retrospective review of human movement, the system supports a flexible analysis where clinicians can look for any movement that interests them. Evaluation by a group of PTs with expertise in training movement control showed that 96% of all relevant movements were identified with time savings of as much as 99.1% compared to reviewing target videos in full. The novelty of this contribution includes retrospective progress monitoring that preserves context through video, and content-based video retrieval that supports both fine-grained human actions and query-by-movement. Future research, including large clinician-led studies, will refine the technical aspects and explore the benefits in terms of patient outcomes, PT time, and financial savings over the course of a programme of therapy. It is anticipated that this clinician-led approach will mitigate the reported slow clinical uptake of technology with resulting patient benefit. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

8,"Orthogonal signal-division multiplexing (OSDM) has recently emerged as a promising alternative to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for high-rate wireless communications. Although providing more flexibility in system design, it suffers from a special interference structure, namely intervector interference (IVI), when channel time variations are present. In this paper, we first derive the general OSDM signal model over time-varying channels, and then show that a time-domain window can be used to enhance the diagonal-block-banded (DBB) approximation of the channel matrix in a transformed domain. Furthermore, based on the DBB matrix enhancement, a low-complexity OSDM equalization algorithm is designed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed equalizer has significant performance advantages over that using the direct DBB approximation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

9,"The dynamic analysis of induction motors is supported by well-known theories: the two-axes transformation, and the space vector theory. Yet some inconsistencies with the theory of dynamic systems exist. The machine eigenvalues suggest the existence of two damped oscillators, physically not understandable. The respective eigenfrequencies change with the angular velocity of the reference frame. This contradicts the understanding that eigenfrequencies are inherent system properties. Physically, the dynamics depend on the continuous distribution of magnetic energy and its spatial displacement during transient processes. Information on the system dynamics is lost when dividing the continuum of magnetic energy into discrete portions. Complex state variables associate the dynamics to the propagation in space of distributed magnetic fields. The dynamic analysis reveals the existence single-complex eigenvalues. These define a novel class of system identifiers. They are characterized by having only one imaginary part instead of a conjugate complex pair. The use of complex state variables conveys insight and physical understanding of the dynamic processes within the machine. The approach constitutes an extension to the theory of dynamic systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"One key issue of the fifth mobile communication generation (5G) is to elaborate an appropriate new waveform. Ideally, this waveform should preserve the two main advantages of the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, namely low latency and complexity. Along this line of thought, we propose in this paper an OFDM-type window, i.e. identical symbol time duration and equivalent spectral efficiency as OFDM. This optimal waveform with respect to the time -frequency localization criterion is analyzed using a Filtered MultiTone (FMT) framework. For this design criterion, comparisons are carried out between our optimized FMT solution, OFDM and the Root Raised Cosine window. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

12,"This paper proposes a family of single-stage converters consisting of three different converters, each of which is able to produce a variety of waveforms through the waveform-subtraction technique. We brand this converter family as waveform-subtraction based single-stage converter (WSSC). By using only a single-stage converter, the proposed waveform generation technique is able to realize dcdcac conversions and suppress input current ripple, meeting the needs of modernized power grid with renewable energy sources. At the same time, converters in this WSSC family are capable of generating a range of shapes, such as triangular, rectangular, and sawtooth waveforms, with simple structures, demonstrating its suitability of being applied in the electrochemical industry, e.g., in the electroplating process. Furthermore, the proposed family converters also realize substantially better input current ripple suppression compared to other conventional converters. In order to prove the validity and efficacy of the proposed WSSC and the theory underpinning it, in this paper, extensive simulations and analyses are conducted to verify the theoretical foundation of the proposed WSSC strategy, and the prototype of a converter from the proposed converter family is built and tested in our laboratory, which validates the functionality of the WSSC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Smoothed finite element method (S-FEM) is a new general numerical method which has been applied to solve various practical engineering problems. It combines standard finite element method (FEM) and meshfree techniques based on the weaken-weak (W2) formulation. This project, for the first time, develops a preprocessor software package SFEM-Pre for creating types of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) S-FEM models following strictly the S-FEM theory. Because the software architecture of our 3D processor is the same as our 2D preprocessor, we will mainly introduce the 2D preprocessor in terms of software design for easier description, but the examples will include both 2D and 3D cases to fully demonstrate and validate the whole preprocessor of S-FEM. Our 2D preprocessor package is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy use, and with a connectivity database for efficient computation. Schemes are developed for not only automatically meshes the problem domains using our GUI, but also accepts various geometry files made available from some existing commercial software packages, such as ABAQUS (R) and HyperMesh (R). In order to improve the efficiency of our preprocessor, a parallel triangulation mesh generator has also been developed based on the advancing front technique (AFT) to create triangular meshes for complex geometry, and at the same time to create six types of connectivity needed for various S-FEM models. In addition, a database is implemented in our code to record all these connectivity to avoid duplicated calculation. Finally, intensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficiency, accuracy and stability of our preprocessor codes. It is shown that with our preprocessor, an S-FEM can be created automatically without much human intervention for geometry of arbitrary complexity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"This study determined an explicit tolerance for bottom flanges of tub girders giving computed first yield moment including the strength reduction due to initial out-of-flatness of tub girders higher than the flexural design capacity for the limit state of bottom flange local buckling in current standards. Finite-element analysis (FEA) was used to construct flexural strength-reduction curves for tub girders with various out-of-flatness magnitudes covering a range of girder cross sections and spans. Tub bottom flange slenderness ratios between 25 and 120 were modeled as covering the practical range. Models were built with coexisting out-of-flatness in both webs and flanges. The appropriate residual stress pattern was created using heat analysis. Models were laterally supported to ensure the local buckling limit state controls. Both 344.7-MPa (Grade 50 Steel) and 689.4-MPa (Grade 100 Steel) yield steel plates were considered with elastic-perfectly plastic material behavior. Large deflection theory was used to iteratively capture the secondary moments due to out-of-flatness. The current tolerance of D/150 out-of-flatness for the fascia web of an I-shaped plate girder was shown to implicitly accept a 20% strength reduction. Results showed that compressive flexural design formulas for tub girders in current standards conservatively reduce the strength to account for local buckling. Code adoption of b(f)/200 is recommended for the tub girder bottom flange out-of-flatness tolerance, where b(f) represents the bottom flange width.

15,"Reduced-rank adaptive beamforming is a well established and efficient methodology, notably for disturbance covariance matrices which are the sum of a strong low-rank component (interference) and a scaled identity matrix (thermal noise). Eigenvalue or singular decomposition is often used to achieve rank reduction. In this paper, we study and analyze an alternative, namely a partial Cholesky factorization, as a means to retrieve interference subspace and to compute reduced-rank beamformers. First, we study the angles between the true subspace and that obtained from partial Cholesky factorization of the covariance matrix. Then, a statistical analysis is carried out in finite samples. Using properties of partitioned Wishart matrices, we provide a stochastic representation of the beamformer based on partial Cholesky factorization and of the corresponding signal to interference and noise ratio loss. We show that the latter follows approximately a beta distribution, similarly to the beamformer based on eigenvalue decomposition. Finally, numerical simulations are presented which indicate that a reduced-rank adaptive beam former based on partial Cholesky factorization incurs almost no loss, and can even perform better in some scenarios than its eigenvalue or singular value-based counterpart.

16,"Pricing and inventory management make up together revenue management, which is a significant effort to boost revenues out of available resources. Firms use various forms of dynamic pricing, including personalized pricing, markdowns, promotions, coupons, discounts, and clearance sales, to respond to market fluctuations and demand uncertainty. In this paper, we study a temporary price increase policy, a form of dynamic pricing, for a non-perishable product, a practice used by several giant retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Apple. We develop a continuous review inventory model that allows for joint replenishment and pricing decisions, where the lead time is not zero. A replenishment decision controls supply, while a pricing decision controls demand. A manager exercises a temporary price increase to slow demand and avoid a stock-out situation while waiting for a shipment, which may not necessarily increase revenues, but decrease stock-out costs. The problem is to solve for the optimal replenishment and the pricing policy parameters that maximize the long-run expected profit. That is, when and how much to order and when to raise the price. In this paper, the inventory level and time trigger a price increase. We solve many numerical examples and perform extensive sensitivity analyses. Our results show that compared to a model that focuses on fixed pricing, our model brings an additional increase in profit of about 13%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

17,"Liquid leakage assessment is usually difficult, what can be overwhelmed through leakage testing using gases. This happens in many situations of practical interest of pressure-difference driven liquid leakage. Starting from physical principles and laws, analytical expressions relate the liquid and gas leakages occurring through the same leak geometry. Pressure differences driven the liquid and gas leakages can be different. Process of obtaining the analytical expressions highlights the physics behind the process of leakage testing and the involved variables and principles. Obtained analytical expressions relate the governing variables, allowing calculations for results treatment, interpretation, correlation or uncertainty analysis. Developments and results presented in the paper fulfill a gap of the literature concerning the liquid leakage assessment and testing using gases, and of the users' manuals of the leakage testing equipment.

19,"This paper proposes three polytomous item explanatory models with random item errors in Item Response Theory (IRT), by extending the Linear Logistic Test Model with item error (LLTM + epsilon) approach to polytomous data. The proposed models, also regarded as polytomous random item effects models, can take the uncertainty in explanation and/or the random nature of item parameters into account for polytomous items. To develop the models, the concepts and types of polytomous random item effects are investigated and then added into the existing polytomous item explanatory models. For estimation of the proposed models with crossed random effects for polytomous data, a Bayesian inference method is adopted for data analysis. An empirical example demonstrates practical implications and applications of the proposed models to the Verbal Aggression data. The empirical findings show that the proposed models with random item errors perform better than the existing models without random item errors in terms of the goodness-of-fit and reconstructing the step difficulties and also demonstrate methodological and practical differences of the proposed models in interpreting the item property effects in each of the item location explanatory Many-Facet Rasch Model and the step difficulty explanatory Linear Partial Credit Model approaches.

20,"Detailed transient behaviors of mass and heat transfer processes are required to solve partial differential equations. When those partial differential equations are coupled, they are still difficult to solve in time domain. For linear mass and heat transfer processes, their Laplace-domain solutions are obtainable and, when they are approximated by rational polynomials in the Laplace variable s, the problems can be transformed to a set of ordinary differential equations solved easily in time domain for various initial conditions. In this approximation, the conventional Pade method based on the Tayler series expansion of the Laplace-domain solutions has been well developed and effective. However, for some mass and heat transfer processes in the semi-infinite geometry, the Pade approximation is not applicable because the Laplace-domain solutions involving exp(-sqrt(s)) are not analytic at s = 0. Here, for such processes, analytical methods to approximate exp(-sqrt(s)) by rational polynomials are proposed. First it is expanded in series in terms of cosh(-1)(2(k)sqrt(s)) which converges fast. This series, when truncated, is analytic at s = 0 and its Pade approximations are available. The proposed method enables partial differential equations be replaced to a set of ordinary differential equations, reducing computations considerably for coupled partial differential equations. Performances of the proposed method are illustrated with several realistic mass and heat transfer processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"Current probabilistic methods for maximum and minimum run lengths in a hydrologic time series need further development. Using the first-order Markov chain model and an extreme-value theory for randomly occurring events, this study investigates probabilistic properties of both extreme run lengths in a stationary hydrologic time series. The interaction between negative run length, positive run length, total run length, life span, and number of total runs was analyzed. As a result, a joint probabilistic space was defined for negative (or positive) and total run lengths, and a corrector was established for an existing cumulative distribution function (CDF) of negative run length. Lengths of incomplete runs were considered appropriately, especially when no total run occurred during the life span. A generalized CDF was formulated for each extreme value, and simplified versions of the generalized CDF were proposed as practical approximate methods, including expectation approximations and limiting approximations. Results of computational examples indicated that expectation approximations generally provided better results than limiting approximations for maximum negative run lengths, and the non-negligible probability of no total run occurring during the life span may have a significant influence on CDFs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO-n) molecular sieves are important microporous materials for chemical processes like MTO. Classical synthesis route for SAPO-n, i.e. hydrothermal method, generally requires dozens of hours (> 24 h). In this work, we reported a chemical approach to significantly reduce required crystallization time to 40-120 min by adding citric acid (CA) in synthesis gel. The time consumed with the proposed process is comparable with that by special heating intensification method while it is simpler, cheaper, and greener than latter. The ultrafast crystallization was attributed to the non-classical nucleation theory inspired by kinetic analysis, in which chelation interaction between CA and Al3+ favored metastable phase generation evidenced by XRD and Al-27 NMR. Other chelate agents (tartaric acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) with multi carbonic group also showed promising interaction. Moreover, the superior crystallization promotion effect could be applicable in the synthesis of other SAPO-n molecular sieves like SAPO-11, which indicates its great potentials in the future. With further optimization by structure promoter, the obtained SAPO-34 demonstrated sub-micron particle size, high ratio isolated Q(0) state Si specie, and hierarchical structure, characterized by the SEM, XPS, Si-29 NMR, TEM, and N-2-isotherms. The promoted physiochemical properties favored superior performance during MTO test.

23,"Fine structure splitting (FSS) is a bottleneck in quantum dot (QD) based solid-state entangled photon pair sources for application in quantum key distribution (QKD). In QDs, entangle photon pairs are generated through a cascaded emission process: biexciton to exciton to the ground state. The FSS of the excitonic states destroys the entanglement of the photon pairs; hence, it needs to be eliminated. For numerical investigation of FSS and design optimization, a multiscale-multiphysics many-body calculation is required. In this article, we report the coupling of a full configuration interaction (FCI) method with a 10-band ( $sp<^>{ {3}}$ $s<^>\ast $ -spin) tight-binding (TB) model to calculate the excitonic energetics of realistically sized InGaN/GaN dot-in-nanowire structures.

Computational methodology of implementing a hexagonal-base truncated pyramid shaped QD has been presented. The effects of QD shape/thickness, material composition, and crystal growth direction (polar ${c}$ -plane and non-polar ${m}$ -plane and ${a}$ -plane) on the FSS of InGaN/GaN based photon emitters have been investigated. Polarization profiles of the emitted photons from the excitonic transitions have been derived quantum mechanically from transition dipole moments.

24,"The balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) problem is a difficult combinatorial problem with a large number of symmetries, which add complexity to its resolution. In this paper, we propose a dual (integer) problem representation that serves as an alternative to the classical binary formulation of the problem. We attack this problem incrementally: firstly, we propose basic algorithms (i.e. local search techniques and genetic algorithms) intended to work separately on the two different search spaces (i.e. binary and integer); secondly, we propose two hybrid schemes: an integrative approach (i.e. a memetic algorithm) and a collaborative model in which the previous methods work in parallel, occasionally exchanging information. Three distinct two-dimensional structures are proposed as communication topology among the algorithms involved in the collaborative model, as well as a number of migration and acceptance criteria for sending and receiving data. An empirical analysis comparing a large number of instances of our schemes (with algorithms possibly working on different search spaces and with/without symmetry breaking methods) shows that some of these algorithms can be considered the state of the art of the metaheuristic methods applied to finding BIBDs. Moreover, our cooperative proposal is a general scheme from which distinct algorithmic variants can be instantiated to handle symmetrical optimisation problems. For this reason, we have also analysed its key parameters, thereby providing general guidelines for the design of efficient/robust cooperative algorithms devised from our proposal.

25,"Two different approaches are used to assess the impacts associated with natural hazards and climate change in cities. A bottom-up approach uses high resolution data on constituent assets within the urban area. In contrast, a top-down approach uses less detailed information but is consequently more readily transferable. Here, we compare damage curves generated by each approach for coastal flooding in London. To compare them, we fit a log-logistic regression with three parameters to the calculated damage curves. We find that the functions are remarkably similar in their shape, albeit with different inflection points and a maximum damage that differs by 13%-25%. If rescaled, the curves agree almost exactly, which enables damage assessment to be undertaken following the calculation of the three parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"Chlorosilane gas transport in ambient hydrogen in a slim vertical cold wall chemical vapor deposition reactor was real-time monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) using its behaviour responding to the properties of the gas mixture. The QCM frequency quickly decreased by introducing the trichlorosilane gas, while it slowly decreased by the dichlorosilane gas. The QCM frequency behavior was explained by the gas flow condition, such as the plug flow and recirculating flow, in the reactor. The relationship was consistent with the gas flow calculations, because the heavy and light gases could directly flow downward and recirculate, respectively, in the chamber due to natural convection. The information obtained from the QCM frequency behavior is expected to be utilized for the real-time gas monitoring and for the process design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This leads to the problem of determining an appropriate location and height for an Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower that can provide the right vantage point for coordinating runway and taxiway movements. The challenge involves finding the right location and optimal height that can satisfy the visibility and obstruction constraints for a complex airport-airside environment with multiple runways and civil infrastructure under different weather conditions. This article formulates the ATC tower location and height problem as a Mixed-Integer-Programming (MIP) model while considering the visibility and obstruction constraints. Singapore Changi Airport's proposed third runway extension is used as a case study to determine the set of location and height of ATC Tower using the proposed approach. A visual analytic test is conducted in an ATC tower simulator for different tower locations and heights under varying visibility conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"In this study, we analyze the absence epileptic seizures using the data recorded from different layers of somatosensory cortex of absence epileptic rats. We aim to (1) extract the epileptic activities or sources generating the seizures, and (2) investigate the temporal changes of seizures. To achieve our goals, we describe the recorded seizures by a linear superposition of static and dynamic sources. The static sources are stable and have a fixed structure, while the dynamic sources can be intermittent, and may be with different locations. Retrieving the sources and their structures from the recorded seizures helps us to achieve the desired analysis. Experimental results show the existence of a static source and three specific dynamic sources during the recorded seizures. The dynamic sources randomly activate with the static source and one of them disappears towards the end of the seizures. Moreover, it is shown that the spatial locations of the sources are similar in different absence epileptic rats. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"One of the reasons why photovoltaic technology is not massively installed is its variation in production. This variation is due to intermittences in the solar resource. Based on real data from the microgrid of the Renewable Energy Development Center (CEDER, Spain) and another scenario in Xalapa (Mexico), the study determines the solar intermittences produced and grouped monthly. The period of data acquisition, in the first study, was from May 30th, 2012 to March 3rd, 2015 with the help of a Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSNR) team; in the second, 2014 measurements were obtained from a meteorological station certified by the National Meteorological System (SMN). The analysis is based on the determination of monthly frames of reference for radiation by third-degree spline adjustments with smoothing, using the JUMP statistical application software (JMP (C) 2009, SAS Institute, version 8.0.2). The results of the analyses have provided important information to understand the unstable appearance of solar radiation and, in turn, will be the basis of a control system to optimize photovoltaic production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"When an oak board is exposed to a change in the relative humidity of the ambient air, moisture transfer occurs. Consequentially, the internal moisture content distribution changes continuously, which induces bending of the board over time. With increasing asymmetry in the internal moisture content distribution, induced by an increasing difference in relative humidity over the board thickness, the board's curvature increases. In case the board is subjected to two different sinusoidal fluctuations in relative humidity on its opposite sides, the bending response is a superposition of two sinusoidal fluctuations. The influences of different fluctuation frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts on the macroscopic bending are theoretically predicted and experimentally explored. Moisture transport characteristics are derived from a frequency analysis of the macroscopic bending response, whereas the equilibrium bending configuration provides the linear hygroscopic expansion coefficient. Furthermore, the effect of hysteresis during sinusoidal relative humidity fluctuations is explored. The results are used in a case study to predict the deformation of an oak door separating an indoor and outdoor environment, with differently varying relative humidity on both sides of the door.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"1-read/1-write (1R1W) register file (RF) is a popular memory configuration in modern feature rich SoCs requiring significant amount of embedded memory. A memory compiler is constructed using the 8T RF bitcell spanning a range of instances from 32 b to 72 Kb. An 8T low-leakage bitcell of 0.106 mu m(2) is used in a 14 nm FinFET technology with a 70 nm contacted gate pitch for high-density (HD) two-port (TP) RF memory compiler which achieves 5.66 Mb/mm(2) array density for a 72 Kb array which is the highest reported density in 14 nm FinFET technology. The density improvement is achieved by using techniques such as leaf-cell optimization (eliminating transistors), better architectural planning, top level connectivity through leaf-cell abutment and minimizing the number of unique leaf-cells. These techniques are fully compatible with memory compiler usage over the required span. Leakage power is minimized by using power-switches without degrading the density mentioned above. Self-induced supply voltage collapse technique is applied for write and a four stack static keeper is used for read Vmin improvement. Fabricated test chips using 14 nm process have demonstrated 2.33 GHz performance at 1.1 V/25 degrees C operation. Overall V-min, of 550 mV is achieved with this design at 25 degrees C.

43,"While PIV allows the extraction of instantaneous streamlines, the availability of typically thousands of patterns hampers a statistical understanding of the underlying flow topology. A particular application is oscillating gas jets, encountered in scientific and industrial studies dealing with mass transfer and flow control. Multiple methods, such as statistical moments (including mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis), proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and Hartigan's dip test are common post-processing methodologies. However, as demonstrated in this paper, they do not provide sufficient in-depth information from a statistical perspective to attribute probabilities to potential flow topologies. In this work, a novel approach to describe probability distributions based on extracted streamline patterns is proposed. Based on the available streamline patterns, the convolution with adaptive Gaussian kernels reveals the probability density function of the flow topology. The proposed methodology, as well as more traditional post-processing approaches, are assessed on the basis of synthetic flow fields and experimental PIV data of oscillating impinging gas jets, demonstrating the added value of the streamline probability map in characterising the scrutinised flow.

44,"The effects of heating temperature in ultraviolet irradiation process (hereafter named as UV temperature) on photon-activated precursor YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) films were investigated systemically. The results from FT-IR spectra, carbon content, the XPS spectra of Cu 2p and O1s reflected that the photochemical reactions were inhibited by high UV temperature. And we proposed a model to analyze and explain the mechanism of how the UV temperature affect the photochemical reactions. Finally, the YBCO films irradiated at 100 or 150 degrees C had higher Jc values (about 7.0 MA/cm(2) at 77 K and 0 T) than samples UV-irradiated under high UV temperatures (beyond 200 degrees C), which showed lower Jc values due to the weakening of oxidation progress. Consequently, a temperature window of 100-150 degrees C in UV irradiation process maybe suitable for the deep UV irradiation method used in YBCO preparation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"Radioactive effluent is generated through a nuclear fuel cycle involving the use of radioactive materials in nuclear power plants. The concentration of the nuclear effluent is of concern if it is discharged into a natural water body and potentially used for human consumption. The present study involves numerical simulation of hydrodynamic parameters for prediction of near-field concentrations of tritium at various sampling points in a natural lake system in India. The modeling software with volume of fluid (VOF) two-phase model, for tracking the fraction of each fluid element, and k-epsilon model, as turbulence closure, is used to analyze the dispersion of tritium in the lake domain. The simulated results are validated using data on velocity and tritium (H3) concentrations measured at sampling locations in the lake system. The simulated hydrodynamic parameters are reported to be in agreement with their measured values at sampling locations, particularly with a wind effect on the lake surface. The simulated values of hydrodynamic parameters as well as tritium concentrations are found to be within +/- 10% of their respective measured values in the lake domain. The safe disposal practices of tritium within the lake system are indicated because simulated effluent concentrations are well within the permissible limits of international standards. The numerical model would be useful for real-time operation and management of the chosen lake system in future while simulating the concentration of tritium at different sampling locations, monitoring their concentrations within permissible limits, and ensuring passage of safe water further downstream in the canal system for municipal, industrial, and irrigation usages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

50,"This study investigated the effects of cue plausibility in a baggage screening task. 120 participants had to indicate whether a prohibited item was present in a series of grey-scaled X-ray images of baggage. They were assisted by a support system, which pointed at the location of a suspicious object. A 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects design was used. Cue plausibility for false alarms (i.e. how the cued object was similar to a prohibited item) and support system reliability were manipulated at two levels (high/low). Furthermore, half of participants were provided with a rationale about automation failures (RAF) to reduce their negative impact on trust and performance. The results showed lower performance and more compliance with automation suggestions when cues were implausible than plausible. The RAF increased the response time and did not improve detection performance. Overall, this suggests that effective (computer-based) training is needed to reduce the negative effect of plausible cues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"Constant-modulus signals such as m-sequences are known to have good autocorrelation properties, as well as good peak-to-average power ratio that allows for full utilization of the transmitter's power. However, the broadband ambiguity surface for such signals exhibit high sidelobe levels that are undesirable in applications where the signal is subject to broadband Doppler. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the maximum sidelobe levels of such signals over a set of delay-Doppler values. This problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We explore a convex regularization of the problem that can readily be solved using semi-definite programming, and show that optimal or near-optimal signals can be designed using this method. We further explore some heuristic methods to reduce computational and memory complexity of the solution, to enable us to design longer signals. We demonstrate the advantage of our signal design over conventional unimodular signals for target detection in strong clutter in a continuous active sonar application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

71,"In this paper, the Wigner-Kirkwood quantum theory and the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) effective diameter method in Classical DFT are employed to account for the effects of quantum corrections on the Helmholtz free energy of bulk and confined fluids. Initially, experimental data are exploited toward accurate prediction of pressure-volume isotherms and vapor-liquid equilibrium in bulk fluids. In the second part, the effects of quantum correction on the structure and thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in slit pores are investigated. Our results show that quantum effects may come into account by considering the effective size of the particles and also intermolecular interaction which both of them have direct effects on the density distribution of molecules in the slit pore. Furthermore, the excess adsorption of fluids at a fixed bulk density is shown to increase with quantum effect, but this trend is reversed with increasing wall fluid interaction because of the entropy and energy effects. Also, it is found that the excess adsorption and interfacial tension of the fluid against the solid surface of fluids exhibit oscillatory behaviors with maximum and minimum values for half integer and integer values of pore width. This oscillatory behavior disappears at high values of pore width with increasing quantum effect. Another finding of the present study indicates that the interfacial tensions of the fluid against the solid surface for a classical fluid are negative but quantum effect increases it and shifts its sign to positive. Finally, it is shown that the locus of phase transition is shifted toward higher bulk densities as a result of increasing quantum effect. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

73,"Shallow urban road tunnels with top vents represent environmentally friendly and energy-saving technology. To date, four such tunnels are operational in Nanjing, and their intra-tunnel air quality has been widely acclaimed. However, no prescriptive design methods have been developed for this technology. Natural ventilation at the top of the tunnels is caused by the pressure difference inside and outside the top vents. Thus, a prerequisite to the development of scientific design methods for such tunnels is a complete understanding and representation of the pressure wave distribution pattern in the tunnels. Based on an analogy with an electric dipole, we propose a pressure-induced dipole theory and construct an intra-tunnel pressure distribution model. An experimental platform is developed to evaluate the pressure distribution inside tunnels under 6 operational conditions. The results suggest the following. (1) The proposed pressure-induced dipole theory can well describe and explain the pressure wave distribution rules in road tunnels. (2) With a uniform and continuous traffic flow, the real-time pressure on each point in the tunnels demonstrates periodical asymmetrical quasi-sinusoidal pulsation, where the cycle is given as T = (S + L)/v.

82,"Background and Objective: Kinematic and dynamic modeling of any physical process is critical especially for the design phase of associated control units and the prediction of their performance levels. In this paper, a dynamical model and a development frame including interactions with the objects for a tendon-driven underactuated hand are developed and examined. Using the proposed dynamic model, free movement and the object interaction of the underactuated hand can be simulated with a single, integrated simulation step in the simulation frame. Methods: Lagrangian Method is used to model the dynamic behavior of the underactuated fingers and the thumb under tendon dependency in a 3D coordinate system. Then, as an important extension to the modeling studies that can be found in the literature, the interaction of the hand with an object that co-exists in its workspace is modeled in terms of contact forces acting on the joints of the fingers. The unified dynamic model is simulated by using the Simulink platform. Results: The simulations showed that the adaptability of the underactuated mechanism and joint torque levels are modeled and examined realistically. The flexion movement of the fingers resulted in realistic torque levels which can be handled by commercially-off-the-shelf actuators. Various tendon forces were examined in terms of the distance of the individual phalanx to the object and their contact instants. Applying an increasing input force with 1.617 N/s ramp slope, finger flexion movement was obtained in 1s. In another simulation scenario, compliance of the underactuated mechanism to an object was examined. With 0.66 N/s tendon force input ramp, proximal, middle and distal phalanx contacted an object in 1.3 s, 2.35 s and 2.75 s, respectively. Conclusions: Presented features obtained by the simulation platform are especially useful to researchers working on the development of control methods for underactuated prosthetic hands and robot manipulators. Through the simulations of experimental scenarios, a detailed analysis of dynamic responses of each finger phalanges can be carried out properly in any level of the design phase.

83,"Bar and joint frameworks provide useful models to the structure of building, metals, glasses, crystal states materials, nano-materials, and some biological systems. Using the symmetry and the periodicity of the structures, their rigidity is a problem of long-standing interest in kinematics, statics, and optimization. We considered the skeletal of a wide class of 3-dimensional tiling with the special assumption that the original polygonal faces are allowed to deform in a way that faces remaining central symmetrical and not necessarily planar. Some vectors that represent the parallel edges with the bracing elements as auxiliary framework characterize the mobility of this framework. A new theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the rigidity of the tiling framework applying face diagonals as bracing elements. This result implies an efficient algorithm for the rigidity of the braced tiling structure. Based on simple elements, we construct new mechanisms which move as the skeleton tiling structure with the planar and the central symmetrical assumption.

86,"As an emerging manufacture technology, block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) is promising for via layer fabrication. Meanwhile, redundant via insertion is considered as an essential step for yield improvement. For better reliability and manufacturability, in this paper, we first concurrently consider DSA guiding template cost assignment with multiple redundant via and dummy via insertion. Firstly, by analyzing the structure property of guiding templates, we propose a building-block based solution expression to discard redundant solutions. Then, honoring the compact solution expression, we construct a conflict graph with dummy via insertion, and then formulate the problem to an integer linear programming (ILP). In addition, to optimize the guiding template cost, we incorporate it into the objective of ILP by introducing vertex weight and edge weight in conflict graph. To make a good trade-off between solution quality and runtime, we relax the ILP to an unconstrained nonlinear programming (UNP). Finally, a line search optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the UNP. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our new solution expression and the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

Spatio-temporal decorrelation is a useful preprocessing technique that can reduce the blind separation problem into a simpler orthogonal matrix estimation problem. However, it is computationally expensive for its large unknown parameter set. Realtime spatio-temporal decorrelation method remains an open issue for years. In this paper, we focus on accelerating the adaptation process in the FIR filter based decorrelation method. Firstly, the update equation is decoupled into spatial decorrelation and temporal decorrelation. Then, their respective convergence conditions are systematically analyzed using eigenvalue decomposing method. Based on it, a fast algorithm for FIR filter network with spatio-temporal decoupled adaptive step-sizes is proposed. Comprehensive simulations are performed on both synthetic data and real world captured sEMG data. We have compared the proposed algorithm with the fixed step size method, IIR filter with natural gradient, and the annealed step size method. The factors including number of iteration, number of channel, computational time, selection of filter order and window size are elaborately compared and discussed.

92,"This study deals with the tracking control problem of a large class of multi input multi output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics and subject to unknown disturbances. First, two interval type-2 adaptive fuzzy systems (IT2-AFSs) are constructed to efficiently estimate the unknown nonlinear dynamics. Then, based on IT2-AFSs and super-twisting algorithm (STA), a new robust adaptive fuzzy-reaching STC law (AF-RSTCL) has been added to the global control law to improve the robustness of the studied systems in the presence of approximation errors and unknown disturbances. In order to avoid the chattering phenomenon and guarantee simultaneously the best tracking performance, the gains of the designed AF-RSTCL are optimally online estimated. The adaptive parameters of the global synthesized control law are deduced from the stability analysis in the sense of Lyapunov. Finally, an example of simulation is used to confirm the effectiveness of the developed method in achieving the predetermined objectives of the tracking control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"This paper reports results of the impact of a quayside floating system on overtopping. The approach is experimental and analytical. Rectangular floaters in heave motion were considered at various distances from a vertical wall. Floaters with different widths and heights were tested. The effect of the draft and the floater's distance to the wall on overtopping quantification was considered in intermediate water conditions. First, overtopping evolution as a function of the wave period was found to be correlated with the floater behavior. The overtopping increased at the resonance period of the floater but decreased at larger periods. The experimental results were then compared with a linear analytical model based on potential flow theory, where the wave height at the seawall was given using the Van der Meer formula. An improvement of the analytical model was obtained by introducing a term corresponding to pressure losses between the floater and seawall. The experimental results are in good agreement with the corrected analytical model: the evolution is similar, with an averaged standard deviation of 1.2 for large wavelengths. The present results show that the wave period and distance of the floater to the vertical wall are significant parameters for overtopping. Overtopping is reduced by the presence of the quayside floater for small distances to the vertical wall and large wave periods when the floater follows waves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"In this paper we have comprehensive study on the interplay among radiation loss, transverse disorder (diagonal and off-diagonal) and Kerr-type nonlinearity on the light propagation in 1D array of optical waveguides. Our numerical results demonstrate the presence of three distinguished regimes of transverse light expansion at different propagation distances. At short propagation distance, the Kerr-type nonlinearity are dominated and results in the transverse localization of light through the self-trapping mechanism. Radiation loss, causes the light escape from the injected guides, affect the light expansion in middle distance via broadening the light beam width. At longer distance the disorder terms led to the transverse localization of light, again. Also, we compared the propagation of light in edge and middle modes in the presence of the above effects. Our results show that the propagation distance of first localized regime for edge modes is larger than the middle modes since the edge modes can exchange energy with one of the left or right waveguides, while for middle modes there are two ways for energy exchange. Therefore the discrete diffraction can be diminished the nonlinear effects in middle modes faster than the edge modes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"E-waste collected from households must be properly processed in recycling plants to acquire high-purity output materials and hazardous substances removed. It requires a systematic approach to the disassembly process and wastes classification and categorization. Big variety of shapes and materials used in the equipment need processing lines including manual and automated sections. The main purpose of the machines used on the processing lines is to shred equipment into small size fraction and then separate each material depending on the physical properties. In such case, the output material from the E-waste disassembling plants can be recycled and used in new parts or components. This chapter includes a description of methods of disassembly focused on E-waste recycling in compliance with environmental standards. The required steps of the end-of-life products disassembly vary depending on the category of waste equipment. To show these differences, the chapter includes two case studies showing the configuration of a layout of E-waste processing lines with possible options to reconfigure them. The variants of the system's configuration depend on the volume of the waste stream, labor cost, and required purity of output materials. Economic efficiency indicator of E-waste processing indicates big differences in potential profit from recycling E-waste mainly depending on labor cost. Example of calculation of this indicator has been presented in this chapter on cooling appliances recycling for four European countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With continuing developments in non-intrusive measurement techniques, such as particle image velocimetry, there is an ever-increasing demand for simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution, which can make them well suited to the spectral characterization of fluid flows. This application places significant importance on the accuracy and repeatability of the timing between successive laser pulses of high-speed, double-pulsed laser systems, as any timing errors propagate directly into the computed velocity vectors and indirectly into all other derived quantities, including the spectral analysis of the flow.

104,"A micro-trigger sensor for alarm or emergency protection under abnormal working conditions is proposed. The mathematical and mechanical models with scale-dependent are established using the Euler-Bernoulli beam hypothesis and the generalized elasticity theory. Meanwhile, governing equations are deduced using the principle of minimum potential energy.

The iteration method is used to solve the trigger angular speed that cannot be directly calculated by the design formula. The scale effects of the deflection of the microcantilever under angular speed and acceleration are analyzed by using generalized elasticity theory and classical elasticity theory, and significant scale effects are observed.

106,"Computers and smartphones have become indispensable parts of human daily life. Driven by various modern applications, the demand for high-speed Internet connection is always growing. Because Internet speed strongly depends on signal strength and quality, a great deal of effort has been spent to increase the number of ""bars"" displayed on the screen of wireless devices. One effective approach toward ""more bars"" is deploying microwave relay systems to provide stronger signals, and thus higher data rates, to end users. Microwave relay links facilitate the transmission of signals from one point to another by receiving, recovering, and retransmitting wireless signals with enhanced quality and strength. With more bars on the end-user side, handheld wireless devices also become smaller because of reduced power consumption in their receivers. With the help of sophisticated radio relay links in the last mile of communications networks [1], wireless data can be efficiently communicated among a variety of devices, such as home appliances, smart Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and autonomous vehicles [2], [3].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
107,"Purpose The finite element model developed for a new-designed aircraft was used to solve some problems of structural dynamics. The key purpose of the task was to estimate the critical flutter velocities of the light airplane by performing numerical analysis with application of MSC Software. Design/methodology/approach Flutter analyses processed by Nastran require application of some complex aeroelastic model integrating two separate components - structural model and aerodynamic model. These sub-models are necessary for determining stiffness, mass and aerodynamic matrices, which are involved in the flutter equation. The aircraft structural model with its non-structural masses was developed in Patran. To determine the aerodynamic coefficient matrix, some simplified aerodynamic body-panel geometries were developed. The flutter equation was solved with the PK method. Findings The verified aircraft model was used to determine its normal modes in the range of 0-30 Hz. Then, some critical velocities of flutter were calculated within the range of operational velocities. As there is no certainty that the computed modes are in accordance with the natural ones, some parametric calculations are recommended. Modal frequencies depend on structural parameters that are quite difficult to identify. Adopting their values from the reasonable range, it is possible to assign the range of possible frequencies. The frequencies of rudder or elevator modes are dependent on their mass moments of inertia and rigidity of controls. The critical speeds of tail flutter were calculated for various combinations of stiffness or mass values.

108,"The introduction of liquid-crystal display (LCD) for television and personal computer monitor has gained momentum in sales and distribution due to its portability and energy efficiency over traditional bulky cathode-ray tube (CRT) used in the manufacture of television and personal computer. The disposal of the cathode-ray tube is further having a major challenge due to its hazardous characteristics resulting from the composition of glass used in cathode-ray tubes. There are various recycling technologies available to extract toxic lead from funnel glass of cathode-ray tube. This chapter explores the status of cathode-ray tube, disposal, and environmental issues followed by potential challenges of segregating funnel and panel glass of cathode-ray tube. Separation of funnel and panel glass from the cathode-ray tube based on open-loop and closed-loop process is discussed with pros and cons. Cathode-ray tube glass-ceramic brick and concrete, vitrification glass to stabilize nuclear waste, and fluxing materials such as silica flux are gaining momentum on the reuse of cathode-ray tube under closed-loop process. The diamond cutting method for segregation of funnel glass from panel glass is highly recommended among the various potential segregation technologies available due to its vacuum adsorption and dust recovery capacity, automatic edge searching, and laser positioning. The study finds that emerging technology using furnace and chemicals for extraction of toxic lead from the cathode-ray tube is a promising method for management of recycling in an environmentally sustainable way without any residual waste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,"This paper considers price and modularity of competition between two firms with deterministic demand, in which demand is dependent on both the prices and the modularity levels determined by two firms. Bertrand competition and Stackelberg competition are formulated to derive the equilibrium solutions analytically. Because of the complexity, an intensive numerical study is conducted to investigate the impact of the sensitive parameters on equilibrium prices and modularity levels, as well as optimal profits of the two firms. An important and interesting finding is that optimal profits of the two firms under both types of competition are decreasing with the modularity cost when the price and modularity sensitivities are low, where both firms are worse-off due to decrease of the modularity levels; but they are increasing when the price and modularity sensitivities are high, where both firms are better-off at the expense of modular design. Our research reveals that Stackelberg game improves the modularity levels in most of the cases, though both firms perform better in Bertrand competition in these cases when jointly deciding the prices and modularity levels in the two firms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
110,"One fluid formulation is an approach used for modeling and analysis of mass transfer between two immiscible phases. In this study we implement and analyze the advantages and limitations of this approach for CO2 physical mass transfer into MEA. The domain is a flat plate and gas liquid flow is counter current. The analysis was carried for operating parameters like liquid phase Reynolds number, MEA mass fraction and the angle of inclination of flat plate. The results clearly show that the model effectively captures the deviation in liquid side mass transfer coefficient due to the surface instabilities and liquid properties which are generally neglected by standard correlations. Also the model shows that the standard Higbie correlation is preferable at low Reynolds number at any angle of inclination. The grid independent studies show that a size of 6.25 mu m is required in the interface region for effectively using this approach. The computational resource time at this resolution was found as the only limitation for using this approach and we suggest a procedure to overcome this limitation.

111,"The ability to characterize implant debris in conjunction with corresponding immune and tissue-destructive responses renders retrieval analysis as an important tool for evaluating orthopedic devices. We applied advanced analytics and in silico approaches to illustrate the retrieval-based potential to elucidate host responses and enable discovery of corresponding biomarkers indicative of in vivo implant performance. Hip retrieval analysis was performed using variables based on immunostaining, polarized microscopy, and fretting-corrosion and oxidation analyses. Statistical analyses were performed in R. Hierarchical/k-means clustering and principal component analysis were used for data analysis and visualization. Correlation Engine (CE) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were employed for in silico corroboration of putative biomarkers. Higher giant cell and histiocyte scores and positivity for CD68 and CD3 indicating infiltration with macrophages and T-cells, respectively, were detected mainly among older generation hips with higher ultra-high-molecular-weight-polyethylene loads. Our in silico analysis using pre-existing data on wear particle-induced loosening substantiated the role of CD68 in implant-induced innate responses and identified the CD68-related molecular signature that can be indicative of development of aseptic loosening and can be further corroborated for diagnostic/prognostic testing in clinical setting.

115,"The addition mud density is a key part of drilling fluid design to avoid drilling accidents resulting from the pressure surge. However, the current standard of addition mud density is empirical and whether this empirical value can be applied to all wells, especially deep wells, deserves further study. In this paper, in order to quantitatively calculate the variation of downhole pressure during tripping, the transient wellbore surge pressure calculation model during tripping was established and verified by field data fist. Then, through the analysis of the surge pressure and its influencing factors during tripping, it was found that the current standard of addition pressure difference cannot be used as an empirical value for different sections of a well, while the addition mud density was more reasonable for the open hole safety in casing program design. However, the surge pressure was much smaller than the lower limit of current standard addition mud density under the actual working conditions. On the other hand, through the analysis of the wellbore pressure variation and its influencing factors when gas kick occurs, it was found that the variation of bottom hole pressure caused by gas kick was much smaller than that caused by tripping. Therefore, the surge pressure should be the main factor in the determination of addition mud density. Based on this, the determination method of addition mud density for each tripping section was proposed, which can calculate the addition mud density quantitatively and more reasonably for each tripping section based on the comprehensive consideration of factors such as wellbore pressure variation and formation pressure prediction error. The results showed that the current standards of addition mud density are too conservative in medium and shallow formations and may not meet the safety requirements in deep formations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
116,"This study introduces a characterization technique for trap locations (X-t) with considerable trap density along the channel in field effect transistors (FETs). The technique is based on the experimental gate-to-source or gateto-drain capacitance-voltage (C-GS-V-GS or C-GD-V-GD) characteristics of FETs. As the gate bias (V-G) increases, the effective channel length (L-eff) extends by the increased conductivity of the channel from the source or the drain. Due to trapped charges at the trap sites with a high density of traps along the channel, abrupt change in the C-V characteristics is observed. For the transition gate bias (V-G,V-t) with abrupt change in the C-V characteristics, the dominant trap location (X-t) can be converted through the channel conduction factor (alpha(V-G) to be the effective channel length L-eff(V-G) = alpha(V-G).L-ch). We expect that the proposed C-V technique to be useful in non-destructive electrical characterization of lateral trap locations (interface states, bulk traps, and/or grain boundary traps caused by the bias stress and/or fabrication process) along the channel in FETs. We successfully applied the proposed technique to the p-channel poly-Si thin-film transistors (TFTs) for characterization of the grain boundary locations along the channel. As an example for the proposed technique, we applied the technique to a p-channel poly-Si TFT and obtained a dominant trap at X-GB1 = 3.13 [mu m] from the source and another at X-GB2 = 3.70 [mu m] from the drain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
117,"Oriented-plane curvature reproduction, the control of fingertip deformation by orientating a flat plate on contact points to generate a sensation of curvature, is one of the curvature reproduction methods with favorable effects. However, among the three geometric cues of curvature, only the zeroth- and first-order information is recovered with this method, whereas the second-order information (i.e., local curvature) is neglected due to the oriented plate's inherent characteristic of having a planar surface. The second-order information will change the contact length between the finger and the surface and thus affects the feeling. As a solution for this problem, this paper proposes to control the indentation depth of the finger pulp on the oriented plate such that the correct contact length is reproduced during the rendering. A finger wearable device is developed to control that indentation depth. Three psychophysical experiments are carried out and the results indicate that the second-order information plays a positive role in curvature rendering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

125,"In this study, cobalt oxides were loaded on a CeO2 nanorod and synthesized using a hydrothermal method and wet impregnation to reduce nitrogen monoxide (NO) by carbon monoxide (CO). A series of catalysts were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to determine the reacting path in the reduction zones. Co species were highly dispersed on the CeO2 nanorod when the precursor solution content was less than 20% by weight. Co3+ species were the most active components in the NO+CO reaction, and the Co3+ fraction reached a maximum when the precursor concentration was 10% by weight. A possible mechanism for the CO+NO reaction was suggested in which NO adsorbs onto the surface of CoOx-CeO2 and transforms to some nitrite/nitrate species under the reacting condition. At lower temperature (<300 degrees C), adsorbed CO species react with a nitro complex to generate N2O and CO2, whereas as the temperature increases, these nitro complexes transform to coordinate nitrates reacting with CO species to generate nontoxic N2 and CO2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

127,"Introduction Diaphragmatic myopotential oversensing (dMPO) by implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) is thought to be a rare condition that can be misdiagnosed as lead failure and lead to unnecessary lead replacement. We observed several cases of dMPO in patients with Sorin/LivaNova ICDs (MicroPort Sci.). We sought to systematically assess the incidence of dMPO in patients with Sorin/LivaNova ICDs. Methods and Results A predefined number of 100 consecutive patients with Sorin/LivaNova ICDs were prospectively included in the device clinic of our center. Stored arrhythmia episodes were checked for spontaneous dMPO. In addition, we performed provocation maneuvers by Valsalva. At least one episode of spontaneous or provoked dMPO was seen in 12 (12%) of the 100 patients included in the study (86% males, median age: 66 years). Nine of 89 patients (10%) with true bipolar and 3 of 11 patients (27%) with integrated bipolar sensing configuration were affected. Spontaneous dMPO was observed in 7 of 58 patients (12%) with sensitivity programmed to 0.4 mV and in 2 of 42 patients (5%) with sensitivity programmed to 0.6 mV (not significant). In three patients, dMPO could be provoked with no spontaneous episodes recorded. In two nonpacemaker-dependent patients with a CRT-D, ventricular pacing was temporarily inhibited. No antitachycardia therapy was triggered by dMPO in any patient. Conclusions DMPO is frequent in patients with Sorin/LivaNova ICDs, especially with sensitivity programmed to 0.4 mV. It also frequently occurs with true bipolar sensing configuration. DMPO should not be misinterpreted as lead failure to avoid unnecessary lead replacement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

130,"Rapid and sensitive detection techniques for foodborne pathogens are important to the food industry. However, traditional detection methods rely on bacterial culture in combination with biochemical tests, a process that typically takes 4-7 days to complete.

The designed primers were highly specific for their respective target gene fragments. As the selected primers follow the principles of similar melting and annealing temperature, all the targeted genes could be detected for one strain with the same PCR program.

131,"Integration of renewable energy sources into a distribution system requires adjustments and improvement of the existing relay protection systems. Application of the three-phase reclosing in radial distribution networks often leads to the island operation of the distributed power generation, which causes the generator's disconnection from the network.

133,"With the analysis on the drawbacks of the traditional direct power control for three-phase pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier, including the unfixed switching frequency, the higher grid-side current harmonic component, and the longer system setting time, one method of the model predictive direct power control based on error correction for three-phase voltage source PWM rectifier is proposed in this paper. Based on instantaneous power theory, the PWM rectifier model predictive objective function of is built. Its partial derivative is calculated to predict the variations of active and reactive power in the next sampling period and achieve the tracking control for the given power of the next period. The second-order Lagrange interpolation method is introduced to correct the predict power to achieve the minimum error of active and reactive power between actual value and the predicted value. Instead of switch table, space vector PWM is adopted to drive the power switch of rectifier. This method simplifies power control inner-loop structure and is able to achieve the fixed switching frequency. The experimental results show that this method has better dynamic and static performance; the system is not sensitive to the change of inductance parameters; it can reduce the total harmonic distortion of grid current effectively and improve the power factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
134,"A new soft-punch-through (SPT) buffer concept for 600-1200 V insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) based on thin wafer technology is proposed. The new SPT structure employs an epitaxial layer for the lightly doped n-type drift region, which is grown on a thick starting material or substrate. The n-type substrate serves as the SPT buffer region. The doping concentration of both drift and buffer regions are comparably low with the buffer region having a higher doping level. The design options of this new concept are discussed based on experimental data and 1200 V IGBTs using the new buffer concept are compared to IGBTs employing previously published buffer technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,"Although compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) have been in the market for a long time, many of them do not achieve the same power factor as the incandescent lamps do, which appears to be a significant problem for the utility with the current widespread use of CFLs for household lightings. A single-stage single-switch electronic ballast with active power factor correction is presented in this study for CFL applications. Unlike other single-switch ballast circuits, the presented integrated dual-boost converter circuit can produce a symmetric bipolar square-wave voltage, thus generating a near-pure high-frequency sinusoidal voltage on the lamp, which is beneficial to the CFL lifetime. Moreover, its soft-switching variant can achieve the ZVZC turn-on and ZV turn-off for the MOSFET to improve the conversion efficiency. Detailed operating principles and circuit analysis of the proposed circuit have been provided in this study. Simulation and experimental results on a prototype of a 15 W CFL validate the theoretical analysis and highlight the merits of the presented work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,"Diode rectifiers are widely used in many applications, and therefore, there is a need for an accurate model to study the rectifiers. Because of the complexity and time consuming of the analytical model of rectifiers, the average value modeling has been introduced. This paper proposes a novel average value model (AVM) for the line-commutated rectifier bridge supplied with an unbalanced power source. The unbalance condition, here, refers to the asymmetry of the three-phase voltage magnitude and the three-phase impedance, which is possible due to the occurrence of asymmetry in the sources with winding such as power sources, generators, and transformers. According to the three-phase input current of the rectifier, one cycle is divided into some intervals, and the differential equation for each interval is provided. Then, utilizing these equations, the average value of the derivative of the load current is derived from which the average value of the load current and voltage can be calculated. The proposed AVM is then verified using simulation and experimental results for the diode rectifier bridge with the load of the brushless synchronous generator field winding. Besides, the model is investigated for different load and supply parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

138,"Contribution This study reveals that the programming paradigm is relevant to obtain advanced programming skills. Background Parallel computing has become mandatory for computer science students. The increasing amount of computational resources required by emerging applications need experienced programmers that fully exploit hardware resources. However, the hardware platforms and programming languages to leverage them evolve at a dizzying pace, making very challenging for students the successful learning of the continuously changing high-performance computing concepts. Research Questions (a) Is the learning curve of the programming language too steep to begin learning parallel programming fundamentals? (b) Are emergent learning methodologies making even more difficult to learn parallel programming in general? Methodology It is analyzed the main challenges for succeeding in parallel programming courses at the undergraduate level in two different learning modalities, namely on-campus and online. It is analyzed the main tools available within a learning management system, showing their impact on online studies. Findings Our results reveal that the steep learning curve for parallel programming is one of the main barriers to student success, leading to an early drop out of the subject. On-campus studies mitigate this problem through a close relationship between students and educators. Online studies, however, do not have this tight relationship by its definition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,"This paper aims at assessing a custom numerical procedure built to predict the level of stress in the structural components and equipment in proximity of a cannon-like weapon system when firing. In such a blast scenario, the structures adjacent to a gun may undergo sudden and unwanted damages, since they are commonly subjected to the blast load due to the impingement and propagation of the shock waves expanding from the weapon muzzle. The proposed procedure pertains the coupled use of an in-house developed tool (GUNWave3D) based on the power-law scaling technique and a general-purpose commercial fast dynamic solver to compute the structural response of the loaded components. The in-house tool, in particular, allows one to rapidly calculate the blast parameters over the surfaces of the items of interest in the function of the weapon characteristics and launch conditions, also accounting for the asymmetric shape characterizing the gun blast wave. Taking as reference the numerical free field peak overpressure profiles of a 30 mm gun, whose blast quantities were already validated in a previously published work, the final stage of the assessment was accomplished. Such an estimation consists of the comparison between the structural stresses calculated using the blast loads predicted through the in-house tool and those computed adopting the free spherical air blast of the tri-nitro-toluene model. This operation has the objective to quantify the discrepancy between the computational results of two Lagrangian techniques that can be alternatively adopted in industrial gun blast design procedures and methodologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

141,"Inspired by the polymeric ""soft"" properties and divisional isolation of tandem processes in natural systems, an artificial reactor with self-screened catalytic ability was fabricated with a polymeric tri-layer architecture. The non-responsive middle layer encapsulated catalytic metal nanoparticles, while the two outer layers consisted of a negatively and a positively thermosensitive imprinted polymer. The inverse responsiveness of the outer layers induced switchable shapes, which led to alterable tandem channeling to the reactive middle layer and, as a result, the divisional admission of different substrates. This way, the reactor led to the formation of self-screened catalytic ability. The design for this artificial reactor offers promising prospects for struggling tandem catalysts, suggesting opportunities to develop schedulable tandem processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,"In this paper, we present our novel platform called Bo_CEM. It is composed of three levels: QoE Data Sources, QoE Monitoring System, and QoE Management System. The QoE Data Sources is an umbrella retrieving information from all sources. The monitoring systems are based on fuzzy logic in order to design a novel unique value called QoE score which is our main contribution as it uses customer profile indicators in addition to network KPIs. Finally, the QoE Management System is a high level of decision using the QoE Score as decision metric. The utility of the model is validated via three cases: The first one consists on the enhancement of the troubleshooting prioritization process for NOC Teams. The use of our new approach leads to increasing the operator's profit while customers still satisfied by the expected QoS. The second used case presents a new approach for SON Mobility Load Balancing. It allows the enhancement of the traffic load over network and increases the average QoE_score per e-NodeB.

143,"Stiffened and unstiffened fillet-welded tube-to-transverse plate connection details are widely used for mast-arm and base-plate connections for highway sign structures. However, due to repetitive wind loads, cyclic fatigue stresses are induced and they are the primary source of failure in welded connections at these locations. The resistance of fatigue critical details has been an on-going research topic because of limited experimental results and the variability in existing fatigue testing results. The main objective of this study is to evaluate fatigue resistance of fillet-welded tube connection details by utilizing the advanced fatigue tool in ANSYS Workbench platform. Finite Element (FE) models development and model validation using existing test data was presented. The resulting fatigue resistance from FE analysis was expressed in terms of fatigue life, fatigue damage, and fatigue safety factor to determine the fatigue performance of fillet-welded connections. Existing fatigue test data was grouped to perform a synthetic analysis and then analysis results were provided to determine input data and fatigue limit for the fatigue module.

Conventional methods always assume that both the sketch and photo face images have the same resolutions. However, in real criminal detection, the target facial sketches obtained by the artist usually have different resolutions against the source photos in the mug-shot database. In this paper, we propose a locality-constrained feature space learning (LCFSL) method to address the above cross-resolution sketch-photo facial images matching problem. The proposed LCFSL approach not only build bridge to associate cross-domain face images, but also can learn resolution robust representation features for cross-resolution sketch-photo face recognition purpose. After common feature space learning, we simply use nearest neighbor classifier to perform recognition based on the projected features obtained from sketch-photo faces with different resolutions.

As an alternative, power line is proposed as a transmission media to combat the high loss.

147,"In this paper, we propose a banknote aging simulator for generating aged banknotes from new banknotes. When new banknotes begin to be circulated, automatic teller machines (ATMs) are trained with these new banknotes. However, the ATM operations become more erroneous after several months as the banknotes start aging. Also, the process of updating ATM software for aged banknotes is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we developed a simulator for banknote aging that uses the Gaussian and Perlin noise models. The proposed simulator allows ATMs to better handle aged and soiled banknotes without updating ATM software. The experimental results show that the classification and validation performance of aged and soiled banknotes improved noticeably when the classification and validation algorithms were designed using the proposed simulator for new banknotes.

148,"Structured glass-fiber catalysts (GFC) are considered for application in the process of oxidation of endogenous SO2 directly in the media of flue gases from coal-fired powerplants. Such oxidation may be used for conditioning of flue gases to improve the efficiency of ash particulates in electrostatic precipitators. Comparison of Pt-based and vanadia-based GFC showed the much better performance by Pt/GFCs, having much higher activity and significantly lower ignition temperature (similar to 300 degrees C). The best performance is demonstrated by Pt/GFC synthesized by high-temperature synthesis method in combination with spraying of active component precursor solution on the glass-fiber support surface instead of conventional impregnation. Application of structured GFC cartridges makes possible to apply them directly inside the flue gas duct with appropriate pressure drop. High permeability of such cartridges makes possible to apply them in the gas fluid contaminated with ash particulates with minimized risk of clogging.

149,"We consider the well-known wireless fair opportunistic schedulers (mainly the alpha-fair schedulers) and analyze their price of fairness (PoF). Efficient scheduler, designed from the system perspective, maximizes the sum of accumulated utilities of all the agents, accumulated over several time slots. On the other hand, the fair schedulers deviate from such a schedule to provide a given level of fairness to various customers utilizing the system. This obviously results in a lower (total) accumulated utility. We study this loss, using the well-known performance measure, the price of fairness. Previous studies show that the PoF mostly increases, as the number of agents increases. We have very different results for opportunistic schedulers. We group agents into finite classes, each class having identical utilities and QoS requirements (inspired by wireless cellular networks), to obtain the asymptotic PoF (APoF). This is always below one. Further, in many cases, the PoF actually decreases to zero/negligible value as the number of agents increases. We also consider the case of multiple resources with bounded utilities. We again have zero/small APoF, depending upon the distributions of the utilities and the relative proportions of various classes. We derive closed-form/easily computable expressions for the APoF, using extreme-value theory, center-order statistics and the maximum theorem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,"We explore options for improving the rigidity of a framework if the modeled building presents cubic symmetries. Braces are used to provide resistance to lateral loads in the framework. These cubic symmetries allow us to use a graph theoretical model and the possibility of a more accurate prediction of the rigidity of the braced cubic structure.

In Asia, the most prominent process safety incident was the 1984 Bhopal accident in India that greatly impacted the chemical industry. Today, it is the prerequisite for the management of major hazards installations (MHIs) such as petroleum refining, petrochemical manufacturing facilities, and chemical processing plants to be fully aware of their responsibility to ensure meeting safety, health, and environment requirements. Any MHI failure would not only lead to operation slowdown that result in financial loss, but also to worst-case scenarios. One typical example is hazardous material release to the atmosphere as occurred in Bhopal which can result in catastrophic consequence.We must always maintain a sense of vulnerability, learning from past incidents, adherence to code of practices, and standards for new as well as existing equipment. Such a proactive approach will definitely reduce the risk of MHI to as low as reasonably applicable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Special attention is devoted to novel theoretical approaches employed in event generators of hadronic interactions and to the impact of experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In relation to studies of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), differences between various predictions for basic characteristics of UHECR-induced extensive air showers in the atmosphere are analyzed and traced down to differences in the respective treatments of hadronic interactions. Possibilities to discriminate between the alternative approaches, based on LHC and UHECR data, are demonstrated and the relation to UHECR primary composition is outlined. Finally, in relation to direct studies of charged cosmic rays, potential improvements of the treatment of cosmic ray interactions at low and intermediate energies are discussed. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

155,This study produces a skewed-imaginary planar rack cutter with discrete conical teeth that is used to create a helical gear with discrete ring-involute teeth. A mathematical equation for the skewed-imaginary rack cutter with discrete conical teeth is firstly solved. The coordinate system for the rack cutter and gear pair is then established and a family of the rack-cutter surfaces is obtained using homogeneous coordinate transformation. The relative velocity method is used to produce the equation for meshing between the rack cutter and the gear pair. Substituting the equation of meshing into the family of the rack-cutter surfaces gives the mathematical models for the gear pair with discrete ring-involute teeth. The transmission error for the gear pair is calculated using the assembly error and a tooth contact analysis. A computer-aided design software package is used to establish solid model for the gear pair. A software interference function is used to simulate the contact condition for the gear pair for various assembly errors. Finite element analysis software is then used to determine the contact stress for the gear pair. The transmission error and the contact stress for the gear pair are insensitive to any horizontal misalignment in the assembly errors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,"A comparison is presented between the experimental dynamic behavior of detuned AlInGaAs ridge waveguide distributed feedback lasers operating at O band and C band at two different temperatures. The nominal center wavelengths at 25 degrees C for the set of devices studied were 1270, 1310, and 1550 nm. Preliminary static characterization of the samples showed consistent trends between wavelength detuning, characteristic temperature, and power output. For all set of samples, the characteristic temperature was substantially higher for the samples detuned to longer wavelengths (red) at room temperature. At the temperature of 85 degrees C, a higher power efficiency was observed for those samples that thermally shifted nearer the peak optical gain. Resonance frequencies were extracted at 25 degrees C and 85 degrees C by means of electro-optical transmission measurements and relative intensity noise measurements. The extracted values confirmed that at room temperature the samples detuned to shorter wavelengths (blue) showed the highest modulation efficiencies. At the temperature of 85 degrees C, however, the wavelength and optical gain thermal shift makes those same samples to have the lowest resonant frequencies. The dynamic trends over temperature were clearer for the O band set of samples, while the detuning had a less pronounced effect at C band. The range of maximum resonance frequencies studied was from 12 to 14 GHz, which makes the devices suitable for uncooled communication applications at multi-gigabit data rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, most of the conventional mineral separators exploit a single physical property difference for beneficiation.

Mathematical formulations were developed for conceptual MPMS, where physical properties of particles such as density, magnetic susceptibility, and surface work function will be exploited in a single separator. Simulations were carried out for tracing particle trajectories in MPMS using MATLAB. Simulation results indicate that separation efficiency can be enhanced by exploiting multiple physical properties of particles simultaneously in a single separator.

Experimental results and validation using prototype MPMS will be reported in near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

164,"The commonly used normal-temperature air-thawing method is time-consuming and cannot achieve constant temperature thawing. Furthermore, microwave thawing consumes a considerable amount of electricity. These two common thawing methods cannot guarantee food quality. Thus, a new type of constant air-temperature thawing system (CATT) that uses compressor casing thermal storage is designed and tested in this study. Results show that the CATT has faster speed than the air-thawing method. Furthermore, although the thawing speed of CATT is slower than that of microwave thawing, food with 274.25 g thawing quality can save 0.2 kW h of electricity per iteration. The weight loss of CATT at 34 degrees C was 64.6% of that of microwave thawing. The weight loss of CATT at 46 degrees C was 40.8% of that of microwave thawing. When thawing at a constant temperature of 46 degrees C, the thawing time required for the central temperature of chicken meat to increase from -8 to 10 degrees C is 2 hr. The thermal storage material can decrease compressor noise effectively by 17.65%. Practical Applications The thawing of frozen food is a common problem. Hence, this paper proposes a new thawing method based on the residual heat of the refrigerator compressor casing. This method does not need to consume other energy and instead uses directly waste heat generated by the compressor casing to thaw frozen food. Frozen food can be thawed naturally at a constant temperature by controlling the temperature of the thawing chamber, and consequently, the disadvantages of long-term air thawing and poor quality of microwave thawing are improved. The application of this method can increase the thawing function of the refrigerator and has considerable application prospects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
165,"In this paper, a parallel group detection (PGD) algorithm is proposed in order to address the degradation in the bit error rate (BER) performance of linear detectors when they are used in high-load massive MIMO systems. The algorithm is constructed by converting the equivalent extended massive MIMO system into two subsystems, which can be simultaneously detected by the classical detection procedures. Then, using the PGD and the classical ZF as well as the QR-decomposition- (QRD-) based detectors, we proposed two new detectors, called ZF-based PGD (ZF-PGD) and QRD-based PGD (QRD-PGD). The PGD is further combined with the sorted longest basis (SLB) algorithm to make the signal recovery more accurate, thereby resulting in two new detectors, namely, the ZF-PGD-SLB and the QRD-PGD-SLB. Various complexity evaluations and simulations prove that the proposed detectors can significantly improve the BER performance compared to their classical linear and QRD counterparts with the practical complexity levels. Hence, our proposed detectors can be used as efficient means of estimating the transmitted signals in high-load massive MIMO systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally we analyze a new design proposal with active cooling for the consolidation of the PS external dump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
167,"This document studies the problem of near-field pattern uniformity in high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. The existence of such inhomogeneity is related to the composition of the global near field radiation pattern of the receiving antennas in the MRI system. For the MRI image uniformity enhancement, two approaches are proposed in order to obtain the optimal image in terms of the acquisition process and subsequent post-processing. The first one is based on a progressive variation of the antenna phase feeding in the array distribution, either at each arraying or between rings, which lets reduce the radial inhomogeneity between the central value (maximum) and the rest of the surrounding values. The second one is based on a progressive variation (rotation) of the antenna location in the array distribution, which lets reduce the pattern ripples at the outer cylindrical rings of the volume under test. In this work, a metaheuristic optimization strategy has been selected to obtain the optimal configuration. This optimal configuration implies angular rotation and the addition of feeding phase values to strain ripple reduction and pattern uniformity, depending on the particular size of the cylinder volume that conforms the volume under exploration for image acquisition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to analyze the effects of PIEs on reflector's average power pattern. Whether for the PIEs of each ring of panels or for the PIEs of all the panels for the whole reflector, the proposed model can be used to calculate the average power pattern with the root-mean-square value of the PIEs, and its correctness is demonstrated by the results calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. For a given paneled reflector, the peak gain losses and the first side lobe level increments caused by different PIEs for the whole reflector are presented. Then, through an analysis for each ring of panels, including the effects of different amplitude aperture distribution functions and different ratios of focal length to diameter (F/D ratios), the results clearly show that the PIEs of the panels for different rings have different effects on the reflector's average power pattern, and valuable results are obtained. The derived results will greatly benefit the panel installation and adjustment of large reflector antennas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
170,"A compact monopolar microstrip patch antenna (MPA) with enhanced-bandwidth is proposed. In order to achieve the miniaturized patch, the zeroth-order mode of the MPA instead of its higher-order modes is employed at first by loading the shorting pin around the center of the patch. After that, a L-shaped microstrip line with a shorting pin is introduced at the periphery of the patch radiator to excite an additional non-radiative mode for bandwidth enhancement. In final, the proposed MPA is fabricated and measured. The results illustrate that the antenna generates an enhanced-bandwidth of about 4.1% ranging from 2.39 to 2.49 GHz, which is significantly larger than that of the traditional MPA around 1%. Meanwhile, the dimensions of the radiating patch are obviously decreased down due to the employment of zeroth-order mode, which are kept as small as about 0.17 lambda(0) x 0.22 lambda(0) x 0.026 lambda(0) (lambda(0) is the free-space wavelength).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

172,"Aggregation-induced emission (AIE), as a special phenomenon of fluorescence, can elegantly overcome the fluorescence quenching caused by common fluorescent materials under high concentration conditions and has attracted interest of researchers in many fields. Particularly AIE-active polymer nanoparticles have been widely utilized in a modern biomedical research. In this work, we prepared a novel kind of AIE-active fluorescent polymeric nanoparticals (Dex-OH-CHO) through a facile esterification between a new hydrophobic AIE-active 1, 8-naphthalimide derivative and the hydrophilic dextran. The structure and optical properties of Dex-OH-CHO were characterized in detail by FTIR, H-1 NMR, XPS, TEM and fluorescence spectra. The results showed that Dex-OH-CHO emitted light-blue fluorescence in aqueous solution with high fluorescent quantum yield (phi = 24.43%, concentration is 20 mu g/mL), low CMC (5 mu g/mL), good photostability, high water solubility and well dispersivity. Moreover, good biocompatibility and ideal cell uptake made Dex-OH-CHO had a great application potential in biological imaging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

174,"Temperature has always been considered as an essential factor for almost all kinds of semiconductor-based electronic components. In this work, temperature-dependent synaptic plasticity behaviors, which are mimicked by the indium-gallium-zinc oxide thin-film transistors gated with sputtered SiO2 electrolytes, have been studied. With the temperature increasing from 303 to 323 K, the electrolyte capacitance decreases from 0.42 to 0.11 mu F cm(-2). The mobility increases from 1.4 to 3.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), and the threshold voltage negatively shifts from -0.23 to -0.51 V. Synaptic behaviors under both a single pulse and multiple pulses are employed to study the temperature dependence. With the temperature increasing from 303 to 323 K, the post-synaptic current (PSC) at the resting state increases from 1.8 to 7.3 mu A. Under a single gate pulse of 1 V and 1 s, the PSC signal altitude and the PSC retention time decrease from 2.0 to 0.7 mu A and 5.1 x 10(2) to 2.5 ms, respectively. A physical model based on the electric field-induced ion drifting, ionic-electronic coupling, and gradient-coordinated ion diffusion is proposed to understand these temperature-dependent synaptic behaviors. Based on the experimental data on individual transistors, temperature-modulated pattern learning and memorizing behaviors are conceptually demonstrated. The in-depth investigation of the temperature dependence helps pave the way for further electrolyte-gated transistor-based neuromorphic applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
175,"The differences between N- and N+ buried layers in improving the breakdown voltage of RESURF (reduced surface field) LDMOSFETs (lateral double-diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors) are discussed in this paper.

The analytical solution quantitatively demonstrates the variation of the drift charge concentration and its dependence on the key NBL and NFL parameters. It also indicates that the NBL LDMOS achieves a superior tradeoff between specific on-resistance (R-s,R-on)and breakdown voltage (BV) to the NFL LDMOS.

177,"Foundations are a vital part of structures. Over time, the foundations can deteriorate due to unforeseen overloads and/or settlements, resulting in the appearance of cracks in the concrete. These cracks produce changes in the static and dynamic behavior of the affected foundation, which alter its load carrying capacity. In this work, non-destructive techniques of relative simplicity of application are presented for the detection, location, and quantification of damage, using numerical models, solved with the finite element method and Power Series. For this, two types of parameters are used: static (displacement and elastic curvature) and dynamics (natural frequencies). In the static analysis, the damage detection is done by means of a finite elements model representing a beam supported on an elastic foundation with a discrete crack that varies in length and location. With regard to dynamic analysis, the governing equations of the model are presented and a method based on Power Series is used to obtain the solution for a data set, which could be the Winkler coefficient, the location of the crack or the frequency. In order to validate the proposed methodologies, these techniques are applied to data obtained from laboratory tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
178,"The mode perturbation method (MPM) is suitable and efficient for solving the eigenvalue problem of a nonuniform soil deposit whose property varies with depth. However, results of the MPM do not always converge to the exact solution, when the variation of soil deposit property is discontinuous. This discontinuity is typical because soil is usually made up of sedimentary layers of different geologic materials. Based on the energy integral of the variational principle, a new mode perturbation method, the energy-based mode perturbation method (EMPM), is proposed to address the convergence of the perturbation solution on the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes and is able to find solution whether the soil properties are continuous or not. First, the variational principle is used to transform the variable coefficient differential equation into an equivalent energy integral equation. Then, the natural mode shapes of the uniform shear beam with same height and boundary conditions are used as Ritz function. The EMPM transforms the energy integral equation into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations which significantly simplifies the eigenvalue solution of the soil layer with variable properties. Finally, the accuracy and convergence of this new method are illustrated with two case study examples. Numerical results show that the EMPM is more accurate and convergent than the MPM. As for the mode shapes of the uniform shear beam included in the EMPM, the additional 8 modes of vibration are sufficient in engineering applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
179,"The characteristics of square twin surface jets at various offset heights from the free surface were studied using a particle image velocimetry technique. The offset heights were varied from 1 to 4 nozzle widths at a fixed Reynolds number of 3890. The entrainment and mixing characteristics were examined using the potential core length, merging point, combined point, maximum velocity decay, half-velocity width and were found be nearly independent of offset height in near field. The jet-surface interaction was examined by surface velocity, vorticity thickness and surface turbulence intensities. The growth rate of the vorticity thickness reduced in the interaction region; and was more severe for shorter offset height. Turbulent structures were examined using weighted joint probability density function and two-point cross-correlations between swirling strength and velocity fluctuations. Weaker turbulent events were observed for deeper jet close to a free surface at the streamwise location beyond the attachment point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
180,"Reliability of a wireless communication system depends on the performance metric of the oscillators employed. In this paper, we have discussed the commonly used oscillator architectures, their equivalent RLC circuits and the influence of the inductor performance on the oscillator design. Inductors designed for the oscillators are fabricated in 180 nm CMOS process. Inductors are implemented with 20 k top metal layer of the P1M6 layer architecture. Two-turns twisted and 3-turns spiral shape inductors are fabricated with and without the substrate shield, respectively. Twisted shape inductor with the floating substrate shield has higher Q-factor due to low substrate loss. To further validate the performance of inductors, digitally controlled oscillators (DCO's) are designed around the inductors and simulated for its phase noise performances.

181,"The paper presents numerical investigations of 921A steel target plates impacted by truncated nosed alloy steel projectiles. The material point method is used to simulate and analyse the problem. Decohesion is an important failure mode to solve the fracture mode, because its constitutive equation is established to solve the local discontinuous fracture problem. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The error of the break diameter is only 2.6% compared with the experimental data. The residual velocity agrees well with the experiment under six different conditions, and the error is less than 10%. The failure behaviour of the frame is similar to the actual situation, and the failure modes are almost the same. The penetration effects of different nosed projectiles are also compared, which verifies the conclusion that different contact forms lead to different failure modes. The results of this study show that MPM with decohesion can be well used to simulate the penetration problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
182,"The work safety level is a reflection of the work safety situation, but in the past, we simply used a single absolute indicator or a single relative indicator to measure the work safety level, which is inadequate.

According to the evaluation results, we grade the work safety level of geographic and economic regions, and find the gap in different provinces and regions. Our analysis suggests that the work safety level in different provinces and regions basically accords with the stage of industrialization process, but the fluctuated data analysis indicates that the theory of the relationship between the work safety and industrialization process has its defects, and the warped-tail phenomenon of work safety level in the final and mature stage of industrialization process is thus pointed out.

183,"The existing database of the loading response of offshore pile foundations needs to be enriched, so that safety and economic considerations can be optimally balanced in design. This paper details a programme of field tests on an open-ended steel pile. The pile with a diameter of 2 m was driven to a depth of 72.8 m in a stratified soil site and then subjected to monotonic compressive, tensile and lateral loadings. Resting periods were allowed before each test to enable strength recovery, and a period of about one month was found to be sufficient (i.e., the axial bearing capacity increases from about 10 MN to 25 MN). The test results were interpreted in terms of the internal forces and displacements/deformations of the pile, and the more detailed pile-soil interactions (i.e., q(s)-s and p-y curves). It is found that, for cohesive soils, the unit shaft resistance q(s) remains constant through each soil layer regardless of the almost linearly varying undrained shear strength s(u) obtained from CPTu tests, and the soil layer with overall higher s(u) does not guarantee greater q(s) owing to different proportions of silty and clayey components. Upon reaching the ultimate uplift load, the shaft resistance within the cohesive soils shows a clear softening response. Extensive comparisons were made between these results and the predictions from existing design methods wherever applicable to discuss the accuracy of each.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

185,"Patient-specific computational models are powerful tools which may assist in predicting the outcome of invasive surgery on the musculoskeletal system, and consequently help to improve therapeutic decision-making and post-operative care. Unfortunately, at present the use of personalized models that predict the effect of biopsies and full excisions is so specialized that tends to be restricted to prominent individuals, such as high-profile athletes. We have developed a finite element analysis model to determine the influence of the location of an ellipsoidal excision (14.2 mm x 11.8 mm) on the structural integrity of a human skull when exposed to impact loading, representing a free fall of an adult male from standing height. The finite element analysis model was compared to empirical data based on the drop-tower testing of three-dimensional-printed physical skull models where deformations were recorded by digital image correlation. In this bespoke example, we found that the excision site did not have a major effect on the calculated stress and strain magnitudes unless the excision was in the temporal region, where the reduction in stiffness around the excision caused failure within the neighboring area. The finite element analysis model allowed meaningful conclusions to be drawn for the implications of using such a technique based on what we know about such conditions indicating that the approach could be both clinically beneficial and also cost-effective for wider use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
186,"The capability of time-shifting-based phase difference method against noise can be considerably improved with the increase of the translation coefficient. However, the anti-noise performance of the traditional method is limited due to the wrapped phase problem. In order to obtain high accuracy of estimate, this paper proposes an improved phase interpolation estimator which is derived in terms of the time-shifting-based phase difference method. First, the estimator utilizes three segments of signal in the time domain to build two sets of frequency estimate. Then the absolute difference of the frequency estimate between the two sets can be calculated. Subsequently, four frequency estimates with minimal absolute difference are selected. Finally, the one in four frequencies owning maximum energy is selected as the final frequency estimate. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm can overcome the wrapped phase problem to some extent and can achieve better noise immunity than traditional algorithms.

187,"Key management solutions are cornerstone requirements for any security service. Due to resource limitations, public key cryptographic (PKC) solutions are unsuitable for IoT devices like sensors of WSN. Consequently we opt for key predistribution schemes (KPS) to preload lightweight symmetric cryptographic keys and later establish them. KPS are designed over random and/or combinatorial graphs and requires several devices to share individual keys (conventionally r many). This causes a dip in the resultant system's resilience. Cichon et al. [10] introduces a technique that involve recursive use of a one-way function to distinguish each key's cycle and improve the given system's resilience. Bechkit et al. [2,3] considers a cryptographic hash function to form their hash chains (KPS), i.e., HC(x) for a given KPS x. They construct hash chains according to node identifiers (ids) and consider modulo n, (n is an element of Z(+)) to reduce hash chains. This paper uses signed weighted graph (SWG) to conceal node ids in the key sharing graph of the underlying KPS x during short-lived key establishment phase (KEP). The concealment of information permits distinct indexing of each sensor according their position in the cycles of preloaded keys. Resultant system remains distributed with improved resilience and is independent of other parameters. In this way, a new class of KPS, named as key-node indexed hash chains (KPS), i.e., KNIHC(x) for the selected KPS x is proposed. It eliminates smart attack (SA). Moreover being fully connected (due to choice of underlying KPS), the proposed system supports mobility. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
188,"Mechanical expansion is the key process in the manufacture of giant metallic ring. The mechanical expansion process of a 10-m-class aluminium alloy ring is taken as the research object in this paper. First, based on the springback theory of small curvature plane bending, the springback ratio formula is derived for the wall thickness centre-line of the ring cross section after unloading, and the mechanical expansion stroke model is established by the mould displacement compensation method. Then, a calculation method for mechanical expansion force is proposed by considering the friction between the mould arc surface and the ring inner wall. Moreover, a finite element model (FEM) is established to simulate the mechanical expansion process of a 10-metre-class aluminium alloy ring using MSC_Marc.

Two heat and fluid flow configurations are generally found to establish inside the cavity, according as the cylinders are located at close distance or at such a distance that the effects of the lateral walls of the cavity become important, each of these configurations being distinguished by the existence of an optimum inter-cylinder spacing which maximizes the overall heat transfer rate.

We, therefore, prepared acrylonitrile butadiene styrene human skull models based on clinical computed tomography skull data using a three-dimensional printer. Six replicate physical skull models were tested, three with bone excisions and three without. A drop tower was used to simulate the impact sustained by falling backwards onto the occipital lobe region. The impacts were recorded with a high-speed camera, and the occipital strain response was determined by digital image correlation. Although the hole affected neither the magnitude nor the sequence of the fracture pattern, the digital image correlation analysis highlighted an increase in strain around the excised area (0.45%-16.4% of the principal strain).

The investigation aims to evaluate the convenience of the reinforced sand, with a view to face of the scarcity of used materials, and also for socio-economic development in northern-Africa Sahara regions.

These indicate that inclusion of single geotextile liner increases the sand CBR value by 73%. The inclusion of two geotextile layers increases this ratio more than 6 times. This makes the sand to pass from a low bearing material to a good supporting novel composite product.

Different from existing work on machine current sensor FDI, the proposed method addresses the sensor FDI problem under co-existence of PMSM current sensor and non-sensor imbalance faults, and thereby help prevent the controller performance degradation caused by a faulty machine current sensor signal. Meanwhile, hardware protection is achieved through the proposed algorithm which has a unique feature of providing online overcurrent regulation and source power management at the same time to enhance protection of power inverter and power source. Benchmark comparison of the proposed sensor FDI method to state-of-the-art techniques is carried out to validate the good performance of the proposed FDI method in terms of fault detection time, false detection rate and missed detection rate. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed current management algorithm with overcurrent regulation and source power management is performed under changing rotor flux linkage and machine stator d-axis self-inductance, as an example to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm for hardware protection against system parameter variations.

196,"Herein a new polymer processing method referred to as Melt-Mastication (MM) is presented as way to substantially improve the thermal and mechanical properties of Polypropylene (iPP) and other semi-crystalline polymers. MM is a low temperature mixing technique that subjects molten iPP to chaotic flow under at temperatures between the melting and crystallization temperatures, thereby promoting flow induced crystallization (FIC). The resulting materials demonstrate an unusual crystal morphology that is highly crystalline by thermal calorimetry (57% crystal volume fraction), melts at a temperature 10.3 K higher than conventionally processed iPP, and demonstrates melt memory after annealing at 200 degrees C. The highly crystalline morphology does not show birefringence in polarized optical microscopy and by SEM and AFM appears to be comprised of largely disorganized lamellar crystals, with possible stacked ordering in local (1 mu m) regions. Melt-Masticated iPP demonstrates improved compressive modulus (+77%), strength (+40%), and strain hardening modulus in uniaxial compression, which are attributed to enhanced crystal volume fraction, lamellar crystal thickness, and network connectivity, respectively.

198,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion measurements of surfactants suffer from fast exchange of the surfactant between the micellar aggregate and bulk solution. Therefore, hydrophobic probe molecules are commonly used to directly measure aggregate diffusion under the assumption that the probe molecules remain solubilized inside the micelles. Aggregate size is then determined or estimated from the aggregate diffusion value. Unfortunately, the probe molecule also experiences rapid exchange between the aggregate and bulk, leading to inaccurate or unreasonable micelle diffusion values, a fact that has often been ignored in the literature. In this article, we present a systematic evaluation of probe molecules in cationic and anionic surfactants, obtained by measuring the diffusion of probe molecules with varying hydrophobicity. We find that an octanol-water partition coefficient of at least similar to 5 is required for correct measurements of aggregate diffusion in the systems studied. Notably, some commonly used probes have a partition coefficient much lower than five and are therefore not suitable for aggregate diffusion measurements. Consideration of these results will help researchers obtain accurate results for micelle sizing or partitioning studies with pulsed-field-gradient NMR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach The framework was developed based on function areas where (detached) house fires start, expert opinion and recommendations derived from the published literature on residential fire safety. This framework was applied to a sample of ten public detached house designs to check the applicability of the framework and to determine how safe these designs are from a fire safety perspective.

205,"Nylon 6 fibers are produced by polymerization of caprolactam obtained after oximation and Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone. For this reason, the purity of cyclohexanone used is an important parameter to control the quality of final nylon 6 products. The poor quality of cyclohexanone is related to the presence of some cyclic ketone impurities, such as 2-methylcyclopentanone, n-methylcyclohexanones (n = 2, 3, and 4), and 2-cyclohexen-1-one, which can remain after the purification process of cyclohexanone. In this study, the first step was to study the products promoted during the oximation of these cyclic impurities. The oximation of each impurity was carried out at T = 80 degrees C and pH = 5, and the reaction products were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and NMR Each cyclic oxime promoted a mixture of cis and trans stereoisomers, and the relative production ratio was determined. Additionally, the operating conditions that can affect the oximation step were studied. To do that, cyclohexanone was spiked with the mentioned cyclic impurities, and the oximation reaction was carried out using an aqueous solution of hydroxylammonium sulfate. The effects of experimental conditions, such as temperature (353.15-358.15 K) and pH (3.5-6), were studied. It was found that the higher the temperature, the higher the impurity conversion. However, when the pH was studied, the conversion of impurities presented a maximum due to the oximation mechanism. Additionally, a kinetic model of oximation reaction of cyclohexanone spiked with the cyclic impurities, based on an apparent constant to take into account that the reaction was carried out in two liquid phases, was proposed to explain the experimental results. The apparent kinetic constants obtained for 2-methylcyclohexanone and 2-cyclohexen-1-one were similar but lower than that for 2-methylcyclopentanone. The study was completed promoting the Beckmann rearrangement of the oxime mixtures obtained from the oximation of pure cyclic impurities under mild conditions (sulfuric media at 100 degrees C). The amides produced were identified by gas chromatograph/mass selective detector (GC/MSD). Cis/trans oxime stereoisomers from n-methylcyclohexanones (n = 2 and 3) and 2-methylcydopentanone presented the same reactivity to the corresponding amides, but only(Z)-2-cyclohexen-1-one oxime reacts in the Beckmann rearrangement to produce its cyclic amide.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
206,"A new method approximates transport properties of a homologous series of poly(oxyethylene-ethylene carbonate) copolymer-lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs)-using both dilute and concentrated solution theories. A chemical equilibrium model uses published Fourier-transform infrared data to estimate the concentrations of positively charged ion aggregates, of free anions and negatively charged ion aggregates, of charge-balanced ion aggregates, and of lithium ion adducts with ether and carbonyl oxygen groups in the copolymer. Ion shuttle-hopping and bulk self-diffusivities are estimated using published cation transference number, glass transition temperature, and ionic conductivity data using species concentrations from the chemical equilibrium model. Over a broad range of copolymer composition, salt concentration, and temperature, both ion shuttle-hopping and bulk diffusion contribute to ion transport.

207,"Tieback walls are typically designed using apparent earth pressures that are obtained initially by back-calculating earth pressures from measured support loads for excavation only. For construction activities involving both excavation and backfilling aspects, the use of apparent earth pressures might not be adequate. This paper investigates the performance of two tieback walls constructed using a combination of fill and cut construction sequences. Results obtained from data collected using load cells and strain gages along with the soldier piles of both walls, show the correlation of axial loads and bending moments to construction activities. Results show that some load is transferred to the soldier piles during anchor installation, despite using steel casings to prevent this action. Backfilling behind the wall created significant curvature in the soldier piles based on the measured bending moments. Moreover, results evidence that the apparent earth pressure does not reflect the observed bending moments in the walls. However, a beam model including lateral displacement is presented to represent the measured response in both walls. The results unveil differences in anchor loads estimations, evaluates the appropriateness of apparent earth pressures for the design of tieback walls and provides design recommendations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,"In geotechnical engineering, probability theory can be implemented regarding a reliability-based design to investigate the probability of failure. In this research, a practical probabilistic approach is used to calculate the reliability of a footing design by applying the first-order reliability method (FORM). The reliability and design risk level of deterministic approaches proposed by Iranian code and Eurocode 7 is evaluated. Both the static and seismic designs have been discussed. The distance of the foundation, both near the crest of the slope and away from it, has also been considered. An entire analysis has been done regarding the three most important different soil types to investigate the effect of soil shear strength parameters on reliability. Although the Iranian code presented a more conservative result than Eurocode 7 did in the static design, there was no tangible difference in the seismic mode. Generally, target reliability was not satisfied in any of the deterministic design approaches. In cases where shallow foundations were located near the crest of the slopes, the difference in the results of RBD and deterministic methods would increase. Finally, it can be concluded that the soil type plays an important role in the results obtained from the Iranian code. In granular soils, the reliability of designs based on Iranian code is low (beta = 1.80), so this may be a high risk, which should be considered. On the contrary, the best circumstance (beta = 3.40) was related to the foundations that are based on cohesive soils.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
209,"To improve the cycling performance of nickel-rich layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material, many methods have been studied to reduce cation mixing degree, improve layered structure and modify particle morphology, including doping elements, coating metal oxides and morphology control (spherical, nanoflower, core-shell structure, etc.). In this paper, a new gradient calcination process through four-step temperature gradients is applied to synthesize LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material synthesized by gradient calcination shows more excellent electrochemical performance than traditional method. The XRD results indicate that the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material produced by four-step calcination shows lower cation mixing degree and better crystallinity. In addition, the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode produced by gradient calcination presents the highest initial capacity (177.9 mAh g(-1)) and a retention of 82.07% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. And the material shows the best electrochemical properties when the final temperature in these steps is 820 degrees C. Our results explain the reason why the thermal stability and electrochemical performance could be improved by gradient calcination from the aspect of material crystallinity, crystal defects, cation mixing degree and the completeness of the layered structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
210,"5G, as the next generation of wireless networks, promises very high throughput and low latency to mobile users that calls for a substantial innovation in computing management platforms to attend QoS metrics. Thanks to emerging technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN)/network function virtualization (NFV), many features are available in 5G design to detect and control two types of latency caused by computation and communication. In this paper, taking features of caching mechanisms and SDN into the account, a platform is proposed to minimize latency in 5G via caching big flows intelligently and avoiding bottlenecks that may cause by virtualized computing components. First, the pioneering idea of compromising between the cloud radio access network (CRAN) and mobile edge computing (MEC)/information-centric network (ICN) via dynamic processing location management platform is investigated. Accordingly, a mathematical optimization problem to minimize the average latency is formulated. Due to the problem complexity, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to treat the latency via dynamic orchestration of processing functionalities. Through numerical results, the performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed, and the simulations corroborate our analytical results and illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with acceptable optimality gap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
211,"Zero-sequence current (ZC) occurs due to harmonics and unbalanced loading current. ZC increases the sheath voltage (SV) and cable temperature, so cable faults occur on cable terminations in high-voltage underground cable lines (HVUCL). In literature, bonding methods are used to prevent ZC effects, but these methods are not adequate to prevent ZC effects for long HVUCL under high harmonic distortion because ZC is not considered when these methods are designed. In this study, the modified sectional solid bonding (MSSB) is suggested for long HVUCL that works under high harmonic distortion rate and unbalanced loading conditions. Namely, ZC is considered when MSSB is designed. MSSB parameters should be determined before HVUCL is installed for the most economical and practical bonding. SV of HVUCL should be known to determine MSSB parameters, so SV of HVUCL is forecasted by using adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural networks (ANN), and hybrid ANN. Training and forecasting errors of hybrid ANN are less than ANFIS and ANN methods, so hybrid ANN methods are suggested to forecast SV of HVUCL. Also, MSSB parameters should be optimized, so optimization methods are used for optimization of MSSB. When MSSB method is used for bonding of long HVUCL, harmonic distortion rate and SV in cable terminations are not exceeded the determined limits to prevent cable faults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transmission loss of this stripline structure is significantly lower than that of PCB and low-temperature cofired ceramic stripline structure.

213,"An offshore company intends to develop a new field by installing two wellhead platforms to accommodate the well production from this field. Based on port development plans, the locations of these platforms are closed to port dumping and commercial anchorage areas. This can affect the platform's safety. Therefore, risk assessment and mitigation studies are required to forecast the impact of the new wellhead platform project. In this research, a risk analysis was conducted using a semi-quantitative risk analysis method to determine the value of total external risk that affects the safety of platforms and security of personnel. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to identify the maximum likelihood factors that affect the risk values of platforms. The values for the new platforms were found to high-risk levels. To ensure that the risks are more tolerable, risk mitigation tasks need to be executed. Such tasks should be conducted by the company and related governmental bodies, such that the risk value, can be reduced to medium risk level. The typical risk factor developed in this research can be used by related stakeholders to determine the risk value for the impact of port development on platforms during construction and operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead of placing the linearized system poles at exact locations, ray-like paths in the left hand plane are selected where the poles can freely vary to efficiently exploit the admissible input signal range to increase the speed of response. A stability test for the proposed method is derived via the multivariable circle criterion and the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma. Simulation results demonstrate how the method significantly increases the speed of response in spite of the input constraints compared to fixed pole placement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
216,"Stringer sheet forming enables an efficient production of branched sheet metal structures. Compared to conventional sheet metal components, stringer sheets show a significant increase in stiffness and therefore offer new possibilities for lightweight design. A challenge in stringer sheet forming is the failure due to instability, which appears in the buckling of the stringer in concave curvatures. The prediction of this failure mode is so far only possible by complex numerical simulations. This work introduces an analytical model for the prediction of the buckling failure during forming of concave stringer sheet curvatures under different process boundary conditions. It is derived from Kirchhoff's plate theory. A detailed sensitivity analysis of all influencing parameters is shown and extends the process understanding. The model is validated by means of a 4-point bending test and a stamping process. It can be used for a conservative estimation of the buckling failure limit in stringer sheet forming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
217,"Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519 CE) was one of the most productive geniuses in history. He was painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer whose genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. He also studied rocks and landscapes to improve the realism of his paintings, as well as to increase his knowledge about the surface earth geohazards, in terms of heavy rainfall, floods, and even landslides. The relationship between Leonardo and landslides was never investigated before. For the first time, the present article investigates a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, dating back to 1482-1485, in which he set up a precise description of a rock slump/fall, with its crown, upper scarp, surface of rupture, and debris deposit. This is remarkable as it contributes to expand the scientific dimension of Leonardo, and also calls to a proper consideration about geomorphological hazards inside his studies. This relationship is confirmed by a second drawing by Leonardo, ca. 1512-1518, in which he drew a rock fall at the very moment of collapse, while impacting on two rupestrian settlements. The present article, re-interpreting some material produced by one of the fathers of modern science, is also a tribute of the journal ""Landslide"" to Leonardo da Vinci, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of his passing away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
218,"The present work focuses on the structural, morphological and dielectric characterization of barium titanate films (BTO or BaTiO3 due to its chemical formula) deposited by spin coating on crystalline silicon (Si) substrates and CPW resonators using the Sol-Gel technique with a Ba/Ti molar ratio of 0.5/0.5. The coplanar waveguides were manufactured on alumina substrates (Al2O3) with 3 mu m of gold (Au) metallization using the laser ablation technique. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with X-ray energy dispersion spectrometry (EDS) showed the existence of a BTO film with an elementary composition of 14.62% barium and 5.65% titanium, with a thickness of 0.77 mu m measured using the profilometric mode of the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Dielectric characterization was carried out by comparing the frequency response (parameter S-21) of a CPW resonator with deposited BTO film and another reference resonator (without film) using a network vector analyzer (VNA). These measurements are compared in turn with computational simulations to obtain the dielectric properties. For the BTO film was determined a relative dielectric constant constant (epsilon r) of 160 with a loss tangent (Tan delta) of 0.012 for a frequency of 3.60 GHz. The dielectric constant constant and the ferroelectric property of the material produced are quite promising for applications in microwave circuits, such as miniaturization and tuning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
219,"As an optimization problem, reactive-power compensation (RPC) in distribution networks has variety of technical and economical objectives and constraints. In order to solve the RPC problem, classic and heuristic methods have been applied. In distributed networks with large amounts of equipment, the RPC has a large dimension which could be a challenge for the aforementioned methods. So, having an initial guess or solution for buses that are suitable for compensator installation, lessens the mentioned challenge and thus improves performance of the solution procedures. Applying extended impedance matrix, this paper proposes a method to determine initial solution for the RPC problem. ""Extended"" means loads connected to buses are included in the impedance matrix. Inclusion of loads in the matrix gives more realistic initial solutions. The rationale behind it is that buses with more loads usually need more reactive composition. Two ranking lists of the buses that could be nominated for RPC have been considered in this paper: One list is obtained by the proposed method, and the other by the sensitivity analysis. Comparison of the mentioned lists in two typical distribution systems shows acceptable performance of the proposed method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, an optimisation algorithm for electric field inverse calculation is proposed, which enables non-destructive detection of voltage on overhead transmission lines, enhances the robustness of the algorithm and improves the accuracy of calculation. Firstly, 2D and 3D calculation models of electric field are established. A multimedium calculation model with the operating environment of transmission lines considered is proposed.

Secondly, in order to eliminate the measurement noise and electric field distortion to the electric field measurement data, a modified model based on Kalman filter is constructed. Both multimedium calculation method and Kalman filter are applied to the inverse calculation of electric field as an optimisation electric field inverse solving algorithm.

221,"A new slotted waveguide antenna is proposed in this paper, which opens eight parallel slots along the longitudinal axis at the broad wall of the waveguide as radiation output facets. It has compact slot structure, which greatly reduces the size of the antenna, and the overall longitudinal size of the parallel slot facet is merely 3.8 mm (just slightly larger than half of the operating wavelength). The slot linear array design of the antenna achieves the central trapped wave radiation effect, avoids energy consumption at communication discontinuous zone, and enhances radiation efficiency. The operating bandwidth could be up to 10 GHz, with the center frequency of 85 GHz.

222,"The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using a simple mechanical test to determine the setting time of mortar. The simple mechanical test was carried out on a cantilever PVC pipe filled with fresh mortar. The flexural strain response over time was monitored to investigate the setting process of mortar. The estimated setting time could be compared with that determined by the penetration resistance method. The experimental results show that the strain response of the PVC pipe and mortar can be divided into two stages. The first stage is that the cement mortar has not yet become plastic, and the flexural stress is mainly borne by the PVC pipe. The second stage is that the mortar has become plastic and gradually rigidified and has the ability to bear the flexural stress so that the strain of the PVC pipe decreases with time. Both the initial and final setting times of mortar obtained from the flexural test were in good agreement with those determined by the penetration resistance method. The proposed flexural test can be applied directly to measurement of the setting time of concrete without a need to remove the coarse aggregates larger than #4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
223,"A significant difference was found in the amplitude and polarization spectra of ULF magnetic noise at stations with a base of 120 km during periods of absence of regional thunderstorm activity. A simultaneous analysis of low-frequency data and ionosonde data allowed us to conclude that the difference in the main parameters of the polarization spectrum at two stations is due to the appearance of sporadic E-s layers having a nonuniform horizontal intensity distribution with characteristic scales of the order of the base between stations. A difference in the depth of variations in the polarization parameter epsilon was also found during the ionosphere recovery after magnetic storms. It could be related with Es layers, which had not only a nonuniform intensity distribution, but were also located at different altitudes. A difference was found in the frequency scales of the spectral resonance structure during recording of time variations of its fundamental frequencies. Numerical calculations of the parameter epsilon with specifying model E-s layers and electron-density profiles corrected at the altitudes of the ionospheric F layer adequately explained the observed difference in the magnetic noise spectra and allowed us to determine the altitudes at which the horizontal ionospheric irregularity existed. The studies were carried out on the basis of records of horizontal magnetic components at Radiophysical Research Institute midlatitude observatories Novaya Zhizn (56 degrees N, 45.74 degrees E) and Staraya Pustyn (55.66 degrees N, 43.63 degrees E, 120 km east of the first reception point).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is why, the risk analysis and the study of various effects of different factors that could potentially represent a hazard to a safe long term operation are necessary.

228,"Purpose Lug joints with fasteners play a crucial role in connecting many major components of the aircraft. Most of the failures in the past were credited to the damages initiating and progressing from these types of joints. Ensuring the structural integrity of these fastener joints is a major issue in many engineering structures, especially in aerospace components, which would otherwise lead to fatal failure. The purpose of this paper is to adopting the prognostic approach for analysing these lug joints with fasteners subjected to off-axis loading by estimating the crack initiation and crack growth life of these joints. This data will be useful to estimate the remaining life of these joints at any given stage of operations, which is mandatory in structural health monitoring (SHM). Design/methodology/approach Straight and tapered lug joints are modelled using the finite element method in MSC PATRAN and analysed in MSC NASTRAN. These lug joints are analysed with a push fit fastener. The contact/separation regions at the pin-lug interface are carefully monitored throughout the analysis for various loading conditions. Critical locations in these lug joints are identified through stress analysis. Fatigue crack initiation and fatigue crack growth analysed is carried out at these locations for different load ratios. A computational method is proposed to estimate the cycles to reach crack initiation and cycles at which the crack in the lug joint become critical by integrating several known techniques. Findings Analysis carried out in this paper describes the importance of tapered lug joints, particularly when subjected to non-conventional way of loading, i.e. off-axis loading. There is a partial loss of contact between pin and lug upon pin loading, and this does not change further with monotonically increasing pin load. But during load reversals, there is a change in contact/separation regions which is effectively handled by inequality constraints in the boundary conditions. Crack growth in these lug joints pertains to mixed-mode cracking and is computed through the MVCCI technique. Originality/value Most of the earlier works were carried out on in-plane pin loading along the axis of symmetry of the lug. The current work considers the off-axis pin loading by loading the lug joints with transverse and oblique pin load. The significance of taper angle under such loading condition is brought in this paper. The results obtained in this paper through prognostic approach are of direct relevance to the SHM and damage tolerance design approach where the safety of the structural components is of foremost priority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

230,"Generally, the coprime linear array (CLA) consisting of two interleaved uniform linear subarrays can enlarge the array aperture to attain the better angle estimation performance compared with the uniform linear array (ULA). In this paper, we ulteriorly study the virtual sum coarray of the unfolded coprime (UC) bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar whose transmitter and receiver array are both unfolded CLA from the viewpoint on the geometry and array aperture. The UC MIMO radar can be exploited to obtain the better joint direction of departure (DOD) and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation performance due to the larger array aperture. Furthermore, we propose an all sum coarray multiple signals classification (ASCA-MUSIC) algorithm for the UC MIMO radar. ASCA-MUSIC can fully exploit all the degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the sum coarray and can obtain the better estimation performance. We also prove that ASCA-MUSIC can avoid the phase ambiguity problem due to the coprime property. In addition, we devise a reduced complexity scheme for ASCA-MUSIC to reduce the high computational complexity and utilize Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) as a benchmark for the lower bound on the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of unbiased angle estimation. Finally, the numerical simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the UC MIMO radar, ASCA-MUSIC and the reduced complexity scheme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

232,"Hydrogen is a key parameter that determines the safe operation of defense and civilian facilities. The maximum allowable level of hydrogen concentration in high-strength steels and aluminum alloys for aviation is 0.05-0.5 ppm. For technological control of the quality of materials and ensuring the principle of unity of measurement tools, state standard samples (SSS) are required, in which the certified values of the hydrogen content are in this range. The article presents data on the development and study of the stability of the certified value of the new generation of SSS.

233,"We discuss improving the reliability of measured DC and AC response curves for a bipolar transistor as a function of frequency using the mass-produced 2T937 transistor (Russia) as an example. We describe preparations for measurement and the actual measurements in considerable detail. We provide experimental response curves for the 2T937 transistor. A special test (measurement) board was developed to prevent the measured response curves from being affected in any way by the transistor mount or interface hardware (power buses, soldering leads, matching devices, adapters, etc.). A bare transistor chip was used to eliminate any effect of the transistor package on the results and improve the size and weight specifications of devices using the 2T937 transistor. The transistor chip can be directly mounted to a test board whose topology is used to connect the transistor chip to the device. The microstripline board is designed to enable measurements to be performed in the microwave frequency band using a probe station with standard calibration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
234,"The main idea of solving a multicriteria optimization problem (MOP) is to find non-dominated solutions belonging to the Pareto frontier (e.g., a compromise between the criteria). If we consider our criteria as players, we can remark that the obtained solutions are the result of a cooperation of the players to increase their profits which is the same principle of solving a bargaining problem (BP). The Kalai-Smorodinsky (KS) model suggests an attractive solution for the BP called KS equilibria that can be also a MOP solution without having to calculate the Pareto Frontier known to be computationally so expensive. In this paper, we propose an algorithm aimed to rapidly finding the KS solution. The idea is to make a coupling between the KS algorithm and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) metamodel called KS-RBF. In fact, the KS algorithm transforms the MOP into a succession of single objective problems (SOP); for our proposed algorithm, the objective function of each SOP will be replaced by an approximate one using a reliable RBF metamodel (SOP-RBF). The performance of the proposed approach is firstly validated by some well-known mathematical multicriteria problems (Tanaka, Poloni, and ConstMIN problems) by finding a KS solution belonging to the Pareto Frontier; then, we used it to solve a realistic industrial case, namely, shape optimization of the bottom of an aerosol can undergoing non-linear elasto-plastic deformation in order to simultaneously minimize the dome growth (DG) (e.g., displacement of can base) at a proof pressure and maximize the dome reversal pressure (DRP), a critical pressure at which the aerosol can's bottom loses stability (e.g., initiates buckling). The KS solutions are compared with Pareto Frontier results previously suggested in other papers. The comparison leads us to confirm the performance of the KS-RBF coupling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
235,"The problem of energy efficiency due to the limited resources in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has made cluster-based architectures widespread use in these networks. The studies in literature regarding WSNs aim to make efficient use of battery in network by different methods such as using different parameters in cluster head selection, time-based cluster head election or clustering with artificial intelligence algorithms. The coverage area of clusters is selected in a range that can cover the whole network in some studies, while it is limited in others. In this study, the effect of the cluster-head coverage area parameter on the lifetime of the network is investigated with detailed simulations. The death of the first, middle, and last node are reported by using different numbers of nodes, coverage areas, and network sizes. According to the results obtained, the increase of the cluster coverage area causes the first node deaths to be delayed and the middle and last node deaths to occur earlier. The increase of the network area takes all the node measurements at an early cycle while the first node is at the highest level and the last node at the lowest level. As the number of nodes increases, the first node deaths are delayed to an earlier cycle, while the middle and final node deaths are delayed. In the light of the results obtained, it is thought that this study will help the cluster coverage area to be selected according to the design preferences in clustering based architectures that will be designed both in real time and in the simulation environment in future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
236,"This paper presents the behavior of single tension pile in collapsible soil (Gypseous soil) by experimental work. The natural Gypseous soil with 66% gypsum used in the study was brought from Salah Al-Deen governorate in Iraq while that of the sand was brought from Karbalaa governorate, south of Baghdad, Iraq. The model pile used is smooth steel pipe pile with slenderness ratios (L/D) of 10, 15, 20 and 25. The effect of the gypsum content included in the soil as well as the effect of rest time and the effect of (L/D) on the pullout capacity of pile were studied in the laboratory scale model pile. The results showed that the pullout capacity of pile in Gypseous soil is more than its capacity in Sandy soil by about 64%. When the rest time was increased, the pullout capacity of tension pile embedded in Gypseous soil decreased. Increasing (L/D) ratio of pile in Gypseous soil from 15 to 20 increases pullout capacity of pile to about 65%, while increasing that ratio from 20 to 25 increases pullout capacity of pile to about 76%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposes a switched observer approach to generate a road-adaptive vehicle dynamics residual signal. The main contribution in this paper is to generate a residual signal with low false alarm rate. Lateral vehicle dynamics suffers from presence of two types of disturbances, a stochastic white-noise disturbance and a deterministic lateral dynamics one. Kalman filter and parity-space approach are used to generate the residual signals that must feed the fault tolerant control system. The observers were modeled and simulated in Matlab/Simulink environment, they were then applied to a vehicle dynamics scenarios with lateral disturbances using virtual vehicle simulator (CarMaker).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

239,"In this work, screening of adsorbents for the capture step of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) purification from human embryonic kidney cells supernatant was done. Anion-exchange, cation-exchange and multimodal adsorbents were first examined in batch equilibrium measurements at different pH and NaCl concentrations. Binding capacity of rhEPO and impurity proteins and rhEPO selectivity factor were determined. The best performance characteristics were exhibited by cation exchangers and multimodal adsorbents with cationexchange ligands at pH 6-7. Binding capacity of impurity proteins was typically below 10 mg/g and the selectivity factor was close to 8. Preferential binding of rhEPO was confirmed in chromatographic column experiments for two selected adsorbents - Fractogel EMD SE HiCap and Capto MMC. Most impurity proteins were removed in the breakthrough during the loading phase. rhEPO was then eluted with the concentration factor of about 4-5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a first contribution, the theory of configuration functions is exploited to obtain a general abstract formulation of the network information as a function of the network constraints. As a second contribution, two classic network paradigms are examined: $i)$ a decentralized architecture with remote fusion center; and $ii)$ a fully-flat decentralized architecture with local data exchange between neighboring agents. It is shown how these paradigms match well with the general formulation in terms of configuration functions. Finally, the statistical concentration properties of configuration functions are exploited to characterize the information growth rate under both the aforementioned network paradigms, revealing the thermodynamic deterministic behavior that emerges with high probability as the network size scales to infinity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemically similar cells of different makes were assessed for maximum surface temperature followed by the spark ignition test as per IS/IEC 60079-11. It was observed that the maximum surface temperature, open voltage, and short circuit current varied among cells having the same maker and nominal capacity. The cells were not vented or leaked or exploded during the short circuit test for determining the temperature class of cells. The cells with protection circuit had passed in spark ignition test but failed without protection circuit. It may be recommended that the cell should not be used without appropriate protection circuit even in a low power rating certified IS circuit for hazardous areas. A study was also carried out for spark ignition test on different cells connected to the IS protection circuit and the certified IS apparatus as a composite circuit.

Software pipelining algorithms are developed for the CGA acceleration of inverse transform, pixel reconstruction, de-blocking filter and sample adaptive offset modules. To enable efficient software pipelining, several very-long instruction-word-based intrinsics are designed in order to maximize the parallelization rather than the computational acceleration. We found that the HEVC decoder with the proposed intrinsics yields 2.3 times faster in running clock cycle than a decoder that does not use the intrinsics. In addition, the HEVC decoder with CGA pipelining algorithms executes 10.9 times faster than that without the CGA mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
243,"Recirculation in underexpanded supersonic jet flow with varying degrees of swirl was experimentally investigated due to its potential for enhanced flame holding in supersonic combustion engines. Recirculation caused by swirl is free of solid walls, avoiding the challenge of wall cooling due to high heat fluxes. Schlieren imaging, planar laser Mie scattering, and planar particle image velocimetry were used to observe and quantify shock cell and vortex structure, and where applicable, to map velocity in and around the recirculation zone. Case study showed that different patterns of tangential injection, pressure ratios, and nozzle sizes were more or less favorable to flow recirculation. Various metrics of recirculation and shock structure were correlated with the onset, variability, characteristic length, and characteristic time of recirculation vortex. Statistical analysis of instantaneous velocities indicated that (1) recirculation velocity and recirculation zone width had standard deviations of similar to 30% and similar to 20%, respectively (in part due to unsteady precession of the vortex around the axis of mean flow); and (2) the average velocity within the recirculation zone was seen to be insensitive to the pressure ratio (and hence, to the fully expanded Mach number). The recirculation zone width was slightly increased by doubling the pressure ratio, within the range investigated. Thus, under conditions that most favored recirculation, the net effect of (1) and (2) was the formation of a toroidal vortex structure within which the average velocity was sufficiently slowed (by a factor of 3 relative to the bulk velocity) to measurably enhance flame holding in supersonic combustor applications.

244,"In conventional ID-based user authentications, privacy issues may occur, since users' behavior histories are collected in Service Providers (SPs). Although anonymous authentications such as group signatures have been proposed, these schemes rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP) capable of tracing misbehaving users. Thus, the privacy is not high, because the TTP of tracing authority can always trace users. Therefore, the anonymous credential system using a blacklist without the TTP of tracing authority has been proposed, where blacklisted anonymous users can be blocked. Recently, an RSA-based blacklistable anonymous credential system with efficiency improvement has been proposed. However, this system still has an efficiency problem: The data size in the authentication is O(K'), where K' is the maximum number of sessions in which the user can conduct. Furthermore, the O(K')-size data causes the user the computational cost of O(K') exponentiations. In this paper, a blacklistable anonymous credential system using a pairing-based accumulator is proposed. In the proposed system, the data size in the authentication is constant for parameters. Although the user's computational cost depends on parameters, the dependent cost is O(delta(BL) . K) multiplications, instead of exponentiations, where delta(BL) is the number of sessions added to the blacklist after the last authentication of the user, and K is the number of past sessions of the user. The demerit of the proposed system is O(n)-size public key, where n corresponds to the total number of all sessions of all users in the system. But, the user only has to download the public key once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
245,"For recording bioelectrical signals using Instrumentation Amplifiers (INA), capacitive AC coupling of the differential inputs is necessary for two major reasons, providing DC electrical isolation of the subject to avoid hazards of tissue burn, and to block DC or very low frequency skin-electrode contact potentials. The latter, when met, allows high admissible differential gain of the INA, which in turn, is expected to give a desirable high Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR). However, the use of conventional passive RC high pass filters at the input greatly reduces CMRR. This work intends to design an improved AC coupled input circuitry for INA giving high CMRR and high input impedance. A differential RC high-pass input circuit has been developed using an active element. It creates an effective high resistance for the common mode current but provides a low resistance path to input bias currents for normal operation of the INA. Between 1 Hz and 100 Hz, CMRR of the DC coupled INA (LT1167) was 115 dB, using a well matched traditional RC coupling, 55 to 95 dB, while it was 110 dB using the improved active AC coupled circuit. This improvement was practically demonstrated through Electrocardiogram measurements from a human subject. A novel active AC coupling circuitry has been proposed and developed giving high CMRR, very close to the maximum of an INA, which is non-varying within the frequency band of interest of Bioelectrical amplifiers. The developed input circuit will improve all bioelectrical measurements in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

247,"Flaring in oil and gas production is the controlled burning of unwanted exhaust gases to enhance safety. To improve flare combustion, gas flares are equipped with air nozzles that introduce extra oxygen and improve mixing in the combustion zone. These nozzles are operated in the subsonic, sonic, or supersonic regimes. In this paper, we are concerned with turbulence modeling of the jet flow exiting from a particular convergent-divergent nozzle used in flare systems. That nozzle has convergent and divergent sections that are connected via a throat section with a finite length and constant diameter. The Realizable k- epsilon and SST k - omega models are used to study the compressible flow within the nozzle. The velocity profiles, turbulent kinetic energy, Mach number profiles, and entrainment rate coefficients predicted by both turbulence models are compared for nozzle pressure ratios in the range 1.18 <= NPR <= 1.78. It is shown that both turbulence models predict nearly identical flow evolution along the nozzle. When the flow becomes supersonic, the shock surface, and consequently nozzle outlet velocity profiles, predicted by the SST k- omega model deviates slightly from the other model. The differences, however, become negligible a couple of diameters downstream of the nozzle outlet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
248,"Cement modification of soils has been widely practiced for the last few decades. Recently, cement has become a more economical binder to modify in situ subgrade soil because other binders, such as fly ash, have become less available and therefore their prices have gone up significantly. In addition, a much higher percentage of fly ash needs be used when compared with cement to achieve the same subgrade strength and stiffness. However, cement-modified subgrade may have an issue with shrinkage cracking, which can eventually reflect through the asphalt pavement layers to the surface after construction. For some subgrade soils, a high cement content is needed to meet the unconfined compressive strength requirement without jeopardizing durability. A higher cement content will result in higher shrinkage cracking potential. To overcome this problem, microcracking technology has been developed and adopted in the field. This technology involves recompaction of cement-modified soil (CMS) with a roller 24-48 h after initial compaction to induce microcracks in the CMS and minimize the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Microcracking of CMS is not expected to significantly reduce the strength and stiffness of CMS, but it is expected to increase its permeability and reduce the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Unfortunately, the procedure to simulate microcracking of CMS in the laboratory and evaluate its effect on properties of CMS has not been established yet. This note documents the development of such a procedure and discusses the effect of microcracking on the properties (strength and modulus) of CMS specimens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

250,"In this work, the authors are focusing on various aspects to support the reliability and security of a self-powered disaster recovery network (DRN) infrastructure. Different methods and algorithms were suggested to resolve the different logistic requirements to build a Green DRN Infrastructure. First of all the architecture of a DRN node is enhanced to support its robustness and availability against the different failure events which may occur due to many reasons such as power supply shortage or Denial of Service attacks. Secondly, the DRN Infrastructure Clustering algorithm is suggested to limit the size of the ad-hoc network and to isolate the problems in each cluster which offers a more efficient, robust and secured system. Finally, several fault tolerance procedures are described which provide different solutions against nodes or DRN server failure. This study also discussed the need to ensure the successful combination of different security solutions (using an Embedded Cooperative Hybrid Intrusion Detection System) and reliability methods (using the DRN clustering algorithm) with a probably managed solar energy powered.

251,"The complex correntropy is a recently defined similarity measure that extends the advantages of conventional correntropy to complex-valued data. As in the real-valued case, the maximum complex correntropy criterion (MCCC) employs a free parameter called kernel width, which affects the convergence rate, robustness, and steady-state performance of the method. However, determining the optimal value for such parameter is not always a trivial task. Within this context, several works have introduced adaptive kernel width algorithms to deal with this free parameter, but such solutions must be updated to manipulate complex-valued data. This work reviews and updates the most recent adaptive kernel width algorithms so that they become capable of dealing with complex-valued data using the complex correntropy. Besides that, a novel gradient-based solution is introduced to the Gaussian kernel and its respective convergence analysis. Simulations compare the performance of adaptive kernel width algorithms with different fixed kernel sizes in an impulsive noise environment. The results show that the iterative kernel adjustment improves the performance of the gradient solution for complex-valued data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
252,"A methodology is developed to assess the load transfer (t-z) curves of piles in sandy soils under uplift/tension force based on soil-pile interaction. Compared to current practice, the proposed approach accounts for soil and pile properties and contributes to the improvement in the construction of a nonlinear (springs) t-z curve in sandy soil which can be utilized with other computer codes to model the soil-pile response under tension forces (i.e., seismic events). The technique determines the mobilized shear stress/strain in soil associated with pile upward displacement at the soil-pile interface under progressing tension forces. A nonlinear soil constitutive model is employed to evaluate the variation of soil shear stress/strain at the soil-pile interface up to failure. The presented approach accounts for the influence of the pile length and diameter on the predicted t-z curve and has been validated through a number of comparisons with measured pile-head response and t-z curves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
253,"Ground cracks occur in many parts of the globe due to various causes. In Burdur (Turkey), they have been observed on an old alluvial fan encompassing 9 km by 7 km in an area south of Lake Burdur. This 3 m deep crack system continues along a line extending to 850 m, with the largest segment being about 170 m long. Because the cracks are close to a populated area, where damaging earthquakes had occurred in the past, further anxiety is created among the general population as to their source mechanism(s)-particularly if they are related to an imminent earthquake. An accurate mechanism for their occurrence requires resolution of multitude of issues. One aspect not considered to date is the drop in the lake's water level of about 15 m in the last 25 years. This study focuses on the role of this drop in the lake's water level. Satellite remote sensing and slope stability analysis methods are used.

259,"The work presented here relates to the instrumented piles tested in 1969, by the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) in loose sand at Holmen, Drammen. The material contained in the first publication, which is an Internal Report F.273.0 of NGI (Balasubramaniam et al., 1969), was mainly on the load tests only and contained the analyses of the vibrating wire gauges as based on the zero of the gauges after the pile driving, to make sure the best set of zero values were used. The publication of Gregersen et al. in 1969, includes pull out tests and also the effect of the residual stresses developed in the piles during pile driving. Further, the work of Gregersen et al. contains a detail section on the performance of the vibrating wire gauges and in particular the drifting of the zero of the gauges. The entire pile testing work and reporting in NGI internal report F.273.0 (Balasubramaniam et al., 1969) included a description of the instrumentation used and the results obtained from load and pull out tests on precast reinforced concrete piles. The piles, of circular cross section and available in standard lengths, can be joined together in the field by means of threaded connectors. The primary purpose of the instrumentation was to determine the distribution of axial load along the length of the pile and the point load and also to measure the distribution of lateral earth pressure acting on the periphery of the pile. To accomplish these goals, the piles were equipped at a number of levels with strain gauges embedded in the concrete, on the reinforcing steel, and earth pressure cells on the sides of the piles, together with hydraulic piezometers for measuring pore water pressure in the sand. The instrumentation system was based on the operating principle of the vibrating-wire strain gauge (Bjerrum et al., 1965). Altogether four instrumented piles were used in the test program, three cylindrical and the fourth conical in shape, and had a uniform taper, typical for a Norwegian timber pile. The piles were constructed in such a manner that the 8m long cylindrical and conical piles can be tested first and later, after completion of these tests each one of them can be lengthened by connecting additional 8m segment of instrumented cylindrical pile to make up two 16 m long test piles. The test program also included additional tests on a single pile, which was made up of 4 m long precast concrete pile sections driven one section at a time and tested for embedded lengths of 3.5, 7.5, 11.5, 15.5, 19.5 and 23.5 m; the latter pile only had load cell at the top to measure the applied load and was not instrumented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

261,"In this work, a combination of B-train type vehicle is dynamically analysed through lateral movement at low speed manoeuvre known as Lane Change Manoeuvre. The analyses were conducted for a vehicle with liquid loads of 100%, 80%, 60% and 40% capacity. The analyses involve adjusting the steer angle through an objective function taking into account the numerical and experimental lateral acceleration of the tractor vehicle. The movement of the liquid (slosh) during the manoeuvres are approximated using the software Pasimodo and trammel pendulum. Considering the upper surface of the liquid inside the tank as a straight line, it is possible to obtain the centre of gravity variation and the moment of inertia through polynomial adjustments. In this way, it is possible to analyse numerically the behaviour of the vehicle with liquid load in a curved trajectory. To obtain modal parameters, the operational modal analysis technique is used. With the applied methodology, it was possible to find good agreement between the numerical and experimental values of the acceleration signals in four different positions in the vehicle combination. Through the analyses of the vehicle with fluid in movement, it was possible to verify a great variation of load in the wheels due to transfer of load of the vehicle travelling by curved trajectories or due to evasive manoeuvres. This is a critical condition that can lead the vehicle to rollover condition. The experimental data were obtained for the vehicle at constant speed (between 30 and 40 km/h) and under these conditions, the vehicle is considered stable by analysing the eigenvalues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
262,"Condition of the ballast bed is one of the most important parameters for safe and economical operation of railway systems. In order to define the optimum time for ballast bed cleaning or renewal as well as to improve ballast serviceability and track life cycle performance, better knowledge of the ballast bed condition, i.e. definition of the degree of ballast fouling is of crucial importance. As a core maintenance activity in ballasted track, the tamping process influences the economical service life of the track to a great extent and is essential in restoring the track geometry for safe train operations. During the tamping process, the tamping tines interact with the ballast matrix, transferring the displacement caused by the dynamic excitation overlapped with the extension in the hydraulic cylinder to the ballast, compacting it under the sleeper. This interaction is observed and measured in-situ in several locations in Austria.

263,"Extensive experimental investigations have shown that the water permeability of steel slags can be reduced by the addition of fine-grained additives, such that they can be used as additional sealing layer, in accordance with the technical recommendations for the use of soils and building materials with environmentally relevant substances in earthworks (M TS E). The experimental investigations were carried out on three steel slags which were granulometrically modified using four fine-grained additives. The results of the water permeability tests show that the coefficient of permeability k(f) <= 1 . 10(-8) m/s can already be achieved with an addition of 8 wt.-% fine-grained additives. In comparison to natural soils, it should be noted that steel slags generally require a higher compaction energy (modified proctor energy) to achieve a low air void ratio with accompanying additional reduction of their water permeability and that the swelling capacity of sodium-activated bentonite can be reduced due to the high ion concentration in the pore solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
264,"Due to throughput requirements above 1 gigapixel/sec for the real-time compression of modern image and video data streams, parallelism for encoding and decoding is inevitable. To achieve parallel decoding, a well-established technique is to insert markers into the variable length code (VLC) stream. By locating markers, it is then possible to extract the sub-streams that are, in turn, decoded in parallel. The use of markers adversely affects compression especially when a high degree of parallelism is required. In this paper, we propose an architecture of a marker-free parallel decoding approach of VLC streams. Instead of multiple local entropy decoders, the proposed architecture is based on using a single parallel entropy decoder in conjunction with a novel format to construct the VLC stream. The approach runs at high clock rates supporting parallelism to a high number of decoders. A synthesized clock frequency well above 110 MHz is achieved for up to 20 decoders on a medium-sized FPGA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
265,"A modified sol-gel route was used to prepare zinc oxide nanorods, and its sample was named as the Z sample. Photoassisted-deposition regime has been utilized to decorate ZnO nanorods with copper; percentage weight of Cu dopant was adjusted to be 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 wt.%, their samples were named as CuZ-0.3, CuZ-0.6, CuZ-0.9 and CuZ-1.2 samples, respectively. Z and CuZ samples were characterized using different tools. The values of the surface area of Z, CuZ-0.3, CuZ-0.6, CuZ-0.9 and CuZ-1.2 samples are 80, 78, 76, 73 and 70 m(2)/g, respectively. Thus, decoration of copper in zinc oxide surface blocks some pore of zinc oxide and hence reduces surface area. XPS results reveal that copper was decorated in zinc oxide nanorods surface as metallic copper. The efficiency of Z and CuZ samples was inspected for the reduction of mercury ions under visible light. Photocatalyst of CuZ-0.9 sample has the best photocatalytic activity for reduction of mercury (II), at which 100% of mercury (II) can be reduced within 20 min using 0.9 g/L photocatalyst dose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
266,"We propose a simple and efficient method to measure beam attenuation in one or two dimensions using an amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (a-Si EPID). The proposed method was validated against ionization chamber measurements. Beam attenuation through treatment couches (Varian Medical Systems) and immobilization devices (CIVCO Radiotherapy, USA) was examined. The dependency of beam attenuation on field size, photon energy, thickness of the couch, and the presence of a phantom were studied. Attenuation images were derived by computing the percentage difference between images obtained without and with a couch or immobilization devices determining the percentage of attenuation at the center and the mean attenuation. The beam attenuation measurements obtained with an a-Si EPID and an ionization chamber agreed to within +/- 0.10 to 1.80%. No difference was noted between the center and mean of an attenuated image for a small field size of 5 x 5 cm(2), whereas a large field size of 15 x 15 cm(2) exhibited differences of up to 1.13%. For an 18 MV beam, the a-Si EPID required additional build-up material for accurate assessment of beam attenuation. The a-Si EPID could measure differences in beam attenuation through an image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) couch regardless of the variabilities in couch thickness. Interestingly, the addition of a phantom reduced the magnitude of attenuation by approximately 1.20% for a field size of 15 x 15 cm(2). A simple method is proposed that provides the user with beam attenuation data in either 2D or 1D within a few minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, investigations on the interactions of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CFX) being a second-generation antibiotic with both nonessential amino acid and essential amino acid have been done. The physicochemical properties like apparent molar volume (V-2,V-phi) and apparent molar isentropic compression (K-s,K-2,K-phi) of drug, CFX in water and in the presence of glycine (GLY), and L-isoleucine (ILU) at m(B) (molality of GLY or ILU) = 10, 20, 35, 50, and 75 mmol.kg(-1) have been determined over the temperature range of 288.15-323.15 K and at p = 1 x 10(5) Pa. These data have further been used to calculate different parameters, which help to obtain valuable information corresponding to the distinct kinds of interactions present in the ternary systems. The volumes and compressibility studies have shown that the predominant interactions are hydrophilic-hydrophilic and hydrophilic-ionic in the studied systems. It may be postulated that the effect of CFX prevails through the hydrophilic groups of the constituents of proteins.

269,"Background: The quality of intestinal blood supply is extremely important for healing of intestinal anastomoses. During the surgery the blood supply of the intestine may appear sufficient even though the microperfusion is not fully adequate. The degree of blood supply of remaining intestinal segment and the positioning of the resection margins is estimated subjectively by the surgeon's experience or objectively by means of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. The subject of our study is the evaluation of the infrared thermal imaging as another supportive non-invasive imaging method in assessment of intestinal blood supply, and to compare surgeon's decisions of the position of resection line with information obtained by infrared thermal imaging and by indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. Methods: A pilot study on thermal imaging measurements was done in a porcine model. The infrared thermocamera Workswell WIC 640 was used in our study. The thermal imaging was correlated with the indocyanine green imaging method ICG NOVADAQ and with surgeon's subjective expert decisions of the places of resection lines. Fifteen monitored resections were performed on three experimental porcine models. Results: Based on the data evaluated, experience of the surgical team and the post-operative conditions of the porcine models, we conclude that the thermal imaging is a useful tool for determination of the optimal intestinal resection margins, and thus contributes to lowering anastomotic complications rate in colorectal surgery. The results show relatively high consistency between the used imaging techniques. Both methods showed ischemic regions of the intestine at a comparable level. The IRT methods showed even a slightly higher match with the surgeon's rating. Conclusion: Based on experiments, the infrared thermography can be considered as one of complementary imaging methods suitable for use during anastomosis surgery. The sensitivity and versatility of the infrared thermography method was demonstrated. There was confirmed agreement in obtained information about the position of area with maximal blood insufficiency obtained by IRT with the information obtained by using the ICG method. (C) 2019 AGBM.

Among the different types of fuel cells, passive Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) has many advantages because of its simplicity. This paper presents the effect of Anode Diffusion Layer (ADL) thickness and its porosity on the performance of a passive DMFC. A one-dimensional, non-isothermal model is developed in MATLAB environment for exploring the complex physicochemical phenomena taking place inside the passive DMFC, by considering both heat and mass transfer effects. Modeling studies have been carried out by varying the ADL thickness from 0.1 mm to 0.6 mm, and the ADL porosity from 0.3 to 0.8. The concentration distribution of methanol, water and oxygen inside the cell have been predicted and, the crossover of methanol and water across the membrane have also been estimated. It is observed that increase in thickness of the ADL decreases the methanol corss over.

275,"A deflagration occurred inside a 200-gal (0.757 m(3)) atmospheric mixing vessel during the course of apparently normal operations. The vessel had previously been used to dilute 70% aqueous tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) with deionized water. Ten minutes earlier the mixed batch had been transferred out and the vessel had been given a brief rinse with deionized water about 4 minutes after the transfer. The deflagration occurred soon after starting the second of two deionized water rinses. Although the hinged vessel lid was forced open and damaged there were no injuries or chemical exposures since no personnel were in the area at the time. The incident was caused by a faulty metering system that overcharged sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution to the deionized water supply. The roughly 100-fold overcharge of bleach resulted in a vigorous, gassy reaction with t-BHP in the mixing vessel. The reaction generated a gas-phase mixture comprising mostly acetone plus about 90% oxygen. The ignition energy of a replicated mixture was 0.015 mJ, similar to that of optimum hydrogen-air, but with poor upward mixing of acetone the ignition energy could have been as small as 2 mu J. The source of ignition could not be identified with certainty; the ""least improbable"" scenario was considered to be a spark from an electrically charged slug of rinse water falling through an electrically charged mist that had formed during the gassy reaction.

276,"So-called full-face masks are essential for fire fighters to ensure respiratory protection in smoke diving incidents. While such masks are absolutely necessary for protection purposes on one hand, they impair the voice communication of fire fighters drastically on the other hand. For this reason communication systems should be used to amplify the speech and, therefore, to improve the communication quality. This paper gives an overview of communication enhancement techniques for masks based on digital signal processing. The presented communication system picks up the speech signal by a microphone in the mask, enhance it, and play back the amplified signal by loudspeakers located on the outside of such masks. Since breathing noise is also picked up by the microphone, it's advantageous to recognize and suppress it - especially since breathing noise is very loud (usually much louder than the recorded voice). A voice activity detection distinguishes between side talkers, pause, breathing out, breathing in, and speech. It ensures that only speech components are played back. Due to the fact that the microphone is located close to the loudspeakers, the output signals are coupling back into the microphone and feedback may occur even at moderate gains. This can be reduced by feedback reduction (consisting of cancellation and suppression approaches). To enhance the functionality of the canceler a decorrelation stage can be applied to the enhanced signal before loudspeaker playback. As a consequence of all processing stages, the communication can be improved significantly, as the results of measurements of real-time mask systems show.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

280,"The present paper is proposing a methodological approach for predicting the Shielding Effectiveness (SE) of metallic walls with various apertures, supported by software simulations. First, the SE modeling for a single aperture is addressed, whereas, at the difference with an homogeneous barrier, the transmission through a slot of given length behaves as a dipole that re-radiates some of the incident RF power. Because of this, the re-radiated field behind the barrier -hence the SE- becomes dependent of the barrier-to-target distance. Next, the SE for a single row of apertures is addressed, with an attempt for quantifying its dependency upon N identical holes and their individual separation. A further step is treating the SE for an array of NxM holes, including the effect of an off-axis shift target location. Some of the simulation results are compared with those obtained by using a few, widely-used simple formulae, trying to characterize their limitations, and proposing correction factors as the discrepancy typically increase with the barrier-to-target distance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

286,"Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) technology can monitor the multi-phase flow in closed pipes or vessels. The monitoring technology has the advantages of anti-intrusion, low manufacturing cost, high-temperature resistance, and simple structure. At present, ECT systems use small-scale sensors for signal capture, but such sensors have problems such as low sensitivity and poor anti-interference, which have attracted the attention of researchers. In this study, a light-trigger sensor was proposed, which was equipped with a special light window to receive optical signals. At the same time, in terms of the problem of electromagnetic shielding and optical window protection, a light window structure that transmitted optical signals and shields electromagnetic waves was designed. Based on the light-trigger sensor, the other modules of the ECT system were designed, considering that the sensor would be interfered by the measurement of stray capacitance, the intra-isoelectric driver cable shielding technology, the double T-type simulation switch matrix, and the digital-mode demodulation technology was introduced. Consequently, the performance of the sensor was tested. During the experiment, the sucrose flow pattern was used as the test object. The results showed that compared with the traditional sensors, the image distortion of the sensor based on the ECT system was lower; while in the performance test of the ECT system, the introduction of the double T-type simulation switch matrix, the digital-analogy demodulation technology, and the bipolar plate excitation mode could further optimize the signal-to-noise ratio index of the image; in the sensitivity test of the ECT system, the introduction of bipolar plate excitation mode could improve the output sensitivity of the capacitance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

288,"The dynamics in blood circulation is determined by the functional states of its components, i.e., cardiac contractility, vascular hindrance, and blood viscosity. While blood viscosity is a determinant of blood flow, the shear stress resulting from blood flow also modulates blood viscosity. This shear dependence of blood viscosity is a result of the composition of the blood as a suspension of deformable and aggregable blood cells in protein-containing plasma. The interplay between blood rheology and shear stress has significant implications on circulatory regulation in health and in cardiovascular and hematological diseases. Shear stress also acts on the vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to modulate their gene and protein expressions to regulate vascular function in health and diseases, particularly those resulting from atherosclerosis such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Understanding of the mechanisms of mechanotransduction and gene regulation underlying the shear-modulation of vascular function is essential for the improvement of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these fatal diseases. Shu Chien has elucidated the fundamental determinants of blood viscosity, viz. cell concentration, plasma viscosity, and shear-dependent cell aggregation and cell deformability, which is determined in turn by intracellular viscosity, cell geometry, and membrane properties. He has applied such fundamental mechanical and molecular knowledge to the understanding of the role of blood rheology in cardiovascular and hematological diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and sickle cell disease. His findings have led to improved management of these disorders such as the use of blood thinners to prevent restenosis after vascular stenting. By using a combination of cellular, molecular, and genomic techniques, coupled with innovative engineering experimentation and analysis, Dr. Chien has elucidated the roles of flow patterns in mechanotransduction and gene regulation in endothelial cells, including mechano-sensing, molecular signaling, genetic and epigenetic modulation, and functional regulation in response to mechanical forces. He formulated the concept that the adaptive response of intracellular rheology to different shear stress patterns is a key mechanism for homeostasis. He established the principle that shear stress with a clear direction is athero-protective, while that without is atherogenic; this has led to the recognition of the importance of minimizing disturbed flow in the treatment and prevention of a variety of clinical conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The errors of the interpolated dynamic discrete Fourier transform (IpD(2)FT) due to interharmonic interferences are investigated. Then the optimal frequencies where the IpD(2)FT has the smallest interharmonic interference are obtained. To achieve higher accuracy, the Taylor-Fourier multifrequency (TFM) model-based method is used to estimate and then eliminate the interharmonic component further. Concerning response time requirements, robust thresholds for transient detection are obtained based on numerous simulations, and the Kaiser-based IpD(2)FT is used to meet the corresponding limits.

Results show that the modified ventilators exhibit better air extraction rates than the conventional one does at all of the test wind speeds, especially at low wind speeds and as the ventilator not rotating. Also, the air extraction rate is generally proportional to the total height of the low-pressure ventilation device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
292,"Thermal responses of steel beams under fire can be intricate, considering the coupling effects between material thermal-expansion, mechanical property degradation, and constraints by surrounding structural members. While research efforts have focused on catenary action of structural members without initial imperfections, few accurate and efficient methods are found to reveal the fire resistance of restrained cellular steel beams (RCSBs). In this paper, parametric and regression analysis are applied to investigate the thermal behavior of RCSBs with initial imperfections. Eight groups of RCSBs are set up to demonstrate how various design parameters may affect structural responses at elevated temperatures. The results indicate that axial restraint stiffness ratio, load ratio, and opening diameter-to-height ratio significantly affect the structural responses of RCSBs in fire, followed by the rotational restraint stiffness ratio and span-to-depth ratio as secondary effects. Through the orthogonal and regression analysis, simplified formulas for four characteristic temperatures and four characteristic internal forces are defined, which agree with finite element results to a certain extent. Meanwhile, reasonable range of each design parameter is put forward for a more efficient and applicable calculation of thermo-mechanical responses of RCSBs. The proposed formulas are practical, convenient and accurate enough to be applied for engineering design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

294,"Primary open-angle glaucoma is a progressive disease affecting nearly 60 million people worldwide which, if left untreated, can lead to optic nerve head damage and complete loss of sight. Current interventions include: pharmaceutical drops, laser surgery, shunts, and bleb; however, these methods provide insufficient long-term efficacy in intraocular pressure management. We developed a semi-permanent, implantable transcorneal duct as a new aid in the treatment of this disease. The duct, composed of an intracorneal stabilizing washer and hollow screw, creates an interface between the anterior chamber and the external environment, allowing for the outflow of excess aqueous humor. We discuss the fluid mechanics behind designing and implementing a filter material capable of preventing the ingress of bacteria and viruses while modifying aqueous humor outflow resistances to pre-glaucomatous levels, finding the effective radius of such a material to be 10.44 mu m. After performing surgical implantation in four rabbit eyes, subsequent testing showed successful integration between the screw and washer. Colored saline injections highlighted fluid flow progression out of the eye through the duct, suggesting that the device may be a viable approach to treating high intraocular pressure created by open-angle glaucoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
295,"The effects of T-stress on the stress field, creep zone and constraint effect of the mode I crack tip in power-law creeping solids are presented based on finite element (FE) analysis in the paper. The characteristics of the crack tip field in power-law creep solids by considering low negative T-stress and high positive T-stress are studied in the paper. The differences of T-stress effect on the crack tip field between power-law creeping solids and elastoplastic materials are also clarified. A modified parameter is proposed to characterize the influence of T-stress on creep zone. The constraint parameter Q under both small-scale creep and large-scale creep with various T-stresses for the modified boundary layer (MBL) model and various specimens with different crack depths are given. The applicability and the limitation of the MBL model for creep crack are also investigated. The inherent connection between T-stress and Q-parameter is discussed. The investigations given in this paper can further promote the understanding of T-stress effect and constraint effect on the mode I creep crack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
296,"When designing handling and conveying equipment for combustible dusts, it is crucial to properly implement protective measures (e.g., deflagration venting, suppression, and isolation) capable of mitigating the potential consequences in the event the dust is ignited. Generally speaking, dust processing, storage, and collection equipment, such as cyclones, mills, baghouses, dryers, and silos are typically connected via pipes, pneumatic conveyors, and dust extraction or aspiration lines. If a fire or dust explosion occurs in one vessel, or the interconnecting piping, the flame front or pressure can quickly propagate through these conduits to other parts of the plant and potentially escalate to even worse consequences than the original event. Improper design of isolation devices can be costly, as illustrated by this case study on the fire and explosion in a baghouse that occurred on April 26, 2014 at a plywood manufacturing facility in Texas. More specifically, numerous deficiencies in the system design were identified, which included (1) required air stream flow rates; (2) proper isolation designs; (3) exclusion zones in the anticipated path of a vented deflagration; and (4) impeding deflagration vents. The root cause analysis identified that had a dust hazard analysis been properly performed, these deficiencies would have been identified and the explosion in the baghouse could have been avoided.

297,"Water scarcity is a major problem in terms of human supply and agricultural development, especially in the semiarid region of Brazil. Thus, the aim of this work is to spatialize the flow (Qt) and electrical conductivity (EC) of water from artesian wells located in the municipality of Mossoro, Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil, and make recommendations for agricultural crop selection according to the salinity levels and water availability in the region. The well flow and electrical conductivity data of artesian wells identified in the study area were based on sampling performed from 2002 to 2003 and obtained from the Secretariat of Environment and Water Resources (SMARH). Spatialization of the Qt and EC in the area was performed using the geostatistical method of ordinary kriging (OK) and fitted using a spherical semivariogram. After spatial analyses, suitable crops for the area were identified according to the EC values, and a map of agricultural capability based on the artesian well Qt and EC was also produced. The average estimated EC was 0.40 dS m-1, and 38% of the study area was lower than 0.27 dS m-1. The estimated average Qt was 16.0 m3h-1, with 64% of the area estimated to have discharge between 10.0 and 25.0 m3h-1. The southern region of the study area showed the highest Qt values, and the municipality of Mossoro had the lowest water restrictions in the study area. Lettuce, citrus fruit, and melon are the most recommended crops for cultivation throughout the study area. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of agricultural planning for sustainable farming based on factors that can affect production, such as the EC of irrigation water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

299,"When performing oceanography measurements, it is critical to assess the presence of the noise sources that could affect the measured data and lead to wrong interpretation of the results. This paper report the result of an oceanography survey conducted by ISMAR-CNR, Naples, in the north-eastern marine sector of the Ischia Island and assess the influence of EMI on the measured results. The analyzed measurements of the Electric and Magnetic fields showed values of the E up to 0.82 V/m and of B up to 85 mu T. By assuming a standard conductor, an inductance L up to 47 Omega on the cable corresponding to an induced electromotive force of 1184 mV was calculated. Also the experimental data show the EMI increase in site where the Pearson index correlation is higher. The results demonstrate that in an oceanographic survey planning, a preliminary electromagnetic screening is advisable to optimize the measurement setup. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

300,"Antibacterial activity of a natural zeolite, clinoptilolite (Z), enriched with about 0.4-0.5 mmol of Ag (Ag-Z), Cu (Cu-Z) or Zn (Zn-Z) was tested toward two strains of Gram-negative bacteria - Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii - in natural seawater from Adriatic Sea (Croatia). The Ag-Z and Cu-Z exhibited bactericidal activity toward E. coli and A. baumannii after 3 and 6 h of exposure, respectively. The Zn-Z showed antibacterial activity toward both strains, but lacking the bactericidal effect even after 24 h of exposure. All studied samples released metal cations in seawater. Concentration of Ag and Zn leached from Ag-Z and Zn-Z was higher than maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) for drinking water, whereas concentration of Cu was below MAC. Due to high concentration of Na+ in seawater (about 1.2 g Na+ dm(-3)) an ion-exchange process can be responsible for the leaching of the studied cations. The lowest extent of leaching from Cu-Z was ascribed to different position and geometry of sites occupied by Cu(II) in the clinoptilolite lattice. The antibacterial activity of M-Z was attributed to the metal cations leached from the zeolite lattice into seawater. The obtained results indicate that Cu-Z can be considered as a promising disinfectant for treatment of seawater.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

303,"Mesophase pitch, as an important chemical intermediate, belongs to highly structured pitch materials that has good property for conducting heat or electricity. Pitch can be naturally derived from petroleum or coal tar. Prior to producing the mesophase pitch materials, the removal of complex low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the original petroleum pitch is essential. In the study, we have developed a two-step process using high pressure CO2 for separating the useful part with desired properties from the raw petroleum pitch sample. Firstly, a stepwise supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)) extraction process was employed for removing the lightest molecular weight fractions. The residual and CO2-insoluble fractions were further separated by a subcritical anti-solvent (SAS) process using CO2 at 25 degrees C and three high pressure conditions. A modified SAS apparatus was utilized in this study. The gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis system with standard calibrations was used to determine the molecular weight of various pitch samples. The GPC system was equipped with dual Ultraviolet (UV) and Refractive Index (RI) detectors. The polydispersity index (PDI) value of the raw petroleum pitch 6 (PP6) sample was 6.9, and it was reduced to 3.8 after the scCO(2) extraction and under the appropriate SAS processing pressure. The corresponding weight average molecular weight (M-w) was increased from 987 to 1493 g/mol.

306,"The synchronverter (SV) is currently one of the most promising grid-friendly inverters that mimic synchronous generators (SGs). Almost all the available SV use virtual current signal for synchronization, which require a complicated controller that lacks plug-play capability. This paper proposes a new generation of self-synchronised SV with a simpler controller, which provides plug-play capability with no need for switching between actual controller current and a virtual current for each ON-OFF process. The proposed SV (PSV) can also share the load with other SGs and SVs and also it is able to take part in regulating system frequency and voltage. A linearised small-signal model is derived for the controller to investigate its stability. The PSV is also validated through multiple simulation studies carried out in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The results show the capability of the PSV to achieve self-synchronisation and plug-play operation without a dedicated PLL or a virtual current. Compared to the current self-synchronised SV, the PSV guarantees a smoother grid connection and gives more accurate reactive power sharing. Moreover, the PSV is applied to a modified IEEE 14-bus test system considering three different contingencies to prove its impact on enhancing system dynamics and stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
307,"A random access scheme is a fundamental scenario in which the users transmit through a shared channel and cannot coordinate with each other. Recently, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is introduced into the random access scheme. The SIC decodes the transmitted packets using collided packets. The coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) is a random access scheme using the SIC. The CSA encodes each packet by a local code prior to transmission. It is known that the CSA achieves excellent throughput. On the other hand, it is reported that shift operation improves the decoding performance for packet-oriented erasure correcting coding systems. In this paper, we propose a protocol which applies the shift operation to the CSA. Numerical simulations show that the proposed protocol achieves better throughput and packet loss rate than the CSA. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the throughput and the decoding erasure rate for the proposed protocol by the density evolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

311,"In this paper, the microstructure and mechanical properties of dissimilar welding of AISI 304 L austenitic stainless steel and UNS C70600 copper-nickel alloy have been investigated. For this purpose, Tungsten-Gas Arc welding method with both pulse and non-pulse currenst and ERNiCr-3 welding wire was applied. The microstructures of different regions were evaluated using optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. The result showed that ERNiCr-3 filler metal has fully austenitic microstructure in both pulse and non-pulse modes, but in pulse mode, dendrites were found to be smaller than non-pulse mode. In both interfaces, between base and weld metal, partially melting zone was illustrated. Increasing grain size was more intense in the HAZ region of the copper-nickel base metal. In the tensile test, all samples were ruptured from the HAZ region of copper-nickel alloy with ductile fracture mode. According to the result of tensile test, tensile strength of the welded sample in pulse and non-pulse modes was 235 MPa and 268 MPa, respectively. The results of the hardness test showed that the hardness of the weld region in the pulse mode (75.3HRB) was slightly higher than hardness in non-pulse mode (71.6HBR).

312,"Mid-infrared (MIR) optical frequency combs (OFCs) are ideal light sources for precision metrology and can find extensive applications, especially in molecular spectroscopy and gas detection. Here the generation of mode-locked MIR frequency comb in a LiNbO3 microring through optimized slot-waveguide design is proposed. Such microcomb can span over four-fifths of an octave (ranging from similar to 2810 nm to similar to 4630 nm) with pump power as low as 50 mW, which can be applied to the 2f-3f self-referencing for fully stabilization and helpful to monolithic integration of the whole system. Further investigations on complex dynamical processes for the microcomb generation suggest that the intracavity soliton drifting caused by the third-order dispersion could be compensated by the self-steepening effect as introducing an additional drift through proper dispersion tailoring. This work could facilitate the low-threshold broadband MIR frequency comb generation technique, as well as provide a way to realize more delicate control of soliton microcombs in both temporal and spectral domain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leaky Feeder (LF) or radiating cable have been the primary solution to provide wireless access in tunnels and mines, but being overlooked until now. The LF is a natural multi antenna transceiver ideal for broadband short rage access. In this work, we model the LF as a linear antenna array and derive the average bit error rate (BER) in Rayleigh fading channel considering Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and M-Array Quadrature Amplitude (M-QAM) Modulations. We consider maximal ratio transmission (MRT) at the transmission end and coherent detection and maximal ratio combining (MRC) at the receiving end. Analytical expressions are derived for the BER. The effects of slot spacing and carrier frequency on the BER are also studied. Numerical evaluations show that the LF is a strong candidate for tunnels with much lower BER than a single antenna transmitter with the same SNR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

315,"To apply abrasive slurry jet (ASJ) in rock drilling calls for in-depth understandings on the mechanism of impingement process. A fluid-structure coupling model that combines multi-fluid model and finite element method was established for a set of numerical investigation. The simulation results show that entrained air contributes to the divergence by successive disturbing on the jet flow. Subjected to the jet impact, the stress field of rock structure is affected by the standoff distance, abrasive particle diameter and crack in rock material. On the other hand, we adopt both first strength criterion and Drucker-Prager criterion for the elastic-plastic rock material to evaluate the stress state of rock under a high-speed jet impact. It is found the onset of rock damage is primarily attributed to a brittle tensile fracture at crack tip and a plastic failure in the crack front, tending to initiate from a smaller-length-scale crack. The flow field and rock stress are characterized to provide a numerical basis for the parametric optimization of ASJ impinging rock as well as other elastic-plastic materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
316,A portable meter for measuring the modulus of the reflectivity of various material objects over a wide range of frequencies using a low-intensity noise probe signal is described. The operation of the meter is analyzed with the real characteristics of its high-frequency components and of the elements of the circuit taken into account. Formulas are obtained for estimating the deviation of the measured absolute values of the reflectivity from the ideal values. It is found that the main contribution to the difference in the deviations is from damping of the signal from the noise generator in the meter as the signal passes toward the antenna through the circuit elements. An adjustable attenuator for the generator signal is included in the meter to account for the damping. A way of reducing the systematic error is examined and the permissible values of the characteristics of the circuit components of the meter are determined.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pseudo-range estimator based on angle of arrival information is introduced to generate the tracking initialization for each local processor. An extended Kalman filter as a local processor is utilized for state and state covariance extrapolation and updating. For integrating the outputs of local processors, a recursive least squares estimator as a global processor is used to sequentially generate a global estimate for system outputs and information feedback. Computer simulation results show that the modified spherical coordinate state estimation convergence of each local processor is greatly accelerated by using information feedback. The proposed algorithm markedly improves the local tracking accuracy as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The numerical results were verified by the experimental study. It was shown that exists two shapes of liquid film nearby nozzle exit - 'onion' and open film. Shape of the liquid film for the given nozzle pressure drop depends mainly on air pressure difference outside and inside the film.

Among the aqueous working mixtures, NaOH solution shows several advantages for absorption system applications. The aim of this paper is to propose new mathematical correlations to predict or estimate the NaOH concentrations and refractive index in aqueous solutions (H2O NaOH) for an air conditioning absorption system application. The experimental measurements of NaOH concentration and refractive index were made in situ from aqueous solutions with concentrations from 20 to 50% (weight/weight %, with increases of 5%) and temperatures between 10 and 60 C (with increments of 1 C). Two correlations for predicting the concentration of NaOH and refractive index based on cubic regression models with R2 of 0.99704 and 0.99918, respectively, are presented for the first time. The normalized error for NaOH estimation using experimental data lies between 0.026 and 0.040, and for refractive index, the estimation lies between 0.002 and 0.001.

Therefore, a 3D motion segmentation combined for static object imaging features recognition is proposed, which clusters the same optical flow of feature points in 3D motion subspace, including orientations and amplitude of translation and rotation. The simulation results show that the proposed static object imaging features recognition method improves the recognition correct rate and reliability of static features.

328,"In this study, modeling and designing different topologies of on-chip transformers are presented using 130nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. Interleaved, stacked, and full symmetrical interleaved transformers are investigated. Octagon and square shapes are used for designing transformers with flipped and non-flipped feed lines. A comparison between performances of various configurations is presented using a full-wave simulator. The octagon stacked transformer with flipped feed lines showed a good performance at around 60GHz. The simulated results demonstrated a coupling factor K of 0.94, minimum insertion loss of 1.01518dB, and Q-factor of 9 with a minimum occupied area of 0.0019mm(2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
329,"Computer Aided Design of Chemical Process is now a well established eld in the design of new process as well as in the optimization, revamp and retrot of existing ones. The use of powerful process simulators available today allows the process engineer to simulate even an entire process, but the majority of process simulators have only classical unit operations. So, if the process has a non-classical unit operation it needs to be simulated using a suitable computer language and further to be linked to the simulator. In this paper we addressed the problem of including a new unit operation in a process simulator and how to use the virtual plant to optimize and to evaluate the environmental impact of a chemical process. We used the free chemical process simulator COCO to simulate two styrene process production plant. The firrst one uses as a reactor a conventional PFR that is available in the simulator. The second plant uses a membrane reactor that was simulated using the software Scilab that was embedded in COCO simulator by using the CAPE-OPEN protocol. Then, we used both virtual plants to develop meta-models of the processes by using experimental design and surface responses. These empirical models were used after to optimize the plants and the results shown that it is possible to increase the styrene productivity up to 27.32 kmol/h using a PFR reactor and up to 30.56 kmol/h using a membrane reactor. Finally, we calculated the Potential of Environmental Impact (PEI) for each process using the WAR algorithm and we shown that both processes have PEI very similar. Therefore, the route that uses membrane reactor has an advantage over the route that uses PFR reactor since it allows to obtain higher styrene productivities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
330,"The various tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) remelting processes applied on the surface of hypereutectic cast aluminum alloy were used to investigate the effect of remelting method on microstructures and mechanical properties of the remelted layer. Optical microscope and scanning electron microscope were carried out to study the penetration and microstructures of the remelted layers, and the micro hardness tester and universal mechanical tester were performed to measure their mechanical properties. The experimental results indicated that the remelting could refine the structure and enhance the hardness and mechanical properties of the remelted layers. The remelted layer with activating flux TIG (A-TIG) reached the deeper penetration of 3.9 mm, the lowest secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) of 3 mu m and the finest primary silicon particles. The hardness of A-TIG remelted layer was lower because of the reduction of hard Si phases, while the ultimate tensile strength increased from 163 MPa of the substrate to 236 MPa, which was considered to get the best overall performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
331,"Mitochondria are tiny energy producing structures within all living cells and contain their own DNA. They were bacteria, similar to Rikettsia, which two to three billion years ago invaded an organism with a nucleus, and formed a symbiosis. There are hundreds to thousands within almost every human cell. Hence there are multiple copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) within all living cells. There are only two copies of nuclear DNA (nDNA) within each cell. Mitochondria turn the carbohydrates and fats we eat into carbon dioxide (CO2) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), or useful energy, in a process called oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation includes the citric acid cycle and both are part of classical biochemistry and are sources of early interest in the mitochondrion. During evolution, mitochondria lost many genes to the host cytoplasm. Human mitochondria now have only 37 genes. Douglas Wallace has said it was the small size of the human mitochondrial genome that inspired him to investigate it, while everyone else in graduate school was hoping to work on an aspect of the Human Genome Project. That project had been proposed in order to completely elucidate the human nuclear genome: a challenge of approximately 20,000 genes versus only 37. Moreover, as he studied and worked, it was becoming more clear to him that the one-gene-one-disease theory regarding the nuclear genome was failing to meet expectations. Some investigators said it might be interactions of two or more gene mutations that explained intransigent human diseases. However, Wallace was convinced that nuclear genes, singly or in concert with others, were unlikely to explain the diseases that concern us most in the developed world, the diseases of aging such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancers. After all, his thinking was apparently, your nuclear genome defines the body you are born with. Something else appears to be involved when debilitating change takes over in middle age. In his career of, now, approximately four decades, Wallace has devoted his research to discovering the precise causes and possible cures of mitochondrial disease. Early in his career, he built a department devoted to the study of genetics and molecular medicine at Emory University in Georgia where he began on the faculty by teaching biochemistry. Subsequently, he moved to the University of California at Irvine where he built up an institute devoted to studying mitochondrial disease. Ultimately, he was invited to Philadelphia to build and lead the Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
332,"In this work, it was focused on predicting the contribution of nano fly ash (NFA) reinforcement material on weld joints of aluminium metal matrix composites (AMCs). The AMCs were produced through stir casting with 0%, 1%, 2%, 3% weight of NFA reinforcement. Weld joints of AMC plates were fabricated through Friction stir welding (FSW) process by considering %wt of NFA, tool feed rate (TFR) and tool rotational speed (TRS) as process parameters. Taguchi analysis has been used through a selection of L16 factorial design of experiments and subsequent mechanical properties were obtained for all L16 array of experiments. Predicted optimum values were determined by considering Taguchi response values and main effect plots at optimal conditions. The relative significance of individual process parameters were determined by ANOVA analysis. NFA has 78.73%, 90.95% and 79.93% contribution on tensile strength, Vickers Hardness number and impact strength respectively of AMC weld joints.

333,"In this article, we report for the first time that the well-established diffusion noise can be apparently increased in large proportions and that such a situation can be very common at some specific frequencies in the p-n junction structures operating at a very low direct bias current. Noise theories and the associated measurement techniques are a major issue for the emerging semiconductor technologies, the development of accurate computer-aided design (CAD) models, and the designing of low-noise circuits and systems. The conventional shot noise model usually satisfactorily describes the p-n junction noise in solid-state devices, such as diodes and transistors. It has proven to be very efficient for many different conventional and advanced semiconductor technologies. However, alterations may sometimes be needed as previous works indicate scenarios where this so-called shot noise exhibits deviations from the theory, which translates into some noise suppression. In this article, we report on alterations that look like low-frequency diffusion noise enhancement (unexpected noise increase). It occurs at low current levels, for many generic commercially available diodes and the p-n junctions in transistors. Therefore, we propose an appropriate electrical noise model that satisfies both the low-frequency noise experimental data and the electrical behavior of the devices observed from impedance spectroscopy. We also evaluate this model as the ambient temperature is varied. Finally, it is discussed how this model can be connected to the conventional van der Ziel shot noise model and a better insight on the possible origin of such diffusion noise enhancement is provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both used organo halides as the initiators, the key being the atom transfer to the metal was reversible, producing ""living"" polymerizations with narrow polydispersities. Metal catalysts for these polymerizations have since been extended to other metals; including iron, palladium, nickel, rhodium, and cobalt.

338,"The presence of dent in composites causes a reduction in its compressive strength. To understand the effect of a dent in hybrid composites with the inter-ply approach of Carbon and Kevlar reinforcements in an epoxy matrix, the damage tolerance estimated by applying a compression load in compression after impact test to the samples having with indentation produced in quasi-static apparatus using a conical-shaped penetrator. It was observed that the place and content of Kevlar layers directly effect on the toughness of composites which steered to the enhancement of the penetration resistance. The compression loading was given to the penetrated samples and then compressive residual strength calculated. The results revealed that the test sample of Kevlar reinforced epoxy composite presented a reduction of 32% in compression strength after quasi-static indentation and hence is more damage tolerant against indentation compared to other carbon-Kevlar/epoxy hybrid and carbon-reinforced epoxy composites. The samples submitted to compression after tests were photographed revealing typical crack aspects. The quasi-static indentation process and key findings can help as a design guideline for dynamic application, predominantly, velocity impact loading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
339,"Quantum mechanics is arguably the most important physical theory to have emerged in the 20th century. It, in principle, explains nature on the atomic level completely, specifically the interactions between electrons and the energy levels of atoms, necessary to understand the properties of atoms, molecules, and solids, all the way to living things. The fundamental laws were established already before 1930, but applying them to real systems, observable in the real world, has taken much longer. This was due, at least in part, to the computational complexity of these laws, which can only be solved by making careful approximations. Once one has these results, one has to extract the physical important consequences. Marvin Cohen has played a central role in making it possible today to use these equations in practical terms to explain and predict macroscopic properties of materials. His pioneering work started already in the 1960s, when he used the concept of ""empirical pseudopotentials"" to make accurate descriptions of the optical properties of a large group of semiconductors, based on existing measurements (= ""empirical""). In the following years, the understanding of the interaction of electrons deepened, and he was in the 1970s and 1980s able to develop new theories and carefully made approximations that made the calculations independent of experimental data; he could truly start to predict the properties of materials by only knowing the identity of the atoms involved (""first principles""). The impact of this is hard to overestimate: It is now possible to predict the properties of novel materials before they are synthesized in the laboratory, making progress in the development of new functional materials much faster. Cohen has for 50 years been at the very forefront of this development, extending it to ever more complex materials. He has mentored a large number of young scientists, who, together with him, have continued to carry the field forward. Indeed, it is likely that Cohen and his intellectual descendants compose the most cited group of physicists in the world. Today, quantum mechanical calculations of solids are a large and ever increasing field, in size as well as importance. Cohen stands alone, through his contributions to the development of fundamental theory, to calculation schemes all the way to the application to real materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

341,"The degradation of amine solvents leads to increasing costs and deterioration in long term performance. Therefore, the purification of the solvents is needed to guarantee smoother operations. In this research, the flotation setup was investigated by means of laboratory and pilot-scale experiments in the amine reclamation for chloride and N, N ' -bis (2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine (BHEP) separation. The maximum removal efficiency recorded was 51% for the largest chloride concentration of 7091 mg/l and 37% for the lowest chloride concentration of 1536 mg/l. The mass transfer coefficient was hence correlated with the hydrodynamic parameters, including chloride reduction rate, bubble surface area, and gas and liquid phase concentration. The average chloride removal efficiency for the monoethanolamine (MEA) was more than 61% due to a better dispersion of pure nitrogen gas bubbles and formation of the tiny bubbles provided in the column. The results indicated that a higher chloride initial concentration corresponded to better performance of the setup. Under the typical column operating conditions, it was concluded that a collection zone H:D of 10:1 was a reasonable compromise. The flotation setup results in BHEP separation, known as amine degradation product showed about 24% average amine recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
342,"In this research, we focused on the tuning of the absorption properties of acceptor materials based on naphthothiophene diimide (NTI) with a triad structures (NTI-pi-NTI) by modifying the central pi-unit. Novel NTI-based acceptors with a spirobifluorene (SF) unit (SF-NTIs) were designed and synthesized. Their absorption range (400-600 nm) were clearly different from that of previously reported acceptor with a NTI-indacenodithiophene-NTI structure (IDT-NTI, 650-800 nm). Although, the SF-NTI with the same solubilizing groups as IDT-NTI (2-ethylhexyl groups) is not soluble enough for solution processes and favorable molecular orientation properties for OSC devices, the 1-hexylheptyl substituted SF-NTI showed a good solubility and favorable ""face-on"" orientation in the active layer films. The fabricated OSCs showed power conversion efficiency as high as 5.2%, and excellent thermal stability. These results indicate that the absorption of the NTI-triads can be tuned by modifying the central pi-unit and that their orientation nature and solubility can be controlled by altering the alkyl groups on the imide moieties. These properties allow us to develop efficient NTI-based acceptors with various absorption ranges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

344,"Key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) combiners, recently formalized by Giacon, Heuer, and Poettering (PKC'18), enable hedging against insecure KEMs or weak parameter choices by combining ingredient KEMs into a single KEM that remains secure assuming just one of the underlying ingredient KEMs is secure. This seems particularly relevant when considering quantum-resistant KEMs which are often based on arguably less well-understood hardness assumptions and parameter choices. We propose a new simple KEM combiner based on a one-time secure message authentication code (MAC) and two-time correlated input secure hash. Instantiating the correlated input secure hash with a t-wise independent hash for an appropriate value of t, yields a KEM combiner based on a strictly weaker additional primitive than the standard model construction of Giaon et al. and furthermore removes the need to do n full passes over the encapsulation, where n is the number of ingredient KEMs, which Giacon et al. highlight as a disadvantage of their scheme. However, unlike Giacon et al., our construction requires the public key of the combined KEM to include a hash key, and furthermore requires a MAC tag to be added to the encapsulation of the combined KEM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
345,"Fault tree analysis (FTA) is used to find and mitigate vulnerabilities in a system based on its constituent components. Methods exist to efficiently find minimal cut sets (MCSs), which are combinations of components whose failure causes the system to fail. However, traditional FTA ignores the physical location of the components. Components that are close to each other could be defeated by a single event with a radius of effect, such as an explosion or fire. This motivates the search for techniques to identify such vulnerabilities. Adding physical locations to the fault tree structure can help identify vulnerabilities in the overall system. Using this information requires extending existing solution methods or developing entirely new methods. In this paper, two solution approaches were explored. The first executes traditional FTA software, then searches for clusters in the resulting MCS to find these vulnerabilities. The second uses an evolutionary algorithm to search directly for volumes containing components that form cut sets. Results show that the evolutionary approach provided better answers (i.e., smaller volumes) overall and is suitable to identify vulnerabilities caused by proximity of components. However, the cluster approach performed well when evaluating higher numbers of locations and may be suitable in specific situations. Potential refinements to both methods are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our accelerator exploits parallelism at the low level by implementing the basic resolution step in hardware, and at the high level by instantiating a number of parallel modules for proof checking. Since proof checking involves highly irregular memory accesses, we employ Hybrid Memory Cube technology for accelerator memory.

347,"We propose an interference based molecular transistor consisting of two side groups and a central molecule group. The proposed transistor incorporates a more realistic situation and utilizes three level interference model, a novel concept which yields better transistor performance. Analytical expression of the transmission is obtained using three site energy model and the transfer characteristic of the proposed molecular transistor is investigated. Two different transistor configurations are considered, namely the central molecule directly coupled to the gate lead and isolated by a gate dielectric. The closed form expression for the voltage at which the transistor turns OFF, an important design parameter, is also obtained. Then, performance comparison is done between the two proposed configurations by varying the coupling energy between the side group states and the leads. It is shown that the dielectric separated central molecule configuration has much lower subthreshold slope than present day MOSFETs and much higher ON/OFF current ratio than the four level interference based molecular transistor.

The archived system is solved by Newton's iterative method. Our method is stated in general case on rectangular [a, b] x [0, T] which is based upon Jacobi polynomial by parameters (alpha, beta).

The obtained results confirm the acceptable accuracy and stability of the presented method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
349,"Multiuser systems suffer from multiple access interference (MAI) due to the correlations between users signature codes. The decorrelator detector uses the inverse correlation matrix of the signature codes to eliminate the MAI. The major disadvantage of the decorrelator detector is the enhancement of the noise power at its outputs as mentioned in many previous works. This statement is not always true for non-orthogonal correlation matrix. The decorrelator detector can reduce the noise power at its outputs at certain conditions for non-orthogonal correlation matrix. If the sum of the eigenvalues of the non-orthogonal correlation matrix is greater than the sum of the eigenvalues of its inverse, the decorrelator detector will not enhance the noise power at its output. Moreover, the exponential of the determinant of the correlation matrix should be greater than the exponential of the determinant of its inverse. These two conditions are presented and proved in this work. A new family of signatures codes is also proposed to match the proposed conditions for the correlation matrix. The new signature codes are based on pulse position modulation (PPM). The paper shows that the new codes have three degrees of freedom to change the correlation coefficients between them.

350,"Scientific web repositories are central cyber locations where academic papers are stored and maintained. With the nature of the unstructured and semi-structured information/metadata within these repositories, literature analysis for scholar writing becomes a challenge. Correspondingly, applying CRISP-DM poses a stance to address this challenge through formulating a rather augmented process for a relevant literature search. However, almost all repositories do not have a straight forward method where metadata could be extracted for preliminary data processing being applied as part of the CRISP-DM process. Additionally, most repositories do not follow open access standards. Until the time this paper was published, the topic of the augmented, relevant literature search had seen a methodological progress only, with the inability to apply the underlying methods on a larger scale, given data access constraints to open access repositories. The aim of this paper is to propose CRISP-DM as an augmented research methodology with a focus on web scraping as part of the data processing step. To substantiate the proposed methodology, a play role case study is conducted. This then works on alleviating these restrictions, as well as encouraging the wider adoption of the augmented analysis process for a relevant literature search within the research community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, one of the significant challenges that hinder the wide application of singular beams is how to effectively identify the topological charge and the polarization order of arbitrary singular beams.

Based on this phenomenon, an effective method is proposed to probe the integral topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams. With this detection method, the vortex beam, cylindrical vector beam and cylindrical vector vortex beam with different topological charges and polarization orders have been experimentally identified. This effective detection method can be widely used to measure the topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

354,"The design of rural drinking water schemes consists of optimization of several network components like pipes, tanks, pumps and valves. The sizing and configuration of these network configurations need to be such that the water requirements are met while at the same time being cost efficient so as to be within government norms. We developed the JalTantra system to design such water distribution networks. The Integer Linear Program (ILP) model used in JalTantra and described in our previous work solved the problem optimally, but took a significant amount of time for larger networks-an hour for a network with 100 nodes. In this current work, we describe a series of three improvements of the model. We prove that these improvements result in tighter models, i.e. the set of points of linear relaxation is strictly smaller than the linear relaxation for the initial model. We test the series of three improved models along with the initial model over eight networks of various sizes and show a distinct improvement in performance. The 100-node network now takes only 49 s to solve. These changes have been implemented in JalTantra, resulting in a system that can solve the optimization of real world rural drinking water networks in a matter of seconds.

356,"In many situations, conventional foundation systems could not be chosen in soft soil due to the low bearing capacity. In such a case, ground improvement or reinforcing of the ground is necessary to obtain the required bearing capacity. This paper deals with the use of geosynthetics to reinforce the ground for reducing ground deformation and increasing bearing capacity of the ground. This research is mainly focused on the soft clay soil which is more problematic than the sandy soils with respect to the building foundation of infrastructures. Here, numerical analysis has been carried out with the finite element method, using the elastoplastic sub loading t(ij) model. Bearing capacities for different over consolidation ratios (OCRs)and changing the depth of the reinforcement are compared. Bearing capacity is also checked replacing the soft clay with granular soil in between the foundation and reinforcement. It is found that reinforcement increases the bearing capacity of the soft clay and the increment of the bearing capacity depends on the depth of the reinforcement, OCR and improved area of the ground underneath the foundation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is composed of four phases: preprocessing of fMRI data; filtering insignificant voxels; postprocessing; and meta-heuristics selection. The main contribution is benefiting a meta-heuristics search algorithm to guide a wrapper voxel selection. The main criterion to nominate a voxel is based on its mutual information with the provided stimulus label.

358,"The static fatigue test shows that the lifetime of dual-coated optical fibers is governed by the axial tensile stress exerted on the glass fibers. Polymeric coatings of optical fibers own viscoelastic behavior, so the axial tensile stress acted on the glass fibers depends on the time. After recognizing the exact viscoelastic performance of commercial polymeric coatings, the long-term tensile thermal stresses applied to the glass fiber of dual-coated optical fibers are obtained by viscoelastic theory. Following, the influence of thermal stresses on the fiber's static fatigue is evaluated, and the selection of dual-coated optical fibers to lessen the static fatigue is acquired. To reduce these long-term thermal stresses, the radius, Young's modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, and relaxation time of the secondary coating should be diminished, but the strain ratio of the secondary coating should be raised. Furthermore, the secondary coating should possess sufficiently radius and Young's modulus to withstand external mechanical damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

360,"Self-similarity analysis-based feature summarizing technique (SuCo) was proposed recently to improve the time and memory efficiency of Cover Song Identification (CSI). In this paper, both the feature summarizing and the cross-similarity calculating strategies of the SuCo model are modified as follows to enhance its identification accuracy. At the feature summarizing stage, first, the Hubness Reduction (HR) strategy is adopted to reduce the possible 'Hubness' phenomenon existing in the feature subsequence community, which may affect the retrieval effectiveness. Then, the Network Enhancement (NE) technique, which was originally proposed in biology to improve gene-function prediction accuracy, is introduced to reduce the noise in the self-similarity network caused by the limitation of feature extraction and similarity measuring, and the inherent musical and acoustic variations. At the cross-similarity calculating stage, first, the summarized representative feature subsequences of the reference are concatenated to obtain its combined representative feature. Then, considering that the nonlinear recurrence property is important for describing the melody perception-based similarity, Qmax is adopted to measure the similarity between the combined representative feature of the reference and the unsummarized feature sequence of the query.

The array element is a compact ring patch antenna, and all of the radiating patches are fabricated on the same substrate. A horizontal coaxial balun is used to excite the compact element so that the isolation between two orthogonal polarizations and the coupling between two adjacent elements are reduced. A prototype of the proposed array is constructed. The measured results show that the prototype can be operated at two frequency bands, including 2.4 to 2.48 GHz and 5.15 to 5.875 GHz. Within the operation bandwidths, the array has a gain of about 12 dBi and a cross-polarization level of less than -25 dB; in addition, the isolation levels between input ports are smaller than -35 dB.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

363,"This paper presents a new systematic approach for the design of a gain-scheduling-control system for the oil pressure system of internal combustion engines. Therefore, optimal linear time invariant controllers are designed at given operating points and their characteristics are interpolated by an analytical function. An optimization algorithm finds optimal parameters for a given linear controller structure with a fixed order and two degrees of freedom. To solve the optimization problem, constraints in the H infinity-norm are given for six different transfer functions of the closed loop. The same restrictions are applied for all operating points. For the gain-scheduling-approach, no classical superimposition of the output variables of the linear controllers is selected, as it is often the case with gain-scheduling-controllers. Instead, the poles and zeros of the gain-scheduling-controller are functionally calculated from the linear control loops depending on the scheduling variable. Therefore, the resulting gain-scheduling-controller shows the set behaviour of the linear controllers independently of the original operating points. A control loop that is independent of the nonlinearity of the controlled system is more efficient than conventional oil pressure control systems that use too high target oil pressures for robustness reasons. This results in increased efficiency of the oil pressure system, which can make a significant contribution to fuel savings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
364,"A hedonic price model was estimated for residential developments in the province of Alberta in Canada. The model is designed to be used with the Production, Exchange and Consumption Allocation System (PECAS) land use modeling framework, which forecasts future development patterns on each parcel based on developer return-on-investment functions, allocates households and jobs, and calculates economic benefit measures. In PECAS, base year rents by land use zone (LUZ) are a calibration target, while future rents by LUZ are calculated in a bid-rent allocation, so the estimation separates out local effects from neighbourhood (LUZ) effects. Local effects include proximity to busy collectors, light rail transit (LRT) stations, schools, and amenities such as parks, as well as local road and off-road access to the nearest network link. A non-linear treatment was required to separate out the value of land from the value of space, especially on large parcels at low intensities of development. A Bayesian approach was used to 1) incorporate prior knowledge from previous PECAS work in the U.S., and 2) to provide a model that can forecast future prices on any parcel in Alberta, even in areas where certain types of development are not currently sufficient in quantity to confidentally estimate parameters. The estimation quantifies the current price landscape in Alberta by LUZ, showing higher prices (and a tendency for future development, where allowed) in major cities, major oil industry locations, and national parks. It also quantifies the positive impacts of local road access, LRT station proximity, schools, rivers, and natural areas; the negative (nuisance) impact of being too near to busy roads and schools; and the depreciation of older buildings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
365,"Multiple patterning lithography allows fine patterns beyond lithography limit, but it suffers from a large process cost. In this paper, we address a method to reduce the number of V0 masks; it consists of two sub-problems. First, stitch-induced via (SIV) is introduced to reduce the number of V0 masks. It involves the redesign of standard cells to replace some vias in V0 layer with SIVs, such that the remaining vias can be assigned to the reduced masks. Since SIV formation requires metal stitches in different masks, SIV replacement and metal mask assignment should be solved simultaneously. This sub-problem is formulated as integer linear programming (ILP). In the second sub-problem, inter-row via conflict aware detailed placement is addressed. Single row placement optimization is performed for each row to remove metal and inter-row via conflicts, while minimizing cell displacements. Since it is time consuming to consider many cell operations at once, we apply a few operations iteratively, where different operations are applied to each iteration and to each cell depending on whether the cell has a conflict in the previous iteration. Remaining conflicts are then removed by mapping conflict cells to white spaces. To this end, we minimize the number of cells to move and maximize the number of large white spaces before mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that the cell placement with two V0 masks is completed by proposed methods, with 7 times speedup and 21% reduction in total cell displacement, compared to conventional detailed placement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we analyse the performance of three Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithms in estimating Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in the Czech Republic to gain knowledge about their accuracy and uncertainty. The Dark Target (DT), the Deep Blue (DB), and the merged algorithm (DTB) of the MODIS latest collection 6.1 Level 2 aerosol products (MOD04_L2) were tested by comparing its results with the measurements of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Level 3 Version 2.0 ground station at Brno airport.

367,"This letter discusses a novel low-power circuit to self-localize a mobile sensor node in the three-dimensional space using a passive optical receiver. Self-localization of sensors, where a sensor node computes its spatial location by itself, reduces transmission demand, and improves real-time conformity of mobile wireless sensor systems. Our approach forms an over-determined system of angles-of-arrival (AoAs) to mobile sensor received from an optical anchor grid. The AoA system is solved with a linear program (LP) solver, which is implemented using a nonlinear feedback recurrent neural network. To solve the primal and dual LP optimization problems in the AoA system, we show a single multifunctional data path that does not require matrix inversions; thereby, enables within-sensor low-power computations to self-localize. Additionally, unlike other optical indoor positioning architectures, our approach does not require measurements of received signal strength and, thereby, is insensitive to power and alignment imbalances in the anchor grid. We show proof-of-concept field programmable gate array (FPGA) and ASIC simulations of our approach and validate its operation under noisy AoA data and for different numbers of anchors. An FPGA implementation in 180 nm CMOS achieves a peak similar to 0.12 mega localization operations per second per Watt (MOPS/W), while ASIC design in 45 nm CMOS shows a peak similar to 7.7 MOPS/W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One is when illegal access does not occur, and the other is when illegal access occurs.

Further, an optimal policy which minimizes the expected cost is discussed. Finally, numerical examples are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
369,"Sampling is an important and effective strategy in analyzing ""big data"", whereby a smaller subset of a dataset is used to estimate the characteristics of its entire population. The main goal in sampling is often to achieve a significant gain in the computational time. However, a major obstacle towards this goal is the assessment of the smallest sample size needed to ensure, with a high probability, a faithful representation of the entire dataset, especially when the data set is compiled of a large number of diverse structures (e.g., clusters). To address this problem, we propose a method referred to as the Sparse Withdrawal of Inliers in a First Trial (SWIFT) that determines the smallest sample size of a subset of a dataset sampled in one grab, with the guarantee that the subset provides sufficient number of samples from each of the underlying structures necessary for the discovery and inference. The latter is established with high probability, and the lower bound of the smallest sample size depends on probabilistic guarantees. In addition, we derive an upper bound on the smallest sample size that allows for detection of the structures and show that the two bounds are very close to each other in a variety of scenarios. We show that the problem can be modeled using either a hypergeometric or a multinomial probability mass function (pmf), and derive accurate mathematical bounds to determine a tight approximation to the sample size, leading thus to a sparse sampling strategy. The key features of the proposed method are: (i) sparseness of the sampled subset for analyzing data, where the level of sparseness is independent of the population size; (ii) no prior knowledge of the distribution of data, or the number of underlying structures in the data; and (iii) robustness in the presence of overwhelming number of outliers. We evaluate the method thoroughly in terms of accuracy, its behavior against different parameters, and its effectiveness in reducing the computational cost in various applications of computer vision, such as subspace clustering and structure from motion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
370,"A compact and low profile ultra wideband planar antenna comprises dual notched-band characteristics for WIMAX and WLAN are presented. UWB communication system is allocated between 3.1 and 10.6GHz, which coexisted with the WLAN and WIMAX frequency bandwidths at 3.3 to 3.6GHz, and 5 to 6GHz, repsectively. The coexistence between multiple frequency bandwidths possibly can cause interference into the communication systems such as data loss and signal disruption. Thus, it is essential to eliminate the coexisted frequency bandwidhs from UWB spectrum. The UWB planar antenna is costructed with a radiator of an elliptical-shaped, and half-ground element which is subjected to suppress the frequency bandwidth for 3.3 to 3.7 and 5 to 6 GHz. Slits are engraved in the elliptical radiator and ground clement by etching the conductor elements. Slit shapes are designed in simple and optimized to realize the maximum band notch characteristics. Slit placements are scrutinized and the band notch characteristics are determined. It is considered that the slit in the ground element and the elliptical radiator have stimulated the band notches frequency bandwidths for 3.3 to 3.7 and 5 to 6 GHz, respectively. The UWB planar antennas arc compared with the reference antenna and the results are verified. Measured reflection coefficient S-11 for band notch peaks at the WLAN and WIMAX frequency bandwidths are about -3.0 and -4.0 dB, respectively.

372,"Modern pulp mills can produce biofuels and value-added bio-products, such as lignin products. However, these bio-products are often present in solutions that are too dilute to be separated in a cost-efficient manner, and concentration by filtration is difficult due to their high fouling properties. In this research, challenging liquor, tannin-containing spruce bark extract, was concentrated by forward osmosis using soda ash from the soda recovery boiler as a draw solution. Soda ash, which consists of about 90% sodium sulphate, could be considered as a cost-free draw solution, since part of it needs to be discharged daily in order to prevent enrichment of potassium and chloride in the chemical circulation of pulp mills. Draw properties of soda ash solution were compared with the properties of pure salts, namely sodium sulphate and sodium chloride. Soda ash generated the same osmotic pressure and similar flux than sodium sulphate, but was a weaker draw solution compared with sodium chloride. When the draw solution concentration was 20% at 40 degrees C, the flux was 16 and 13 LMH with soda ash and sodium sulphate, respectively. Using FO, water recovery over 80% could be reached, which is double compared with water recovery obtained by nanofiltration. However, the salt concentration of the feed solution was increased due to the reverse salt flux of the draw solution, which may hinder the further processing of tannin-containing spruce bark extract.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

380,"Silver-coated Al-Si alloy particles were prepared by a polyol method to develop a novel conductive filler. The influence of the reaction temperature, reaction time, concentration of silver ions, and addition of a protective agent on the size of the silver particles formed and silver coverage on the Al-Si alloy particles was investigated. The addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone into the liquid phase led to a reduction in the size of the silver particles and an increase in the silver coverage on the alloy surface. The optimum concentration of silver ions for silver coating ranged from 3.8 x10(-2) to 1.5x 10(-1) mol/L, and an excess amount of silver ions (0.3 mol/L) caused agglomeration of the particles. The coating of the alloy was achieved by the adhesion of small silver particles onto the alloy surface, followed by growth of the particles with increasing reaction time. Control of the thickness of the layer was possible by changing the silver nitrate concentration in ethylene glycol within a range not exceeding 0.3 mol/L. Silver nitrate concentrations of 7.5x10(-3) or 1.5 x10(-2) mol/L were suitable to obtain particles with a thin silver layer and high coverage. Coverage of the entire surface of Al-Si alloy particles was achieved by coating Al-Si particles at AgNO3 concentration of 3.8x 10(-2) mol/L and then recoating the coated particles at the concentration of 1.5 x 10(-2) mol/L.

383,"In the paper, a finite element model is developed that predicts boundary layer transition in low-speed aerodynamic flows. The model is based on a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes approach, where the incompressible form of the Navier-Stokes equations is solved together with a three-equation eddy-viscosity model utilizing the FEniCS framework. A least-square stabilized Galerkin method is employed in order to prevent numerical oscillations that can arise from dominant advection terms. The proposed FEniCS model is ideal for applications with complex geometries and is tested on high performance computing platforms for parallel processing. The FEniCS model is validated by comparing the skin friction coefficient as well as profiles of velocity and total fluctuation kinetic energy with the benchmark experimental data for transitional boundary layers on a flat plate. The validity of the solver is further examined using experimental measurements reported for a NLF(1)-0416 natural laminar flow airfoil at different angles of attack. The airfoil results are also compared with those obtained using XFOIL, a well-known tool for the design of two-dimensional airfoils.

The self-similarity solution is further simplified in order to indicate several asymptotic bubble growth regimes. The case of non-constant bubble growth rate conditions is treated only for the asymptotic regime of quasi-steady growth. Several results for idealized and realistic bubble growth cases are presented. It is shown that the two individual theories of degassing and boiling are unified through the appropriate manipulation of the bubble temperature. Small temperature differences can yield large variation in bubble growth rate in a small range around the boiling temperature.

385,"The operating life of endoscopy capsules is limited by the batteries needed for use. The capacity of corresponding batteries, however, is too short to cover the total period of gastrointestinal transit. To overcome this limitation, a novel kind of wireless power transmission was used. It utilizes a permanent magnetic cylinder located outside the patient's body and is turned by an electric motor, thereby generating a rotating magnetic field. This field in turn causes the motor, by a permanent magnetic sphere, located in a liquid bearing inside the endoscopy capsule, to rotate synchronously. The sphere induces an alternating voltage in coils inside the capsule and thus provides the necessary power. This arrangement was able to transmit power of up to 170 mW. This value is clearly higher than the minimum power of 100 mW needed to operate the electronics of the endoscopy capsules that are actually in use. The volume of both the sphere and the induction coil is smaller than the batteries that are actually integrated in the capsules. By this means, the operating time may be prolonged, in principle up to arbitrary values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

390,"This paper evaluates the performance of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system considering backward compatibility issue. This issue is considered by assuming that backward/legacy devices are incapable to perform successive interference cancellation (SIC), which is the baseline for NOMA systems. In a normal NOMA two-user pair between a cell center user (CCU) and a cell edge user (CEU), the CCU needs to perform SIC for data recovery, whereas the CEU does not need to perform SIC. Considering this, for the cell edge legacy devices, they can get paired in the conventional NOMA user pairing fashion, as they do not need to perform SIC being CEUs. But for the cell center legacy devices, they cannot get paired, as they are unable to perform SIC. In these scenarios, we evaluate the performance of a NOMA system, and investigate user pairing strategies to improve the system performance. Detailed mathematical analysis is provided to investigate the sum capacity of the NOMA system, followed by validation using simulations. It is shown through results that performance of the NOMA system in the presence of legacy devices can be improved through efficient user pairing strategies. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The planarity, continuity, and clay mineral infill are particularly important in the areas where outslope bedding dominates. The shear strength of clay mineral approaches zero upon saturation. The discontinuity nomenclature reduces the volume of the geomodel (GM) works, which comprise geology, hydrogeology, engineering geology, geoenvironment, and the geotechnics over 80%. The smectite-group clay minerals have a unit cell with net negative charge. Hence the water is readily captured by the electrically unbalanced mineral causing it to swell by more than 10% of its dry volume and then its shear strength approaches zero. The outsloping bedding, layering, or the basically imbricated thrust faults in places are the common examples of large-scale landslides. The discontinuity survey with the proposed nomenclature and approach is especially important in locating and orienting linear engineering structures. Consequently, this approach enhances the researchers and designers considerably in conducting projects conveniently in terms of timing, environment, safety/security and the cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
396,"Objective. N400 plays an important role in the studies of cognitive science and clinical neuropsychology diseases. However, it is still a challenge to extract the N400 component from a few trials of electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Approach. A method was proposed to analyze the spatial and temporal-frequency patterns of N400 in this study. First, resampling-average difference was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of N400 in EEG samples. Next, dictionary learning was utilized to adaptively select the wavelet bases corresponding to event-related potentials (ERPs) rather than spontaneous EEG activities and obtain the temporal-frequency patterns of ERPs. Finally, the low-rank constrained sparse decomposition was exploited to remove the spontaneous EEG activities and to learn the ERP spatial patterns, and the number of ERPs was also automatically determined. Simulation N400 datasets with different SNR levels and real N400 datasets of 15 subjects were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Main results. The results indicated that the proposed method accurately extracted the N400 component from a few trials of EEG data, and a significant difference of extracted N400 waveforms was observed between two experiment conditions. Significance. In the proposed method, the resampling-average difference significantly enhanced the SNR of EEG samples. Combined with the dictionary learning, the low-rank constrained sparse decomposition effectively removed the spontaneous EEG activities and automatically selected the correct ERP components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

398,"A double-resonator unit cell is designed to achieve a locally resonant bandgap in the range of low-frequency in this paper. The characteristics of the wave motion of the double-resonators periodic structures are investigated both by finite element analysis and by vibration experimental analysis. The double-resonator periodic structure is printed by a 3D printer. In the double-resonator periodic structure, the low-frequency bandgap is realized in the case of a small size with a relatively hard matrix material. Both simulated and experimental results show that the double-resonator periodic structure does ensure the realization of local resonant bandgap in the range of low-frequency. Therefore, it can be predicted that locally resonant bandgap can be realized in the range of even lower frequency by using softer materials, while the unit cells are kept in the same size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
399,"The centrifuge model test is usually used for two-dimensional deformation and instability study of the soil slopes. As a typical loose slope, the municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill is easy to slide with large deformation, under high water levels or large earthquakes. A series of centrifuge model tests of landfill slide induced by rising water level and earthquake were carried out. The particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser displacement transducer (LDT) and marker tracer (MT) methods were used to measure the deformation of the landfill under different centrifugal accelerations, water levels and earthquake magnitudes. The PIV method realized the observation of continuous deformation of the landfill model, and its results were consistent with those by LDT, which had higher precision than the MT method. The deformation of the landfill was mainly vertically downward and increased linearly with the rising centrifugal acceleration. When the water level rose, the horizontal deformation of the landfill developed gradually due to the seepage, and a global slide surface formed when the critical water level was reached. The seismic deformation of the landfill was mainly vertical at a low water level, but significant horizontal deformation occurred under a high water level. The results of the tests and analyses verified the applicability of PIV in the two-dimensional deformation measurement in the centrifuge model tests of the MSW landfill, and provide an important basis for revealing the instability mechanism of landfills under extreme hydraulic and seismic conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
400,"Having simultaneously a high quality factor (i.e. a narrow resonant band) and a shorter decay time between the resonating system and the external sources (i.e. a wide resonant band) is a desirable characteristic for mechanical resonators, which however has been regarded as contradictory. This has been known as the limit of Lorentz reciprocity. We explore a configuration to achieve this desired characteristic within the mechanical regime. The configuration consists of a pair of mechanical resonators coupled together through their connecting part. One of them is encapsulated in a vacuum environment, and the other is left in the normal ambient condition. Numerical model of this configuration shows clearly the advantages such as: (a), sensitivity to the change of resonant frequency is greatly improved (the product of bandwidth Delta omega and the decay time Dt has increased at least two orders of magnitude); (b), the value of Delta omega . Delta t can be adjusted through the coupling stiffness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
401,"Fretting wear is a major form of fretting damage involving various factors, such as material properties, surface roughness, surface topography, lubrication conditions, environment temperature, type of loading, and loading phase difference. In this study, ABAQUS is used to establish three models to simulate the variation of wear depth with the amplitude of additional load. The influence of the phase difference between additional load and original load is considered. Four phase difference angles are involved, i.e. 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. Results indicate that the rule of the variation of wear depth with the additional load amplitude increasing varies under different phase differences. It is observed that for the 0 degrees phase difference, the wear depth firstly decreases then increases with the increase of the additional load. However, the wear depth increases monotonously in the case of the 180 degrees phase difference. The variation of wear depth with additional load amplitude for 90 degrees phase difference is similar to that of the 270 degrees phase difference. The depth of wear is firstly kept at a relatively low level and then increases sharply, with the increase of the additional load.

405,"It is of great importance to separate potassium salts from carbonate-based lakes, especially the low-[K+] but high-[Nal brine which has been discovered around the world. Here the phase diagram of the quaternary system Na+, K+/Cl-, CO32--H2O was experimentally studied at 298.15 K via the method of isothermal evaporation, and the results corrected the previous diagram reported by Blasdale (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1923, 45, 2935-2946). The type of salts appeared and their solubility during the evaporation, and the density vs composition diagram and the pH values were plotted based on the experimental data. It was found that there were six invariant points, seven univariant curves, and five crystallization fields in the equilibrium phase diagram. To extract single-salt of potassium, certain areas in the Na+, K+//C1-, C032 --H2O diagram were chosen to be acidified by the compressed CO2, and potassium in the form of KHCO3 was precipitated from the mother solution. The compressed CO2 was able to avoid formation of NaKCO3.6H2O during evaporation of the original system Na+, K+//C1-, CO32--H2O. Based on experiment data, the region area for potassium salt extraction was determined, and this area was suitable for extracting K+ salts from brines with a [Na+/ICl ratio even lower than 0.44.

406,"Objectives: In this study, we assess the possible influence of soybean isoflavone (genistein) and other flavonoids (quercetin and catechin) on breast cancer chemoprevention. We design in-vitro and in-vivo experiments to analyze the effect of genistein, quercetin and catechin on cell proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis of breast cancer cells. Methods: In cell proliferation experiment, MCF-7 cells, SKBR-3 cells, and HUVEC cells were treated with genistein and other flavonoids (catechin and/or quercetin) for 48 h to assess the influence on cell growth of normal and breast cancer cells. In cell motility test, we analyze the effect of isoflavone and flavonoids on migration ability of MCF-7 cells by 16 h and SKBR-3 cells by 24 h in two different concentrations (1.25 mu g/ml and 2.5 mu g/ml). In the in-vivo experiment, SKBR-3 cells mixed with PBS and catechin, respectively, were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, then we investigated the effect of catechin on cell growth by observing subcutaneous tumor size changes after 15 days. Results: The results suggest that genistein and quercetin can significantly inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells, and their inhibitory effects are independent of estrogen receptor. In cell motility tests, all of the three phytochemicals were effective in the inhibition of cell migration on two breast cancer cell lines, except for quercetin on cell migration of SKBR-3 cell line. In the in vitro experiment, catechin showed stimulatory effect on cell proliferation of HUVEC cell line, which may consider positive effect on angiogenesis, rather than inhibitory effect. However, in the in vivo experiment, it showed no significant change in tumor size between the groups of with and without catechin treatment. Conclusions: According to our study, the results suggest that isoflavone and flavonoids tend to inhibit cell growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Our in vivo experiment does not reach a significant result, and it may be due to lower catechin concentration. Under in vivo environment, we should also consider the possible metabolic forms of catechin that cause different result from the in vitro study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

408,"In order to meet the needs of the development of low-rise assembly structure in rural areas, a fabricated light-weight steel frame-composite light wall structure is proposed in this paper. The light-weight steel frames are used to bear the vertical loads. The single-row-reinforced recycled concrete wall-boards are used as lateral members to resist most of the horizontal earthquake loads. The wall-board, EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) insulation modules, and fly ash blocks form the thermally insulated wall. Four fabricated lightweight steel frame-composite light wall structures and one light-weight steel frame (FRA) structure were tested under the low cyclic loads. The influence of wall reinforcement spacing and structural form (be it fly ash block or not) on the seismic performance of this new structure was analysed and the damage process of the specimen was simulated using the ABAQUS (R) software. The results show that the light steel frames and the single-row-reinforced recycled concrete wall-board can work well together. Furthermore, the structure has two clear seismic lines. Due to the use of EPS insulation modules and fly ash blocks, the structure has good anti-seismic and thermal insulation abilities. Reducing the spacing of bars or compositing fly ash blocks can significantly improve the seismic performance of the structure.

410,"An ultra-high sensitivity directional torsion sensor by hybrid cascaded configuration is proposed. The cascaded structure are composed of a multimode interference (MMI) employing multimode fiber (MMF) and a Mach-Zehnder interference (MZI) employing triangular four core fiber (TFCF) with a spiral structure. Under the condition of continuous arc discharge, the spiral structure is realized by torquing TFCF. The spiral structure assisted the MZI has the ability to sense torsion and identify the direction. The ultra-high torsion sensitivity is due to the modified Vernier-effect, which is generated due to the spatial frequency difference between the MMI and MZI. The MMI acts as the reference interferometer, and the MZI with spiral structure act as the sensing interferometer. We used the Gaussian function to filter out the envelope frequency component. The inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is used to recover the envelope spectrum. The values of sensitivity magnification can be tuned by changing the length of the TFCF. The proposed configuration are applied for high-sensitive directional twisted sensor with a sensitivity of 0.8916 nm rad(-1) m(-1) over the range of -20.94 rad m(-1) to 13.96 rad m(-1).

411,"A novel three-dimensional (3D) micro-manufacturing technology of a curved surface diamond structure used for a micro birdbath resonator gyroscope (mu-BRG) with integrated curved electrodes is presented. The integrated curved electrodes with the same curvature as the birdbath shell are embedded using a self-aligned process, which avoids the extra assembly process, ensures the symmetry and improves the driving capacity of the mu-BRG. The capacitive gap is defined by the sacrificial layer, and a uniform and small gap distance (2 mu m) between the curved electrodes and the birdbath shell is obtained. The mu-BRGs with a diameter of 1.2 mm and a thickness of 2 mu m have been demonstrated by employing boron-doped microcrystalline diamond films deposited using hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD). In this paper, the device structure and basic working principle of the gyroscope are described. The key steps in the fabrication process, such as isotropic wet etching of the bulk silicon for a birdbath mold, photoresist spray-coating for patterning the curved electrodes, and deposition and etching of diamond films, are considered in detail and well solved. The radial deviation of the etched birdbath mold is about 0.31% for the similar to 560 mu m radius shell and the surface roughness of the birdbath mold is favorable (Rq = 4.933 nm, Ra = 3.945 nm).

Concentration polarisation is modelled for micro-particles by having the diffusion coefficient defined as a function of particle concentration and shear rate. The model considers the effect of an incompressible cake formation. Pore blocking phenomenon is predicted for filtration membrane fouling by using the rate of particles arriving at the membrane surface. The simulation code is parallelised in two ways. Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is used for a cluster of graphical processing units (GPUs) and Message Passing Interface (MPI) is utilised for a cluster of central processing units (CPUs), with various parallelisation techniques to optimise memory usage for higher performance.

413,"The problems of increasing the accuracy of numerical differentiation in the measurement model are investigated. We consider the measurements of target characteristics of an object that are not directly measurable, and also the reduction of measurements using the example of determining derivatives and initial parameters in the Cauchy problem. We clarify the relationship between the initial parameters of the differential dependencies and particular solutions of the differential equation of the Cauchy problem at the measurement points of the input quantities of the measurement model. Using the example of determining the derivatives in the Cauchy problem, we note the efficiency of the Lagrangian approximation of the functions of the input and output quantities of the measurement model. It is shown that the maximum accuracy of the approximation of the studied characteristics of the object is attainable using the theory of inverse problems. The following scientific results were obtained: assuming the form of the differential equation for the Cauchy problem, particular solutions of the equation are found; using a polynomial approximation, we compute the function of the measurement model input parameters measured by the sensors; we derive formulas for computing the derivatives of the function of input quantities; by the method of measurement reduction, an approximation grid is determined that minimizes the influence of sensor error. We propose a criterion for estimating the efficiency of solving the measurement reduction problem. Formulas are obtained for estimating the level of error in the derivatives of the function of the input quantities, taking into account the given sensor error.

The electrolysis analysis on the presence of several media would minimize the preparation steps on wastewater utilization for generating hydrogen as renewable energy. The research looks at the potential of wastewater as the raw material for the electrolysis process. In this research, stainless steel cyclic voltammograms were studied on water electrolysis.

415,"The topology of a network may change inevitably, due to dynamic behaviors of nodes and links, and failures of hardware and software. Many protocols and applications must be aware of the up-to-date topology of the underlying network. This triggers the <italic>topology calibration</italic> problem, which means to deduce those different nodes and links between two topologies. The Bloom filter and its variants are efficient to represent and calibrate two general sets. They, however, fail to represent all links and nodes in a topology simultaneously, and thus remain inapplicable to the <italic>topology calibration</italic> problem. In this paper, we design the graph filter, a novel space-efficient data structure to record not only the node set but also the link set of any given topology. Accordingly, given two topologies we aim to represent them via two respective graph filters, and thereafter deduce those different links in an invertible manner. To this end, we design three essential operations for graph filter, i.e., encoding, subtracting and decoding. Although such operations are sufficient to solve the topology calibration problem, two challenging issues still remain open. First, the <italic>XOR traps</italic> which occur with low probability at the encoding stage may result in a few miscalculations at the decoding stage. Thus, we propose another augmented decoding algorithm to lessen the impact of <italic>XOR traps</italic> via terminating illegal decodings. Second, several different links may form cycles in the worst case; hence, we further design a cycle destruction algorithm to make such different links decodable. We implement the graph filter and the associated topology calibration method. Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our method finishes the topology calibration task efficiently with high probability, incurs the least space overhead, and supports invertible decoding reasonably.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radio frequency and inductively coupled pure oxygen plasma techniques were used to obtain the fine etched structures. A simple etching scheme describing the obtained results is presented for each type of plasma technique and mask type. Although the Al mask is widely believed to have outstanding properties over other metallic materials, we found that the Cu mask exhibits lower side edge etching for both types of plasma techniques. A formation of thick and crystalline copper oxide layer in contrast with thin amorphous aluminum oxide is believed to be the reason for this behavior.

419,"Maritime works deteriorate continuously and at a certain moment in time are in need of some sort of repair. Usually the decision maker seeks technical advice and has to consider the resources available. A literature review showed great limitations in the tools that are today in use. This paper presents the implementation of a decision support methodology to prioritize repairs in rubble-mound breakwaters using MACBETH. Models for the benefits of repairing breakwaters, which are based on visual inspection data only, were created, and an expert meeting was held-the decision conference-following MACBETH. As outputs, the criteria, the value functions, and the weights to obtain scores were generated. Yet, using the condition indices set for the different levels of analysis of the breakwater, the decision maker will decide whether and how to intervene. The analysis uses MACBETH for calculating the scores and considers the benefits of the interventions in the armor layer for a breakwater divided into reaches. Costs and benefits are used afterward to prioritize the interventions. The common issue of the limited budget available is solved by applying portfolio-set of interventions-creation methods. The Ericeira rubble-mound breakwater (Portugal), which shows some signs of deterioration, was selected as a case study to illustrate the methodology. Interesting enough, the use of this new methodology shows what are the reaches that must be repaired in the very first place, which was not evident when using conventional analysis.

421,"It is believed that isolated subsurface structures of an infrastructure do not ventilate through opening(s) in manhole covers. The literature has almost no information on this topic. This study reports on considerations involved in the development and utilization of a method to study this question. Carbon monoxide (CO) is readily obtainable in engine exhaust, easily detectable at very low concentration, and is relatively safe to handle, which makes it ideal for use as a tracer gas. Transfer into the airspace of the structure was carried out using metal tubing. This study examined the engine operating time and the number of openings in a manhole cover. CO was measured using four instruments in the vertical profile. It was found to generally decrease in a narrow band, initially linearly through a curvilinear region and a linear tail. Clearance of most of the contaminant occurred rapidly during the first part of the process. A decrease to 25 ppm required from 439 min (7 openings) to 1118 min (1 opening). Ambient temperature and near-surface air flow likely influenced these values. The measurement profiles strongly suggest that the atmosphere in the airspace was rapidly and thoroughly well-mixed. The methodology developed and reported here is suitable for a more expanded investigation, the intent being to identify modifications of the design to optimize the process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve this, the equivalence ratio was fixed at 0.73, while the CO2 mole fraction was varied from 0 to 10%. The wall interaction model was used based on the Mundo-Sommerfeld model. In addition, the results of peak cylinder pressure, ignition delay, IMEP, NO distributions, and soot distributions were compared. The ignition delay was longer and the peak cylinder pressure was decreased with the increasing CO2 mole fraction because the evaporation of the injected fuel deteriorated. Moreover, when the CO2 mole fraction was increased to 5%, the ISNO values decreased to 55% owing to the high specific heat of CO2. Furthermore, the ISSoot values increased by 10% because the oxidation of soot does not occur well by low temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

425,"This paper proposes a learning policy to improve the energy efficiency (EE) of heterogeneous cellular networks. The combination of active and inactive base stations (BS) that allows for maximizing EE is identified as a combinatorial learning problem and requires high computational complexity as well as a large signaling overhead. This paper aims at presenting a learning policy that dynamically switches a BS to ON or OFF status in order to follow the traffic load variation during the day. The network traffic load is represented as a Markov decision process, and we propose a modified upper confidence bound algorithm based on restless Markov multi-armed bandit framework for the BS switching operation. Moreover, to cope with initial reward loss and to speed up the convergence of the learning algorithm, the transfer learning concept is adapted to our algorithm in order to benefit from the transferred knowledge observed in historical periods from the same region. Based on our previous work, a convergence theorem is provided for the proposed policy. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms follow the traffic load variation during the day and contribute to a performance jump-start in EE improvement under various practical traffic load profiles. It also demonstrates that proposed schemes can significantly reduce the total energy consumption of cellular network, e.g., up to 70% potential energy savings based on a real traffic profile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
426,"The paper proposed the optimization of the network construction timing of the control network according to the specific conditions of the survey route. Moreover, presented here are the adjustments according to the layout requirements of the control network layout process, strengthening the control of the line level base point during the construction process. Several optimization solutions are discussed for the special design of the level control before the construction of the long tunnel. It has been explained the methodology to introduce new Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) technology in railway survey and design with appropriately adjustment of the position requirements of the control network according to the specification. In order to carry out the special design of the levelling route with precision, it is advisable to set a certain stable reference point in the level control of the long line. The proposed methodology can effectively solve some problems existing in the current high-speed railway construction process, and make the precision measurement control network better for survey, design, construction, supervision and operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
427,Propagation of light beam along the optical axis of a biaxial crystal results in conical intensity distribution with an azimuthally varying polarization. Such variation of the polarization vector is utilized for the design of an optical diode in which the biaxial crystal with appropriate length is placed between two angularly adjusted polarizers. Our simulation results reveal that a significant difference in forward and backward transmission coefficients could be obtained by adjusting the crystal length as well as the optical wavelength.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
428,"Big data repository is a myriad collection of data that needs enormous processing for data analysis to extract interesting patterns. It involves third party to do the data analysis that endangers the privacy of the data. Hence, along with efficient real time analysis of data, privacy of the data also needs a careful attention. In this paper, we discuss the problem of linking attack in the data releases. We show the attack due to the linking of social media data with relational sensitive database discloses the sensitive information about a social entity. Though the data releases don't contain Identifiers (IDs) information like Name, Social Security Number (SSN), etc., linking attack is still possible through the combination of background knowledge with Quasi-Identifiers (QIDs) information like age, sex, etc. The solution encourages the release of anonymized relational sensitive database that obstruct the linking with other databases like social media data. Anonymization is a way to transform the original data to an anonymized version, such that the linkage between the sensitive information of an entity is dissociated from his/her identity. Most of the anonymity models are based on the concept of k-anonymity and l-diversity. In this paper, we present an extensive study on Greedy based heuristics. We propose Local Beam Search (LBS) based global generalization approach to achieve k-anonymity with l-diversity. The experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed method outperforms the existing Greedy based heuristics. The proposed method guarantees a faster convergence than existing Greedy based heuristics. Also, the proposed method performs better than the existing (t, k) Hypergraph Anonymization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
429,"In this paper, the numerical study of cold flow over two types of regular and wavy V-gutter flame holders has been presented. The edges of the V-gutter, which are smooth in the regular case, are shaped in a sinusoidal form with different phase angles on upper and lower edges. The three-dimensional numerical analysis has been performed using the finite volume method and the renormalization group k-e model has been used for turbulence modeling. The results were compared and validated by an existing experimental work based on the particle image velocimetry method. This study provided the fluid flow structure behind the V-gutter, the dimensions of the recirculation region, the behavior of vortex shedding phenomenon, and the static pressure distribution in the wake area. According to the results, the recirculation length for the sinusoidal case with 90 degrees of the phase difference is the largest compared with the other cases, which increases the mass flow rate of the fresh unburnt mixture into the recirculation region and improves flame stability. The results also show that the 90 degrees wavy V-gutter case has the lowest pressure drop in the wake region, which reduces the drag coefficient against the main flow. The values of the Strouhal number are approximately the same and equal to 0.27 for both cases (the regular and the 90 degrees cases). Therefore, it is concluded that the 90 degrees wavy V-gutter shows better performance than the regular V-gutter in flame stabilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
430,"The elements of rotors have inherent characteristics as geometry and material composition, which causes natural vibrations at frequencies that, due to the rotor unbalance, may coincide with the harmonics of the shaft speed, increasing stress and the probability of fractures even in transient conditions. Therefore, in this work, a theoretical-experimental hybrid method for calculating the natural frequencies and the mode shapes, at rest and non-supported conditions, of a turbocharger rotor is proposed. Firstly, a discrete model of low number of degrees of freedom is considered, and from an oversampled modal approach (OSMA) based on the axial oversampling, sectioning and coupling of the rotor, it is possible to use the oversampled mode shapes to increase the degrees of freedom of the system without major complications in the model. This spatial oversampling criterion is based on the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, and it is used to reduce the error in the estimates of the natural frequencies and to get a first approximation of the mode shapes. The natural frequencies were estimated by the transfer matrix method (TMM) and finite element method (FEM) in order to compare the proposed model results with well-founded numerical methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
431,"In order to achieve high-quality colour prints by using an electrophotography printing machine, it is necessary to prepare the printing substrate. Additional treatment may be needed to achieve the better substrate surface tension for optimally attaching the liquid electrophotography ink to the fine art paper. To ensure good adhesion of the ink to the printing substrate, a pre-treatment by application of surface tension regulating fluids (priming) may be used. In this paper, we will determine the possibility of realization of the CMY prints and the possibility of achieving an increased range of tone value in electrophotography digital printing. Based on the results, the new possible values of reproduced CMY tones will be determined so that a higher print quality can be achieved. The application of primers changes the optical properties of the paper printing substrate, which directly affects the colour reproduction. An additional 100 % increase of primer application will result in total colour changes of Delta E-c (0,E-5g/m2 &1g/m2) = 0,06, Delta E-C ((0,5g/m2 &1g/m2)) = 0,42, Delta E-Y ((0,5g/m2 &1g/m2)) = 0,08. In this scenario, 1 g/m(2) application of primer will produce the most intense full tones and therefore the highest quality prints for all three Electrolnk process colours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
432,Processing-in-memory (PIM) proposes to move computational components inside memory units to alleviate the high cost of data movement in big data processing. This approach has been recently utilized to reach high performance and energy-efficiency in large-scale graph processing. This paper analyzes a state-of-the-art PIM accelerator for graph processing and identifies message queue management as a significant bottleneck for system efficiency. Two metrics were introduced for representing the waiting time and processor utilization. We then present a lightweight solution for reducing waiting time caused by the message queue while increasing resource utilization in the system. Our simulation results on a set of real-world graph examples indicate that the enhanced graph processing system achieves 40% reduction in the overall execution time and 15% system energy savings over the baseline PIM based accelerator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
433,"Dynamic response of a round aluminum tube supported at both ends was investigated when impacted at its center by an external mechanical loading. The tube was subjected to different conditions. First, the empty tube was tested. Then the tube was filled with different amounts of stationary water (i.e., 25, 50, 75, and 100% full), based on the inner volume of the tube. Finally, flowing water through the tube was considered. Different magnitudes of impact loading were also applied. The study was primarily conducted experimentally with some additional numerical studies completed to further understand the results. The impact force as well as strain along the tube were measured for all described test conditions. Their results were compared. Additionally, the vibrational frequency and damping of the system were examined using strain-time histories. The results showed that the dynamic behavior of the tube was significantly dependent on the amount of internal water as well as its flow condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
434,"Spatial-spectral interference is an effective way to characterize an unknown ultra-short pulse. The key of characterizing an unknown ultra-short pulse is to retrieve the dispersion. Considering that the spatial-spectral interference fringe is the equiphase line of different spectra in the space domain and that the phase difference between adjacent interferences is equal to 2p, we propose a novel method of dispersion retrieval for spatial-spectral interference. The analytic expression is deduced and demonstrated by simulated experiments. This method has the advantages of intuitive principle, less calculation and simple process with no Fourier transform, which are beneficial for practical applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
435,"In Europe, market access for radio equipment is governed through the Radio Equipment Directive (RED), which replaced the Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (R&TTE) Directive in 2016. The essential requirements were introduced by RED and subsequently processed by European standards organizations: the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, and the European Committee for Standardization, in order to develop harmonised standards (HSs). These HSs may be used by manufacturers in order to achieve self-declaration of conformity of radio equipment. Compared to the previously applicable R&TTE Directive, RED contains a set of new Articles, including RED Articles 3(3)(a) to 3(3)(i) and Article 4, which were not enacted when RED was originally published. This article discusses the process for ""activating"" the corresponding articles, and provides commentary on related ongoing activities in European Commission Expert Groups and detailed implications on radio equipment design. Indeed, new requirements need to be met in order to achieve market access, such as reconfigurability, privacy, and security features. Finally, implications such as time to market and RED compliance certification cost are assessed, and a comparison to other regulation regimes is given, including those in the United States, Korea, and Russia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
436,"The natural gradient descent is an optimization method for real-valued neural networks that was proposed from the viewpoint of information geometry. Here, we present an extension of the natural gradient descent to complex-valued neural networks. Our idea is to use the Hermitian extension of the Fisher information matrix. Moreover, we generalize the projected natural gradient (PRONG), which is a fast natural gradient descent algorithm, to complex-valued neural networks. We also consider the advantage of complex-valued neural networks over real-valued neural networks. A useful property of complex numbers in the complex plane is that the rotation is simply expressed by the multiplication. By focusing on this property, we construct the output function of complex-valued neural networks, which is invariant even if the input is changed to its rotated value. Then, our complex-valued neural network can learn rotated data without data augmentation. Finally, through simulation of online character recognition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
437,"In this paper we report results from optical transmittance spectroscopy complemented with data from Raman scattering measurements to determine optical properties of two series of silicon based bilayers deposited by PECVD on glass substrate (intrinsic a-Si:H/p-type a-SiC:H and n-type mc-Si:H/intrinsic a-Si:H). These samples represent segments of common p-i-n thin film amorphous silicon solar cells with intrinsic hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H) as the solar absorber. The members of the series differ by the KCN treatment conditions. Dispersive and absorptive optical properties - refractive indices, absorption coefficients and optical band gaps were determined from transmittance spectra. Each bilayer was considered as one effective thin film the optical properties of which can be regarded as effective optical properties of the bilayer structure. After KCN treatments refractive indices were modified probably due to the structural changes of bilayers. Moreover the effect of the solvent used in KCN solutions was recognized. Optical band gaps calculated either by the Tauc procedure or determined as iso-absorption levels were found to be only slightly KCN treatment dependent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
438,"Fountain codes are erasure correcting codes realizing reliable communication systems for the multicast on the Internet. The zigzag decodable fountain (ZDF) codes are one of generalization of the Raptor codes, i.e., applying shift operation to generate the output packets. The ZDF codes are decoded by a two-stage iterative decoding algorithm, which combines the packet-wise peeling algorithm and the bit-wise peeling algorithm. By the bit-wise peeling algorithm and shift operation, ZDF codes outperform Raptor codes under iterative decoding in terms of decoding erasure rates and overheads. However, the bit-wise peeling algorithm spends long decoding time. This paper proposes fast bit-wise decoding algorithms for the ZDF codes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm drastically reduces the decoding time compared with the previous algorithm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
439,"Professor Nick Holonyak, Jr. has made many contributions to the field of electrical engineering. In 1960 he created the first binary III-V alloy compound semiconductor employing a ""closed-tube"" form of vapor-phase epitaxy (VPE). Realizing the flexibility and utility of combining different binary semiconductors to create entirely new ternary materials with properties that the binary compounds could not have, the first ""bandgap engineering"" was performed. This resulted in the demonstration of the first practical and efficient visible (red) laser diode and LED in 1962, thus laying the groundwork to produce (white) solid state lighting. This was a historic feat given that in 2015 a quarter of the world's energy was consumed by lighting. Based on these techniques, Holonyak and his students demonstrated the first laser diode using ultra-thin active layers-the first ""quantum-well (QW) lasers-in 1977. This technology underpins essentially all of the photonic sources-both LEDs and lasers-employed today. In fact, the compact lasers used in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), as well as the high-speed infrared lasers which are currently used in optical communications as the back-bone of the Internet and optical storage technologies, rely upon many of these innovations.

442,"Metal price is one of the most important parameters in the calculation of cut- off grade. The cut- off grade has the main role in determination of mine layout. Mine layout actuates mineable reserve, mine life and economic profitability. Not considering the uncertainty in metal prices can lead to a non-optimal layout. In this paper optimum underground mine layout is determined by expected utility theory with regard to metal price uncertainty. With the proposed approach metal price uncertainty is modeled by Monte Carlo simulation technique and decision maker will be gained probability of underground mine layouts. The utility function of underground mine layouts is defined and by the probability of them, expected utility is determined. Underground mine layout with the maximum expected utility is the optimum layout. Application of this approach in a hypothetical gold mine, in addition to considering metal price uncertainty, leads to 14% more mineable reserve and 18% higher net present value than normal design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
443,"To evaluate the potential of the high-efficiency microwave source Miro 200 CI the properties of plasma processes were investigated focusing at PECVD coatings of a-C:H- and SiOx as relevant applications. The sources were also intensively characterized by plasma diagnostic methods, e.g. by optical emission spectroscopy and electrical plasma probes. The analysis of the real efficiency of individual sources with slight changes in construction could be used to come to an optimized design. The Miro sources are able to create an extensive working volume showing relative homogeneous deposition rates of currently 35 mu m/h for a-C:H and 25 mu m/h for SiOx. An arrangement of multiple sources enables PECVD processes for large area coating at a pressure level close to those commonly used with PVD sources. So, post-oxidation of sputtered layers with the Miro source could be used beneficially to obtain optical oxide layers with lower absorption. Combinations with HIPIMS sputter sources lead to efficient deposition processes of coatings for tribological applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
444,"Sit-to-stand (STS) motion is one of the most common movements of a person during daily life. The motion, as a prerequisite for other movements, such as running and climbing, can be a very challenging task for the elderly or disabled people. Assistant tools, such as auxiliary walkers and exoskeletons, are commonly used to help these individuals have independent or at least semi-independent life. In order to design efficient rehabilitation treatments and also develop assistive devices for STS motion, it is necessary to have a validated dynamic model with an appropriate embedded controller on the ancillary instrument to reach the desired posture of the human body. In this paper, a linkage-based dynamic model of STS motion using Lagrange's equation is extracted. The dynamic of the model is simulated using anthropometric parameters associated with the subject. Moreover, two robust controller types are designed and implemented in the presence of sinusoidal bounded disturbances in the dynamic system on the model in order to track the desired trajectory acquired from experimental kinematic data. The simulation results of the controlled dynamic model are compared with experimental data from a healthy subject and demonstrate the performance of the controller. The proposed model can be utilized in the design and control of an assistance device for STS motion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
445,"Blocking constraints are ubiquitous in machine scheduling. In a flowshop scenario, a machine might get blocked by a job that has just been processed by the same machine. This happens when there is no buffer where the job can temporarily go before the next machine is available to process it. This also happens when two successive machines depend on a mutually exclusive resource to process the same job. In this paper, we show that under certain conditions, two successive machines operating under blocking constraints involving mutually exclusive resources can virtually be treated as a joint machine. Before performing search, we then use this makespan preserving property in reengineering a permutation flowshop. The reengineered flowshop model can actually be used by any arbitrary search algorithm to improve efficiency. We show an example of machine conjoining in the waste treatment industry. We also empirically show that such reengineering helps state-of-the-art flowshop search algorithms obtain significantly better makespan values than when the original model is used. Flowshop reengineering is appealing particularly because it helps obtain a higher abstraction level and any search algorithm can use it as a preprocessing step.

446,"This study is concerned with the phenomenon of flow instability in the entrance region of a pulsating pipe flow perturbed by a trip wire at the inlet, where the flow was uniform at the core with a thin boundary layer on the wall. First of all, it is illustrated by a case without the installation of a trip wire that small disturbance developed in the accelerating phase of pulsation, which was well explained by the inflection-point instability mechanism Subsequently, one of the cases studied with the installation of a trip wire indicates that the inflection-point instability mechanism still played the key role, but the instability was promoted further upstream. On the other hand, there were cases of which the flow instability development was rather due to the viscous effect mainly which was decaying in a certain downstream region, followed by a renewal growth with irregular fluctuations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
447,"The ability to design and build complex structures at the nanoscale level with programmable functions is revolutionizing the fields of biomedicine, bioengineering, and materials sciences. DNA, the genetic material of life, has long been known to carry the instructions for the structures and assembly of the biomolecules of cells and organisms. DNA also undergoes accurate replication in conjunction with the creation of new cells. The genetic instructions in the linear strands of DNA are in the form of specific sequences, comprised of the four nucleic acid bases: A, T, G, and C. Two DNA strands can spontaneously associate to form a double-helical structure that is stabilized by the pairing of A with T, and G with C in the interacting strands. Nadrian Seeman had an original vision that regarded DNA not as just the genetic information carrier, but as material for the creation of complex functional architectures at the nanoscale level. He did so by exploiting the ability of DNA strands to spontaneously associate, forming specific stable structures, according to the nucleic acid base sequences and pairing rules. Starting with short synthetic DNA molecules, Dr. Seeman was able to construct relatively simple geometric objects, including a cube and a truncated octahedron. He then developed small DNA structures (""tiles"") that exhibited enhanced rigidity and could act as stable building blocks that could interact in a programmed manner to form large, regular, two-dimensional arrays. These studies inspired the creation of more complicated DNA building blocks that could self-assemble to create three-dimensional ordered DNA structures, akin to regular crystals. Seeman's pioneering investigations attracted other investigators within and outside the field of biochemistry, including physicists and computer scientists, resulting in many collaborations that demonstrated the computational capacity and programmed mechanical action of DNA nanostructures. DNA nanostructures are now being employed as devices to deliver drugs, detect disease biomarkers, probe cell function, and even as ""molecular foundries"" for the construction of hitherto inaccessible assemblages of atoms and molecules with potential practical applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
448,"This paper investigates friction-induced self-excited vibration in a bi-stable compliant mechanism. A single-degree-of-freedom oscillator, hanged vertically, vibrates on a belt moving horizontally with a constant velocity. The oscillator is excited through the frictional input provided by the belt. The friction coefficient is defined as an exponentially decaying function of the sliding velocity. Due to the specific configuration of spring and damper, the normal contact force is variable. Therefore, the friction force is a function of the system states, namely, slider velocity and position. Employing eigenvalue analysis gives an overview of the local stability of the linearized system in the vicinity of each equilibrium point. It is shown that the normal force, spring pre-compression and belt velocity are bifurcation parameters. Since the system is highly nonlinear, a local analysis does not provide enough information about the steady-state response. Therefore, the oscillating system is studied numerically to attain a global qualitative picture of the steady-state response. The possibility of the mass-belt detachment and overshoot are studied. It is shown that one equilibrium point is always dominant. In addition, three main questions, i.e., possible mass-belt separation, location of stick-slip transition and overshoot are answered. It is proven that the occurrence of overshoot is impossible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
449,"The decision to mitigate exposures from vapor intrusion (VI) is typically based on limited data from 24-hour air samples. It is well documented that these data do not accurately represent long-term average exposures linked to adverse health effects. Limited decision guidance is currently available to determine the most appropriate sampling strategy, considering the cost of sampling alternatives along with the economic consequences of exposure-related health effects. We present a decision model that introduces economic and statistical considerations in evaluating alternative VI sampling methods. The model characterizes the best sampling method by factoring economic and health consequences of exposure, the variability of exposure, the cost of sampling and mitigation, and the likelihood of false-negatives and false-positives. Decision-makers can use results to select the sample size that maximizes net benefit. Conceptual and mathematical models are presented linking biological, statistical, and economic considerations to assess the cost and effectiveness of different sampling strategies. The model relates an average exposure concentration, determined statistically, to abatement costs and to the monetary value of health deterioration. The value of the information provided by different strategies is calculated and used to select the optimum sampling method. Simulations show that longer-term sampling methods tend to be more accurate and cost-effective than short-term samples. The ideal sampling strategy shows significant seasonal variation (it is typically optimal to use longer samples in the winter) and also varies significantly with the stringency of regulatory standards. Longer-term sample collection provides a more accurate representation of average VI exposure and reduces the likelihood of type I and type II errors. This reduces expected costs of mitigation and exposure (e.g., health consequences, legal and regulatory penalties), which in some cases can be quite significant. The model herein shows how these savings are balanced against the additional costs of longer-term sampling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
450,"Boost pressure control is an important part of the control of modern gasoline engines. The implementation of modern control schemes for this nonlinear system has been subject of scientific publications for years. In contrast, state of the art for serial operation is a relatively simple gain-scheduling structure based on PID controllers and stationary feedforward control. This paper presents a concept for controlling boost pressure which is suitable for series production and its experimental evaluation on a test bench. The applied control structure corresponds largely to the state of the art, though the feedforward control was significantly simplified and an anti-windup concept for systematic consideration of manipulated variable saturations was supplemented. The systematic model-based procedure used for H-infinity-optimal design of structured operating point controllers should be noted. Using H-infinity-optimal controllers enables a priori inclusion of quantitative requirements for the behavior of the resulting local control loops during the design process. The underlying controller design procedure allows linear controllers of any structure. Thereby H-infinity-optimal parameterization of control structures being in use and accepted by application-oriented engineers becomes possible. The calculation of controller parameters is done reliably by solving non-convex and non-smooth optimization problems using published methods. The mathematical system descriptions required for the model-based controller design are obtained by identifying linear time-invariant setpoint systems. Experimental results clearly show the performance of the proposed control concept in comparison to a conventionally parameterized boost pressure control. In contrast to the conventional procedure for parameterization based on expert knowledge and road tests, the design process presented is characterized by a structured, methodical and theoretically sound procedure. The resulting design process is largely automated and significantly reduces resource and time requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

453,"Control of the spatial distribution of various cell types is required to construct functional tissues. Here, we report a simple topographical structure changed the spatial cell density. A concave curved boundary was designed, which allowed the spatial descent moving of cells and the change in spatial distributions of co-cultured cells. We utilized the difference in cell motility between myoblast cells (C2C12) and neuronal cells (PC12) to demonstrate the feasibility of spontaneous change in spatial cell density. Without the curved boundaries, high motility cells (C2C12) did not migrate to the adjacent area, which resulted in a slight temporal change (< 15%) in the spatial cell distribution. In contrast, with the curved boundaries, the cell density of the high motility cells in the groove to those cells on the ridge showed an increase exceeding 45%. On the other hand, the temporal change in the spatial cell distribution of low motility cells (PC12) was below 15% with or without the curved boundaries. In addition, as groove width increased, both cells displayed more initially gathering in groove. Importantly, these cell-type dependent results were also maintained under co-culture conditions. Our results suggest that designing topographical interfaces changes spatial cell density without any manipulation and is useful for multi-cellular constructs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This allows us to (i) establish the worst-case optimality of the submodular extension for Potts model used in the literature; (ii) identify the worst-case optimal submodular extension for the more general class of metric labeling; (iii) efficiently compute the marginals for the widely used dense CRF model with the help of a recently proposed Gaussian filtering method; and (iv) propose an accurate submodular extension based on an LP relaxation for a higher-order diversity model. Using synthetic and real data, we show that our approach provides comparable upper bounds on the log-partition function to those obtained using tree-reweighted message passing (TRW) in cases where the latter is computationally feasible. Importantly, unlike TRW, our approach provides the first computationally tractable algorithm to compute an upper bound on dense CRF model with higher-order Potts potentials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
459,"Background and objective: The evaluation of musculo-articular stiffness (MAS) is an increasingly demanded procedure with applications in different fields, such as sports performance and lower limbs injury prevention. However, this task is non-automated, time-consuming and error-prone due to manual handling of data streams and files across several software applications. Despite the fact that process automation of validated procedures helps to prevent errors, there is still a lack of easy-to-use tools for analysis, management and visualization of MAS trials. Methods: In the present work a tool called FLEXOR has been developed which applies mathematical methods and novel algorithms to automatically adjust curves of data streams for MAS analysis decreasing substantially time employed and errors. This tool permits to define different adjustment parameters, detect curve peaks and valleys, and display the results on the fly. FLEXOR has been implemented through a component-based software development (CBSD) process. All physiological fundamentals for the biomechanical measurement have been included in the tool developed. To describe the integration of all required components a 4 + 1 view model architecture has been used. The installation guide, the FLEXOR software and some data samples can be found on its GitHub repository (https://github.com/FlexorSoftware/flexor). Results: A multiplatform software tool to simplify traditional complex and manual procedures for MAS analysis is obtained. The tool turns them into a simple all-in-one procedure, reducing processing times from hours to a few minutes. The methodology was tested on multiple datasets generated by previous tools in former procedures as well as on real-time trials in the laboratory, showing identical results. Conclusion: The results show that the developed tool can accomplish an unfilled essential task in the analysis, management and visualization of MAS measurement. The presented software tool empowers analysts to handle the different studies, investigate different parameters related to each experiment and even test with different output parameters in each experiment, enabling real-time trials and shared studies between different analysts.

460,"The use of heat-treated wood material and eco-friendly impregnation chemicals are steadily increasing in the woodworking industry over the last decades. In this study, the effects of applications of impregnation and heat treatment on combustion properties of Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) wood were investigated. The test specimens were impregnated with Imersol-aqua (Ia) and Timbercare-aqua (Ta) impregnation material according to ASTM D 1413-76 standards. Impregnated specimens were subjected to heat treatment at 150, 170 and 190 degrees C for 2 h. The temperature of flame source combustion, the temperature of without flame source combustion and varying light intensities (Lux) depending on the smoke production in these combustion stages were determined according to ASTM E 160-50. According to the test results, the highest combustion temperature of flame source combustion was determined in unimpregnated and heat-treated samples at 190 degrees C, while the highest combustion temperature of without flame source combustion was determined in impregnated with Ta and heat-treated samples at 170 degrees C. The highest light density in flame source combustion phase was determined in unimpregnated and heat-treated samples at 190 degrees C, while in without flame source combustion was in unimpregnated and heat-treated samples at 170 degrees C. As a result, as the heat treatment temperature increase, the combustion temperature increased and the smoke density decreased. In addition to impregnation materials increased the smoke density while reduced the combustion temperatures of test specimens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

463,"Multifilter instruments such as the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU)-UV Irradiance Meter (NILU-UV) are suitable for long-term monitoring of UV radiation, as long as their irradiance scale is maintained. The sensitivity of these instruments varies with time; thus, periodic standard absolute calibrations are required. However, standard calibrations may be insufficient to characterize the short-term variations of channels sensitivity. Therefore, results from standard calibrations have to be combined with the information derived from frequent relative calibrations, leading to a stable irradiance scale. This paper focuses on the long-term application of three calibration methods, hereinafter referred to as CC, CC2, and CC2(phi), as applied to the NILU-UV 119 multifilter radiometer. Here a generalization is proposed, consisting of using empirical functions in order to guarantee the accurate calibration of multifilter instruments over long time periods. These function-based methods need to be updated regularly to account for changes on instrument sensitivity. The changes in sensitivity of the NILU-UV 119 were found to be channel dependent. The detected drifts range from 23% to 42% for a 4-yr period of study. Time series of calibrated irradiance are obtained by applying the proposed methods. Results suggest that calibration methods using empirical functions perform better than classic calibration approaches that use constant calibration factors. When methods CC2 and CC2(phi) are applied, calibrated irradiances agree with the measurements of reference within +/- 5% for channel 305 and within +/- 3% for channels 312, 320, and 340.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

465,"Modern medical devices have the ability to producing and transmitting all kinds of basic medical data. These devices can share data with each other or send data to a central platform in the cloud. The new trend in the healthcare industry is the creation of a medical monitoring system integrated with electronic medical records that presented from the cloud, that can be accessed anytime and anywhere. It is essential to store, transfer, share and visualize large volume heterogeneous medical data in a low-cost, fast and secure database system. In this study, a medical Internet of Things (mIoT) platform that can use different database systems was realized in order to acquisition heterogeneous medical data from sensors to visualize and store data. Four different database models on mIoT platform were tested with four different scenarios. The performance of the database models used in the mIoT platform in these scenarios; query time, data preparation, flexibility, security and scalability parameters were compared.

466,"The increasing number of clock domain crossings in modern systems-on-chip makes the careful consideration of metastability paramount. However, the manifestation of metastability at a flip-flop output is often unduly reduced to late transitions only, while glitches are hardly ever accounted for. In this paper we study the occurrence of glitches resulting from metastability in detail. To this end we propose a measurement circuit whose principle substantially differs from the conventional approach, and by that allows to reliably detect glitches. By means of experimental measurements on an FPGA target we can clearly identify late transitions, single glitches and double glitches as possible manifestations of metastability. Some of these behaviors are unexpected as they do not follow from the traditional modeling theory. We also study the dependence of metastable behavior on supply voltage. Beyond confirming that, as reported in previous literature, the metastable decay constant tau is voltage-dependent, we also produce strong evidence that the relative occurrence of glitches is not voltage-dependent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
467,"Many sensors exhibit nonlinear dependence between their input and output variables and specific techniques are often applied for the linearization of their transfer characteristics. Some of them include additional analog circuits, while the others are based on different numerical procedures. One commonly used software solution is Progressive Polynomial Approximation. This method for sensor transfer function linearization shows strong dependence on the order of selected nodes in the linearization vector. There are several modifications of this method which enhance its effectiveness but require extensive computational time. This paper proposes the methodology that shows improvement over Progressive Polynomial Approximation without additional increase of complexity. It concerns the order of linearization nodes in linearization vector. The optimal order of nodes is determined on the basis of sensor transfer function concavity. The proposed methodology is compared to the previously reported methods on a set of analytical functions. It is then implemented in the temperature measurement system using a set of thermistors with negative temperature coefficients. It is shown that its implementation in the low-cost microcontrollers integrated into the nodes of reconfigurable sensor networks is justified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
468,"Over the last decade, landslides triggered by rainfall in Phuket have been a major problem affecting development and tourism. An investigation of areas susceptible to landslides is necessary in order to institute policies to reduce the impact of landslide and to ensure the safety of tourists. In this study, two-dimensional electrical resistivity imaging (2D-ERI) was applied and slope stability modelling was conducted to investigate the sliding surface and the thickness of the sliding mass in a study area which is prone to landslide during intense and prolonged rainfall. The result of the 2D-ERI was used to validate the result of a simulation of the slope stability to determine the landslide sliding surface and the thickness of the sliding mass based on rising piezometric head due to rainfall. Further, the model geometry of the slope stability was reconstructed using the 2D-ERI data, and the simulation was repeated. The result for the factor of safety (FS) when the piezometric head was rising was found to have been overestimated in the original simulation Therefore, the reconstruction of the model geometry is essential to avoid the over-estimation of the FS in slope stability modelling in conditions of rising piezometric head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
469,"In this paper the geometrical characteristics and construction method of hex-tri reciprocal frame are studied. The naming rules of structural units, members and joints of hex-tri reciprocal frame are proposed.

The geometry construction method of hex-tri reciprocal frame is established in this paper. By this method the whole structure is formed as an assembly of the units arranged in rings about the structural center. The influences of the diameter, the length and the binding length of the member on the rise of hex-tri reciprocal frame are analyzed by an example. If the rise of hex-tri reciprocal frame needs to be specified in the design, the values of the diameter, the length and the binding length of the structural member need to be coordinated to meet the design requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

471,"Based on the destructuring framework proposed by Liu et al. (2015) preceded by the work by Liu and Carter (1999, 2000), the virgin compression destructuring behavior of fifteen natural soil published in various literature over the last seven decades in several locations around the globe have been studied. Two methods (i.e., graphical and two reference point approach) to determine the parameters used in the equation of compression destructuring line (CDL) are proposed and examined by simulating the experimental data. Also, a systematic approach to find the yield pressure is suggested. The study concluded that CDL parameters obtained from graphical approach successfully predicted the compression behaviors of structured soil for most of the soil samples. Nonconformity occurs in case of two reference point approach in some cases. The two reference point approach is very helpful for a quick approximation of the CDL parameters because of its simplicity. Theoretically, two reference point method should be independent of the selection of the two point sets and always yield the same parameters but due to the uncertainty of the precision of experimental data, it varied. The author used and suggested a universal by taking furthest two points on the destructuring compression data as references. Also, the analytical approach to locate the yield pressure point is found very helpful. These methods eliminate the rigorous process of trial and error to find CDL parameters and other conventional processes to locate the yield pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
472,"Klystron microwave amplifiers play a vital role in addressing the increasing demands of high-average microwave power for strategic applications such as linear accelerators, active denial technologies, radar, and so forth. Typically, klystrons have an efficiency of 50%-60% that demands an efficient thermal design for dissipating the unused DC power in the form of spent electron beam in collector. Hence, thermal modeling of the collector for efficient heat dissipation is highly critical in design of high average power klystrons. Of several types of design, grooved collector design is widely employed so as to increase the surface area between the collector and coolant and thereby enhance heat transfer. In this article, a mathematical model and design strategy have been demonstrated to obtain the optimum dimensions, that is, height, depth, and width of fins based on film coefficient and Reynolds number. For validation, the dimensions are then simulated in a computational fluid dynamics software (ANSYS-Fluent) demonstrating excellent agreement with the mathematical modeling. In addition, the optimum choice of grooving method (longitudinal or crossed) for the given power level has also been provided. The demonstrated strategy can also potentially be employed to other devices, which uses groove based design with water as coolant medium such as gyrotrons, plasma devices, and so forth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
473,"Conventional sequential processing on software with a general purpose CPU has become significantly insufficient for certain heavy computations due to the high demand of processing power to deliver adequate throughput and performance. Due to many reasons a high degree of interest could be noted for high performance real time video processing on embedded systems. However, embedded processing platforms with limited performance could least cater the processing demand of several such intensive computations in computer vision domain. Therefore, hardware acceleration could be noted as an ideal solution where process intensive computations could be accelerated using application specific hardware integrated with a general purpose CPU. In this research we have focused on building a parallelized high performance application specific architecture for such a hardware accelerator for HOG-SVM computation implemented on Zynq 7000 FPGA. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) technique combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier is versatile and extremely popular in computer vision domain in contrast to high demand for processing power. Due to the popularity and versatility, various previous research have attempted on obtaining adequate throughput on HOG-SVM. This research with a high throughput of 240 FPS on single scale on VGA frames of size 640x480 out performs the best case performance on a single scale of previous research by approximately a factor of 3-4. Further it's an approximately 15x speed up over the GPU accelerated software version with the same accuracy. This research has explored the possibility of using a novel architecture based on deep pipelining, parallel processing and BRAM structures for achieving high performance on the HOG-SVM computation. Further the above developed (video processing unit) VPU which acts as a hardware accelerator will be integrated as a co-processing peripheral to a host CPU using a novel custom accelerator structure with on chip buses in a System-On-Chip (SoC) fashion. This could be used to offload the heavy video stream processing redundant computations to the VPU whereas the processing power of the CPU could be preserved for running light weight applications.

475,"Based on the difference of thermal expansion coefficient between Si and Ge, low-intensity tensile stress can be introduced into Ge epitaxial layer on Si substrate. S-Ge/Si semiconductor (as known as low tensile strained Ge grown on Si substrate) has a higher carrier mobility when compared with unstrained-Ge or Si material, so that s-Ge/Si is appropriate for the production of high-speed circuit. At the same time, transformation from indirect bandgap semiconductor Ge into Pseudo-Direct bandgap semiconductor (which is also called PD-Ge) will be happen after s-Ge/Si is heavy doped, which makes LED produced of PD-Ge material perform a higher luminous efficiency because the radiative recombining probability of carriers in PD-Ge material is greatly improved compared with unstrained one. Taking the advantages referred of s-Ge/Si into account, s-Ge/Si has the potential to PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration. Carrier mobility of the semiconductor is one of the key physical parameters during the design and simulation of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integrated system. While as far as the authors are aware, carrier mobility model of s-Ge/Si is still rarely reported to date. In view of that all above, based on the E-k relation in both conduction band and valence band of s-Ge/Si material, the analytical models of physical parameters in energy band are established, and the models are verified by experiments. Then the s-Ge/Si carrier models are further established based on our band structure model, and the Monte Carlo method is used to verify our s-Ge/Si carrier mobility model. The quantificational results of our paper will help understand s-Ge/Si material physics and provide an important theoretical basis for the design of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

477,"This paper describes the design and implementation of a low cost, contacless, reliable and sensitive direct torque measurement system applied to small single cylinder engine transient test cell. The experimental set-up consists of a three-phase induction machine, used as a transient a.c. dynamometer, and non-regenerative frequency inverter connected to an internal combustion engine. Coupling the engine to the dynamometer is by a low stiffness PA-6 nylon shaft with magnetic pickups at its ends. The sensors phase are zero when torque in PA-6 nylon shaft is null, adjusted in static conditions and engine/dynamometer turned off. Contactless torque measurement occurs by magnetic pickup phase difference during PA-6 nylon shaft torsion promoted by engine in operation. Engine speed is measurement by frequency of magnetic pickup signal. PA-6 nylon shaft torsion promotes a misalignment between sensors phase, proportional to torque application in both direction.The electronic capture unit using pulse train rising edge detection measures this phase change (time shift) in pulses. An embedded microcontroller development kit acquires the time-shifted pulses. This board has circuits for A/D signal conditioning, pulse width modulate channels, and a specific circuit for magnetic pickups signals conditioning, which can measure less then 0.09 Nm resolution, taking 96 time-shifts values. The design and implementation of all embedded electronics and data acquisition system follows electromagnetic compatibility premises, which have resulted in an adequate signal-to-noise ratio so that common and differential mode noises have not edges with amplitude approximately equal to the output magnetic sensors signals. The maximum measurement uncertainty associated with the contacless direct torque measurement system were calculated at +/- 0.54% to 99% confidence interval.The performance is presented under different load conditions, defined by engine throttle position and the results are compared with the engine datasheet performance curves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Austar event possibly can be explained as the collapse of a wedge in association with a very low intensity seismic event. Kinematics using either toppling or planar slide models can provide explanations for the collapse of unsupported ribs where joints or mining-induced fractures are vertical. Behaviour models based on kinematics can provide the basis for the specification of ground support.

The absence of ties has resulted in rupturing of examined building due to tensioning of the moving foundation.

490,"The performance evaluation of the developed low-temperature grinding mill was carried out on the basis of temperature inside the grinding chamber at the end of grinding, flour temperature, and time of grinding; while aiming to minimize the milling loss. Turmeric powder ground at low temperature was analyzed on the basis of volatile oil, protein, carbohydrates, moisture, fat, and ash content and compared with that of turmeric ground at ambient temperature (control treatment). It was found that low-temperature ground turmeric contains more volatile oil, protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Volatile oil analysis of the control treatment and the best between all treatments were carried out using GC-MS. Major compounds, namely ar-curcumene, ar-tumerone, gamma-curcumene, and monoterpenes, present in volatile oil were retained in low temperature ground turmeric sample that were not found in the sample of control treatment.

491,"Zirconia oral implants are increasingly considered as an alternative to metallic (titanium) ones, mostly for their aesthetic properties and their metal free composition that enables soft tissue integration. We report a systematic comparison of the fatigue performance of oral implants of identical geometry, made of partially stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) and titanium as a reference group, using random spectrum fatigue testing in both air and saline solution. The spectrum data clearly points unequivocally to the operation of a fatigue (damage accumulation) failure mechanism in the zirconia implants. Saline solution reduces the quasi-static fracture strength. It also causes a marked degradation of their spectrum fatigue longevity, but it does not affect their spectrum fatigue fracture strength. Given that the quasi-static fracture strength of the tested implants is smaller in saline solution than in air, the results suggest that the maximum admissible design loads for spectrum loaded zirconia oral implants are of the order of 0.8 times their wet (saline) quasi-static fracture strength.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, multi-speed transmission systems were discussed for further reduction of the energy consumption of electric vehicles. Therefore, analyzing the power losses of such transmissions is of interest. In this paper, the novel powertrain concept DE-REX (Two-Drive-Transmission with Range-Extender) and the experimental investigation of its overall power losses is first introduced. A method is then developed to model and analyze the power losses of this hybrid transmission based on experimental data. After the validation of the method, the overall power loss model is eventually applied to estimate the power losses of the transmission at other driving modes, which were not measured on the test rig. The method is used to understand the characteristics of power losses inside the transmission in a hybrid powertrain and to optimize powertrain power losses in future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve high strength and drop weight tearing test properties for heavy wall X70 spiral linepipes, the microstructure refinement of bainitic ferrite is essential in hot-rolled steel coils. Niobium addition is very effective to have precipitation strengthening and bainitic ferrite grain refinement through the increase of controlled rolling ratio in austenite non-recrystallization region. Laboratory rolling test results indicated that low-carbon, high-niobium steel had excellent strength-toughness balance by increasing the amount of finer NbC precipitates by 20 nm or less in a fine bainitic ferrite microstructure.

The results of the present study could be useful for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) using chemical flooding technique.

In addition to the homogeneous media, the simulations are performed for a horizontal layered heterogeneous medium and the results are presented as concentration contours, transversely averaged concentration profiles, mixing length, and sweep efficiency. It is concluded that the heterogeneity of the medium has a great effect on the flow structure. The channeling regime is observed in these media. Higher layers in the heterogeneous medium reduces the intensity of instability while permeability variance acts on the contrary.

498,"In this paper, Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is designed using Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to Load Frequency Control (LFC) in three areas of an interconnected power system. The proposed controller has appropriate dynamic response, so it increases damping in transient state in unhealthy conditions. Different generators have been used in three areas. Area 1 includes thermal non-reheat generator and two thermal reheat generators; area 2 includes hydro and thermal non-reheat generators, and area 3 includes hydro and thermal reheat generators. In order to evaluate the performance of the controller, Sim/Matlab software is used.

In this work, the dynamic behaviour of circular plate in contact with fluid and resting on Winkler and Pasternak foundations is investigated. The coupled differential equation of the system is analysed using differential transformation method. Good agreements are established when the results of the analytical solutions are compared to the results of the experimental investigation as reported in literature. The analytical solutions obtained are used to investigate the effects of elastic foundation parameters on natural frequency, combine foundation parameters on natural frequency, plate in contact with fluid and that of radial and circumferential stress on mode shapes. From the results, it is observed that, increases in elastic foundation parameter increases the natural frequency in all cases. Presence of fluid reduces the natural frequency of the plate. Also, it is established that mode shapes are not altered by the presence of fluid. However, mode shape displacement occurs due to presence of radial and circumferential stresses.

Free vibration analyses using different modeling parameters showed that the natural frequencies increased when an anchorage was included or when the upper flange thickness was kept constant in the modeling. The maximum dynamic responses of the girder at different speeds of two trains [a high-speed train (KTX) and a freight train] were compared using different modeling parameters. Changes in the flange thickness did not have any significant effect on the maximum vertical displacement. However, the maximum acceleration of the girder for the flange modeled with the originally designed varying thickness was higher than that for the flange modeled with the average thickness as a constant. This difference became more significant as the train speed approached the critical speed of resonance. Regardless of whether the anchorage was modeled, no significant change was found in the maximum vertical displacement for both KTX and the freight train. The vertical accelerations for both the trains were generally lower when the anchorage was modeled.

Force acting on the magnetically isotropic region can be always represented by means of Maxwell stress tensor surface integral. However, the magnetic anisotropy causes the asymmetry of Maxwell stress tensor. Subsequently, the force cannot be always evaluated by the surface integral of the Maxwell stress tensor, only. This article points out that the surface integral has to be often supplemented by the volume integral of a defined residual vector. The residual vector does not vanish in the case of anisotropy and has to be incorporated into the Maxwell stress tensor method. Appropriate examples of force evaluations for anisotropic ball levitating in the electromagnetic field are presented. The total force value is four times checked by Maxwell stress tensor modified method (for cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems), sum of physical components (Lorentz and material forces), and coenergy method, subsequently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
507,"Congestion prevention, safety benefits, environmental release-all these objectives are supposed to be accomplished as part of traffic networking and the increasing vehicle automation. As a result, drivers will move in an urban mixed traffic that consists of conventionally, (un)connected as well as automated, connected vehicles in the future. Innovative networking technologies will not only enable cooperative behavior that exceeds traditional interaction patterns, but also issue new challenges (e.g. approaching a signaled intersection untypically and decelerating) to humans by incorporating new vehicles into road traffic. Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) have the potential to optimize interactions between differently equipped road users, as long as they support the drivers by providing them with currently relevant information, but do not distract them at the same time. The informational needs drivers have in urban mixed traffic using conventionally, connected as well as automated, connected vehicles has rarely been examined so far. Therefore, the present paper examines this issue. Within the context of two research associations (""HarmonizeDD"" and ""SYNCAR""), three focus group discussions were conducted with five resp. six participants each. The constellation of the groups varied concerning the participant's experience towards automated vehicle functions (low vs. test driver). After presenting diverse urban scenarios using video animations, informational needs for these scenarios were collected and their importance was rated. The results show that especially during the initial phase of system usage as well as in situations, in which unusual and unnatural behaviors are shown or demanded, detailed information is desirable (e.g. indicating the trigger of a certain behavior-ambulance). Moreover, HMIs should be designed adaptively based on the passenger's/driver's varying experience and concomitantly the varying amount of required information. The present study's level of innovation is high, as to date, information presentation in specific driving scenarios based on networking technologies has only been examined for extra urban areas. Here, we address the resulting need for research in the field of urban mixed traffic with heterogeneously equipped road users explicitly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
508,"The design of a voltage source inverter is challenging for PV-grid connected systems due to power quality issues. To improve the power quality,a two-phase interleaved voltage source inverter (IVSI) is proposed in this paper. IVSI phase shifts two voltage source inerters connected in parallel. The inverter topology is interfaced with a 40W PV panel employing a multiple maxima search (MMS) MPPT algorithm. This algorithm results in higher tracking efficiency compared to existing methods. Modelling of the PV with MPPT and the circuit configuration of the interleaved inverter is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The switches in the IVSI is controlled by employing a unipolar PWM technique. The performance of the IVSI is investigated in terms of weighted total harmonic distortion (WTHD), distortion factor (DF), harmonic spread factor (HSF), and inductor current ripple and compared with classical VSI. From the analysis, it is inferred that the proposed inverter results in reduced total harmonic distortion(THD) and decreased inductor current ripple thereby producing a high-quality output. The hardware model of the two-phase IVSI is developed and interfaced with PV where gating pulses are generated in FPGA.

512,"We propose a scheme to realize all-optical temporal differentiation calculation to input pulse in an inverse Y-type four-level atomic system driven by a strong standing-wave. Two optical blockades are created at individual wavelengths of two probe fields in presence of one single strong standing-wave field. On one hand, ultra-narrow transmission windows are produced for probe pulse field 1 when probe field 2 is so strong as a controlling field in EIT configuration. The system can be designed as a phase-reverter of weak probe field 1 and can perform temporal differentiation calculation to it because a pi phase shift is created. On the other hand, the blockade at probe field 2 can be burst in two-photon resonance configuration when probe field 1 becomes strong and saturated absorption takes effect. So a two-photon switching is also expected in this standing-wave-dressed atomic system. The scheme has a potential for an all-optical transistor in quantum logical circuits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will show that the proposed invertible and low-complexity mapping of integers enables the GR encoding to assign nearly the optimal code length for a wider range of distributions, generalized Gaussian distributions, maintaining low computational cost. A simulation by random numbers reveals that the proposed coder based on this scheme works about 6 times faster than the state-of-the-art arithmetic coder for Gaussian-distributed integers maintaining the increase in relative redundancy around, which is much lower than that of a conventional GR coder. Additionally, an application to a practical speech and audio coding scheme is presented, and an objective evaluation for real speech and audio signals confirms the advantages of the proposed method in compression.

517,"Interactive failures are failures caused by two or more components that often occur in complex systems when the system is modified, upgraded, or simply designed inadequately. However, the official guideline provided, namely, common cause analysis, cannot discover these problems. It cannot establish a complex interactive system model, nor can it provide a unified analysis method for all parts of the system. Another method, systems theoretic process analysis, is limited to the control system. To solve this problem, a method called system theoretic formal analysis method (STFAM) is proposed in this paper. STFAM establishes a system-component-interactive model that provides an abundance of interactive information for failure analysis and presents a unified model to support the analysis of multiple components in the system. It is divided into three steps. First, a hierarchical system structure is built and then transformed into a formalized state machine. Next, the interactive failures are determined and converted into a linear temporal logic or computation tree logic model. Finally, NuSMV is used to verify the model and record the results.

525,"Mobile video traffic is expected to increase explosively because of the proliferating number of Wi-Fi terminals. An overloaded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique allows the receiver to implement smaller number of antennas than the transmitter in exchange for degradation in video quality and a large amount of computational complexity for postcoding at the receiver side. This paper proposes a novel linear precoder for high-quality video streaming in overloaded multiuser MIMO systems, which protects visually significant portions of a video stream. A low complexity postcoder is also proposed, which detects some of data symbols by linear detection and the others by a prevoting vector cancellation (PVC) approach. It is shown from simulation results that the combination use of the proposed precoder and postcoder achieves higher-quality video streaming to multiple users in a wider range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than a conventional unequal error protection scheme. The proposed precoder attains 40 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio even in poor channel conditions such as the SNR of 12 dB. In addition, due to the stepwise acquisition of data symbols by means of linear detection and PVC, the proposed postcoder reduces the number of complex additions by 76% and that of multiplications by 64% compared to the conventional PVC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
526,"Modern computing is based in large part on an important abstraction called the von Neumann model. In this model, the program consists of a series of instructions stored in memory. The computing hardware performs the program by executing the instructions in sequential order. This basic model constitutes a contract that allows software developers to construct programs based on a simple, easy to understand execution model while delegating the details of the execution of those instructions to the hardware. Yale Patt and his colleagues have been responsible for pioneering new approaches to the design of computer systems that achieve increased performance by automatically identifying instructions that can be performed in parallel. This approach allows us to preserve the model of sequential execution while reaping the performance benefits associated with concurrency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
527,"In recent years, Electromechanical Impedance (EMI) method has been widely used in structural health monitoring (SHM). In this method, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic sensor patch is added to the structure to be monitored for structural health. Impedance and admittance characteristics are measured using an impedance analyzer, which forms the reference characteristic in the evaluation of structural health. It is expected that these characteristics will not change as long as there is no change in the structure. However, it is known that these characteristics change in some situations, such as exposure to external environmental conditions and temperature fluctuations. If the effect of temperature is not taken into account, it leads to misinterpretations as if there were faults in the structure. Rails are exposed to changing environmental conditions continuously. In this study, the behavior of the R260 rail steel at varying temperatures is investigated using the EMI method. As a result of the experimental studies, it has been observed that frequency and amplitude change with decreasing temperature. This change has been interpreted using damage metrics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
528,"In this work, the drop casting method is utilized to obtain a thin graphene-like graphite layer as a photodetection layer on a SiO2/Si substrate, and its performance is characterized to determine its potential use in commercial applications. The thin layer is formed by first synthesizing graphite soot from a butane flame before being turned into a liquid solution and drop-casted onto the substrate to form a thin graphene-like graphite film. Field emission scanning electron microscope and Raman vibrational mode analyses indicate that the fabricated graphene-like graphite layer has characteristics similar to the graphene. The graphene-like graphite photodetector demonstrates a narrow photoresponse from 530 to 680 nm, covering visible sources from green to red. The responsivity and external quantum efficiency of the device under the illumination of red laser 660 nm is found to be around 148 mA W-1 and 27.8% respectively and is faster than that reported for similar systems using graphene and reduced graphene oxide previously. A fast response time of 83.7 and 28 mu s at a modulation frequency of 1.0 and 10000 Hz respectively from the graphene-like thinly layered graphite photodetector shows potential application for the development of low-cost carbon-based photodetectors in near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
529,"In this work, we present a theoretical research of the absorption and desorption of simultaneous CO2 and H2S present in the natural gas using aqueous solutions of monoethanolamine (MEA). The acid components of natural gas react with the basic solution of alkanolamine through a reversible reaction exothermic in an absorber and subsequently proceeded to regenerate the aqueous solution of amine. It has been investigated the use of the solvent MEA for the sweetening of natural gas and has used the program of process simulation ASPEN PLUS. The model thermodynamic used is Amine Package (Kent and Eisenberg model). We studied the effects of temperature, rate of recirculation and the concentration of amine poor depending on the efficiency of absorption of CO2 and H2S. Satisfactory results were obtained when increases the flow and the concentration of amine poor, the absorption of CO2 and H2S also increase. With an improvement of the temperature of the amine of entry into the absorber, CO2 and H2S penetrate the upper stages of the absorbent and reduce the absorption of acid gases in the absorber. The concentration of CO2 in the clean gas can be greatly influenced by the number of stages, while for the concentration of H2S in the gas clean; the amount of stages plays a minor role.

Fuzzy Gantt chart with linguistic set provides a way to estimate resource requirement more reasonably.

In this study, TiO2 nanotube (TiNT) was grown on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V plates by means of anodization in an electrolyte solution containing glycerol, water and 0.5 wt.% of NH4 F. Silver particles were deposited on TiNT using a Photo-Assisted Deposition (PAD) method. Formation of crystalline phase of TiO2 on the surface was confirmed by means of XRD while its superficial morphology was observed using FESEM/EDS. Hydrophilicity was assessed by means of contact angle measurement. As-synthesized silver-loaded TiNT on osteoblast ATCC growth in vitro was also investigated in terms of its capacity in supporting osseointegration. The cell viability was determined by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5dipheny1-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay and its differentiation activity was measured by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay. The results showed that desposition of silver on TiNT increased cell viability after 14 days culture while improving the hydrophilicity feature. Silver-loaded TiNT on Ti-6Al-4V alloy with Ag precursor concentration of 0.10 M showed the optimum viability of osteoblast growth, with 14% improvement in comparison to its unmodified counterpart. The MTT assay showed that no cytotoxicity in vitro was observed on this material.

535,A change of thermodynamic parameters of surrounding air is experimentally investigated in the vicinity of metal conductor in which electric current flows. Substantial variations of pressure that are comparable with large meteorological variations are experimentally observed upon flowing a direct current pulse with a small amplitude and alternating currents of an industrial frequency through the conductor. Such significant and fast variations of the pressure occur at the instant the current in the conductor changes. Even current pulses with a short duration influence the pressure distinctly. Jumps of the pressure are experimentally observed in an investigated volume upon both building up the current amplitude and switching off the current pulse. These jumps are not typical for a usual cooling or heating of air mixture. It is expected that an exact correspondence between current pulses and the pressure variations makes it possible to create new technical equipment. The possibility of applying experimentally obtained results in device physics and nanotechnology science is of special interest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
536,"Character recognition is a study that has been used in various fields for many years. In character recognition, the aim is to identify the various texts, letters and symbols in the images as accurately and quickly as possible. In addition to the Optical Character Recognition (OCT) method, which is used as a very common method, there are many feature extraction methods in which character image features are compared. In this study, which is presented as another feature extraction method, the letters on the license plates are recognized. The characters were examined using the circular shape histogram technique and histograms were obtained from the sectors within the circular regions. Feature vectors for letter characters were created using character pixel densities in sectors. Feature vectors are analyzed linearly and an alternative quick character recognition method is presented. With the proposed method, the element numbers of the feature vectors are kept constant.

537,"We present a method for the manufacturing of thin shells of glass, which appears promising for the development of active optics for future space telescopes. The method exploits the synergy of different mature technologies, and leverages the commercial availability of large, high-quality sheets of glass, with thickness up to few millimeters. The first step of the method foresees the pre-shaping of flat substrates of glass by replicating the accurate shape of a mold via direct hot slumping technology. The replication concept is advantageous for making large optics composed of many identical or similar segments. After the hot slumping, the shape error residual on the optical surface is addressed by applying a deterministic sub-aperture technology as computer-controlled bonnet polishing and/or ion beam figuring. Here we focus on the bonnet polishing case, during which the thin, deformable substrate of glass is temporarily stiffened by a removable holder.

541,"The study focuses on an improvement of the catalytic activity via CO oxidation for Pt/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst by addition of La onto the support prior to impregnation with Pt metals. The molar ratios of La/Al were varied from 0.01 to 0.15. Based on temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2, La addition apparently resulted in increased basicity of the catalysts, which is related to increasing of oxygen mobility. However, when considered the Pt dispersion measured by CO chemisorption, it was found that Pt dispersion also increased with increasing the amount of La addition up to La/Al = 0.05. It is suggested that too high amount of La addition can inhibit the dispersion Pt due to surface coverage of La. It is worth noting that the catalytic activity toward CO oxidation essentially depends on both Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility and they can be superimposed on each other. Based on this study, the Pt/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst with La addition of La/Al molar ratio = 0.05 showed the highest activity due to its optimal Pt dispersion and oxygen mobility leading to its highest value of turnover frequency (TOF).

542,"This paper looks at the influence of the sorting coefficient, average particle size and quartz content on the abrasion rate of the cone bit. This paper uses rock drillability experiments, particle sizing tests and XRD mineral component analyses as methodology. The results show that the larger the average particle size and sorting coefficient, the smaller the real contact area between the bit and the rock surface, the smaller the friction force. Meanwhile, the volume of the fractured cuttings increased. The results also show that the less the quartz content, the less hard points in the rock. All these factors lead to the reduction in drill bit damage. Because of the strong correlation among the factors of abrasiveness, this paper develops a model of the drill bit abrasion using the partial least square method. The main factors of the model are the grain size distribution and the quartz content of the rock. This model can also be used in the selection of drill bit type and the classification of rock abrasion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

546,"We propose a feasible temporal filtering (or spectrum weighting) system to implement optical differentiation with arbitrarily-tunable order. Differentiation order is tuned by programming the temporal weighting mask (TWM) as power function of different exponents, not limited by the structure of the system. Assembly of the system is feasible, since the active parts are implemented by electro-optic elements and some key elements are reused between sub-systems involved in the scheme. Tuning of the system is simple, since electronically pre-stored TWMs are easy to switch among each other. The order-tunable functionality is verified by numerically testing the differentiation cases of normalized input pulse duration ranging from 0.1 to 0.4, and of differentiation order tuned from 1 to 10. Good accuracy is achieved, and measured by root mean square error lower than 0.1. Feasibilities of the system are also verified in terms of accuracy maintaining and distortion avoiding. Compared with existing methods, apart from the arbitrary order-tunable capacity and good accuracy, our proposed optical differentiator also possesses properties of good compactness and constant complexity.

547,"In this paper, we explore how to enhance the physical layer security performance in downlink cellular networks through cooperative jamming technology. Idle user equipments (UE) are used to cooperatively transmit jamming signal to confuse eavesdroppers (Eve). We propose a threshold-based jammer selection scheme to decide which idle UE should participate in the transmission of jamming signal. Threshold conditions are carefully designed to decrease interference to legitimate channel, while maintain the interference to the Eves. Moreover, fewer UE are activated, which is helpful for saving energy consumptions of cooperative UEs. Analytical expressions of the connection and secrecy performances are derived, which are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Theoretical and simulation results reveal that our proposed scheme can improve connection performance, while approaches the secrecy performance of [12]. Furthermore, only 43% idle UEs of [12] are used for cooperative jamming, which helps to decrease energy consumption of network.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
548,"This study investigated the properties of colloidal nanoalumina (CNA)-blended cementitious mixtures in the presence of calcite to promote better understanding of the enhancing mechanisms of nanoalumina in cementitious materials through experimental investigation and thermodynamic calculation. The rate of heat evolution, compressive strength, connected pore structure, and chloride binding capacity were investigated. The results show that CNA can accelerate cement hydration at early age, and therefore improve the 1-day strength of blended mixtures. The strength at 28 and 56 days can be maximized with 1% by weight CNA addition, but considerably reduced with 5% by weight CNA. Different from the mechanical properties, the connected pore structure and chloride binding capacity are improved straightforwardly with CNA addition, which benefits the ability to resist chloride attack. The experimental and modeling results demonstrate that CNA addition benefits the generation of carboaluminate, which has high efficiency to fill voids due to its higher volume, thus densifying the microstructure as well as improving the chloride resistance. However, these aluminate-ferrite-monosubstituent (AFm) phases demonstrate little cementing capacity relative to calcium silicate hydrate (C S H) gels, thus resulting in an obvious decrease of strength with a high amount of CNA addition even though the microstructure is further densified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
549,"The measurement of transient stagnation pressure in impulse facilities, such as shock tubes and expansion tubes, is critical due to the limited experimental time window. In the present study, we investigate the characteristic behavior of pressure sensors shielded by blunt and conical housings, and evaluate the specific influence of the housing dimensions on the stagnation pressure measurement in distinct flow conditions. Pressure signals of piezoelectric sensors were acquired and schlieren images visualizing the wave dynamics were recorded. We conducted additional numerical simulations to support our hypotheses concerning the flow inside the housings. Results indicate that the pressure signal for conical housings exhibits longer rise time and more pronounced oscillations compared to that for blunt housings. Enlarging the borehole diameter and reducing the cavity depth both shorten signal rise time but enhance overshoots. Additional experiments on the sensitivity to assembly misalignment, the effect of gelatin-filled housings and the performance of exposed sensors complete the study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
550,"The assessment of the magnitude and frequency of natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, or hurricanes depends on understanding the records of these events. Written or historical records are rarely long enough to demonstrate patterns of occurrence, hence it is necessary to rely on geological records, many of which are subtle, incomplete, and subject to multiple possible interpretations. Brian Atwater has applied his expertise in coastal geology to the problem of reconstructing the history of earthquake-induced ""coastal submergence events"" caused by tsunamis or sudden sinking of the land surface. Events such as these have been directly observed in some cases, such as major earthquakes in Alaska and Chile in the 1960s, but longer histories must be reconstructed from the geological record. Using detailed observations of layers of different types of sediment in coastal marshes of Washington, Dr. Atwater and those who followed have shown that major submergence events have occurred roughly every 300 to 500 years along the coastal region known as Cascadia, stretching from British Columbia to Northern California. His studies have been replicated in numerous coastal regions worldwide where comparable hazards exist, helping emergency planners in these areas to better understand the magnitude of the potential risks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

556,"In this paper, an input-decimation technique for the recursive discrete Fourier transform (RDFT)/inverse DFT (RIDFT) algorithm is proposed for the high-speed broadband communication systems. It is worth noting that the input-decimation approach is presented to decrease the number of input sequences for the recursive filter so that the computation cycle of RDFT/RIDFT can be shortened to meet the computing time requirement ( $3.6{\mu }s$ ) for the high-speed broadband communication systems. Therefore, the input-decimation RDFT/RIDFT algorithm is able to carry out at least 55.5 reduction of the total computation cycles compared with the considered algorithms. Furthermore, holding the advantages of input-decimation technique, the computational complexities of the real-multiplication and -addition are reduced to 41.3 and 22.2, respectively. The area and the power consumption can be minimized by employing the cost-efficient constant multiplier with the refined signed-digit expression of twiddle factors. Finally, the physical implementation results show that the core area is $0.37\times 0.37$ mm(2) with $0.18\mu \text{m}$ CMOS process.

559,"The non-destructive damage identification approaches for existing structures become more of a concern due to safety requirements. However, the application of damage identification method is still limited for complex spatial structures. In this paper, a practical residual force decomposition (RFD) method is proposed to identify damaged members in existing reticulated shell structures. A parameterized model is built by taking the stiffness reduction into consideration. In the proposed RFD method, the significant damage can be recognized corresponding to the changes of the observed eigenvector of the reticulated shells, and the eigenvector changes can be easily transferred to a set of multivariate linear equations to locate the members with significant stiffness reduction. The inputs of the equations are discussed including the additional constraints and the selection of effective modes. According to the different proportion of the numbers of members and joints, three situations of the solution are discussed. Especially when the solution is not unique, the importance coefficients of structural members are introduced as additional constraints through Ritz vector sensitivity analysis and application of the Modal Assurance Criterion. Two illustrative examples including a single-layer Kiewitt-6 reticulated shell and a structural model of international convention center are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The results show that the proposed method can yield a suitable damage identification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
560,"A large number of inclusion defects were found during the metal supervision process of the Russian-made 15Cr1Mo1V steel main steam pipeline of a thermal power unit. In this paper, the tracking supervision research of the 15Cr1Mo1V steel pipeline (three elbows with the most serious inclusions at different service time) is carried out in order to find out the variation and distribution law of the material's strength, toughness, metallographic structure and creep rupture strength. And on this basis, a creep fatigue life assessment is performed. The results show that the tensile strength, impact absorption energy and creep rupture property of the material decreased with the increase of the service time. The ductile-brittle transition temperature increased as time prolonging, all above room temperature, which means that the material is brittle. The main inclusions are MnS and SiO2 which are usually plastic, and the most serious inclusions are grade 3. Longitudinal inclusions are mostly of long-chain features, but no crack was found at the inclusion tips; the transverse inclusions are granular. The creep fatigue crack evaluation for the defects of plastic inclusions such as MnS and SiO2 shows that the crack propagation length at the inclusion tip after over 10(5) h of service is tiny which is consistent with the microscopic result, which means that the influence of the plastic inclusion on the structural integrity can be neglected. With the increase of the service time, the endurance strength gradually and slowly decreased. The presence of the inclusions did not accelerate the decline rate of the endurance strength, but might have an impact on the initial endurance strength of the new material. Meanwhile, brittle inclusion defects tend to generate stress concentration and induce the formation of cracks, so it is also necessary to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the inclusions and judge the inclusion category in the subsequent operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
561,"This paper focuses on power-area trade-off axis to memory systems. Compared with the power-performance-area trade-off application on the traditional high performance cache, this paper focuses on the edge processing environment which is becoming more and more important in the Internet of Things (IoT) era. A new power-oriented trade-off is proposed for on-chip cache architecture. As a case study, this paper exploits a good energy efficiency of Standard-Cell Memory (SCM) operating in a near-threshold voltage region and a good area efficiency of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM). A hybrid 2-level on-chip cache structure is first introduced as a replacement of 6T-SRAM cache as L0 cache to save the energy consumption. This paper proposes a method for finding the best capacity combination for SCM and SRAM, which minimizes the energy consumption of the hybrid cache under a specific cache area constraint. The simulation result using a 65-nm process technology shows that up to 80% energy consumption is reduced without increasing the die area by replacing the conventional SRAM instruction cache with the hybrid 2-level cache. The result shows that energy consumption can be reduced if the area constraint for the proposed hybrid cache system is less than the area which is equivalent to a 8 kB SRAM. If the target operating frequency is less than 100 MHz, energy reduction can be achieved, which implies that the proposed cache system is suitable for low-power systems where a moderate processing speed is required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
562,"For the multi-cylinder gasoline engine, the consistency among cylinders is an important index to affect the engine emission and the engine power. In this paper, an individual cylinder air-fuel ratio (A/F) control method for a fourcylinder camless engine with the electromagnetic valve train (EMVT) was proposed to reduce the imbalance of engine torque. An individual cylinder A/F estimation algorithm with a single universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor based on fading Kalman filtering was introduced. Four proportional-integral feedback controllers were built to regulate the individual A/F by adjusting the intake valve closing (IVC) timing of each cylinder independently based on the EMVT. The effectiveness of the proposed estimation and control approach was validated by co-simulation of GT-Power and Simulink. The results showed that the proposed estimation method could accurately estimate the individual cylinder A/F, and the maximum estimation error under steady state condition was less than 1 %. With the feedback control, both the individual A/F imbalance and the cylinderto- cylinder torque generation imbalance were decreased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To simplify an implementation using a fixed-point number representation, we transform SP decoding in the logarithm domain to that in the decision domain. A polynomial approximation is proposed to implement an update rule of the proposed SP decoding efficiently. Numerical simulations show that the approximate SP decoding achieves almost the same performance as the exact SP decoding when an appropriate degree in the polynomial approximation is used, that it improves the convergence properties of SP and normalized min-sum decoding in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime, and that it is robust against quantization errors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
564,"In this research, recognition sensors are used for tracking the outside world along with a steering assistance model that reduces delays inherent in the human cognition, decision, and operation decision-making chain, thereby minimizing vehicle behavior delay with respect to the vehicle position and steering wheel angle based on a read-ahead effect. Additionally, the creation of an emergency avoidance assistance program based on obstacle detection and a cornering assistance program based on white line detection are reported. The effectiveness of these programs using a driving simulator and a model vehicle was investigated. It was found that when the emergency avoidance assist provided by the obstacle detection program was used, the automatic override function was capable of successfully intervening to prevent accidents in situations where it determined that manual steering operations by the driver would be too late. Additionally, in experiments involving cornering assistance by white line detection, it is found that smoother steering around curves was facilitated by the system's ability to set up a optimal approach earlier than could be expected by the curve recognition processes used by human drivers, and that the vehicle was more stable at the curve exit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
565,"The effect of dry-type surface modification of a fumed TiO2 and the thermal treatment were studied to synthesize the new fumed TiO2 having a high content of rutile structure and high dispersibility. The fumed TiO2 was modified with various metallic alkoxides to prepare precursors and next the resulted precursors were thermally-treated by the novel natural dropping method with a very short heating time, less than 1 s. The focus of this investigation was on the metallic alkoxide species as a surface modification agent and morphologies of both the precursor and thermally-treated fumed TiO2. The morphologies and nanostructures of the obtained fumed TiO2 were characterized. The carbon content and agglomerate of the precursor influenced on the transformation ratio from anatase to rutile structure. It was confirmed that the dry-type surface modification with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and titanium tetra-isopropoxide (TTIP) at room temperature is very effective method to prepare precursors for the next thermal treatment. The thermally-treated fumed TiO2 modified with TTIP showed 100% rutile structure with pure TiO2 composition at 1400 degrees C. The thermally-treated fumed TiO2 modified with small quantities of TEOS exhibited both 100% rutile structure and excellent dispersibility. This high dispersibility caused from a sponge-like structural characteristic of the agglomerate and static electricity repellence by coated SiO2 layer. The thermally-treated fumed TiO2 modified with TEOS and TTIP showed the color tone shift can be attributed to rutile structure. It was revealed that the combination of dry-type surface modification and natural dropping thermal treatment is an attractive method to prepare the new fumed TiO2 with 100% rutile structure maintaining the high dispersiblity.

566,"Studying the birds' natural ability of long-range migration hopefully improves the existing navigation technology. The ability of navigation using the geomagnetic field is known as magnetoreception. Recently, a theory based on quantum mechanics reports that the geomagnetic field can affect some molecular chemical reactions of birds and thereby change their flight directions. This chemical magnetoreception process is called radical pair (RP) mechanism. This paper uses quantum spin theory to analyze the magnetoreception effect caused by the reaction of free radical pairs to the geomagnetic field. A quantum spin model is established here to simulate the bird's visual magnetic compass as a navigation tool to sense their orientations with respect to the geomagnetic field. The established visual magnetic compass is then applied to verify the magnetoreception of Platalea minor, commonly known as black-faced spoonbill. By tracking the GPS signals of an individual Platalea minor, the actual migration path is successfully incorporated into the mathematical model to reconstruct the visual images of the geomagnetism on the retina of Platalea minor and to expound its magnetoreception navigation ability along the migratory route from Taijiang National Park in Taiwan to the border area between North and South Korea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
567,"Tight filtering and fiber Kerr effect both cause severe pattern-dependent distortions that need to be combated to achieve higher spectral efficiency (SE), larger capacity and greater achievable transmission distance in the next generation wavelength division multiplex (WDM) optical transmission system. In this paper, a novel multiplier-free maximum-a-posteriori-probability (MAP) detection scheme is proposed and verified in dual-polarization (DP) 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) Nyquist-WDM systems. Based on the innovative technique of approximate calculation of Euclidean distance, the competitive performance is obtained in terms of pattern-dependent impairments mitigation. Besides, the computational complexity (CC) is drastically reduced to about 34%, as the multiplier of the proposed MAP detection is completely removed. Comprehensive simulation results of triple-carrier Nyquist DP 16-QAM demonstrate that the MAP scheme could effectively mitigate the tight filtering and fiber nonlinearity impairments with much lower CC, i.e., achieve desirable SE and nonlinearity tolerance in long-haul transmissions. In addition, a 1.1 dB reduction of the required OSNR and 2.6 dB launch power range extension are observed in the triple-carrier 480 Gb/s Nyquist DP 16-QAM back-to-back and 700 km transmission experiments, respectively. The advantages of the proposed low-complexity MAP scheme make it a preferable impairment mitigation technique for practical Nyquist-WDM systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

569,"We developed a desktop-type bulk magnet system using a Stirling refrigerator and used it to study how to improve the trapped field by pulsed field magnetization (PFM). Although PFM has the advantage that the bulk is activated in a few seconds using an ordinary inexpensive equipment, the amplitude of a trapped field is low as compared with the maximum performance of the material. This paper aims to improve the trapped field by changing the size of soft-iron yoke, which are generally used to extend the pulse width. When a phi 60-mm GdBCO bulk was magnetized using phi 64-mm and phi 80-mm yokes, the maximum flux density and total magnetic flux of large yoke were 13% and 23% higher than those of small one, respectively. Moreover, improvement of trapped field by multi PFM was investigated.

In this study, we demonstrate the vibration effect on the embryonic period of C. elegans. Vibration was found to affect growth promotion and gene expression.

572,"In this paper, we present a GPU-based implementation of an elastic shape registration approach in implicit spaces. Shapes are represented using signed distance functions, while deformations are modeled by cubic B-splines. In a variational framework, an incremental free form deformation strategy is adopted to handle smooth deformations through an adaptive size control lattice grid. The grid control points are estimated by a closed-form solution which avoids the gradient descent iterations. However, even this solution is very far from real time. We show in detail that such an algorithm is computationally expensive with a time complexity of O(NCPxNCP2X2Y2) where NCPx and NCP are the grid lattice resolution parameters in the shape domain of size XxY. Moreover, the problem becomes more time-consuming with the increase in the number of control points because this requires the execution of the incremental algorithm several times. The closed-form solution was implemented using eight different GPU techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate speedups of more than 150x compared to the C implementation on a CPU.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
573,"This study presents two improved designs of eccentric-shaped permanent magnets and teeth-shaped stators in radial-flux dual three-phase permanent magnet electric machines to reduce cogging torque and torque ripple. The finite element analysis (ANSYS Electromagnetics) has been adopted in simulation, and real radial-flux dual three-phase permanent magnet electric machines have been fabricated in experiment to verify the study. Using the radial-flux dual three-phase permanent magnet electric machines in electric machine systems can improve the reliability and obtain higher output torque. In electrical drives and control, a simplified model-free predictive current control method has been proposed and implemented to drive the radial-flux dual three-phase permanent magnet electric machines, and the control law has been achieved by a TMS320F28377S microcontroller of Texas Instruments. The simplified model-free predictive current control method is senseless to parameter variations and back electromotive force of the permanent magnet electric machines, and only needs current sensors to detect six-phase current. The optimal one has been chosen by 14 various switching modes, which has the minimum cost function, and then the converter can be directly driven and controlled in the next sampling period. The features of the simplified model-free predictive current control method can reduce the algorithm calculation and avoid the defect of conventional model-based predictive current control scheme. A proportional-integral speed controller has also been designed to achieve the speed response of the fixed-speed tracking effect. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed simplified model-free predictive current control method for the dual three-phase permanent magnet electric machines can be verified in the experimental and quantitative results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
574,"Sand is a type of soil with high porosity and a tendency toward a high permeability rate and low shear strength, which often causes problems in terms of piping and low slope stability. Permeability and shear strength have a very close relationship with soil stability. In this paper, we analyzed the addition of the bacterial producer exopolysaccharide on sandy soil for increased instability. The addition of this bacterial producer is expected to improve soil stability by reducing its permeability and increasing its shear strength. To find an alternative approach to overcome the problems of low permeability and shear strength, experiments were conducted using five types of non-pathogenic inoculated bacterial producer, namely, Lactobacillus sakei, Agrobacterium tumifaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas sp, and Nifrobacter sp, added to five samples of river and beach sand. After 30 days of bacterial inoculation, the permeability of the sand samples was tested using a constant head test, and the shear strength was tested using a direct shear test, which was confirmed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on the permeability test, the permeability of the sand samples inoculated with Bacillus subtilis was reduced the most at 74.43%. Based on the direct shear test, the highest increase in shear strength, i.e., about 58.91%, was in the samples inoculated with Lactobacillus sakei. SEM photographs with 10,000 x magnification showed the presence of bacteria and the formation of extracellular polysaccharides in the walls of the sand, which affected the permeability reduction rate and increased the shear strength of the sand samples. Based on the permeability and shear strength results, it can be seen that the correlation between the two is weak, and thus when the shear strength of the sample increases, the permeability does not necessarily decrease; the correlation depends on the type and characteristics of the bacterial producer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, standard cultivation protocol for Kappaphycus alvarezii has yet to be well-documented, particularly on strain selection for kappa-carrageenan production. There are various strains of Kappaphycus alvarezii grown in Indonesia, specifically in Serang, Banten such as green, red, and yellowish green strains. In this study, growth rate, carrageenan yield, and gel strength from different strains of Kappaphycus alvarezii were investigated. It was observed that the specific growth rate of green type (4.14% /day) differed significantly from the other two types (red; 3.41% /day and yellowish green; 3.47% /day). The red type had the highest yield of carrageenan (45.16%) followed by yellowish green (36.66%) and green strain (33.67%). Gel strength was not significantly affected by the strain variations where the observed values for yellowish green, green, and red strain were 344.46, 316.91 and 313.10 g/cm(2), respectively.

A novel reusable non-separation spring-driven opening scheme is proposed to achieve rapid and reliable opening of the front cover. The mathematical model of the opening process of the front cover is established by the rigid body dynamics theory. To establish a response surface model to optimize the opening scheme, three main influencing factors of the opening process are obtained through the designed experiments, including the pre-compression, the stiffness of the thrust spring, and the thrust spring force arm length. In addition, the prescribed kinematic law was taken as constraint, and the smaller thrust spring preliminary pressure and angular velocity was taken as optimization expectations.

Idle UAVs may work as relays between the sources and destinations to enhance communication quality. In this letter, we investigate the opportunistic relay selection for the UAVs dynamic network. On account of the time-varying channel states and the variable numbers of sources and relays, relay selection becomes much more difficult. In addition, information exchange among all nodes may bring much cost and it is difficult to implement in practice. Thus, we propose a decentralized relay selection approach based on mood-driven mechanism to combat the dynamic characteristics, aiming to maximize the total capacity of the network without information exchange.

591,"Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has been a feasible and flexible apparatus for providing Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) information globally. In GNSS, the navigation satellites broadcast the signals to the earth, and the user receives the signals for PNT information determination. However, a standalone GNSS is not sufficient to construct a seamless navigation system, especially in some signal challenging environments. Thus, GNSS is always integrated with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) for providing reliable PNT information, since the INS is able to provide moderate PNT information during short time. Micro-Electro-Mechanical IMU (MEMS IMU) is popular in the navigation community, due to its low cost, smaller volume and less power consumption. However, the MEMS IMU experiences complicated noise, which contributes the dramatically errors divergence in navigation solutions. For solving the problem and improving the navigation solution accuracy, this paper introduced Artificial Intelligence methods for addressing this issue. Specifically, deep recurrent neural networks (DRNN) gained excellent performance in processing time series. Inspired by this, this paper firstly employed a deep Gated Recurrent Unit- Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU-RNN) to model the noise with the aim to improve the accuracy of the navigation solutions. Two different MEMS gyroscopes (MSI3200, STIM300) from two different companies were employed in the experiments for testing the evaluating the proposed GRU-RNN, and a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) was also employed for comparing with the GRU-RNN. Following conclusions were drawn according to the results: 1) the employed GRU-RNN and LSTM-RNN were both effective for MSI3200 and STIM300 gyroscope raw signals processing. The results showed that the standard deviation (STD) of the noise decreased by 27.1%, 36.1% and 51.1% in MSI3200, and 37.5%, 60.0% and 57.1% in STIM300 dataset after processed by the GRU-RNN.

An electronic circuit with only linear elements, for example, R, C, L and independent current, and voltage sources (LTI), is described with a system of differential (state) equations. Nonlinear elements, such as L(i), C(u), Diodes, MOSFETs, BJTs and/or PWM controllers are described with piecewise-linear models. Connecting linear and linearized nonlinear elements, results in a linear system of differential equations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

598,"3D skull similarity measurement is a challenging and meaningful task in the fields of archaeology, forensic science, and anthropology. However, it is difficult to correctly and directly measure the similarity between 3D skulls which are geometric models with multiple border holes and complex topologies. In this paper, based on the synthetic feature method, we propose a novel 3D skull descriptor, synthetic wave kernel distance distribution (SWKDD) constructed by the laplace-beltrami operator. By defining SWKDD, we obtain a concise global skull representation method and transform the complex 3D skull similarity measurement into a simple 1D vector similarity measurement. First, we give the definition and calculation of SWKDD and analyse its properties. Second, we represent a framework for 3D skull similarity measurement using the SWKDD of 3D skulls and details of the calculation steps involved. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method by calculating the similarity measurement of 3D skulls based on the real craniofacial database.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
599,"Torus cutters are increasingly used in machining high-hardness materials because of high processing efficiency. However, due to the large hardness variation in assembled hardened steel workpiece, the tool wear occurs easily in machining process. This severely affects the machined surface quality. Here, we conduct a research on the tool wear and the machined surface quality in milling assembled hardened steel mold with a torus cutter. The experimental results show the abrasive wear mechanism dominates the initial tool wear stage of the torus cutter. As the tool wear intensifies, the adhesive wear gradually occurs due to the effect of alternating stress and impact load. Thus, the mixing effect of the abrasive and adhesive wears further accelerates tool wear, resulting in occurrence of obvious crater wear band on the rake face and coating tearing area on the flank face. Finally, the cutter is damaged by the fatigue wear mechanism, reducing seriously the cutting performance. With increase of flank wear, moreover, there are increasingly obvious differences in both the surface morphology and the cutting force at the two sides of the joint seam of the assembled hardened steel parts, including larger height difference at the two sides of the joint seam and sudden change of cutting force, as a result, leading to decreasing cutting stability and deteriorating seriously machined surface quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The application there is limited to the use of an ordinary Portland cement (CEM I) based repair material and to an average carbonation depth of less than 20 mm beyond the reinforcement. Concerning the repair of drinking water reservoirs, special boundary conditions must also be considered from both a hygienic and a technical point of view.

The possible involvement of visual misperception in crash causation can be evaluated during a comprehensive site inspection under conditions that correspond as much as reasonably possible to the actual conditions that existed at the time of the crash. Two case studies are described that illustrate the value of site inspection in uncovering the possible contribution of visual misperception in these nighttime fatal crashes; case 1 involving visual illusion, and case 2 involving signal ambiguity.

The shear forces and displacements are compared with those obtained when simplifying the wall by a cantilever with full fixity at the top of the basement, ignoring the transfer of shear force and bending moment into the basement. First, the influence of the basement is modelled by hinged connections between the wall and the base slab and the floor diaphragm above the basement, respectively. This will result in an unrealistically large wall shear force in the basement. Then, the flexural restraint of the wall by the base plate, and the lateral compliance of the floor diaphragm are modelled by a rotational spring and a lateral spring at those levels. Recommendations are given for reasonable values of the spring constants for practical design purposes. Special attention is given to the way in which including the basement in the mechanical model of such walls will influence aspects of their seismic design.

In order to implement the velocity and temperature boundary conditions, the force term and heat source/sink are included in the evolution equations. While fixed Eulerian lattice nodes are employed, while different eccentricities are considered for inner cylinder. In order to simulate mixed convection, the radius ratio is set to be 2.5. Furthermore, the effect of Richardson number by choosing 0.01, 1, 100 and Prandtl number of 0.716 for air and 6.2 for water are investigated. Isotherms, streamlines and mean Nusselt numbers are given for each case. The results are in good agreement with previous related publications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
636,"This paper presents an empirical study to determine whether alterations to graphical features (colour and size) of automatically generated LineSets improve task performance. LineSets are used to visualise sets and networks. The increasingly common nature of such data suggests that having effective visualisations is important. Unlike many approaches to set and network visualisation, which often use concave or convex shapes to represent sets alongside graphs, LineSets use lines overlaid on a graph. LineSets have been shown to be advantageous over shape-based approaches. However, the graphical properties of LineSets have not been fully explored. Our results suggest that automatically drawn LineSets can be significantly improved for certain tasks through the considered use of colour alongside size variations applied to their graphical elements. In particular, we show that perceptually distinguishable colours, lines of varying width, and nodes of varying diameter lead to improved task performance in automatically laid-out LineSets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
637,"A robust private sector in space can be instrumental in achieving major space policy goals, such as those promoted by the U.S. Government: fostering private space markets and reducing the cost and time required for the government to develop and procure space systems. Meeting these goals will likely require increased government attention to the challenges facing the private sector, as well as potential implementation of new or underutilized regulatory, policy, and economic mechanisms. This article focuses on a government strategic investment fund as a potential economic mechanism, which would make equity investments in companies pursuing activities of interest to the government, and offers examples of past and current funds both in the United States and internationally. This article then assesses the utility of such a fund in addressing the challenges with meeting these 2 policy goals; these challenges were identified through a literature review and interviews with >60 space experts, economists, and other stakeholders. We identified 5 major challenges to fostering the growth of private space markets and 4 challenges to reducing government costs and accelerating the development and procurement of space systems. Our analysis concludes that although a government strategic investment fund may be useful in select scenarios, it will not most effectively address the current challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

639,"The monopoly electricity market in Indonesia uses flat tariffs but is being encouraged to change to dynamic pricing. Dynamic pricing scenarios have been implemented in many Western countries with various types of schemes. This paper discusses dynamic pricing scenarios based on residential load and generation in the Java-Bali system. The tariff scheme is a combination of critical peak pricing (CPP) and time-of-use (TOU). The CPP runs for only a few hours each year depending on the gas power plant operation. TOU will be used with peak and off-peak schedules as determined based on residential load characteristics. The gas power plant is a reference in designing the CPP rates because it is used to meet peak loads if other plants are unable to meet requirements and its cost of generating electricity is high compared to other power plants. The dynamic pricing scheme is simulated for a residential load. Then, the load reduction during peak times and the impact of reducing electricity consumption in the Java-Bali system is analyzed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
640,"Catalytic CO oxidation on platinum group metals can exhibit nonlinear behaviors like catastrophe, bistability, and hysteresis, which are indicative of self-organizing processes occurring in the course of the oxidation reaction. As a result, the system demonstrates a multi-branch nonlinear input/output relationship for which the output value depends not only on the instantaneous input values, but also on the history of operations. Traditional linear control approaches may cause unstable operation in the CO oxidation reaction. In this paper, a nonlinear control strategy is proposed to solve the control problem. The control strategy incorporates a PI controller and a switching control strategy by which the control system can maintain a high regulating performance while preventing unstable operation. It may be applied to control operations in industrial processes of catalytic CO oxidation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
641,"This paper considers the structural modeling of reinforced concrete beam-column (RCBC) joints of unbraced framed structures. The main objective is to establish a formula that determines, for each particular situation, if the centreline joint model may be used or if an explicit model, which although more accurate is also more complex, is required. Accordingly, in order to circumvent the need to analyze the full frame and to avoid the shortcomings of empirical procedures we derive simplified classification criteria (SCC) based on the stiffness of the joint components. By applying these SCC to a given RCBC joint, it is classified either as semi-rigid, meaning that an explicit model is required, or as nominally rigid otherwise. The determination of the parameters that are required by the SCC is fully discussed. The presented example illustrates the application of the developed SSC to particular RCBC joints, showing that its results are mainly confirmed by the analysis of the full frame to which they pertain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
642,"Pakistan is one of the coal rich countries but only adds 10% of electricity to the national grid from coal fired power plants while major sources are, Hydel, LNG, Furnace oil, and natural gas. Prior to the discovery of Thar coal reservoirs, Lakhra was the largest coal field of Brown Lignite coal with high ash and sulfur contents, i.e. 30% and 7%, respectively. The power generation capacity of the plant is 150 MW. Study conducted revealed that all the existing values of un-washed coal found (High Ash, Low Moisture, Low Fixed Carbon, High Sulfur, and Low Calorific value) while the washed coal values found (Low Ash, Low Moisture, High Fixed Carbon, Low Sulfur, and High Heating value).

643,"In this paper, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) transmissions with multiple-input single-output transceiver pairs are considered. In each pair, a multi-antenna transmitter sends data and energy to a single-antenna receiver with a signal-splitting structure and a non-linear energy harvesting model. Each transceiver pair tries to achieve high individual harvested energy efficiency, and uses artificial noise (AN) to protect the information from being overheard by other users that cooperate like a virtual eavesdropper. The weighted sum user-centric harvested energy-efficiency maximisation problem is formulated under constraints on the required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each receiver, plus a limited SINR for virtual eavesdroppers and limited transmit power at each transmitter. The optimal precoding beamforming, AN, and signal-splitting factors are obtained by two proposed algorithms. The first solution exploits semidefinite relaxation and sequential parametric convex approximation techniques to convert the non-convex problem to a series of convex subproblems with matrix variables. We obtain optimal beamforming vectors along with an optimal covariance matrix for AN. The second solution directly utilizes beamforming approximation and obtains a low complexity solution for the convex subproblem. Moreover, we need to apply the feasible point pursuit method. Finally, numerical evaluations are provided in comparison with some benchmark schemes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high induction time result of +0.500 mm size fraction with low ash content proved that the physical property, especially particle size, has a significant effect on induction time and wetting thermodynamic measurements. Moreover, LHR value and combustible recovery of 0.250-0.125 mm size fraction were higher than that of 0.125-0.074 mm size fraction, which indicated that the induction time measurement was greatly affected by the chemical property, i.e. heterogeneity.

645,"Occupational Applications This article describes techniques to evaluate combinations of percentile values when only the nominal percentile level and percentile values are known, but not the underlying data. The methods described can be employed to estimate anthropometric accommodation. One application is that of estimating accommodation from the sum of two or more percentile values when a desired dimension has not been directly measured, but can be estimated by combining the percentile values of two or more known percentile values (e.g. the percentile for seated eye height above the floor as the sum of 90th percentile values of seat height and eye height above the seat). A second application is to estimate the joint accommodation on multiple variables when two or more percentile values have been used to define dimensions (e.g. what is the joint accommodation for a chair seat when the height, depth, and width are defined by their respective 90th percentile values?). Technical Abstract Background: Several authors have noted the utility of combining percentile values, for example as sums of server response times, or as the proportion of cases in the intersection of sets of percentile-based parameters of objects, such as furniture dimensions. Purpose: This article describes methods to estimate unknown variances and correlations as a function of the percentages or quantiles of a distribution. Methods: Two methods are presented with which unknown variances and correlation values can be estimated. Variances are found by converting percentiles or quantiles to indicator function variables. As a result, the variance can be expressed as a function of the quantile. Similarly, there are limits on the range of correlation values, which are a function of the percentile or quantile. The midpoint of the range of possible correlation values can be used to estimate combinations of percentiles, as it minimizes the possible error due to estimates of the correlation value. Finally, estimates of combinations of percentiles are made using the derived variance and estimated correlation values. These estimates are compared with observed combinations. Results: The maximum possible error using these methods of estimating variances and correlations for combinations of two variables are illustrated for a selected range of quantiles. The maximum possible error is least at the extremes of the quantile range (e.g. for quantiles greater than the 90th or less than the 10th). Conclusions: In some instances where only limited data are available, such as a single pair of percentile values, it may be useful to draw some conclusions regarding the general population. The techniques described in this article allow for estimating the proportion of the population whose measurement values are concurrently less than or equal to the specified percentile values; or, to estimate the proportion of the population whose summed measurements are less than or equal to the sum of the known percentile values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
646,"BACKGROUND Materials from renewable sources are in great demand to reduce carbon fingerprint. Olive pomace is a waste with high lignin content (>25%) and generated in high volumes. Therefore lignin from olive pomace is susceptible to be transformed into added value chemicals such as monomeric phenols through its catalytic depolymerization combining hydrogen donors (i.e. molecular hydrogen, polar protic solvents and formic acid) and catalysts based on transition metals (i.e. palladium and ruthenium supported on carbon, and SHVO catalyst, also ruthenium-based). RESULTS The reaction conditions for the nitrogen and hydrogen experiments were temperatures of 250 and 200 degrees C and initial pressures of 4 and 20 bar respectively. The bio-oil obtained after the catalytic process was approximately half of the initial sample weight, although somewhat lower under hydrogen conditions. The SHVO catalyst yielded 15 and 10% of monomeric phenols under nitrogen and hydrogen conditions respectively, while the other two catalysts yielded between 6 and 9% irrespective of the gas. CONCLUSION Overall, the SHVO catalyst provided a richer mixture of phenolic compounds owing to its milder hydrogenation activity compared with the other catalysts, although at the end of the reaction the catalyst did not preserve its native form. The use of formic acid under nitrogen atmosphere was advantageous to increase the yields of phenols. The most abundant monomers in the experiments using SHVO catalyst under both atmospheres were 4-propylguaiacol, (Z)-propenylguaiacol, 4-propylsyringol, dihydroconiferyl alcohol, (Z)-propenylsyringol and dihydrosinapyl alcohol.

647,"Salient object segmentation is an important computer vision problem having applications in numerous areas such as video surveillance, scene parsing, autonomous navigation etc. For images, this task is quite challenging due to clutter/texture present in the background, low resolution and/or low contrast of the object(s) of interest etc. In case of videos, additional issues such as object deformation, camera motion and presence of multiple moving objects make the foreground object segmentation a significantly difficult and open problem. However, motion pattern can also act as an important cue to identify the foreground objects against the background. This is exploited by the recent approaches via aggregation of temporally perturbed information from a series of consecutive frames. Unfortunately for images, this additional cue is not available. In this paper, we propose to emulate the effect of such perturbations by constructing a bag of multiple augmentations applied on a single input image. Saliency features are estimated independently from each perturbed image in this bag, which are further combined using a novel aggregation strategy based on a convolutional gated recurrent encoder-decoder unit. Through extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets, we show better or very competitive performance when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We further observe that even with a bag constructed using simple affine transformations, we achieve impressive performances, proving the robustness of the proposed framework.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

649,"The adaptive pseudocomponent characterization method for continuous mixtures was extended to mass transfer problems using the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion model. It is based on the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMoM), using a quadrature rule to discretize the molar fraction distribution of the continuous mixture. The solution method was applied to two one-dimensional mass transfer problems: the transient diffusion in a Loschmidt tube and the steady-state diffusion in a thin film. In the latter, it was showed that the DQMoM equations reduce to an equivalent problem with a fixed characterization and solution methods for linearized theory problems can be employed. For these two problems, the proposed method was verified against the discrete component model (DCM), whose implementation was also verified against existing solutions. Results showed that the adaptive method with five pseudocomponents predicts the mixture properties with maximum relative deviation smaller than 1% when compared to the DCM with 57 components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
650,This paper presents an all-digital 1-1 MASH Delta time-to-digital converter (TDC) using time-mode signal processing. A cascode time adder with a raised inverter threshold voltage is proposed to minimize the deterministic timing error caused by the current mismatch of the discharge paths of the time adder. A differential time integrator consisting of a pair of identical single-ended time integrators is proposed to minimize the effect of the nonlinearities of the single-ended time integrator. The random and deterministic timing errors of the TDC are analyzed. The TDC is designed in an IBM 130 nm 1.2 V CMOS technology and analyzed using Spectre from Cadence Design Systems with BSIM4 device models. Simulation results demonstrate that the TDC exhibits 40 dB per decade noise-shaping at high frequencies. The cascode-configured discharge paths and raised threshold voltage of the load inverter improve the linearity of the TDC. The TDC achieves 1.9 ps time resolution over 48-415 kHz signal band while consuming 502 mu W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
651,"Fast pyrolysis of corn stover was carried out in a pilot scale fluidized bed reactor in nitrogen atmosphere. The effects of varying gas flow rates at optimum reaction temperature of about 500oC and feed size of < 1.0 mm on yield and composition of bio-oil, char and gas were investigated. The results for three runs with flow rate of gas of 45, 80 and 70 L/min, respectively, were obtained. The distribution of pyrolysis products was calculated gravimetrically by mass balance and corrected with optimization mass model using proximate and ultimate analysis of feedstock and pyrolysis products. The maximum yield of bio-oil (52 wt%) was obtained in run 3 with flow rate of gas of 70 L/min having heating value of 21.20 MJ/kg. GC-MS analysis identified the major chemical compounds present in the bio-oil which were levoglucosan, hydroxyl acetaldehyde, acetol, acetic acid, phenols, 2-methyl-2-cylopenten-1-one, guaiacol, 2(5H)-furanone, fufuryl alcohol, p-cresol and 2-ethyl alcohol. The bio-oil produced from run 3 had higher amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons, non-methoxylated phenolics, levoglucosan and smaller amounts of acids.

Fifteen commercial carbon nano-particulate materials have been investigated and categorized according to their extinction efficiencies and scattering percentages when measured in-situ. The extinction efficiencies were measured both in liquid suspensions, which allows various mechanisms for particle separation, and in-situ.

653,"An experimental campaign was carried out to investigate the characteristics of the transitional supersonic wake downstream of a single roughness element. Two Mach numbers were tested, 1.6 and 2.3, and two roughness heights, 0.1 mm and 1 mm. Unsteady and steady wall temperature measurements were taken along and across the roughness wake. The spatial trends of adiabatic wall temperature and heat flux, and the spectral time evolution of temperature were documented in this paper. The initial wall temperature was varied during the temperature measurements, and the resulting steady and unsteady effects on the roughness wake were investigated. The streamwise trends of heat-flux and adiabatic-wall temperature confirmed the transitional nature of the roughness wake. Spectral analysis showed that roughness height and initial wall temperature had the same type of effect on the wake wall-temperature fluctuations. The effect of roughness height was more sensible at Mach 2.3, ant that of the initial wall temperature was more evident with the smallest roughness also tested at Mach 2.3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

656,"Purpose - Metalworking fluids can significantly increase the tool life in titanium cutting, however, full-scale cutting tests to determine the performance of metalworking fluid are expensive. The aim of this study is therefore to introduce a reliable and inexpensive alternative testing method. Design/methodology/approach - A newly developed in-process tribometer allows emulating the sliding conditions of the chip formed in cutting as closely as possible. It uses a cutting action in front of a pin to eliminate the influence of the oxidation layer. To observe the wear pattern on the pin, adhering workpiece material is removed by selective etching. A high temperature oxidation test is used to study the wear mechanism. Findings - The wear pattern on the pin correlates well with the wear pattern observed on cutting tools when using the same metalworking fluid while being much more cost-effective than a tool life test. The high temperature oxidation test reveals that cobalt leaching is causing notch wear. Research limitations/implications - The correlation between pin and tool wear is verified for the case of roughing turning of titanium with cemented carbide tools and two metalworking fluids. Practical implications - The method is applicable in an industrial context, potentially replacing the currently used tribological analyzes. Social implications - Submitted in connection with the special issue ""young tribologists - insights into the work of the new generation"". Originality/value - Methods tailored to model the tool wear in titanium cutting are rare.

658,"Core holder is a common experimental device in the field of petroleum exploration. Each kind of core holder has an output port. The objective of this paper is to determine whether the output port will affect the fluid flow in the core. The function of the output port is to collect and derive the fluid. A compression ring with a thickness of 5 mm and a diameter of 25 mm was fabricated by using 3D printing technology. We add the ring between the rock sample and the output port. The ring does not affect the function of the output port but avoids direct contact between the output port and the core end face. We find that permeability test results obtained by adding a ring are larger than that obtained by the core holder without a ring. A numerical simulation model is established according to the size of the output port. The influence of the output port on the velocity and pressure distribution in the rock sample is analyzed by using the coupling of Stokes and Darcy flow numerical simulation method. It is pointed out that the output port affects the fluid flow within 5 mm near the end face of the rock sample. The fluid velocity is unstable in the range of 5 mm near the end face of the rock sample. In order to reduce the influence of the output port on fluid flow in the core, five new types of output port grooves are designed in this paper. Comparing the numerical simulation results of different grooves schemes, it is considered that adding a 5 mm cylindrical cavity between the output port and the rock sample can reduce the influence. It is suggested that the output port should not be in direct contact with the core, and the output port and the end face of the core should be separated by 5 mm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed synthetic method increased the yield of target product by -10% as compared with the conventional one. In addition, the phosphate esters obtained by this method were practically free of tars even before vacuum distillation and had acceptable color and optical density. The proposed technology for synthesizing phosphate esters could produce FRFs with the physicochemical and operating properties required to operate over broad ranges depending on the product application by varying the quantitative and qualitative compositions of the alcohols and/or alkylphenols. In particular, a mixed friary, phosphate with properties meeting basic regulatory requirements for use in power-plant turbine control and lubricating systems was produced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
669,"In this paper, the distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based approach is investigated for total harvested power maximization (THPM) in multiple-input single-output transceiver pairs with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. The power-splitting architecture and practical non-linear energy harvesting are utilized at each receiver. The highly non-convex THPM problem is formulated under requirements for the data rate, the amount of harvested power, and with limited power at the transmitters. First, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and sequential parametric convex approximation are exploited to convert the non-convex THPM to a series of convex subproblems. Then, slack variables replacing interference are introduced to allow decomposing into distributed subproblems via ADMM.The interesting point is that optimal precoding matrices of the local subproblems satisfy the rank-1 constraints of SDR. Finally, the numerical experiments present the convergence of the proposed algorithm, obtaining results similar to the centralized approach, as well as comparing it with some baseline schemes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

671,"In asynchronous duty-cycled wireless sensor networks (WSNs), each node has its own sleep schedule that is independent of the schedules of neighboring nodes. Since each node follows its own independent sleep schedule, the probability that a node's neighbors will wake up concurrently is quite low. For this reason, each single hop broadcast must be completed through multiple unicast transmissions, and the sender node must remain awake until all of its neighboring nodes have received the broadcast packet. In this paper, we present two energy efficient broadcast protocols, namely Broadcast Progress-based Efficient Multihop Broadcast (BPEMB) protocol and Tree-based Efficient Multihop Broadcast (TEMB) protocol, for asynchronous duty-cycled WSNs. In both of the proposed protocols, the decision of whether to transmit the broadcast packet is based on the link quality information and without any forwarder's guidance list. The redundant transmissions and collisions are avoided effectively with cooperation among the neighbors, so that the node with the best link quality to the receiver node takes responsibility to forward the packet to the receiver node. With this approach, nodes that are not involved in transmitting the broadcast packet can go to sleep and save their energy. In the BPEMB protocol, the forwarding decision of transmitting the broadcast packet is also influenced by the broadcast progress information, which is piggybacked in the broadcast packet. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed protocols can significantly improve the broadcast efficiency through reducing the energy consumption and minimizing the broadcast latency. The evaluation results also show that both the BPEMB and TEMB protocols can substantially reduce the collisions and redundant transmissions in asynchronous duty-cycled WSNs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the results of flame arrester tests, using the inner diameter of the pipeline as the basis for the pressure division yielded more accurate results, which was not clearly described in ISO 16852 standard. The target values of P-md/P-TB for the DN50 flame arrester were too small. Further studies are needed to determine appropriate ratios of P-md/P-TB for flame arresters with different pipe diameters. The run-up distance required to form stable detonation was beyond L = 120 D, which is commonly believed to be the required distance for stable detonation to establish. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the conditions where flame arresters to be used and the conditions under which the flame arresters were tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
675,"A vertical caisson breakwater on soft intercalated ground (sand replacement in the upper layer) is highly susceptible to catastrophic failure when subjected to excessive cyclic loadings. In this paper, the cyclic stability of a caisson-rubble-ground system under different sand replacement conditions is investigated via finite element methods. Structure-soil interfaces and undrained strength degradation of the soft intercalated layer are two key considerations. The latter is implemented by modifying the Yasuhara model to quantify the strength degradation in terms of the number of cycles and stress level. Cyclic responses with different replacement ratios r (i.e., the ratio of backfilled sand layer thickness to initial total soft layer thickness) are presented in terms of pore pressure and strength degradation. Failure modes and safety factors are also investigated. Numerical results show that the pore pressure and strength degradation of the soft layer mainly occurred underneath the rubble mound, and were evident at small replacement ratios. The failure modes could be caisson sliding (r <= 0.35), soft ground bearing capacity failure (r > 0.50), or a combination thereof (0.35<r <= 0.50). The safety factor first increased and then approached a constant value with increasing replacement ratios. The findings herein provide a practical implication for safety evaluation and structural design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
676,"Repairing concrete structures with carbon reinforced textile concrete under wet conditions or even underwater is not yet taken in to account according to the German abZ. Nonetheless, it can be assumed that there is a high potential for application in outdoor areas /facilities like channels or sewers which are fully exposed to weathering or even partially flooded with water. Recent research already shows that there are possibilities of applying textile reinforced carbon concrete under such conditions, which finally led to the entitled pilot project that has already successfully been completed. This project was a highly damaged duct liable to collapse in the centre of Feldafingen. The repair must be performed as quickly as possible while traffic and thus access to the adjacent properties must be granted. To meet these requirements, it was necessary to combine the standardised shotcrete method with still developing carbon concrete technology and perform extensive underwater tests prior to the project itself. It was possible to restore the duct with an additional layer of only 70 mm thickness. Furthermore, the flow speed of the water was improved by the seamless and smooth surface of the carbon concrete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the system without prey refuge, i.e., m = 0 case, by developing the new analysis technique, we show that C-1 >= 2 is enough to ensure the global attractivity of the positive equilibrium of the system, such a result seems amazing since it is independent of the parameter a(1), b, delta and beta. Consequently, we can draw the conclusion that for the most of the parameters, system admits a unique globally attractive positive equilibrium. For 0 < c(1) < 2, we also investigate the stability property of the positive equilibrium. Two examples together with their numerical simulations show the feasibility of the main results. For the system with prey refuge, we show that there exists a m*, such that for all m > m*, the system always admits a unique positive equilibrium, which means that enough large prey refuge can improve the coexistence of the species. Refuge plays important role on the persistent property of the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

679,"To deal with the large error of burst height measurement for novel optional burst height millimeter wave proximity fuses in new-generation long-range projectiles, a ground object recognition strategy based on echo polarization is proposed in this paper. In the height measurement process, there are many factors, including the flight condition of the projectile, tall objects, ground clutter, interference signals, etc. restricting measurement accuracy. Therefore, a novel measurement scheme is urgently needed to enhance the accuracy of height measurements. The method mainly distinguishes the surface and ground objects within the range of the detected beam, under the condition that the detection area has apparent divisions. The polarimetric rotation-invariant parameters are used to analyze the features of ground objects. On the other hand, when the detection area does not have apparent divisions, the polarimetric echo reconstruction technology is used to determine the surface. Simulation experiments show the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method compared with the traditional height measurement system. Even in the presence of extensive interference, the method allows the accurate measurement of the projectile's height above the ground.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed method called GMM-MUD is based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to suppress multiple access interference. The GMM describes probability distributions of the hypothesis testing problem which is used for bit classification. To reveal the difference between correct bits and error bits, the preprocessing operation applies a mapping function based on optimal multiuser detection. The parameters of GMM are estimated by using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. EM algorithm employs iterative operation to simplify the complexity of maximum likelihood estimation method and considers the mapping values of received bits as the observations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GMM-MUD algorithm achieves good performances in terms of bit error rate performance, user capacity, and near-far resistance.

686,"The proliferation of digital radiography (DR) has led to a re-evaluation of exposure parameters and image quality. Currently, there is a move towards reducing X-ray tube voltage (kVp) in paediatric exposures down to 40 kVp to achieve better images. However, the effect on patient dose of these modifications is uncertain. The main aims of this phantom study were to evaluate the effect of reducing the kVp in paediatric limb DR exposures on contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and patient dose. For this purpose, Monte Carlo simulations of radiographic exposures on a paediatric limb phantom were performed. The phantom included muscle tissue and bone segments of five different densities in the range of 1.12 to 1.48 g/cm(3). The overall thickness of the phantom varied between 1 and 12 cm. Dependence of the CNR at constant limb phantom muscle and bone doses and dependence of the CNR per unit of muscle and bone dose at constant detector dose on radiographic exposure factors and limb thickness were calculated. X-ray tube current-time product (mAs) values required to achieve equal detector dose versus limb thickness for different kVp were calculated, as well as muscle and bone doses for the limb phantom of varying thickness. Present work has shown that reducing the kVp in paediatric radiography of the extremities can result in a significant increase in radiation dose, particularly for thicker limbs. Low kVp radiography requires justification for use on the extremities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

689,"This study proposes a novel model-free robot manipulator joint position and velocity tracking controller with a simple structure for controlling a robotic manipulator with human-like reaching motion according to human movement characteristics. The proposed design guarantees the responses of the tracking error within preset bounds using velocity feedback. A structurally and computationally natural logarithmic controller is designed to achieve joint position and velocity tracking of a desired trajectory of a reaching motion profile with prescribed performance (PP) bounds. Simulations of a three-degree-of-freedom spatial manipulator with the PP controller confirm the conclusions even in case of typical input disturbances. Results show that the PP controller outperforms the traditional position and derivative (PD) trajectory tracking controller without requiring excessive control effort. The proposed controller that uses sole velocity feedback achieves the control objective with bell-shaped joint velocity profiles and joint consistency. Thus, the proposed controller outperforms the traditional PD trajectory tracking controller that uses position and velocity feedback with comparable control effort. The experiment with a KURA robot manipulator demonstrates that the control algorithm of sole velocity feedback can be used to achieve smooth reaching movements within a short travelling time of less than 1 s. The movements are characterised by bell-shaped joint velocity profiles and joint position consistency similar to human movements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
690,"As an engineering software for calculating the aerodynamic parameters of aircraft, Missile DATCOM is widely used in the design and demonstration stage of aircraft research. In this paper, a 2-dimensional (2D) trajectory correction projectile is taken as the research object, and the DATCOM calculation accuracy is analyzed. The results show that in the software parameter setting, although method 1 describes the body is not accurate enough, its own geometry generators can accurately describe the body contour. The aerodynamic parameters calculated by this method are more accurate than method 2. The aerodynamic parameters of the 2D trajectory correction projectile calculated by DATCOM have a large system error compared with the wind tunnel test data. This paper proposes a system error compensation method (SECM) to compensate the calculated data, which can greatly reduce the system error. After the error compensation correction, the axial force coefficient (C-A) error is reduced to less than 3%, and the normal force coefficient (C-N) error and the pressure center position (XCP) error are generally reduced to within 10% and 5%, when the sideslip angle is 0 degrees. When the sideslip angle is less than 4 degrees, the C-A error is less than 5%, and when the sideslip angle (beta) is less than 1 degrees, the main data error of C-N is less than 15%, and the main data error of XCP is less than 25% These errors meet the engineering calculation accuracy requirements. This method cannot completely replace wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation calculations, but it can greatly reduce the number of wind tunnel tests and the CFD simulations, and has strong application value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in hostile environments where node connectivity is severely compromised, the system performance can be greatly affected. In this work, we consider such a hostile environment where sensor nodes cannot directly communicate to some neighboring nodes. Building on this, we propose a distributed data gathering scheme where data packets are stored in different nodes throughout the network instead to considering a single sink node. As such, if nodes are destroyed or damaged, some information can still be retrieved. To evaluate the performance of the system, we consider the properties of different graphs that describe the connections among nodes. It is shown that the degree distribution of the graph has an important impact on the performance of the system.

Unlike the traditional state observer that is usually designed for the whole state once and for all, this article partitions the whole state into two parts: one is independent of the input and the uncertainty, and the other is not. Following some unique matrix transformations, an observer of the former part is first developed, based on which observers of the latter part and the uncertainty are derived. Using the observers, a controller that guarantees an asymptotically stable closed-loop control system is proposed.

706,"This article thoroughly investigates a novel modified biquad dipole antenna with a simple structure, wideband, high-gain and linear polarization key features for wireless communication systems fabricated on FR4 substrate. The proposed antenna is investigated using circular wire loop antenna designing and is, then, extended to a strip structure antenna. Here, a circular reflector is employed to achieve maximum gain, while a coax line feeds the dipole element. Additionally, the presence of a balun, or lack thereof, is examined. The bazooka balun balances the coaxial cable and increases the bandwidth. Consequently, a wide bandwidth and a triple bandwidth are achieved. The resulting parameters demonstrate that the entire S, partial L and C IEEE radio bands comprise the bandwidth of the proposed antenna. The simulated current distribution, experimented and simulated efficiency, radiation pattern, reflection coefficient and gain of the designed antenna are also examined. The simulation and experimentation results exhibit an impedance bandwidth of 105.4% (1.3-4.2 GHz) for (S-11 < -10 dB). The broadside radiation pattern fills the entire band with maximum simulated and measured gains of 11.8 and 11.02 dBi, respectively. The simulated and measured results tie in closely with each other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
707,"In this study, the stress state of a polygonal plate having a central circular hole with two linear cracks was considered. External forces were applied to the contours of polygonal plate and internal forces were applied to the contours of the circular hole. Conformal mapping function, initially developed by Kuliyev, was used to the make stress analysis of the polygonal plate in physical non-linear statement. As a result, stress concentrations were determined by using conformal mapping function at the end points of cracks. Critical loads where fracture began were defined for different loads. Analytical results of solutions were compared and found to be in agreement with the numerical results in the literature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
708,"Tissue texture reflects the spatial distribution of contrasts of image voxel gray levels, i.e., the tissue heterogeneity, and has been recognized as important biomarkers in various clinical tasks. Spectral computed tomography (CT) is believed to be able to enrich tissue texture by providing different voxel contrast images using different X-ray energies. Therefore, this paper aims to address two related issues for clinical usage of spectral CT, especially the photon counting CT (PCCT): (1) texture enhancement by spectral CT image reconstruction, and (2) spectral energy enriched tissue texture for improved lesion classification. For issue (1), we recently proposed a tissue-specific texture prior in addition to low rank prior for the individual energy-channel low-count image reconstruction problems in PCCT under the Bayesian theory. Reconstruction results showed the proposed method outperforms existing methods of total variation (TV), low-rank TV and tensor dictionary learning in terms of not only preserving texture features but also suppressing image noise. For issue (2), this paper will investigate three models to incorporate the enriched texture by PCCT in accordance with three types of inputs: one is the spectral images, another is the co-occurrence matrices (CMs) extracted from the spectral images, and the third one is the Haralick features (HF) extracted from the CMs. Studies were performed on simulated photon counting data by introducing attenuation-energy response curve to the traditional CT images from energy integration detectors. Classification results showed the spectral CT enriched texture model can improve the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score by 7.3%, 0.42% and 3.0% for the spectral images, CMs and HFs respectively on the five-energy spectral data over the original single energy data only. The CM- and HF-inputs can achieve the best AUC of 0.934 and 0.927. This texture themed study shows the insight that incorporating clinical important prior information, e.g., tissue texture in this paper, into the medical imaging, such as the upstream image reconstruction, the downstream diagnosis, and so on, can benefit the clinical tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

712,"Purpose This paper aims to study frictional characteristics of thin-walled tubes in the liquid impact forming (LIF) process. Design/methodology/approach LIF experiments under various impacting velocities were performed on SUS304 stainless steel tubes with various guiding lengths on a custom-designed measurement system to investigate the effects of impacting velocity and guiding length on the coefficient of friction (COF) in the guiding zone. Findings The results indicate that the COF changes dynamically in the guiding zone and decreases with the deformation process. The reduction range of the COF is wider in LIF than in both the conventional and pulsating hydroforming (THF), which may be contributed to the impacting velocities in a short time. Moreover, the COF decreases faster in the first half of the LIF process than in the second half. Under different impacting velocities and guiding lengths, the decreasing rate of the COF in the first half is more sensitive and obvious than that in the second half. Originality/value A method for determining the COF in the guiding zone in LIF is proposed and the frictional characteristics in LIF are studied. Comparing the COF of tubes in conventional THF, pulsating THF and the LIF process is valuable for improving and predicting the tubular formability in various hydraulic environments for industrial production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
713,"Clustering analysis is an important and difficult task in data mining and big data analysis. Although being a widely used clustering analysis technique, variable clustering did not get enough attention in previous studies. Inspired by the metaheuristic optimization techniques developed for clustering data items, we try to overcome the main shortcoming of k-means-based variable clustering algorithm, which is being sensitive to initial centroids by introducing the metaheuristic optimization. A novel memetic algorithm named MCLPSO (Memetic Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization) based on CLPSO (Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization) has been studied under the framework of memetic computing in our previous work. In this work, MCLPSO is used as a metaheuristic approach to improve the k-means-based variable clustering algorithm by adjusting the initial centroids iteratively to maximize the homogeneity of the clustering results. In MCLPSO, a chaotic local search operator is used and a simulated annealing- (SA-) based local search strategy is developed by combining the cognition-only PSO model with SA. The adaptive memetic strategy can enable the stagnant particles which cannot be improved by the comprehensive learning strategy to escape from the local optima and enable some elite particles to give fine-grained local search around the promising regions. The experimental result demonstrates a good performance of MCLPSO in optimizing the variable clustering criterion on several datasets compared with the original variable clustering method. Finally, for practical use, we also developed a web-based interactive software platform for the proposed approach and give a practical case study-analyzing the performance of semiconductor manufacturing system to demonstrate the usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
714,"Software-defined networking (SDN) facilitates network programmability through a central controller. It dynamically modifies the network configuration to adapt to the changes in the network. In SDN, the controller updates the network configuration through flow updates, ie, installing the flow rules in network devices. However, during the network update, improper scheduling of flow updates can lead to a number of problems including overflowing of the switch flow table memory and the link bandwidth. Another challenge is minimizing the network update completion time during large-network updates triggered by events such as traffic engineering path updates. The existing centralized approaches do not search the solution space for flow update schedules with optimal completion time. We proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm-based flow update scheduling method (the GA-Flow Scheduler). By searching the solution space, the GA-Flow Scheduler attempts to minimize the completion time of the network update without overflowing the flow table memory of the switches and the link bandwidth. It can be used in combination with other existing flow scheduling methods to improve the network performance and reduce the flow update completion time. In this paper, the GA-Flow Scheduler is combined with a stand-alone method called the three-step method. Through large-scale experiments, we show that the proposed hybrid approach could reduce the network update time and packet loss. It is concluded that the proposed GA-Flow Scheduler provides improved performance over the stand-alone three-step method. Also, it handles the above-mentioned network update problems in SDN.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
715,"BackgroundThe aim of the present study is to evaluate whether catheter-induced premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) produced at the presumptive ablation site may aid in the identification of the optimal timing of the earliest local activation for the successful ablation of clinical PVCs. MethodsSixty-three consecutive patients (35 males, age: 53.5 14.4 years) without any exclusion criteria who had undergone PVC ablation between 1 July 2018 and 1 July 2019 constituted our study population. The time interval between the beginning of the EGM and the beginning of the QRS of each catheter-induced PVC (Cath EGM-ECG) and the time interval between the beginning of the EGM of clinical PVCs at the earliest site and the beginning of the QRS of clinical PVCs (PVC earliest EGM-ECG) were noted for each patient. The value of Cath EGM-ECG as a reference for procedural success of ablation was evaluated by examining the relationship between Cath EGM-ECG and PVC earliest EGM-ECG. ResultsFifty-two patients had successful ablation, and 43 of them (82.7%) had PVC earliest EGM-ECG values greater than or equal to Cath EGM-ECG. Eleven patients had procedural failure, and all of them had PVC earliest EGM-ECG values lower than Cath EGM-ECG. A PVC earliest EGM-ECG value -1.5 ms greater than Cath EGM-ECG predicted successful ablation with a sensitivity of 90.4% and a specificity of 100.0% in the general patient population. ConclusionCath EGM-ECG seems to serve as a reliable guide for finding the optimal timing of the earliest site for successful PVC ablation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant improvements in capillary rise were then observed after surface modification. The effects of gravity on the capillary rise were also investigated. In contrast to the constant vertical capillary rise for the hollow tubes, the experimental results show that the vertical capillary rise of the copper braids decreases with increasing inclined angles. The finite impregnation distances in the copper braids placed horizontally are also observed. A revised model is proposed to explain such characteristics of copper braids.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

718,"In this paper, a compact, wideband, and high-efficiency substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) feeding cavity-backed aperture-coupled magneto-electric (ME) dipole antenna element and its array are proposed. Firstly, an SIW cavity-backed and a modified bowtie dipole are designed for the antenna element which makes it possess a high gain and wide impedance bandwidth. The antenna element covers an impedance bandwidth of 66.3% from 10.7 to 21.3 GHz with a peak gain of 10.3 dBi. Secondly, a 4 x 4 array is designed using the proposed antenna element. And a full-corporate substrate integrated waveguide feeding network is introduced to excite the array elements for the antenna application with wide bandwidth and high efficiency. For validation, a prototype of 4 x 4 array is fabricated by standard printed circuit board (PCB) facilities and further measured. The measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth of the proposed 4 x 4 antenna array is 30% (12.75-17.25 GHz) with its gain being 18.2-20.9 dBi within the entire band.

719,"The conventional model of disjunctive group testing assumes that there are several defective elements (or defectives) among a large population, and a group test yields the positive response if and only if the testing group contains at least one defective element. The basic problem is to find all defectives using a minimal possible number of group tests. However, when the number of defectives is unknown there arises an additional problem, namely: how to estimate the random number of defective elements. In this paper, we concentrate on testing the hypothesis H-0: the number of defectives <= s(1) against the alternative hypothesis H-1: the number of defectives >= s(2). We introduce a new decoding algorithm based on the comparison of the number of tests having positive responses with an appropriate fixed threshold. For some asymptotic regimes on s(1) and s(2), the proposed algorithm is shown to be order-optimal. Additionally, our simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed algorithm such as low complexity and a small error probability compared with known algorithms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

721,"Groundwood pulping is an industrial process with a high energy demand, although only a minor part of the energy is used for actually separating the fibres and the rest for working them. Traditionally, the separation process employs a grinding stone having particles embedded in a softer matrix. The position and distribution of the particles have been random, causing their interaction with the wood to also be random. This makes studies of the mechanisms during the separation process difficult. Knowledge of the mechanisms in the separation process helps when designing future tools aimed at energy efficiency or tailored fibre properties. Recently, grinding surfaces having diamond particles brazed to a steel backing at fixed positions have been developed and commercialised. In this work, individual particles are not positioned at the tool surfaces. Instead, well-defined structured diamond films, soldered to a backing, are used as grinding tools. The grinding asperities of such films can be tailored to shapes that are not possible to achieve by using particles. Using this kind of tool in a lab scale grinding equipment, confirms the well-known fact that increased load or increased temperature both lead to lower energy consumption for fibre separation and longer, less damaged fibres.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

723,"ZnO:Ni thin films with Ni content of 0, 3, 5 and 7% were deposited onto ITO/glass substrates using the spin coating method. The deposited films were characterized for their structural, photoluminescence and electrical properties by respectively X ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and the four points probe techniques. XRD patterns showed that the deposited films were polycrystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The absence of the Ni related diffraction peaks reflected the substitution of Zn atoms by Ni atoms in the ZnO lattice. The variation of both lattice parameters and crystallite size, as a function of Ni content, indicated that the Ni doping enhance the structural properties of the deposited films. In Raman spectra, the band at 667.9 cm(-1) appeared for doped samples, was attributed to the Zn sites occupied by Ni atoms in the ZnO lattice. In PL spectra, the decrease of the UV band emission intensity, as a function of Ni content, was attributed to Ni ions doping. The concentration of deep level defect such as Zn-i,V-zn and V-o, decreased as a function of the Ni content. The electrical resistivity increase correlated with the increase of the of Ni3+-related impurity concentration which behaves as a source of free electrons for n-type conduction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
724,"With the number of nodes increasing in scale, the requirements of storage space enlarge sharply in distributed storage systems. Failure-tolerance schemes such as Reed-Solomon codes (RS codes in short) and Cauchy Reed-Solomon codes (CRS codes in short) are used to save storage space. However, these failure-tolerance schemes severely degrade the system performance. In this paper, we propose optimal RS codes (OptRS codes in short) based on RS codes and CRS codes that can offer better performance for encoding and decoding as well as maximizing the utilization of storage space. OptRS codes can speed up the matrix computation which is regarded as the most important factor to impact the efficiency of coding by transferring the matrix computation from the Galois field mapping to the XOR operation. OptRS codes employ an algorithm called row elimination scheme (RE scheme in short), which can eliminate the same XOR operation to minimize the number of XOR operations. We analyze optimal matrices (OM in short) in theory, which prove the optimal performance of OptRS codes over the Galois field. Our method is implemented on the top of the distributed storage system, and code parameters were carefully chosen. The test result shows that OptRS codes can improve the performance in different data block numbers, parity block numbers, block size, normal reading, and degraded reading, compared with RS codes and CRS codes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
725,"Air source water chiller (ASWC) (8-90 kW) performance test rooms are expected to be built to manipulate the interior air field only within the prescribed range. The internal air flow field of the test room for ASWC is determined by air supply from the air outlets.

High similarity is found between calculation results and experimental verification thereafter in most of the models. Based on calculation and experiment results, an integrated index is proposed to evaluate the performance of the air supply duct for ASWC test room by taking the air uniformity index, the pressure drop index and the economic index into consideration. Results show that the air supply duct with the 60 degrees slope works best for a satisfying performance in regular application, and that with equal air flow continuous slope is an inferior option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The statistical matching problem is one of those cases. The statistical matching problem has been recently studied also inside a misclassification setting. To proceed with a correction in such a framework, if marginal assessments on the conditioning event are wanted to remain fixed, the only possible solutions are the closest Frechet-Hoeffding bounds for the misclassification probabilities. On the contrary, if also the marginal probabilities are allowed to be modified, the -based procedure can be applied by a straightforward translation in an MIP problem. Such procedure is applied to a healthcare expenditures and health conditions data example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
727,"Image style transferring is a process of generating an output image in a target style from a given pair of content and target style images. Recently, a simple linear interpolation technique in encoded feature space has been employed in this process to generate output images of intermediate style because controlling the strength of style transferring effect is a key function of an image editing filter. However, this simple technique is effective in generating images of around full style but around zero style hence it cannot smoothly control the style transferring effect from an original content image to a fully stylised image. In this Letter, the authors tackle the missing work on style-strength control from content reconstruction to full style generation. To deal with this problem, they propose to use additional unbiased training data and losses for a style transfer network to learn an unbiased regression between output style strength and style control parameter. Experimental results verified that the proposed method achieved a full range of style-strength control from zero style to full style with no additive complexity in image generating process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Invasive and noninvasive methods are used to measure the pathogenicity of the liver. In this study, ultrasonographic images, clinical findings, and laboratory findings are used to determine the stages of CHD. The stages of CHD are (a) chronic hepatitis, (b) compensated cirrhosis, and (c) decompensate cirrhosis. The histopathological analysis is adopted by the invasive method to conduct a liver biopsy. Results of liver biopsy have shown some kind of complications such as pain after liver biopsy, pneumothorax, bleeding, or puncture of the biliary tree and rarely death due to heavy bleeding. In such situations, noninvasive procedures are used as an alternative for liver biopsy. In this study, Hough-based histogram-oriented gradient features are extracted and classified using combined multi-support vector machine and hidden Markov model classifiers. A large number of feature models containing 42 chronic hepatitis, 49 compensated cirrhosis, and 47 decompensate cirrhosis were selected specifically for the experimental study.

729,"Wheelset bearings are crucial mechanical components of high-speed trains. Wheelset-bearing fault detection is of great significance to ensure the safety of high-speed train service. Convolution sparse representations (CSRs) provide an excellent framework for extracting impulse responses induced by bearing faults. However, the performance of CSR on extracting impulse responses is fairly sensitive to inappropriate selection of method-related parameters, and a convolution model for representing the impulse responses has not been discussed. In view of these two unsolved problems, a convolutional representation model of the impulse response series is developed. A novel fault detection method, named adaptive CSR (ACSR), is then proposed based on combinations of CSR and methods for estimating three parameters related to CSR. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed ACSR method is validated via simulation, bench testing, and a real-life running test employing a high-speed train.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
730,"Cross-modal hashing (CMH) has received widespread attention due to high retrieval efficiency, which plays an extremely important role in cross-modal retrieval. Recently, many CMH methods have been proposed to establish the semantic connection of different modalities. However, most of these methods only use a simple quantisation strategy, resulting in large quantisation error, and inferior hash codes. To address this issue, in this study, the authors propose a novel self-taught CMH (STCMH) to minimise the semantic encoding loss. In particular, the common semantic representations across different modalities are first learnt based on collective matrix factorisation. Then, the quantisation procedure based on orthogonal transformation is integrated to encode the semantic representations into discriminative binary codes. Moreover, similarity preservation is imposed to further boost the discriminative power. Finally, hashing functions learning is formulated as a binary classification problem by self-taught scheme. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that STCMH significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art CMH methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simulation of the load with the use of a special force vector that reflects the nature of its variation is proposed. The components of the force vector (averaged values of partial derivatives of the load with respect to time and spatial coordinate) are calculated from the working information which the control system receives at previous moments of displacement of the control object. The order of the model is the maximumorder of the derivatives included in the model. The general structure and derivation of formulas for models of zero, first and second order are given. The practical case of measurement of the angular displacement of a shaft using incremental encoders is given separately. Initially, direct load models are considered in which time is the independent variable. Then, for a drive with incremental encoders, inverse models are presented separately in which the angle of rotation of the output shaft is the independent coordinate. Conditions under which the adequacy of the parameters of the power vector and the redundancy and insufficiency of the order of the control model is estimated are considered separately. Based on these conditions, a general algorithm for the functioning of the control system by means of which both the parameters and the structure of the control system may be dynamically changed is given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
732,"The presence of noise is generally believed to suppress the actual signal, and subsequently, deteriorate the quality of the signal or image. However, this study counter argues, and proposes a novel technique of enhancing variably illuminated document images through the addition of external noise, using the famous physical phenomenon of stochastic resonance. Here, the fundamental relationship between inherent parameters of a dark and low contrast image, and the intensity of external noise-induced to produce best contrast enhancement is systematically modelled using regression line parameters. With this, the amount of noise to be added is automatically predicted, and is utilised to enhance the dark and low contrast document images. The proposed enhancement technique using noise-induced (non-dynamic) stochastic resonance is computationally very efficient, unlike the existing methods which estimate the optimum value of noise to be added through a time-consuming iterative method. The efficacy of the developed technique is demonstrated through experimental results. Overall, a mathematical model for predicting the optimum noise standard deviation (NSD), and subsequently three variants of image enhancement algorithms based on global-NSD, partition-NSD and mask-NSD are the major contributions reported in this research work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But this characteristic is difficult to simulate by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, not only due to the graphene's thin layer which confines the time step size, but also because of graphene's isotropic surface conductivity when it is biased by static magnetic field. To solve this problem, this study presents an anisotropic hybrid implicit-explicit FDTD method. This method uses auxiliary difference equations to represent graphene's conductivity, and removes the confinement of graphene's thickness on time step size by using hybrid implicit-explicit technique. So, compared with FDTD method, the presented method can save a large number of computational time, which are validated by numerical examples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

741,"In this article, we propose a one-dimensional positioning technique using hybrid inductively-capacitively coupled parallel line feeder, suitable for indoor industrial applications. The proposed system enables a tag to detect its own position by sensing the standing wave pattern along the elongated feeder. If the tag measures only the magnetic field via inductive coupling, the detectable range of this approach is limited to approximately a quarter wavelength as the magnetic field strength repeats beyond this distance. To increase the detectable range, we use a special coupler to observe the standing wave patterns of both electric and magnetic fields and compare them with the reference patterns. Simulation and experiment results show that our method is capable of positioning in approximately a half wavelength. (c) 2019 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

743,"The 'coal to electricity' carried out by the grid company has had poor economic performance during its life cycle. This paper aims to investigate the economic impact of the package deal of off-peak electricity transaction mode (POP) on the 'coal-to-electricity' project in comparison with peak and valley electricity price (PVP). The incremental net present value and the incremental benefit-cost ratio are selected as the main economical evaluating indicators. Taking a coal-to-electricity project in a region of Beijing, China, as an example to study the economic benefit of the grid company in POP. The results indicate that the economic benefit of the grid company is increased by 48% in POP compared to that in PVP. The incremental benefit-cost ratio is less than 1, which demonstrates that POP is conducive to improving the current loss status of the grid company. It is helpful to raise the grid company's enthusiasm for conducting the coal-to-electricity project. Finally, corresponding suggestions are put forward to help the grid company in improving the negative economic benefit.

The five-port integrated antenna system consists of one ultrawideband antenna and four narrowband antennas. The ultrawideband antenna is used for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio, whereas the four narrowband antennas are used for communication. In order to validate functionalities of the antennas, their spectrum sensing and communication performance is verified using an arbitrary waveform generator, real-time signal analyzer, and Universal Software Radio Peripheral. The ultrawideband antenna is able to sense the various frequencies transmitted by the arbitrary waveform generator. These transmitted signals from the arbitrary waveform generator are treated as busy spectrum channels in the cognitive radio environment. The narrowband antennas are able to perform communication by transmitting the signals at identified spectrum holes.

Two most common mechanisms, namely, superheating of interphase boundary and critical bubble size, are chosen as atomization criteria. Two mathematical models, one based on solution of heat conduction equation and the other on VOF, are presented. The studied drops contain rapeseed oil and aqueous suspension of graphite. Experiments were conducted to determine the time lag of atomization of moving two-liquid unmixed drops under high-temperature heating. The theoretical and experimental atomization time lag values are found to be in satisfactory agreement.

Such environments in general have adverse effects on team performance. To mitigate this problem and increase the performance and resilience of teams, we developed the Collective Allostatic Load Measures system. Collective Allostatic Load Measures system collects, aggregates, and analyzes multimodal data, and provides recommendation and intervention mechanisms under acute and chronic stressors. The key innovation in Collective Allostatic Load Measures is the integration of multimodal sensing capabilities with accurate algorithms that can process sequential multimodal data from heterogeneous sensors.

752,"The impact of different sheared velocity profiles on the performance prediction of a horizontal axis wind turbine in the atmospheric boundary layer is investigated. Firstly, the wall roughness in the analytical logarithmic description of the atmospheric boundary layer is varied to obtain different velocity profiles. Subsequently, it is proposed to replace the analytical logarithmic description of the atmospheric boundary layer by the time-averaged velocity data of a precursor large eddy simulation (LES) and to reconstruct the turbulence of the velocity fluctuations. The LES data are introduced as inflow condition through a LES-RANS interface in a one-way coupling approach. Three different methods to reconstruct URANS turbulence values out of the velocity fluctuations are investigated. It is shown that the reconstruction method has an impact on the development of the velocity profile, turbulent kinetic energy, and the turbulent dissipation during the transport through the URANS domain. The different inflow data, which the horizontal axis wind turbine experiences, are responsible for changes in the overall rotor thrust (up to 2.7%) and rotor torque (up to 2.4%). Conversely, the induction factors and effective angles of attack hardly change and can well be compared with a blade element momentum method. Finally, the results of both approaches to prescribe the atmospheric boundary layer are compared. The thrust and power coefficients, and wake recovery are close to each other.

754,"Background The purpose of this study was to provide detailed topography of the left atrial medial isthmus (situated between the right inferior pulmonary vein ostium and the medial part of the mitral annulus). Methods Two hundred human hearts (Caucasian, 22.5% females, 48.7 +/- 4.9 years old) were investigated. Results The mean length of the medial isthmus was 42.4 +/- 8.6 mm. Additionally, the medial isthmus line was divided by the oval fossa into three sections with equal mean lengths (upper: 14.2 +/- 7.2 vs middle: 14.1 +/- 6.1 vs lower: 14.9 +/- 4.6 mm; P > .05). The left upper section of the atrial wall was thinner than the lower section (2.5 +/- 1.1 vs 3.4 +/- 1.6 mm; P < .0001). This study noted three separate spatial arrangements of the isthmus line. Type I (54.5%) had an oval fossa located outside the isthmus line; type II (32.5%) had an oval fossa crossed by the isthmus line, and type III (13.0%) had an oval fossa rim located tangentially to the isthmus line. In 68.5% of the examined specimens, the isthmus area had a smooth surface. Conversely, the remaining 31.5% had additional structures within its borders such as diverticula, recesses, and tissue bridges. Conclusion This study is the first to describe the morphometric and topographical features of the left atrial medial isthmus. Interventions within the medial isthmus line should be performed cautiously, especially when they are transected by the oval fossa (32.5%). Careful navigation of the area is also recommended due to the possibility of existent additional structures. The latter could lead to catheter entrapment during ablation procedures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

758,"This paper presents a folded nonlinear electro-magneto-mechanical (EMM) vibration-based piezoelectric energy harvester system, which is built on the cantilevered beam structure and consists of one host beam and two substrate plates. The performance of the linearity and nonlinearity to the proposed EMM system is evaluated and compared. Moreover, the voltage response in time history and the phase portrait are studied under an external rectifier circuit with a resistor. The results show that the nonlinearity of the reported EMM system changes the coherent resonance vibration mode from single to double under a harmonic base excitation within the frequency range of 20 Hz-50 Hz. Meanwhile, the substrate plate D contributes more averaged voltage output at a lower frequency while the substrate plate A contributes the voltage output at the relatively higher frequency for the nonlinear EMM system. The experimental study indicates that the proposed nonlinear EMM vibration-based piezoelectric energy harvester can yield a total voltage of 8.133 V@35.53 Hz while the baseline structure only produces 1.724 V@38.81 Hz. In addition, the bandwidth range of high-power output is enlarged by the nonlinear EMM system, which makes this device more flexible and applicable to absorb the wasted vibration energy generated by industrial machines and public facilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

760,"The impedance matrix of an arbitrary multiport array antenna with Ohmic losses was studied. It was assumed that the partial current distributions in the array, corresponding to the alternate exciting one of its terminals while the other ones are open-circuited, are known. Consideration of the power balance in the lossy array antenna has allowed ascertaining that its impedance matrix is a sum of the radiation resistance matrix and loss resistance matrix, which are in general case complex Hermitian matrices and only in some particular cases can be real. The theoretical statements obtained are confirmed by two numerical examples, where analysis of two lossy dipole arrays was performed. In the first example, the dipoles were located above the imperfect ground, which served as a source of losses, and in the second example, the same dipoles were located in free space, and the embedded parasitic element was the source of losses. The results of the analysis showed that the asymmetric placement of energy absorbers in the array antennas leads to the appearance of imaginary parts in the matrices of radiation and loss resistances, which allow one to correctly predict the behavior of the array radiation efficiency during beam scanning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The circuit topology and SISL technology are combined together to reach balance in performances such as compact size, wideband, high frequency selectivity, low loss, good in-band isolation, wide stopband, and self-packaging so that there are no obvious flaws. Wide bandwidth and two near-band transmission zeros are contributed by the proposed circuit topology. Good isolation can be obtained by comparing different coupling schemes with one resistor. An additional transmission zero for extending the upper stopband can be achieved by the two closely placed stubs without increasing the size of the design.

Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal robotic grinding path search algorithm based on the recursive method.

First, the position adjustment formula of the tool coordinate system is proposed, and a coordinate plane is established to describe the grinding path of the robot based on the position adjustment formula. Second, the ordinate value of this coordinate plane is dispersed to obtain the search field of the optimal robotic grinding path search algorithm.

However, solving a full set of CMC equations is a time-consuming process. The Tabulated Premixed CMC (TPCMC) model is a modification of the premixed CMC model that seeks to reduce the time consumed in solving equations by making the premixed CMC model amenable to the tabulation of chemistry. TPCMC model considers the effect of small scale mixing of reactants and products using the scalar dissipation rate and effect of large scale turbulence on the flame using the beta probability density function. The validation of TPCMC model using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data has been attempted in this paper. DNS of growth of an ignition kernel in a turbulent medium was performed for this purpose. Two sets of simulations, namely 3D DNS with three-step reduced chemistry and 2D DNS with multi-step chemistry, have been carried out in this study using PENCIL code. The Favre averaging of this DNS data was performed on the surfaces of constant radius to assess the accuracy of TPCMC model.

The thermal conductivity through the joint was investigated by using highly filled PP/graphite composite substrates, which were joined with an epoxy adhesive of different layer thicknesses. Similar measurements were carried out with a constant adhesive layer thickness, whilst applying an epoxy adhesive modified with expanded graphite (EG) (6, 10, and 20 wt%). By reducing the adhesive layer thickness or modifying the adhesive with conductive fillers, a significant increase of the thermal conductivity through the joint was achieved. The examination of the mechanical properties of the modified adhesives was carried out by tensile tests (adhesive only), lap-shear tests, and fracture energy tests (mode 1) with aluminium substrates. Modification of the adhesive with EG led to an increase of the tensile lap-shear strength and the adhesive fracture energy (mode 1) of the joint.

772,"When systems evolve, the maintainability and the complexity of the system increase, resulting in the poor antidesign patterns or antipatterns in software maintenance. Refactoring is an operation used to improve the structure of an existing system by changing its internal structure without affecting its external behavior. Many studies revealed that refactoring is underused by software development team in industry due to its increased effort and lack of knowledge about existing approaches. Thus, a prioritized correction of antipatterns based on relevance of classes, analyzed development history, risk to refactor, minimized code changes, and maintainers context and preferences is needed for good refactoring recommendations. We propose an approach based on filtered relevant classes with generic linkage-based clustering and adapted nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III to find good refactoring recommendations, which maximize the software quality and reduce the refactoring effort.

780,"Relay selection, also called opportunistic relay, is capable of fast narrowing the search scope, finding the optimal relays and achieving a better cooperative transmission. With the continuous expansion of network capacity, the coverage area and the participating relays, it is unwise to traverse all the nodes to select the best relay. An optimal scheme based on cognitive wireless multi-hop relay selection has been proposed in this study, in which a threshold value is set for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Only when the SINR exceeds the threshold can the node be selected as the relay node. Because of the random distribution and geographical universality of the relay, the candidate relays would better be limited within a particular area. Then a model based on stochastic geometry is established to rapidly find the relay which meets the demand near optimally, without needing of the global channel state information of the network in advance.

This process inherently works well at mid to high loads where the displacement ratio of the piston expander can be maximized and fully utilized, but the positive-displacement nature of piston compounding creates a liability in efficiency and exhaust gas temperature at low loads. This study examined the trade-offs in efficiency, exhaust temperature, and engine design for various methods of mitigating the low-load deficiencies of the piston-compounded design. An optimum solution was identified, and these results were then used to guide the design of an experimental piston-compounded engine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

784,"Inorganic macro cations (Na+, K+ and Ca+) co-exist in agricultural and municipal landfill sites. The retention behavior of these ions in different soils and combinations (binary and ternary system) has not been fully understood by previous studies. This study seeks to probe into the retention behavior of macro cations (Na+, K+, Ca+2) in six different soils under multiple combinations of ions solution. The retention of common ions was quantified by using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms. Na+ (single) pollutant-soil interaction was desorbed in most of the soils. The retention of K+ and Ca+2 was much greater than that of Na+. There is no definite trend for retention of Na+ in the presence of K+. For all soils, the retention results of K+ in the presence of Na+ decreased. Affinity for K+ was greater than that for Ca+2 in most of the soils. This study also demonstrated the affinity sequence of the ion retention for each soil and the percentage reduction of ions in competition with respect to single ions. Anomalous trends of the isotherm parameter fitting suggested the limitation of the mathematical models in predicting the experimental data. These results can be helpful in improving accuracy of fate prediction of pollutant fate and thus, design of waste containment facilities for various wastes that contains inorganic ions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

795,"Due to the superior anti-interception performance and inherent security features, the wide applications of frequency-hopping (FH) signals bring a great challenge to the reconnaissance and monitoring of FH emitters. This paper addresses the problem of positioning measurement estimation for unknown FH signals in passive localization, considering the range migration (RM) and Doppler frequency migration (DFM) of the maneuvering target within the observation time. A coherent range difference (RD), range rate difference (RRD) and acceleration difference (AD) estimation algorithm based on scaled Fourier transform and scaled non-uniform fast Fourier transform is proposed. This method can effectively remove RM and random DFM effects regardless of varied carrier frequency and achieve the coherent estimation of RD, RRD and AD. The whole estimation process can be easily implemented by complex multiplications combined with fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT operations without any brute-force searching procedure.

796,"Owning to the impressive performance and high speed of the correlation filter (CF) visual tracking technology, the CF-based tracking gets a significant amount of attentions and obtains a large number of researches. But the traditional CF-based trackers have two inherent issues needed to be solved. On the one hand, the boundary effect caused by the circulant structure will affect the performance. On the other hand, the target response is assumed as Gaussian response and the value is fixed. In order to deal with the boundary effect, a spatially regularized method by imposing space penalties to the spatial coefficients is proposed. About the fixed target response, some researchers propose a framework that can adaptively change the response to deal with it, but the two issues only be coped with separately. We propose a tracker that utilizes the two merits jointly to win a better performance and a more robustness model which can cope with the complex environment to achieve a long-term tracking. We use an iteration solution to solve the joint cost function and ADMM algorithm to solve temporal-spatial consistency problem which can obtain a global solution and fast computation.

At the beginning of the self-intellectual test, language proficiency has always been one of the key test subjects, and most of the intelligence tests also need to be tested by language and writing skills. Testing of English language proficiency is inseparable from the real language environment, but testing in a real environment is time-consuming and laborious. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a test method for rapid evaluation of English networks considering non-metric multidimensional scaling. This study aims to improve the platform test system of the current English network test by analyzing the algorithm characteristics of non-metric multidimensional scale and to optimize the existing English network fast test.

This work examined their degradation characteristics in a mixed culture system and also analyzed the microorganism community. After acclimation for 58 d and 43 d, the high removal efficiency of 100% of 2-FA and 95.3% of 3-FA was obtained by adding 25 mg L-1 of 2-FA or 3-FA to the two reactors, respectively. In addition, the high defluorination rates of 2-FA and 3-FA were observed to be 87.0% and 89.3%, respectively. The degradation kinetics showed that the maximum specific degradation rates of 2-FA and 3-FA were (21.23 +/- 0.91) mg FA (g center dot VSS center dot h)(-1), and (11.75 +/- 0.99) mg FA (g center dot VSS center dot h)(-1), respectively. PCR-DGGE analysis revealed that the unique bacteria degrading 2-FA were mainly composed of six genera (Novosphingobium, Bradyrhizobium, Aquaspirillum, Aminobacter, Ochrobactrum, and Labrys), and five genera that degraded 3-FA (Ochrobactrum, Aquaspirillum, Lachnobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, and Variovorax).

811,"A novel beamforming scheme based on non-cooperative game theory for multi-user multiple input multiple output cognitive radio network is proposed. In a cognitive network, the secondary transmitter is allowed to access the primary network spectrum when the interference to the primary network is below certain power threshold. While transmitting, the secondary user should cause minimal interference to primary user. So it is inevitable to use a transmit beamformer at the secondary user to focus the beam to desired receiver. A distributed iterative algorithm is formulated through non-cooperative game approach for optimizing the beamforming along with optimum power allocation by maximizing signal to interference ratio of secondary users. This is achieved by deriving an optimal pricing policy for each secondary user, which adapts to the strategies offered by rest of the users, which eventually converges the game into Nash equilibrium. Non-cooperative optimization of transmit power leads to maximization of signal to interference ratio. Subsequently, channel capacity maximization is achieved through water filling algorithm. Through simulations, the effectiveness of the game theory based algorithm is validated and impact of beamforming on signal to interference ratio and system capacity is discussed.

813,"In telecommunications engineering degrees, simulations are used to understand better theoretical concepts. However, in courses related to digital communications or signal processing usually these simulations cannot be easily applied to real data or in real scenarios. This limitation does not allow the students to verify that the learned theoretical hypotheses are valid in practice. Nowadays, software defined radio platforms have been proposed to validate theoretical telecommunications concepts in real situations. Therefore, by combining a software defined radio and simulation tools, students can implement the learned notions over real data in real scenarios. This allows students to work under real applications in order to learn by experience and to see that the theoretical concepts are valid in the real world. This paper presents a project involving real-time decoding of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) signals, implemented by using a universal software radio peripheral software defined radio and MATLAB (R). The universal software radio peripheral allows to receive real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals sent by the aircraft. Then, by using MATLAB (R) tools, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast baseband signals are decoded. The students are guided through a manual to demodulate the real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals and display in a map the aircraft trajectories. The evaluation is based on a competition between the students, considering execution time of their algorithms, and a final report of the project.

814,"The concept of wave-based control (WBC) has been around for about two decades. It is designed primarily for controlling the end-point motions of one-dimensional lumped mass flexible chains. The systems under consideration are, therefore, severely underactuated. Typical control objective for such systems is a point-to-point motion without unwanted residual oscillations. These oscillations, however, become troublesome especially for the lightly damped cases. The only way to attenuate them is to 'shape' the control input. For this WBC concept considers a set of hypothetical (forward and backward) motion waves, which combine to form the actual motions. This document critically investigates wonderful properties of WBC which are claimed over the years and presents a completely new mathematical and rigorous treatment of the method.

These models estimate the volumetric reversible heat generation and EMF of electrochemical reactions, within each electrode at local conditions of temperature and pressure, based on entropy change of half reactions. The resulting equations are thermodynamically consistent. They inherently obey the conservation of energy law as the electrochemical energy released added to the heat of reactions at each electrode equate the enthalpy change of the reacted species. The equations are implemented to model electrodes in a tubular micro- solid oxide fuel cell (T mu SOFC). The thermodynamic consistency of the model is numerically confirmed as the enthalpy of the reactants equates the electric energy released by the cell plus the sum of electrode heats plus electrolyte Ohmic heat.

First, combined with communication and control tasks, the key factors affecting synchronization performance of system are analyzed. Then, aiming at key factors and considering the synchronization of system bus, protocol conversion and task scheduling, a software synchronization method based on CANopen protocol and real-time Ethernet is proposed. Finally, the feasibility of this method is verified by establishing distributed motion control system and testing the synchronization performance of terminal control signals of slaves. Findings Based on this method, the results show that the synchronization accuracy for peripherals control of all slaves could be about 100 ns. Practical implications - This research provides high-precision synchronization method, which could lay a foundation for the application of distributed motion control system in the field of assembly automation, such as multi-axis assembly robots control. Originality/value In distributed motion control system, many factors affect the synchronization performance. At present, there is no synchronization method that could comprehensively consider these factors. This paper not only analyzes the key factors influencing the synchronization performance of system but also proposes a synchronization method. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper has certain theoretical value and engineering significance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The balances are extended for the common three-stage gas permeation process for the upgrading of biogas. The solution is calculated with MATLAB's BVP4C boundary value solver. The process is optimized by means of the FMINCON SQP-algorithm towards lowest power consumption.

822,"Unlike other satellite navigation systems such as GPS (Global Positioning System), the BeiDou satellite navigation system broadcasts RDSS (Radio Determination Satellite Service) and RNSS (Radio Navigation Satellite Service) signals simultaneously on its GEO (geostationary earth orbit) satellites and provides related navigation services. This paper studies the method of using the RDSS and RNSS signals of BeiDou to achieve accurate frequency and time transmission. We analyze the generation mechanism of RDSS signal and RNSS signal of BeiDou GEO satellite, establish a mathematical model of RDSS and RNSS signal frequency transfer, and derive an equation based on BeiDou's RDSS and RNSS signals for accurate frequency and time transmission. We also verified the relevant performance of the method through computer simulation. The results show that the combination of RDSS and RNSS signals from the BeiDou satellite system provides a new solution for its application in precise time and frequency transmission. This method is different from other satellite navigation systems such as GPS and is unique to the BeiDou system, with high accuracy and low dependence on satellite orbit accuracy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
823,"An assisted method to segment Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slices is presented. The segmentation process, called shape-based segmentation, consists in three main steps: 1) to draw a series of closed curves at different slices that separates the abdominal structures of interest, 2) to generate a 3D model from the closed curves for each abdominal structure by using shape-based interpolation and 3) to apply a segmentation algorithm to define the adipose tissue. The 3D models considerably simplify the problem since the abdominal structures are separated, and in turn, this reduces the possibility of large segmentation errors. In addition, a fully automatic segmentation procedure was also implemented. Twenty slices of MRI at the abdominal region for each of twelve subjects were analysed. The results of the shape-based and automatic segmentation were compared with the expert segmentation carried out in the slice located at the umbilicus level. Correlation Coefficient (CC) and volume error (VE) were used as performance measures. The comparison between the expert and shape-based segmentation for SAT yielded results of CC= 0.974 and VE=-0.01 +/- 5.8 cm(3), while for VAT the performance indexes were CC= 0.993 and VE= 0.9 +/- 1.8 cm(3). The results suggest that the shape-based segmentation provides an accurate and simple assessment of the abdominal adiposity with minimal human intervention and it could be used as a simple tool in clinics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
824,"The safety of trains, a highly efficient mode of transportation, has attracted significant attention. In the vehicle structure design of a train, the evaluation of the passenger evacuation time is necessary. The establishment of a simulation model is the fastest, most convenient, and practical way to achieve this goal. However, few scholars have focused on the reliability of a passenger train evacuation simulation model. This paper proposes a new validation method based on dynamic time warping and multidimensional scaling. The proposed method validates the dynamic process of a simulation model, provides statistical results, and can be used for small-sample scenarios such as a train evacuation scenario. The results of a case study indicate that the proposed method is an effective and quantitative approach to the validation of simulation models in a dynamic process. Thus, this paper describes the influence of the train structure size on an evacuation based on the results of simulation experiments. The structural size factors include the door width, aisle width, and seat pitch. The experiment results indicate that a wide aisle and reasonable seat pitch can promote a proper evacuation. In addition, a normal train door width has no effect on an evacuation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The river chosen is Paraiba do Sul because it flows through two important states in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and supplies water for several purposes, such as agriculture, drinking, energy, dissolution of domestic sewage, fishing, and so on. Through a single two-dimensional numerical simulation (Computational Fluid Mechanics-CFD) by commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics, it was possible to demonstrate how geometry of a river and tributaries' inflow rates changes the dispersion of pollutants along its course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
826,This paper considers the problem of identifying optimal Split-Plot Designs (SPDs) using traditional design criteria along with pure error degrees of freedom. An optimal SPD is of little use if it does not allow for suitable variance estimation of the whole plot and subplot variance components. The proposed approach incorporates a multi-criterion version of DP-optimality to represent the conflicting criteria involving the D-criterion and the replication at each design level. A set of Pareto optimal designs can then be obtained that consists of the optimal design with respect to each criterion and which cannot be dominated with respect to all the criteria. Key to this development is the notion of Orthogonal Subplot Designs (OSUBD) since this class of SPDs leads to a clear representation of DP-optimality. A number of common SPD design scenarios are provided to demonstrate the approach and to highlight the benefits of using the proposed multi-objective criterion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
827,"In this paper, we investigate the application of the direct Delta sigma receiver (DDSR) concept in a mixer-first architecture. Specifically, we analyze the degrading effects of quantization noise (Q(n)) upconversion on DDSR sensitivity, which is a major concern in mixer-first DDSR architecture. We demonstrate that with the chosen approach, the mixer-first architecture is suitable for the DDSR despite the potential challenges arising from Q(n) upconversion. A systematic modeling and understanding of Q(n) upconversion effects is presented, which lead to simple design guidelines. The results demonstrate that a first-order low-pass Q(n) filtering is sufficient in most cases for mixer-first DDSR implementations. Based on analytical results, we design a transistor-level mixer-first DDSR by merging the functionality of N-path capacitors both as channel select and Q(n) filters. Simulations performed in a 28-nm complementary metal-oxideUsemiconductor (CMOS) process show a mere 1.5-dB degradation from maximum signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) for the worst-case scenarios arising from Q(n) upconversion effects, validating the chosen approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
828,"In light of the situation of sliced or powdery cuttings produced by conventional PDC bit, it is found that they are not convenient for geological logging and stratification. The unit crushing experiment which contains two breaking forms (static-pressure breaking and impact) is conducted on core columns of sandstone, limestone, and granite. This experimental study showed the following: The breaking work ratio of the three core column types is much less than that of the flat rock. The height of the core column has little effect on the bit penetration rate, while core column diameter has greater effect on the bit penetration rate. The experimental results further indicate that a core column has been generated in the central area of the drill bit, which is beneficial to the volume breaking of the rock and can improve the rock-breaking efficiency of the drill bit. The microcoring bit is suitable for raising speed in soft, medium, and hard formations and is helpful for geological logging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
829,"Frontal offset crash test, either regulator or NCAP, only focus on evaluating the primary impact during the collision phase. The rebound phase is not counted in the assessment. This study focused on the rebound phase. In this phase, vehicle will rotate to the side, causing occupant's head move toward the window door glass. At an impact velocity from 6 m/s to 9 m/s against tempered glass windows, HIC values can stand over a limit of 1000. However, the severity of the head injury cannot be evaluated in the offset collision test because the window glass winded down for the high speed camera recording purpose. The analysis from the video shows head are moving towards the b pillar and side windows glass during frontal offset crash test. The resultant head rebound velocities varies in the range of 4.63 to 10.18 metre per second.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
830,"This study numerically and experimentally investigates the transient flow associated with a so-called Benjamin bubble, but, in contrast to previous studies, the approach permits bidirectional flow. Two experiments investigated the bidirectional propagation of an air cavity in a square tank; these two events were also simulated using a three-dimensional numerical model. An exactly conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme was employed to solve both the advection term in the momentum equation and the advection equation of the volume of fluid function. The model was compared with previous one-dimensional Benjamin bubble experimental data and a one-dimensional Boussinesq model. For the one-dimensional Benjamin bubble experiments, the three-dimensional model showed good agreement with both published data and a one-dimensional non-hydrostatic model. After modelling the advance of a one-dimensional cavity, a bidirectional Benjamin bubble was simulated using the three-dimensional model. The numerical results are in reasonable agreement with observations of the free surface and pressurized regions and reasonably predict the shape of the air-water interface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A software package for the generation and management of WAVs is illustrated. It is designed to support single-subject, multi-temporal and collective brain tumour studies. As seen in our experimental context, the combined use of WAVs and statistical parametric maps (SPMs) improves the quality of medical decisions before and after neurosurgical practice. Clustering techniques applied to WAVs can be efficiently analysed and optimised in an attempt to discover relevant properties of collective data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

833,"Hamstring tendon is one of the best graft choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The upper age limit of reconstruction is not determined because tenocytes from old individuals have less proliferative ability than young ones. Dexamethasone is commonly used to deal with musculoskeletal disorder with dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward tenocytes. Ascorbic acid is essential for tenocytes culture and collagen secretion and can alleviate the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone. In the current study, a microfluidic platform was used to screen the best dexamethasone and ascorbic acid combination treatment for tenocytes from young and old donors because it has been proven to provide a high throughput analysis platform. Comparison of their proliferation under three concentrations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone was performed. Tenocytes proliferation among young and old donors was also measured when exposed to nine combinations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone. The result confirmed the differences in cells proliferation when hamstring tenocytes from different ages of donors are exposed to different concentrations of dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. Tenocytes from old donors are not always more susceptible to dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. An optimal dose of ascorbic acid in decreasing the cytotoxic effect of dexamethasone can be screened by a high throughput microfluidic platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
834,"Network coding has been proposed to increase network throughput by combining packets at intermediate nodes. In this paper, we propose a joint throughput optimization method for a multirate multichannel multiradio wireless network with network coding. We propose algorithms for congestion control, joint distributed rate control, and heuristic resource allocation to solve the utility maximization problem in the wireless network environment with network coding. To minimize performance degradation generated by packet loss, we propose a congestion control algorithm. Furthermore, we present a sophisticated resource allocation algorithm which finds a node for the worst traffic jam and selects a session that needs to be first transferred in the node. Then, the node is allocated with the channels and radios for the packets of the selected session. Furthermore, a rate selection method is presented to determine the rate of each node. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves the optimal performance in a multirate multichannel multiradio wireless network.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
835,"A simple colloidal drop generally forms ring like patterns after drying. The deposition morphology of the dried drop changes significantly when such a drop dries in the vicinity of another similar drop. Here we present an observational study and statistical analysis of the patterns formed inside an isolated as well as interacting drops of gelatin containing sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). In all the cases, multiple concentric regions of solute particles combined with the polymer gel appear as the drops dry up. Needle crystals of sulfur and coacervates of salt and gelatin are visible in some regions. The outer region becomes non-uniform, so does the size distribution of the needle crystals and coacervates. The non-uniformity increases with proximity of the drops. Here we propose a novel mechanism of growing patterns inside the single drop during drying and correlate that with the results obtained for interacting drops. This study and the proposed mechanism provide insights into the future studies of drying drops under different physical conditions. Further we explore the statistical characteristics of the single and interacting drops using the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images. Next, we report fractal and image texture analyses along with object shape statistics of the drop FESEM images, under various experimental conditions. Several statistical hypothesis tests have been carried out to identify the most significant features. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
836,"In this paper we discuss the implementation of scaling functions and wavelets based on Generalized Sturmian Functions (GSF). When dealing with finite dimensional spaces, the completeness relation of the GSF basis generates localized functions in two coordinates. By fixing one of the coordinates on particular points one defines the corresponding scaling functions. Wavelets are defined in a similar way by fixing, on a complementary set of functions, one of the coordinates on another set of particular points. This procedure allows for a multiscale decomposition of any signal. When the chosen points are the zeros of the th GSF, scaling functions generate a -dimensional space and happen to be orthogonal. We use GSF associated to the classical damped harmonic oscillator to build scaling functions and wavelets, and apply them to represent eye-tracking signals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
837,"Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-based maxillary templates can transfer a surgical plan accurately only when the template is positioned correctly. Our study aimed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the CAD/CAM-based template for maxillary orthognathic surgery using dry skulls. After reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual skull model, a surface-based surgical template for Le Fort I osteotomy was designed and fabricated using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology. To determine accuracy, the deviation of the template between the planned and the actual position and the fitness of the template were evaluated. The mean deviation was 0.41 +/- 0.30 mm in the medio-lateral direction, 0.55 +/- 0.59 mm in the antero-posterior direction, and 0.69 +/- 0.59 mm in the supero-inferior direction. The root mean square deviation between the planned and the actual position of the template was 1.21 +/- 0.54 mm. With respect to the fitness of the template, the mean distance between the inner surface of the template and the underlying bone surface was 0.76 +/- 0.24 mm. CAD/CAM-based templates showed precise positioning and good fitness. These results suggest that surface topography-based CAD-CAM templates can be considered as an alternative solution in replacing the traditional intermediate splints for the transfer of surgical plans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
838,"Transparent electrodes are frequently used to drive opto-electronic devices, and the patterning of these electrodes is essential. The present work demonstrates a facile means of removing transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) from a glass substrate in selected areas. When agarose gel (agar), a material typically used in desserts, is sandwiched between two TCO-coated glass substrates and connected to a dry cell, the TCO is removed from the glass at the agar stamping area within 2 min. This method allows etching of TCOs using acid-free, inexpensive, and readily available starting materials. Analyses by optical microscopy, transmission spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that this etching occurs as a result of reduction of the TCO in conjunction with the electrolysis of water at the interface between the TCO and agar surfaces. Using this technique, high-throughput patterning of TCOs with an edge resolution of several micrometres was achieved. Furthermore, the shape of the agar template can be readily changed simply by cutting the agar using scissors. Therefore, this method provides a useful means for both researchers and students to easily fabricate patterned substrates for use in electronics and related technologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
839,"In this paper, we introduce a novel system for physics-based vehicle simulation from input trajectory. The proposed system approximates the physical movements of a real vehicle using a proportional derivative (PD) servo which estimates proper torques for wheels and controls a vehicle's acceleration based on the conditions of the given trajectory. To avoid expensive simulation calculation, the input trajectory is segmented and compared to the optimized trajectories stored in a path library. Based on the similarity of the curve shape between the input and simulated trajectories, an iterative search method is introduced to generate a physically derivable trajectory for convincing simulation results. For an interaction with other objects in the virtual environment, the surface of the vehicle is subdivided into several parts and deformed individually from external forces. As demonstrated in the experimental results, the proposed system can create diverse traffic scenes with multiple vehicles in a fully automated way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

841,"In the present study, a rigid pavement resting on extensible geosynthetic reinforced earth bed has been analysed. For the purpose, a simple model has been proposed which considered the rigid pavement as a plate resting on viscous medium. The subgrade soil has been idealized as a Kelvin-Voigt model and overlying granular fill layer as a Pasternak shear layer. Non-linear behaviour of the soil has been simulated by considering the hyperbolic stress displacement relationship. Geosynthetic layer, embedded into the granular fill layer, has been modelled as a rough, extensible elastic membrane. The compatibility of deformation at the interface of geosynthetic and the granular fill has been maintained. Tensile modulus of the geosynthetic layer has been considered in the analysis. The developed governing differential equations have been solved employing finite difference method adopting proper boundary and compatibility conditions. The simultaneous equations, so obtained, have been solved using LU decomposition method to evaluate the response of soil-foundation system by means of deflections in the pavement and the tension mobilized in geosynthetic layer. The results have been validated with the available studies and a detailed parametric study has then been conducted to study the influence of parameters like applied load intensity, flexural rigidity of plate, tensile modulus of geosynthetic layer, ultimate bearing resistance of soil on the response of soil-foundation system. All the results of parametric study have been presented in non-dimensional form so as to highlight the influence of above parameters on deflection and bending moment in the plate and tension mobilized in geosynthetic layer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
842,"In this study, a new approach was investigated to extract reference phases from the scanning acoustic microscope to calculate the speed of sound when dealing with the slope of the stage and fluctuation of the scanning lines. To capture the slope and the fluctuation pattern, data of the first lines along the horizontal and vertical axes on the stage were used. A corrective function was then utilized to improve the accuracy of reference phase extraction. The method was then corroborated by demonstrating tumor discrimination in mice skin by means of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). B16-F10 melanoma cells were used to grow the tumor. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was applied for histology characterization of the sample. A comparison of both acoustics and histology was conducted.

843,"The modular structure has a discontinuity owing to the joint between the modules; thus, structural behavior verification is required. In this study, the tensile behavior of a steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was evaluated in the joint of a modular flexural member. The modular specimen was fabricated with a 400 mm joint, and an integral specimen was fabricated with the same specifications as the modular specimen, without a joint. The largest crack width of the integral specimen was measured at the center of the beam, and that of the modular specimen was measured at the discontinuity interface. The maximum crack width of the modular specimen was greater than that of the integral specimen. The strain of the steel reinforcement was estimated using the measured crack width and six formulas for evaluating the crack width. The estimated strain of the modular specimen was higher than that of the integral specimen, and the deformation of the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was accelerated with the increasing load. Therefore, the tensile load was concentrated at the discontinuity interface in the modular specimen, and the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was likely to yield earlier than the integral specimen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
844,"The visual search performance of radiologists is systematically challenged due to the use of flat-panel displays when viewing multi-slice images. Three-dimensional visualization of information is expected to facilitate visual search for radiologists. However, as the differences in user performance, depending on radiologist experience, have not yet been assessed for real three-dimensional images, it is difficult to estimate the usability of new visualization systems for radiologists with different amounts of professional search experience. In this study, we aimed to determine how three-dimensional visual search is affected by radiologist experience and the physical properties of stimuli. Radiologists, residents, and medical students accomplished visual search tasks with varying set sizes and target-distractor similarities. Search items were presented on multiple display planes and image manipulation was conducted using a computer keyboard. We compared the search outcome and strategy among three groups of participants. All three groups submitted a similar number of correct responses depending on target-distractor similarity. However, in contrast to radiologists and residents, it took a considerably longer time for students to find the targets. The major differences were evident in search strategy when comparing the image manipulations of radiologists with those of residents and students. Our results demonstrated that experienced radiologists' search performance benefited from seeing the entire three-dimensional view of an image, whereas residents and students focused instead on reducing the amount of information and searched in a selective manner. These findings should be taken into account when planning the implementation of new workstations with three-dimensional visualization in radiology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

846,"Nanoscale CMOS technology has encountered severe reliability issues especially in on-chip memory. Conventional word-level error resilience techniques such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC) suffer from high physical overhead and inability to correct increasingly reported multiple bit flip errors. On the other hands, state-of-the-art applications such as image processing and machine learning loosen the requirement on the levels of data protection, which result in dedicated techniques of approximated fault tolerance. In this work, we introduce a novel error protection scheme for memory, based on feature extraction through Principal Component Analysis and the modular-wise technique to segment the data before PCA. The extracted features can be protected by replacing the fault vector with the averaged confinement vectors. This approach confines the errors with either single or multi-bit flips for generic data blocks, whilst achieving significant savings on execution time and memory usage compared to traditional ECC techniques. Experimental results of image processing demonstrate that the proposed technique results in a reconstructed image with PSNR over 30 dB, while robust against both single bit and multiple bit flip errors, with reduced memory storage to just 22.4% compared to the conventional ECC-based technique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
847,"The statistical properties of photon emission counting, especially the waiting time distributions (WTDs) and large deviation statistics, of a cavity coupled with the system of double quantum dots (DQDs) driven by an external microwave field were investigated with the particle-number-resolved master equation. The results show that the decay rate of the WTDs of the cavity for short and long time limits can be effectively tuned by the driving external field Rabi frequency, the frequency of the cavity photon, and the detuning between the microwave driving frequency and the energy-splitting of the DQDs. The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction. This also demonstrates that the effect of the DQDs can be replaced a thermal reservoir when the rate difference of a photon absorbed and emitted by DQDs is larger than zero; otherwise, it is irreplaceable. The results deepen our understanding of the statistical properties of photon emission counting. It has a promising application in the construction of nanostructured devices of photon emission on demand and of optoelectronic devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abstract The article presents the results of experimental and theoretical works aimed at determining the distribution of heat emitted by an obstacle lighting lamp. These kind of lamps are commonly applied as a warning for air traffic vehicles. There is a need for lighting devices with various intensities, whose application depends on the location and operating conditions. The overall aim of the author's work is to develop a computer model that would enable us to conduct research aimed at determining the optimal parameters of lamp operation without the need to build many physical models. Measurements of heat emitted by a currently manufactured lamp were made, and based on these, a numerical model of the lamp operating under laboratory conditions was developed. The considered lamp has two heat sources, one of which is light-emitting diodes (LEDs), while the other heat source consists of stabilizers and other elements of the lamp power supply system. After positive experimental verification of the numerical model, theoretical analyses of heat emission under various meteorological conditions were carried out, while the values of ambient temperature and airflow velocity were changed; then, the influence of these parameters on the temperature distribution on the surface of the lamp was determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

851,"composite concrete-steel plate shear walls are the most critical resisting structural members that resist lateral and axial loads. This type of wall consisting of two steel faceplates presenting the outer skin, infill concrete and shear connectors which are used to provide the composite action of the steel faceplates with infill concrete in order to increase the strength and to reduce the local buckling of steel faceplates. The experimental investigation of composite concrete - steel plate shear walls under axial loads is presented in this research. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of concrete compressive strength and the thickness of the wall on the axial capacity, lateral displacement and axial shortening of the walls. The obtained results indicate that the increase in compressive strength of concrete enhances the ultimate axial load capacity of the wall and it should have an effect on crushing strength of the composite wall which can affect the failure loads of the composite walls. In addition, the concrete strength increased by enlarging the thickness of wall from 55mm to 70mm and this is because the concrete participation leads to large assistance to avoid relatively steel plate from premature buckling as well as, the concrete plays an important role in avoiding instability of steel plate. Thus, the failure load, lateral displacement at top and mid-height of the wall as well as the axial shortening at failure load increased by increasing the compressive strength and increasing the wall thickness of the wall. The failure of the composite walls was started by local buckling of the steel plates, cracking and crushing of the concrete infill in the top region of the composite wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
852,"Additive Manufacturing (AM) achieves significant fabrication cost savings and, enables complex 4 eometries that are otherwise impossible to fabricate using conventional manufacturing processes. 3D-printed parts produced by Laser Power Bed Fusion (LPBF) may suffer from: (i) defects (invisible and visible), (ii) net-shape warpage, (iii) high residual stress, (iv) surface roughness and voids, (v) inconsistent density as a function of localized defects, (vi) anisotropic microstructure due to variable cooling rates and (vii) low through-the-thickness interlaminar strength.

853,"Partial discharge (PD) measurement is an essential to detect and diagnose the existence of the PD. However, this measurement has faced noise disturbance in industrial environments. Thus, PD analysis system using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) denoising technique via Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) software is proposed to distinguish noise from the measured PD signal. In this work, the performance of denoising process is analyzed based on calculated mean square error (MSE) and signal to noise ratio (SNR). The result is manipulated based on Haar, Daubechies, Coiflets, Symlets and Biorthogonal type of mother wavelet with different decomposition levels. From the SNR results, all types of the mother wavelet are suitable to be used in denoising technique since the value of SNR is in large positive value. Therefore, further studies were conducted and found out that db14, coif3, sym5 and bior5.5 wavelets with least MSE value are considered good to be used in the denoising technique. However, bior5.5 wavelet is proposed as the most optimum mother wavelet due to consistency of producing minimum value of MSE and followed by db14.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
854,"A pulse-resonance On-Off keying ultrasound communication microsystem is presented. It is a viable alternative to today's widely used RF technologies in order to avoid the associated health risks for a specific group of interest, namely babies. Special signal processing and circuit techniques are proposed to overcome drawbacks of classical ultrasound communications; such as echoes and excess ringing, achieving a measured communication range of 28m with a 50bit/is data rate and bit error rate (BER) of 0.01. Targeting a biomedical sensory pacifier, the proposed design needs to be insulated, small size, and low power. Utilizing a 40 kHz ultrasound transducer and a 5-pin low-power controller, a wirelessly-charged high-accuracy remote temperature sensor system with nominal average current consumption of 0.416 mu A is designed and tested. Multiple subsystems were merged in total volume of 12mm diameter and 15mm height, excluding the charging coil, which is designed as the pacifier's handler. Thanks to echo avoidance, ringing suppression, dynamic detection threshold adjustment techniques along with 3-bit preamble synchronization; the proposed low-power sub-sampling IQ demodulation of OOK bits results in high-sensitivity robust ultrasound communication system without any alignment requirement for the transducers. The lifetime of the sensor prototype with 8mAh LiR battery is about 27 months. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
855,"This article describes a device to seed solid micron-size particles into gases for particle-based laser diagnostic techniques. The particle seeder consists of a sealed vessel containing the particles, into which the gas to be seeded is introduced. Using an electric fan placed inside the vessel, a fine aerosol can be easily generated. It is demonstrated that (1) at a fixed fan speed the particle seeding density N-p can be kept within the range 10-100 particles mm(-3) across the gas volume flowrate range 0.05-5 LPM; and (2) at a fixed gas volume flowrate, the fan speed can be used for approximate adjustment of the particle seeding density in the range 1-100 particles mm(-3). The device does not affect the volume flowrate of the gas stream. This simple method should prove useful for researchers wishing to generate solid particle aerosols in low volume flowrate gas streams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Successive micro photographic images are recorded, then subsets of the images are column averaged and the resulting 1D profiles arc cross correlated. Factors that limit the correlation resolution are examined and methods for achieving millipixel level repeatability are discussed. Key to high resolution correlation of MEMS motion were low image noise and high stun of square of subset intensity gradients (SSSIG), a measure of image contrast. Using this correlation algorithm, the motion of MEMS thermal actuators was measured. Sub nm resolution was achieved using a wide range of image subsets, with measured standard deviations as low as 0.10nm (0.6 millipixels).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
858,"The present paper discusses efforts made to reinvent the use of the vertical-axis turbine for use in locations of low underwater current velocities. The present work targets the low flow current of the sub-Saharan ocean system, which has an underwater current record of around 0.3 m/s and a sea state that is mild, benign and with little or no local storms. The present initiative is achieved through a combination of ducting techniques to increase velocity of flow, and the utilisation of a large surface contact area exposed to flowing water per unit of time. Torque estimations are made using three methods: first principle, SolidWorks computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software and physical measurement. The lowest power coefficient for the tested model is computed from SolidWorks CFD software as 0.70. Existing state-of-the-art underwater current power technologies are reviewed and the present initiative described. A future for ocean water current technology in sub-Saharan Africa is also proposed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
859,"The purpose of this study is to enhance the performance of Multistream Fast Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keeping in view the recent web-based applications that are being deployed on long-range, high-speed, and high-bandwidth networks. To achieve the objective of the research study, a congestion control after fast-recovery module for congestion control scheme of Multistream Fast TCP is proposed. The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Consequently, Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP consumes the available network bandwidth in lesser time and increases the throughput and goodput. The proposed module enhanced the performance of the transport layer protocol. Our findings demonstrate the performance impact in the form of a decrease in the convergence time to consume the available network bandwidth and the increase in the throughput and the goodput.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
860,"In this study, a broadband high-power amplifier with resistive harmonic matching is introduced. The analytical formulations for the drain voltage, output power, optimum load resistance, and efficiency are derived for this type of amplifier under class-B bias conditions. The design is based on a linear model of a laterally diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor. In contrast to the conventional linear method that is based on an equivalent output circuit, the output matching circuit is designed in the presence of the dependent current source and intrinsic elements of the transistor. The design technique permits a broadband amplifier to be realised without load-pull measurement. The broadband power amplifier is intended for operation in the frequency range of 30-1000 MHz and covers the very high-frequency (HF) and ultra-HF bands. The power amplifier delivers 100 W to a 50 omega load with efficiencies of 38-56%. To validate the design concept, the measured performance of the power amplifier is compared with simulations that incorporate a non-linear model of the transistor. The power amplifier is not driven into saturation and exhibits 2nd and 3rd harmonics of <-20 and <-10 dBc, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
861,"In this paper, we report excellent stability and enhanced photo-catalytic activity of graphite oxide (rGO)/Fe3O4 nanocomposites (NCs) for the decomposition of organic dyes compared with pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and bulk Fe3O4 particles. The rGO/Fe3O4-NCs were prepared by the ultrasonic method at low temperature. Fe3O4 nanoparticles (similar to 10 nm) are well supported by rGO sheets as confirmed by electron microscopic studies. Powder X-ray diffraction, FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies confirm the formation of rGO/Fe3O4-NCs. BET surface area of rGO/Fe3O4-NCs was found to be similar to 160 m(2)/g, which is approximately three times higher than that of pure Fe3O4-NPs. The rGO/Fe3O4-NCs as photo-catalysts show excellent performance in the degradation of organic dye (similar to 94% in 80 min).

862,"Palm stearin has high biodegradability and produces low pollution to the environment. This oil can be improved based on its natural behaviour and can be used as an alternative to replace widely used commercial mineral oils. Thus, the negative impact towards the environment can be reduced. The purpose of this research is to study the performance of two type of lubricants which are vegetable oil (Palm Stearin) and commercial mineral engine oil (CMEO). The sample will be tested using pin on disc tribotester machine that follows ASTM G99 standard. The materials used for this experiment are pure aluminium pin (A110) with spherical head and stainless steel disc (SKD11) with four grooves. The experiment will take approximately one hour to complete one test. The conditions that were considered before the beginning of the experiment are constant loads of 1 kg, varying sliding speeds of 1.5 m/s to 3.5 m/s with incremental 1 m/s and 2.5 ml volume of oil. The wear rate and coefficient of friction can be determined in this experiment. From the result obtained, the coefficient of friction (COF) of palm stearin is 45% higher than CMEO and also the trend for both oils are inversely proportional with sliding speed. Besides that, the wear rate of palm stearin is also higher than CMEO, which shows that CMEO has better lubrication performance when compared to palm stearin. The additives are needed for palm stearin so that the lubrication performance can compete with the CMEO. Furthermore, the results also reveal that vegetable oil shows a potential to be a commercial lubricant when the deficiencies can be overcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
863,"In this study, the Cu-Lu2O3-Cu-Cu metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure was fabricated by electron beam evaporation method on the glass substrate with symmetric electrode configuration. The dominant conduction mechanism in fabricated MIM diode was analyzed using temperature dependent current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in temperature range 323-403 K. Schottky emission, Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) and Poole-Frankel (P-F) conduction mechanisms were tested by analyzing the I-V data according to these theories. P-F emission and Schottky emission conduction mechanisms were found to be dominant conduction mechanisms in low and high applied electric field range respectively. The Schottky emission mechanism was further studied in detail by plotting the Ln(I/T-2) Vs V-1/2 and Ln(I/T-2) Vs 1000/T plots at different applied fields and temperatures respectively.

865,"In a steel structure, choosing the connections type are one of the most important parameters in design consideration. How a connection type affects the vibration of steel beams has been investigated in this paper. The most effective connection type in reducing beam vibration has been highlighted. The study was conducted using different finite element models to simulate each connection type. Firstly, the model was validated by comparing its results with the results obtained by the analytical approach. In the numerical model, a linear frequency analysis was performed to determine beam natural frequency, then it has been compared with the corresponding value obtained by the Euler-Bernoulli approximations for simply supported beams. After that, two analysis procedures have been executed, steady-state analysis and transient analysis. In the steady-state analysis, a harmonic load with different frequencies was applied to the beam mid-span, while an impulsive load has been applied in the transient analysis. The results indicate that the deflection could be reduced by 72%, furthermore steady vibration of the beam can be reduced by 81% with using one of the moment connections instead of the traditional shear connection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
866,"A numerical study is conducted to simulate flow and heat transfer in shallow cooling ponds. A depth-integrated CFD model, based on the finite-volume method, is developed and applied to calculate detailed velocity and temperature distributions inside the pond. The numerical model is validated by comparing results with temperature measurements available for an experimental cooling pond. The model is used to investigate effect of mass flow rate (m) on pond hydrodynamics and thermal characteristics for cases of without and with internal baffles. The results show that the pressure loss coefficient remains constant, while the pressure drop between pond inlet and outlet increases with increasing m. The heat dissipated from the pond at the air-water interface increases with m despite the decrease in difference between water inlet and outlet temperatures. The pond effective heat-transfer coefficient, pond mean temperature, and water loss by evaporation are determined as a function of m. and relative humidity. The outlet temperature from the pond is determined as a function of pond cooling capacity. Streamline plots show that the flow pattern is independent of m but is strongly dependent on geometric configuration. A single contour map of normalized speed is, therefore, sufficient to describe all speeds inside the pond for different m. It is recommended that m should be as high as possible in order to enhance heat transfer from the pond but this would increase pumping power of cooling water through condenser tubes in which a compromise must be sought.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
867,"This paper considers the potential of designing and constructing floor slabs taking into account three aspects of major importance: flexibility-adaptability, energy efficiency and seismic safety. Currently traditional reinforced concrete floor slabs at least 20 centimetres thick are still designed and built. Such practice has no justification, as thick concrete floor slabs hinder architectural creativity as well as all the other aforementioned aspects. In this paper, the authors analyse and demonstrate the simultaneous correlation between flexibility-adaptability, energy efficiency, seismic safety and the mass of the floor slabs in residential buildings. Massive floor slabs limit the distance between load-bearing walls and consequently the adaptability of residential space. A large mass directly intensifies the seismic forces it induces. Thick concrete slabs have high heat capacity, as they have high mass and volume. The solution to floor slabs which satisfy all three aspects is to design and build them as waffle slabs. These two-way spanning concrete slabs have low mass, are rigid and can span the distance of more than 10 metres between two load-bearing walls. The authors of this paper suggest that floor slabs conform to the limitation in mass provided in this paper under Eq. (5) and (6). By applying this principle, architects would be able to design more flexible, adaptable, energy efficient, and seismically safe living spaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

869,"Due to low stiffness of braces after yielding, the structures with buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) experience high residual drifts during an earthquake, which can be intensified by aftershocks and causes considerable damages to structures. Also, due to poor distribution of stiffness, this problem is exacerbated for irregular structures. Recently, the yielding brace system (YBS) has been introduced; which is an alternative to BRBFs to solve this problem. YBS has a secondary stiffening part in its hysteresis behavior which can prevent excessive deformations. Therefore, structures with YBS are expected to show a better peroformance in seismic sequences compared to BRBs. However, the seismic behavior of the YBS system in irregular structures has not been studied so far. On this basis, this paper investigates the seismic behavior of frames with BRB and YBS in regular and irregular structures under seismic sequences. Twenty four 4-, 8-, and 12-story frames with these two systems were designed and evaluated. First, a nonlinear dynamic analysis was conducted on the frames under mainshocks, and the maximum interstory drift and the residual interstory drift of the frames were compared. Then, using incremental dynamic analysis and fragility curves, the behavior of the frames under mainshocks was investigated. Afterwards, using incremental dynamic analysis and fragility curves, the behavior of the structures under mainshock-aftershock in three performance levels was aledso investigated. The results showed that YBS bracing, especially in low rise structures, leads to far lower maximum drifts and maximum residual drifts than BRB braces, which can reduce the probability of the occurrence of soft stories in structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
870,"Super-hydrophobic coating reduces hydrodynamic drag of rigid surfaces due to separation of a part of the surface from the flow by air. The drag reduction ratio is proportional to the ratio of the surface area covered by air to the whole surface area. The maximum ratio may be achieved for coating with a regular spanwise super-hydrophobic bar. The air-water boundary over such bar would be a capillary wave with wavelength equal the distance between bar apexes. The numerical analysis of such waves was carried out by solving a two-dimensional nonlinear free-boundary problem of ideal fluid theory. Besides several wave shapes, the main computational results include dependencies of wavelengths and dimensionless pressure coefficient necessary for wave maintenance on Weber number. These dependencies make it possible to select the bar size and inflow speed allowing for existence of such waves and the highest drag reduction ratios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
871,"With the rapid increase in IoT (Internet of Things) applications, more sensor devices, generating periodic data flows whose packets are transmitted at regular intervals, are being incorporated into WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks). However, packet collision caused by the hidden node problem is becoming serious, particularly in large-scale multi-hop WSNs. Moreover, focusing on periodic data flows, continuous packet collisions among periodic data flows occur if the periodic packet transmission phases become synchronized. In this paper, we tackle the compounded negative effect of the hidden node problem and the continuous collision problem among periodic data flows. As this is a complex variant of the hidden node problem, there is no simple and well-studied solution. To solve this problem, we propose a new MAC layer mechanism. The proposed method predicts a future risky duration during which a collision can be caused by hidden nodes by taking into account the periodic characteristics of data packet generation. In the risky duration, each sensor node stops transmitting data packets in order to avoid collisions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that considers the compounded effect of hidden nodes and continuous collisions among periodic data flows. Other advantages of the proposed method include eliminating the need for any new control packets and it can be implemented in widely-diffused IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
872,"Giving the ratification of the ballast water management convention, a number of ballast water treatment technologies are emerging in the maritime industry; however, choosing the most appropriate technology has been a big challenge for ship owners because it is a very complex and critical task. The aim of this article is to propose a multi-attribute decision analysis model which integrates the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and the weighted linear combination method into a more comprehensive approach to select the most appropriate ballast water treatment technology for ship owners. The proposed model consists of 6 attributes (i.e. technological readiness, commercial readiness, operational readiness, seafarer's skills readiness, biological efficacy readiness and cost of ballast water treatment technologies) and 17 ballast water treatment technologies among which ship owners can choose the best. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process is used to obtain more realistic weights of the attributes, while the weighted linear combination is applied to prioritize the technologies. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, it is applied to select the best ballast water treatment technology for a ship owner in Ghana. The result shows that the ballast water treatment technology which uses membrane filter is selected as the best. Sensitivity analysis is then carried out to determine the effect of changing attributes' weights on the final priority rankings of the ballast water treatment technologies. Finally, the model is validated by comparing the obtained results to those from the PROMETHEE model and both results are consistent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

874,"Consider that a particle-like agent, affected by exogenous disturbances, seeks to remain as close as possible to a reference point. Its state evolves as a Markov decision process in discrete time and the actuation effort is cost-free. A denied environment within which state measurements must be requested and are costly encloses the reference point. Measurements outside the denied region are provided cost-free without the need for a request. No control is applied in the absence of a measurement. At each time step, the agent has the authority to decide whether to wander like a random walk or to request a measurement and use it to move towards the reference point. This paper investigates measurement request policies that minimize an objective function that comprises the expected mean squared deviation of the agent from the reference point and the cost of requesting a measurement inside the denied region. The goal is to characterize the trade-off between paying to access the state immediately and waiting for a free measurement that occurs when the agent is carried outside the denied region by the accrued effect of the disturbances over time. We show that the analysis of this problem simplifies by recasting it as a renewal reward process, for which the maximum wait time between the most recent renewal and a measurement request parametrizes all policies. Our analysis concerning wait-time optimization enabled us to establish conditions under which any local minimum (if it exists) is also global within a pre-specified interval, thus facilitating the search for a minimizer. Our results are discussed for the cases in which the agent's loci are the integers or a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

878,"With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

881,"The present work compares two different drag formulations based on a global balance of momentum (cf. for instance Rival and Van Oudheusden in Exp Fluids 58(3):20, 2017) fed with wake surveys of a finite-size wing. The traditional expression in terms of velocity and static pressure is considered, and compared to the phenomenological drag breakdown put forward by Meheut and Bailly (AIAA J 46(4):847-862, 2008) within the aerodynamic context. Both formulations require information on the velocity field, but also the static or stagnation pressure in the wake plane of the model of interest. In this paper, we focus on computing the results based on velocity data exclusively, acquired by stereo-PIV. These two methods are benchmarked experimentally on the wake of a SACCON model (Schutte et al. in J Aircraft 49(6):1638-1651, 2012) that has been measured in one of ONERA's wind-tunnels, and their performance is evaluated by comparing their results to direct force balance measurements. It is shown that while both formulations perform similarly, with drag predictions lying within 10% of the balance measurements, the phenomenological approach can additionally inform on the physical origins of drag. The latter method may thus be valuable to aerodynamicists, by giving them valuable clues as to how to fine-tune the performances of a given airframe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

886,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to respiratory rate measurement using resonance tube to enhance the performance of microphone inserted and fixed at the end of the tube to catch breath sound signal from the mouth and/or nose. The signal is amplified and passed into envelope detector circuit after which it is compared with a suitable reference voltage in comparator circuit to generate a pulse train of square wave synchronized with the respiratory cycle. A simple algorithm is developed in a small microcontroller to detect rising edges of each consecutive square wave to calculate respiratory rate together with analysis of breathing status. In order to evade noises which will cause errors and artifacts in the measuring system, the reference voltage is creatively designed to intelligently adapt itself to be low during expiration period and high during inspiration and pause period using the concept of resolving contradiction in the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ). This makes the developed device simple and low-cost with no need for complicated filtering system. It can detect breath sound as far as 250 cm from the nose and can perform accurately as tested against End Tidal CO2 Capnography device.

887,"This paper presents analysis of a 25% duty-cycle fully-differential double-balanced passive mixer dedicated to medical implantable devices. The proposed passive mixer is part of a medical implant communication service (MICS) receiver front-end operating at 402-405 MHz. By performing time-domain analysis, two LTI models have been developed to study the fully-differential double-balanced passive mixer: A simplified model and a complete model taking into account harmonic components. Both models account for the AC coupling capacitors at the mixer input and account for baseband voltage variation over one LO period. In this study it has been shown the ability of mixer input impedance matching by varying baseband resistor at the mixer output. The frequency of match can be controlled by varying the AC coupling capacitors and baseband capacitors. The performance of the proposed models was compared with that of the mixer and the results were very close. In particular, the results of simulations of the input impedance as a function of the baseband resistance and as a function of the IF frequency show the validity of the proposed models. The main parameters of the passive mixer such as input impedance, gain and noise figure (NF) were optimized taking into account the constraints of our application. The proposed mixer is designed to operate at LO frequency of 403.2 MHz. Transistors size is optimized to meet the receiver specifications.

888,"In this article, we report the salt effect on interaction of a water-soluble polymer hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) with the cationic Gemini surfactant (ethane-1, 2-diyl bis(N,N-dimethyl-N-hexadecylammoniumacetoxy) dichloride, 16-E2-16), and also its monomeric counterpart cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) using the tensiometric method. Surface tension of the amphiphiles diminished in the presence of the polymer as well as salts; eventually, the polymer gets saturated with the surfactant and there is no further change of surface tension of the solution. Interaction between the polymer and surfactant starts at the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) that is stronger for 16-E2-16 than CTAC. CAC and critical micelle concentration (CMC) values of the surfactant-polymer binary mixtures at various concentrations of the polymer were determined. CAC as well as CMC of 16-E2-16 are considerably lower than CTAC. The inorganic salts (KCl and KBr) have a considerable influence on the polymer-surfactant interaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
889,"In this paper a procedural animation framework is developed and discussed, which consists of a oscillator based Central Pattern Generator (CPG) system. This CPG based animation model is able to produce coupled leg oscillation derived through user-controlled parameters, producing in-phase and out-of-phase leg swing motion curves. Each leg has a separate CPG unit that is able to generate and control the swing and stance phases of each gait cycle with couple oscillation, having a time shift in correspondence to each leg, in a permuted symmetry. The dynamic motion is calculated independently for each body part with user interaction and control over the speed, frequency and oscillation of body parts individually, during runtime, for high divergence control of the simulation. The user can manipulate the simulation parameters for leg impact phases and duration at runtime and the system will automatically adjust the motion gaits and transitions between each gait at runtime. This procedural model for animating quadrupeds can generate various locomotion gaits with varying speed and footfall patterns dynamically. The various gaits produced by the CPG system are, walk, trot, gallop, canter, pace, pronk and rack. Various gait and footfall timing test are performed to test and validate the motion, along with a study of user's perception test to determine a Visual Mean Opinion Score (VMOS) of the believability and accuracy of the generated animation with statistical significance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
890,"Automatic detection of specific artificial region is one of the research hotspots in remote sensing image. In this study, a hierarchical detection method of specific artificial region using local structure constraint in remote sensing images is proposed. The process can be divided into two main stages: screening of keypoints based on the description of structural pattern, and specific artificial regions detection based on the local structural similarity. This method can greatly reduce the calculation of feature description in the redundant non-specific regions, and effectively reduce the error matching points to achieve the rapid and reliable detection of the specific artificial region. The authors test the proposed method on the artificial region sets with different types and time phase. The experimental results show that the method has high computational efficiency and detection accuracy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

893,"Multisensor navigation systems with an inertial navigation system (INS), employ GPS and other aiding sensors to correct INS errors and improve navigation accuracy. Kalman filter (KF) is used to fuse the aiding sensor measurements and estimate errors. Both the time update, in which the state vector and covariance matrix are propagated, and the measurement update, in which all the aiding sensor measurements are fused with the INSderived variables, have high computational costs. Two forms of the KF, the original covariance KF and the newer information KF, are examined. The most efficient parts of each are combined into a hybrid covariance/information filter. The state and measurement spaces of the hybrid filter are partitioned by sensors leading to blocked matrix formulas for both time update and measurement update. The blocked equations lead directly to threaded architecture implementations. The threaded architecture permits either serial operation with a single processor or parallel operation with multiple processors. Formulas are derived and evaluated for the floating-point operation counts for a general unblocked-serial hybrid filter and its blocked-serial and blocked-parallel implementations for an INS aided by GPS and other sensors. The blocked-parallel hybrid filter shows a significant improvement compared to the blocked-serial and unblocked-serial implementations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

895,"This research has the aim of establishing the amount of land that the Conservation Area National System (SINAC) needs to buy and specifying its use inside the Golfo Dulce Forest Reserve in order to maintain the good quality of the rivers. The study was done inside Rincon sub-basin in the Osa Peninsula, a land dedicated to primary and secondary forest (Melina tree plantations), mangrove forest, urbanism, chaparral, pasture for grazing livestock and crop cultivation, mainly rice and African palm; uses that may change in time affecting the actual water quality (WQ) in rivers and the bay. Changes in land uses modify the WQ and it can be predicted using WQ models based on environmental variables through the evaluation of different scenarios. It was found through modeling that pasture or chaparral land use has no negative impact on WQ; all the contrary happens with increments in crop cultivation or human population. At the present, the coastal area, adjacent to the reserve, has low agricultural activity but that could increase over time, affecting the WQ. Therefore, SINAC should continue with its acquisition land activity to counteract the negative environmental effect of agricultural activity to preserve the actual good quality of the rivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
896,"In this paper, we consider the distribution process of a manufacturing company that supplies products to the customers located in a service region. The company distributes its products partitioning the service region into delivery zones or districts that are served by a single deliveryman. Two objectives are considered when designing the delivery zones: balance the workload associated with each zone, and the minimization of the customers' waiting times (latency). The former objective concerns a districting decision, and the latter objective is related to a routing decision. To support these planning decisions, an optimization framework based on a novel bi-objective optimization model is proposed. To approximate the frontier of non-dominated solutions of the bi-objective problem, an efficient heuristic algorithm inspired in the c-constraint method is developed. The proposed algorithm exploits the characteristics of the problem, and it is used to solve a real case study. Obtained results are compared with the current solution employed by the company. Both objective function values are improved by any of the solutions in the approximated Pareto front. To show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, an additional set of instances derived from the case study is tested. The results indicate that the algorithm is able to approximate the Pareto fronts despite their shape. Hence, interesting managerial insights to improve the current decisions of the company are provided derived from the computational experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, they first extract the barycentre coordinates of all objects in the original radar image. Second, a decision criterion is provided to measure the relevance between these objects. If two objects are closely related, they assert that they have multipath-target relationship. Finally, they eliminate the multipath ghosts after all objects being determined.

Finally, the relationship between the angle estimation performance and the target position is examined by simulation experiments, and the result is compared with that of the traditional monopulse method. The results show that the weighted fusion four-channel monopulse angle estimation method can effectively improve the accuracy of angle estimation, and this improvement would be more salient when the target deviation angle increases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
900,"Mission scenarios for piloted Mars mission have traditionally consisted of a landing on Mars followed by a long stay time before the Earth-Mars planetary alignment would allow a minimum energy return. The long mission times increase both cost and risk, which need to reach levels below current projections before any such missions will be practical. An option that may eventually prove advantageous would be to orbit the spacecraft at the sun-Mars L-1 Lagrange point. Such a mission appears possible using bimodal nuclear thermal electric propulsion (BNTEP). The use of BNTEP can decrease round-trip mission times to Mars to one year, significantly reducing not only the cost, but also the risks from cosmic rays, solar flares, weightlessness, and isolation. Orbiting the spacecraft near the Lagrange equilibrium point L-1, using high-performance electric propulsion systems driven by nuclear power, reduces the propellant mass (cost) required and the risk by shortening the mission time. Because L-1 is an unstable equilibrium point, little propellant is required to leave after parking at L-1. Stationing the spacecraft also allows for the use of electric propulsion to enter and leave the equilibrium point. Leaving from L-1 using electric propulsion will also significantly shorten the transit time back to Earth, primarily because spiraling out from low Mars orbit will not be necessary. For BNTEP mission scenarios to become a reality, high-performance electric propulsion needs to be developed and high-performance bimodal nuclear thermal reactors need to be designed and tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

905,"This study investigates short channel (length <20 mu m) p-type organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices which exhibit off-state leakage in their ID-VG characteristics. This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that when a lower positive gate voltage is applied, gate voltage cannot control the back channel, causing back channel leakage. The behavior of back channel leakage is confirmed by the OTFT saturated-regime drain-current formula multiplied by channel length. For dual gate OTFT devices, a top gate voltage sweep and fixed different bottom gate voltages are applied, which indicates that the conduction path is distributed throughout the entire organic semiconductor (OSC) layer, and the back channel leakage can be suppressed by a positive bottom gate voltage. Finally, using dual gate sweeping for a dual gate OTFT device allows the top and bottom gate voltage to simultaneously control the front and back channels, causing a suppression of the back channel leakage, an improvement in subthreshold swing (SS) from 420 to 200 (mV/decade) and an on current increase from 7.8x10(-8) to 3.3x10(-7) A at V-G-Vsub-threshold = -8 V for the W/L = 50/20 mu m device.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
906,"This paper presents a charge accumulation-free voltage-controlled (VC) bi-phasic sinusoidal functional electrical stimulator (FES) for bioelectronic application. Traditionally, constant current (CC) pulse-shaped FESs with active or passive charge balancers are used to compensate for accumulated charges arise from process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variation as a result of long-term stimulation. Unlike the CC pulse-shaped FES, the VC sinusoidal-shaped FES is adopted here to avoid charge accumulation over time. The charge balancer is not required, substantially reducing system complexity and the chip area of the FES. To demonstrate the feasibility of concept, in this paper, four channels of VC bi-phasic sinusoidal-shaped FESs are integrated with the bio-potential recording circuit to compare with four channels of CC bi-phasic pulse-shaped FESs that are integrated with the same neural recording system for comparison. Measurements indicate an absence of charge accumulation as a result of the VC FESs. In addition, here we adopt the sinusoidal stimulation to reduce transient effects on tissue in comparison to a pulse-shaped method. The bio-potential activities of a cockroach leg that is stimulated for 50 s by the proposed bi-phasic sinusoidal stimulation are recorded.

908,"Various phenomena, such as quantum noise and scattering, existing in the industrial X-ray imaging process, and structural complexity of the measured workpiece resulted in low-contrast and blurry industrial X-ray images, which caused interference to the X-ray image analysis. This study proposed an improved adaptive sharpening algorithm to enhance the contrast and quality of X-ray images. Image pixels and the neighborhood established a non-local feature relationship through non-local filtering model on the basis of the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) model. The structural similarity of block-based pixels within the search window area was calculated. The improved weight was combined with image sharpening with high-enhancement results. The edge-preserving ability of the algorithm was verified through image tests. Finally, the proposed algorithm contributed to improving the quality of the contrast of industrial X-ray images through simulation experiments. Results demonstrate that features in the neighborhood based on non-local differences reflect rich details of images. The X-ray images sharpened with the proposed algorithm are characterized with excellent visual effects and rich details, with information entropy (IE) values of 2.1464, 4.2453, and 3.7283 and structural similarities of 0.9521, 0.9238, and 0.9534.

As a new application in the exoskeleton shoulder joint controller design, the controller in this research contained two loops that separately based on the inverse kinematics and pseudoinverse dynamics models of the exoskeleton shoulder. Two PI controllers as the error regulator can reduce the tracking error. The position and angular velocity error feedback were employed to constitute the closed-loops.

910,"The iron and manganese modified mesoporous carbon (MC-Fe, MC-Mn and MC-Fe/Mn) was prepared from waste biomass with nitrogen-doping assistance.

It was found that the introduction of nitrogen on MCs restrained the pore plugging caused by metals doping, and its BET surface area and total pores volume were around 1,200 m(2)/g and 1.00 cm(3)/g, respectively, because nitrogen could facilitate the dispersion of metals on MC evenly. The introduction of Fe might promote the formation of -O-CH3 while Mn might contribute to the formation of the C=O functional group on the surface of MCs. The adsorption results show that the adsorption capacities of modified MCs toward methylene blue (MB) were enhanced evidently by the introduction of Fe and/ or Mn, which was increased from 911 to 1,030 mg/g.

912,"The precise point positioning real-time kinematic (PPP-RTK) technique enables a single receiver to achieve high-precision and real-time positioning services, mainly relying on integer ambiguity resolution based on satellite phase bias (SPB) information. For the PPP-RTK technique based on uncombined observations, the SPBs of basic frequencies are available only at low precision because of high correlation and therefore need to be updated frequently. Thus, the most appropriate linear combinations of BeiDou triple-frequency SPBs with low update rates for transmission to users must be identified. To acquire combinations of BeiDou triple-frequency SPBs, we use the Z-transformation to process the covariance matrixes corresponding to SPB estimates to generate decorrelated SPB combinations. To meet different circumstances, geometry-free, geometry-fixed and geometry-plus-satellite-clock-fixed variants of PPP-RTK are applied to process data from the regional network. The computed results indicate that the primary stable, secondary and tertiary stable SPB combinations of B1, B2 and B3 frequencies are (0, -1, 1), (1, 2, -3), and (-33, -129, 163) for the geometry-free variant, (0, -1, 1), (1, 2, -3), and (-21, -95, 117) for the geometry-fixed variant, and (0, -1, 1), (1, 3, -4), and (-18, -84, 103) for the geometry-plus-satellite-clock-fixed variant. Furthermore, the statistical results of the SPB series provide stable periods of the primary stable combinations of longer than 7 d. For the secondary and tertiary stable combinations, the stable periods for the geometry-free variant are 12 h and 5 h, for the geometry-fixed variant 12 h and 8 h, and for geometry-plus-satellite-clock-offset variant 12 h and 10 h. These stable periods suggest how often the SPB information should be updated and provide meaningful insight for the allocation of the computing resources of the PPP-RTK server.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with the conventional super-resolution DOA estimation method such as multiple signal classification, the proposed method can distinguish two or more targets within one beamwidth more precisely. Compared with the earlier super-resolution DOA estimation method such as maximum likelihood, the proposed method can obtain more accurate and robust angle difference estimation and do not need to previously know the source number.

914,"The range profile of the plasma sheath target is always found to be distorted when using the linear frequency modulation signal as the radar detection signal. As a result, the detection and tracking of the target became hard, or even failure. Here, three possible reasons of the range profile distortion is investigated in detail: (i) The broadening of the particles in the radial direction of the radar detection when the plasma sheath is produced; (ii) The scatterers in one range gate have different radial velocities that the range profile is dispersion due to the range-Doppler coupling effect; (iii) The amplitude and frequency of the echo signal are modulated by the time-varying plasma sheath. Here, the influence of the above three mechanisms on the range profile is simulated. In addition, for the accurate detection and tracking of these targets, the reason of the distortion should be distinguished. Therefore, several methods are proposed to distinguish the different mechanisms for the range profile distortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

918,"Objective: The purpose of this paper is to increase the accuracy of human cardiac diffusion tensor (DT) estimation in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) with a few diffusion gradient directions. Methods: A structure prior constrained (SPC) method is proposed. The method consists in introducing two regularizers in the conventional nonlinear least squares estimator. The two regularizers penalize the dissimilarity between neighboring DTs and the difference between estimated and prior fiber orientations, respectively. A novel numerical solution is presented to ensure the positive definite estimation. Results: Experiments on ex vivo human cardiac data show that the SPC method is able to well estimate DTs at most voxels, and is superior to state-of-the-art methods in terms of the mean errors of principal eigenvector, second eigenvector, helix angle, transverse angle, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity. Conclusion: The SPC method is a practical and reliable alternative to current denoising- or regularization-based methods for the estimation of human cardiac DT. Significance: The SPC method is able to accurately estimate human cardiac DTs in dMRI with a few diffusion gradient directions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The database is based on empirical data obtained from published manuscripts and provides a software package with the potential to reduce experimental effort and save resources throughout the development of an ATPS-based process or product. The package requires only minimal knowledge of R and can be installed directly from its console, and the results are easily exported for subsequent analyses. Detailed examples of usage and descriptions of the package capabilities, including built-in database search functions, are demonstrated by characterizing a poly(ethylene glycol) 2000/ammonium sulfate ATPS, the data of which is provided with the package. Additional online resources for the package are also described, including the procedure to allow users to contribute to LLSR in order to expand its database and capabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
921,"Waste is a complex societal problem: municipal solid waste should be considered a resource, but the methods for capturing, treating and utilising this resource are varied and often dependent on geopolitical factors. Previous research has, on the one hand, explored the need for a more comprehensive waste composition specification to manage municipal waste better, and on the other, focused on a problematic waste stream and the options available for dealing with it. This work considers the use of multi-criteria decision making to assess the relative merits of different treatment options. A complex and problematic waste stream, wood, has been selected as a case study. For the purpose of the study, the work considers the options available to Surrey County Council in the UK. Currently, for the conditions selected, energy from waste was considered to be the best option available for the treatment of wood with no discernible value for upcycling or reuse, but not contaminated with hazardous chemicals. When considering a different location with different circumstances, a different solution might be found.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
922,"A novel dynamic penetration testing method for the investigation of cohesionless soils based on the principles of vibratory driving has been developed. During the so-called vibro-penetration test (VPT), a vertical harmonic excitation force drives a rod with a conical tip into the ground. The penetration resistance is defined as the number of excitation cycles N(z10 )required for 0.10 m penetration with a reference driving energy. In order to evaluate N-z10, the tip and shaft resistance, the tip acceleration and the depth of the penetrometer tip are recorded during driving and the data are evaluated according to a proposed vibro-penetration model. Experimental and numerical investigations are carried out to investigate the soil response, validate the mechanical model and evaluate the influence of the density, the effective stresses and the machine parameters on the vibro-penetration resistance. The results show that the N-z10 - values are reproducible, correlate unambiguously with the state variables but depend on the machine parameters to some extent. In comparison with the CPT, the VPT shows similar sounding records. However, the required equipment is much lighter, the execution faster and in-situ investigations of medium dense to dense cohesionless soils at large depths are feasible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
923,"We present a novel design of a parameterization image stitching algorithm for ultrashort throw laser MEMS projectors. The resultant method allows the use of projectors with short or even long throw ratios to achieve ultrashort throw projection through a parameterized algorithm to stitch multiple images into one single frame, alleviating the trade-off between the resolution and frame rate in conventional laser MEMS displays. To evaluate the effectiveness, we construct a test system that consists of three off-the-shelf projectors with a throw ratio of 1.3 and three planar reflective mirrors. Using our method, the integrated system yields an ultrashort throw ratio of 0.26, greatly reducing the projection distance from 12 to 2.6 ft for the 120-in. screen in diagonal. Moreover, our algorithm can be fine-tuned to correct for image distortion, intensity variation, and edge mismatch induced by two-axis light beam steering, thereby further improving the image quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

925,"This study investigates the optimum location of drainage galleries of concrete gravity dams under usual, unusual, and extreme loading conditions. The uplift and the stress distributions were computed using the gravity method and the beam theory, whereas the leakage rate into the gallery was determined by the finite-element method. The results show that the presence of a drainage gallery can reduce the uplift by over 60 percent compared to a non-drained case. The suitable gallery location shifts toward the upstream if the drain diameter increases and the spacing decreases. This is consistent with previous research. As the gallery is moved toward the downstream, the crack length decreases; however, this increases the uplift. The most effective solution is found to be placing the gallery 10 percent of the base width away from the heel and at the downstream water level or below and adding post-tension cables on the downstream side. This option also yields lower pumping costs by reducing the pump head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
926,"Using heat shield, especially in throat area has a significant effect on combustion chamber pressure and thermal efficiency of solid fuel engines. Precise prediction of the regression of throat area for different pressures, will lead to optimal design of the motors, specifically for those of long burnout times. In this work, erosion of graphite nozzles employed in solid propellant motors with a specific composite propellant and variable pressures, is investigated. The numerical model utilized includes the Naiver-Stokes equations, chamber gas thermodynamic equations and thermochemical and heat conduction equations for the nozzle surface. In order to validate the numerical results, a cartridge type solid propellant motor with a graphite nozzle is experimentally tested. Using a 3D scanner in the experimental setup, the amount of inner surface regression for variable pressures (60, 90, 120 and 200 bars) is measured. Numerical and experimental results are in a proper conformity with each other. There is a direct relationship between convection heat transfer coefficient and the pressure. The overall erosion is the same for all four engine pressures. The erosion rate increases with increasing pressure. This rate for the fuel is about 0.21 mm/s for every 100 times the pressure up to 300 times.

927,"The dc-link voltage stability for a hybrid five-phase open-end winding (OeW) drive operating under carrier-based pulse-width modulation is studied. The drive consists of a five-phase induction machine, supplied using one three-level and one two-level voltage source inverter. This configuration is analysed for the case of isolated dc-link rails, while the dc-link voltage ratio is considered as an additional degree of freedom. It is demonstrated that different dc-link voltage ratios lead to the different overall number of voltage levels across stator windings. Modulation strategies are investigated and their performances are analysed from the dc-link voltages stability point of view. An analytical method for dc-link voltage stability analysis is presented. Results show that the four-level configuration always leads to stable dc-link voltages, regardless of the modulation strategy. On the other hand, if the six-level configuration is combined with modulation strategies that lead to optimal harmonic performance, not all dc-link capacitor voltages will be in the balance depending on the operating conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
928,"An effort has been made to numerically study the interactions between the vapor films generating from multiple heated cylinders placed in a saturated water pool with a view to understand the influence of neighboring interface on growth of vapor films. Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been used for domain discretization and interface reconstruction. Unconstrained growth of vapor film around a cylinder is simulated first and the nature of vapor dynamics has been taken as a base case for the study of interaction patterns. Vapor growth has been understood through temporal phase contours, azimuthal thickness variation, and trajectory of the centroid of the vapor mass. It has been shown that the presence of cylinder in vertical neighborhood results in suppression of vapor film generating from the bottom cylinder, whereas, the vapor films generating from two cylinders placed in horizontal neighborhood experience a horizontal shift. Studies have also been made to observe multidirectional interactions of vapor films with heated cylinders placed in an inline array, vertically staggered and horizontally staggered arrangements. It has been found that the highest deviation from unconstrained growth occurs in case of the center cylinder in a horizontally staggered arrangement as compared to others. Mutual interaction coefficient and indices are proposed to judge the best possible arrangement in case of a requirement for placement of stacked cylinders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are suggestions to discard some initial bytes from the key-stream, to get rid of this, before the actual encryption starts, though no optimum value has been defined. In this paper, by analysing different variants of RC4, the authors have attempted to find out whether this cipher becomes more secure by discarding initial bytes and, if so, what is its optimum limit. Also, multiple S-boxes generated by different logics and a unique key-mixing procedure have been implemented, which made k RC4 more robust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,"The authors investigate and physically analyse the effects of the angle of grooving (theta) on various analogues and RF parameters of InAs-channel quantum well MOSFETs with raised source/drain architecture at a 14-nm gate length. Moreover, harmonic distortion analysis is performed to examine the linearity and distortion of common source amplifiers built with such transistors. The findings reveal that the device with theta = 20 degrees exhibits significant improvement in transconductance efficiency (g(m)/I-DS), output resistance (r(d)), and voltage gain (A(v)) while showing degradation in transconductance (g(m)) compared to the corresponding parameter with theta = 90 degrees. Furthermore, the obtained results manifest that the total harmonic distortion drops to -47 dB for an amplifier built with the device having theta = 90 degrees compared to -22 dB obtained with theta = 20 degrees. Notably, as the angle of grooving increases from 20 degrees to 90 degrees, the gain bandwidth of the amplifier improves by 232% while the peak gain falls by 40%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

932,"The main goals of an engineering test are reproducing a real scenario in a controlled environment and monitoring a device under validation when exposed to such condition. In this context, some recent studies have indicated misalignments between the waveforms suggested by the Radiated Immunity standards and the real telecommunication signals. Reproducing an actual signal in an electromagnetic compatibility laboratory might, however, be an expensive task, since it demands more sophisticated hardware. In this study, a simple solution for this problem is proposed based on adjustments applied to the standardised pulse modulated waveform. The objective is to develop an alternative to the traditional procedures, in an attempt to provide the manufacturers a more realistic test environment for their products. Mathematical manipulations indicate that a good agreement between the adjusted waveforms and a digital television signal cannot be simultaneously achieved in both time and frequency domains. Multiple trade-off solutions are then generated and analysed through electromagnetic simulations. Results show that, in the 210-216 MHz frequency range, the pulse modulated signals model the digital television interference capability better than the classical continuous wave does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

935,"Beams with elastic constraints are widely used in dynamic systems in engineering. A general explicit solution is presented here for the vibration of simple span beam with transverse, rotational and axial elastic boundary constraints due to an arbitrary moving load. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is adopted, in which the boundary constraints are treated as multi-directional boundary springs. After the modal analyses, the explicit closed-form solutions of transverse and axial vibration of the beam under a constant, sinusoidal and cosinoidal moving loads are obtained, respectively. And the vibration of a beam subjected to an arbitrary moving load is derived by the superposition of Fourier series. The current analytical solution is exact and can be applied in multiple engineering fields to obtain accurate structural vibrations. In numerical examples, the effects of the boundary springs on the natural frequencies, modes, deflection, bending moment and boundary reaction of the beam are studied in details. The effects of the number of terms in Fourier series of arbitrary moving load are also discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

938,"With the rapid increase of optical remote sensing (RS) images, on-orbit specific target detection has been facing more and more challenges: limited processing environment, wireless bandwidth, space, power and storage. To resolve this issue, visual characteristics in the compressed domain are exploited to represent and recognise specific objects. In this study, a new saliency method and an airfield detection framework in the JPEG2000 compressed domain is proposed. First, the authors exploit the header information in raw JPEG2000 code streams to generate structural saliency map, and a great deal of non-structural regions in RS images are eliminated. Second, airfield candidates are extracted from low frequency wavelet sub-bands using line segment detection and the parallel density model. Finally, the geometrical properties of airfield candidates are represented by the speed-up robust features descriptor, and the support vector machine classifier is utilised to gain the final detection results.

939,"A new damage identification method with a fusion index to locate the damage position and identify the damage extent of beam structures is presented by integrating the modal strain energy and natural frequency sensitivity. The modal strain energy, which is with the limitation on obtaining the damage extent, is adopted to locate the damage position with avoiding the interference of structure itself. The natural frequency sensitivity, which is with false detection and interference happening when solely used, is adopted for identifying the damage extent. In order to further improve the precision of the damage quantification, additional masses are added on the beam structure to obtain more information about the natural frequency sensitivity. Then, the fusion index for damage identification is established through combining the modal strain energy and the natural frequency sensitivity before and after adding masses on beam structures. The results obtained by finite element analysis and experimental tests show that the presented method can locate and quantify damages on beam structures in an accurate and convenient way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
940,"A new type of catanionic surfactant phosphonium benzene sulfonate was synthesized by quaternization of triphenyl phosphine with dimethyl carbonate and followed by anion exchange with alkyl benzene sulfonic acid. The molecular structure was characterized by FT-IR, H-1-NMR, and P-31-NMR. The thermal stability of phosphonium benzene sulfonate was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Its surface properties were studied systematically through equilibrium surface tension, electrical conductivity, and dynamic surface tension measurements. The wettability, foam properties, and emulsification of phosphonium benzene sulfonate were estimated in this paper. TGA results revealed that it has an excellent thermostability and could be used below 350 degrees C. Equilibrium surface tension results indicated that it has a low critical micelle concentration (CMC, about 0.10 mmol/L), lower than that of ammonium benzene sulfonate and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate. Furthermore, the micellization of phosphonium benzene sulfonate in aqueous solution is an entropy-driven spontaneous process. The adsorption process of phosphonium benzenesulfonate at the air-liquid interface is controlled by hybrid kinetic adsorption. Moreover, it has excellent wetting and emulsifying properties and low foam properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary vortex structures induced by the passage curvature profoundly influence the stability of the granular material and determine the varying bed profiles subjected to the processes of erosion and sedimentation in the flow passage. For examining the characteristics of the bed profile, the current study develops a non-intrusive measurement method whereby transient changes occurring at the granular bed interface are captured for a range of flow operating conditions. The test results indicate three distinct regimes of onset, transition and quasi-stable erosion-sedimentation in the curved passage over the experimental test range. Each stage is analysed and discussed for the observed intricacies of the flow structures and the bed reshaping behaviour, with respect to the timescale of these occurrences, influences of the flow rate and granular particle size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

943,"This study explores using probabilistic and deterministic approaches for evaluating the quality of groundwater resources. The proposed methodology first used the probabilistic approach, which included multivariate statistical analysis, to classify the groundwater's physiochemical characteristics. Then, building on the obtained results, the deterministic approach, which included hydrochemistry analyses, was applied for comprehensive assessment of groundwater quality for different applications. To present this multidisciplinary approach, a basin located in an arid region was studied. Considering the results from correlation and principal component analyses, along with hierarchical Q-mode cluster analysis, chloride salts dissolution was identified within the aquifer. Further application of the deterministic approach revealed degradation of groundwater quality throughout the basin, possibly due to the saltwater intrusion. By developing the water quality index and a multi-hazard risk assessment methodology, the suitability of groundwater for human consumption and irrigation purposes was assessed. The obtained results were compared with two other studies conducted on aquifers under similar arid climate conditions. This comparison indicated that quality of groundwater resources within arid regions is prone to degradation from salinization. The combined consideration of probabilistic and deterministic approaches provided an effective means for comprehensive evaluation of groundwater quality across different aquifers or within one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we investigate a hybrid broadband system combining satellite and terrestrial access networks. The system design and the key building blocks of the intelligent routing entities (referred to as intelligent gateways) are presented. To justify the hybrid broadband system's performance subjectively, lab trials have been performed with an integrated multiple access network emulator and a variety of typical multimedia applications that have varying requirements.

The coefficients were obtained based on certain assumptions and with the aid of nonlinear calculations. These assumptions place limitations on the practical design process in some cases. This especially concerns the use of different materials for new pipes, as well as geometrical imperfections in new and old pipes.

946,"Shear strength of carbon-reinforced concrete members without shear reinforcement - Experimental investigations of the influence of the reinforcement ratio on load-bearing behaviour Fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) as reinforcement for concrete members in structural engineering are becoming increasingly important. Compared to conventional steel reinforcement, FRP reinforcement is different in terms of modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and bond behaviour. If concrete compression failure can be excluded, members with the same mechanical ratio of longitudinal reinforcement have the same bending load bearing capacity. The high tensile strengths of FRP reinforcement can lead to a reduced required reinforcement area and thus geometric ratio of longitudinal reinforcement. This effect leads to a reduced shear strength and increased crack widths and spacings. This article presents and evaluates experimental investigations on the shear strength of concrete members without shear reinforcement. Two different member types were analysed: slabs with textile carbon reinforcement and beams with carbon bars. For a direct comparison with conventionally reinforced members, reference tests with steel reinforcement and comparable mechanical reinforcement ratio were carried out. In addition to a detailed description of the specific properties of the used materials and a comparison of the load-bearing and deformation behaviour of the members, a precise evaluation of the cracking behaviour is shown. Finally, the influence of the reinforcement ratio on the shear strength is presented and the resulting conclusions are summarised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

949,"South Africa faced challenges related to potable water quality that has periodically deteriorated, coupled with inconsistent supply of tap water (TW) to households. These challenges are a primary exasperation in the arid O'Kiep region, where the community has few alternatives regarding drinkable water sources. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of drinking TW supplied to the O'Kiep community, focusing on health risks associated with the ingestion of such water. The study included both the quantitative assessment of water quality parameters and a qualitative assessment of adverse human health outcomes experienced by the residents. Furthermore, disease patterns which were associated with ingestion of supplied water were also identified and subjected to appropriate statistical data analyses. Due to the inadequate drinking water supply and shortages in O'Kiep, households often are dependent on water tankers and commercially bottled water, amongst other potential sources of drinkable water. Water samples (n = 53) from O'Kiep' drinking water supply system (DWSS), that is, n = 3 were collected from source and (n = 50) point-of-use (TW) while the questionnaires were simultaneously administered in households. None of the statistical models suggested physicochemical properties as predictors of any of the health symptoms. Approximately, 88% of community members indicated that the water supplied is often turbid, while a high number of people with teeth discolouration (72%) are living in the area and experience diarrhoea-like symptoms, which are likely to be associated with the ingestion of toxin-contaminated water. This was confirmed by some physiochemical parameters quantified, that is, low dissolved oxygen of 2.0 mg/L, a high electrical conductivity of 595 mg/L, and SO42- and chlorine concentrations of 557 and 47.1 mg/L, respectively, which were not within the range prescribed for drinking water guidelines.

Finally, the third structure is a new dual-mode architecture based on the circular cavity with rotated slots, where the cavity exploits TE and TM resonant modes.

951,"Pre-disaster programs, especially for seismic hazards, are necessary to quickly recover the services of a lifeline network. In the case of a multi-source (or multi-root) water lifeline network, an efficient repair schedule must be implemented immediately after an earthquake to assist in post-disaster activities as well as to minimize the subsequent health problems caused by the lack of potable water supply. As such water lifeline operators must establish restoration strategies especially if the supply of water comes from different sources and spatially distributed. For a single-source water network, Horn's algorithm can be used to determine an optimal restoration strategy. However, a variation of this algorithm is necessary in order to allow simultaneous repairs at any given time for a multiple-source lifeline water network. In this research, the authors employ a constrained spanning forest (CSF) algorithm to decompose the network into trees rooted at each source. After the decomposition, Horn's algorithm is used to determine the optimal restoration strategy for each tree in the network with the objective of minimizing a penalty value. Restoration of each node in the spanning forest is carried in sequence according to availability of the crew and allows simultaneous jobs to be done on consecutive arcs in the sequence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In slope stability analyses, the residual strength of slip zones is the most important parameter for evaluating slope stability and for understanding the reactivation mechanisms. However, it is time-consuming and costly to obtain the residual frictional angle through shear tests. This paper presents the results of a laboratory study designed to evaluate the correlations between the residual frictional angle and the Atterberg limits, which include the liquid limit, the plastic limit and the plasticity index, using eight kinds of reservoir embankment soil samples. The residual frictional angle was measured by the Bromhead ring shear apparatus using remolded samples. Based on the laboratory study, significant correlations between the residual frictional angle and the different indexes were proposed for the reservoir embankment soil, especially in terms of the particle size of the soil, which was less than 0.425 mm. Processing the data on the shear tests led to the discovery that the quantity of eight tests was sufficient for obtaining relevant accuracy in determining the residual frictional angle. Based on the results of the tests, the relationships between the residual frictional angle and all the indexes were found. Compared with the other indexes, the liquid limit had a better correlation with the residual frictional angle. Formulas were predicted in this study that can provide a convenient and highly accurate means for calculating the residual frictional angle value for application to worldwide geotechnical engineering projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
953,"The power amplifier is an important device in the communication system, and its non-linear characteristics will lead to serious distortion of the output signal, reducing the performance of the communication system.

The stochastic geometry method is used to derive some expressions for ergodic rate and coverage probability in downlink transmission. In this system model, Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) are coordinated by a Baseband Unit to transmit data toward users. We assume using RRH clusters where each cluster includes one or two RRHs. To investigate this system, we have used Gauss-Poisson process (GPP). The GPP well describes this clustering scenarios. Considering the intra-cell interference power control, we propose SBS to gain the best performance subject to the energy efficiency (EE) metric. SBS which is based on sparse selections of RRHs, is characterized by introducing analytical expressions and simulation of a C-RAN scenario which the allocation of the RRHs follows the GPP distribution. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed SBS method improves the overall EE of C-RAN scenario up to 15% with respect to full RRHs coordination, at the high intra-cell interference conditions, and about 30% with respect to no coordination state between RRHs in low intra-cell interference regime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A shift generation model is studied and constructed for multi-task hierarchical qualification which including employees have hierarchical qualifications for tasks and shift needs to meet all kinds of labor laws and regulations and others constraints to minimize the total working time of shifts for optimum. Tabu search algorithm is designed to solve the model. Experiments, based on the actual scheduling data set of the foreign airlines service department of capital airport, verify the practicability and effectiveness of the model and the algorithm.

Actually, the combination of physical products with services as a product-service bundle should be offered. Based on this initial situation, this article provides an analysis model for the plant manufacturer industry with a special focus on the maturity level of services. The analysis model shows both, the existent level of service maturity in a company and the steps, which are required to the next higher level of maturity in this model. After the theoretical conception of the model, it is validated practically through a questionnaire and a service maturity portfolio.

958,"Starting initial field production is a unique opportunity to acquire reservoir-surveillance information that can impact future reservoir performance. When a field is perturbed by first production, there is the potential to reduce uncertainty in reservoir properties by monitoring the pressure changes at nonproducing wells with downhole pressure gauges and comparing the observed signal with a range of simulation-model results. The Wheatstone Field, located offshore of Northwest Australia, recently began production startup to supply gas to the Wheatstone liquefied-natural-gas (LNG) facility. The operational guidelines required each development well to start with a single-well-cleanup flow to the Wheatstone platform. The initial single-well-cleanup flows of the Wheatstone field provided scope for selecting a well flow sequence with observation at nonproducing wells. The recommended sequence of initial cleanup flows was designed with a focus on reducing reservoir uncertainties by means of ensemble variance analysis (EVA). EVA is a statistical correlation technique that compares the covariance between two sets of output data with the same set of inputs. For the Wheatstone Field well-cleanup flow sequence selection, the EVA workflow compared the fullfield design of experiments (DoE) study of field depletion and a series of short early-production reservoir-simulation DoE studies of the gas field. The covariance between the two DoE studies was evaluated. The objective of the EVA approach was to determine the startup sequence that would allow for the best opportunity to reduce subsurface uncertainty. This objective was met by ranking multiple cleanup flow sequence scenarios. The key factors considered for sequence selection ranking were the impact on business objectives, such as future-drilling-campaign timing and location of infill wells, and insights on reservoir connectivity, gas initially in place (GIIP), and permeability. The recommended sequence of well-cleanup flows uses a superpositioned pressure signal to boost response at observation wells, which improves measurement resolvability. The selected sequence preserves key observation wells for each manifold and reservoir section for as long as possible before those wells are required to be flowed to meet operational requirements. Operational constraints and variations of the startup plan were considered part of the evaluation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
959,"Probable maximum precipitation (PMP) is the basis for the estimation of the probable maximum flood, with which large hydraulic works are dimensioned and hydrologically revised. There are two groups of methods to estimate PMP: meteorological and statistical. Meteorological methods are the most reliable, but require a lot of data that is usually not available. Statistical methods are much simpler and only use annual maximum daily precipitation (PMD) values. The classic method of this group is the David M. Hershfield method, published in 1961. Subsequently, in England (NERC, 1975) another statistical method was developed based on the prediction of duration 24 hours and return period (Tr) 5 years, designated M5; this approach allows predictions with various Tr. Jonas Eliasson (Eliasson, 1997; Eliasson, 2000) generalized the M5 method, in a regional technique that only requires two statistical parameters: the M5 and the coefficient of variation ( Cv). In this study, the results of the generalized M5 method (MM5G) are compared with those of the Hershfield method, previously calculated based on the PMD data for 81 localities in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. The MM5G was applied using the available values of M5 and Cv. Results allow the recommendation of the use of MM5G to estimate predictions of PMD with Tr less than 100 years, in no-data sites in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. It is also recommended for estimations of PMP of 24 hours duration, remembering that such method underestimates less than 16.4%, with respect to the result of the Hershfield method, when the Cv is less than 0.251 and overestimates, of the order of 38.0% when the Cv exceeds 0.386.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next, a fast estimation technique with few searching times to reduce the computation of the detection process is put forward.

968,"In this article, film cooling characteristics, especially the phenomenon of backflow for the straight turbine blade leading edge, are investigated. Shear stress transport k-omega turbulence model and structured grids are employed to assure the accuracy of the simulation, and the computational method is verified by the available experimental data. The influences of blow ratio, hole diameter, and the spacing between holes in each row are analyzed. The formation mechanism of backflow is discussed to prevent it from happening or relieve the degree of backflow, thereby to improve the cooling efficiency. The results showed that backflow can be avoided by adjusting the structure and the layout of film cooling holes. With increase in blow ratio, the cooling film becomes more obvious at first and then fades gradually for departing from the blade surface. The jet flow is influenced by the total pressure ratio between coolant cavity and surface of blade leading edge. Smaller film hole diameter and larger hole spacing makes it easier to eject coolant and form continuous film by slowing down the pressure in the cavity. Increasing ratio of hole spacing to hole diameter (p/d) can effectively prevent backflow, whereas larger p/d also makes the film coverage area smaller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the solid-core encapsulation of double emulsion in flow-focusing microchannel is either in the stable state or in the transition state, depending on the flow rates of inner and outer phase fluid. The stable microencapsulation includes the stable single-core, double-cores and triple-cores encapsulation states, while the transition microencapsulation includes the single-double-cores and double-triple-cores transition encapsulation state.

971,"The convection heat transfer of transient flow usually involves transient temperature and transient heat flux at the flow-wall interface. For experimental studies on this type of convection heat transfer problems, it is difficult to take measurement at the flow-wall interface, particularly for liquid flow. A substrate with small thickness can be used. One surface is exposed to the flow, while, on the free surface, there is a thin-skin heat source providing a constant and uniform heat flux, and the temperature at the free surface is measured using infrared thermography. Then the heat transfer coefficient of the transient flow can be obtained based on the temperature measured on the free surface. Two experimental tests of water droplets impacting a water film flow are conducted using this method. We solve a 1-D transient conduction problem, and the derived solution is used to calculate the heat transfer coefficient for the two experiments.

972,"The paper is devoted to an experimental investigation of nozzle vane heating in the last stage of a wet steam turbine. The investigation was performed at a steam-dynamic test facility whose circuit was connected to an operating cogeneration power station (TETs). The working fluid was steam from a heat extraction assembly of a steam turbine. To prepare a polydisperse wet steam flow specific for the last stages of steam turbines, a three-stage wetting system based on feedwater injection into the flow was used. The object of investigation is a flat vane cascade consisting of hollow vanes. The vane cavities are fed with superheated steam to provide heating. Experimental data are presented demonstrating that it is advisable to heat nozzle vanes: first, the economic characteristics are improved, and, second, erosion of the blades in the last stages decreases. This method can be used as an alternative to the internal moisture separation from the steam path. The experimental investigation yielded the effect of the temperature difference between the main flow and the heating steam on the amount of heat transferred to the main flow and on the steam conditions at the outlet from the heating chamber. It was found that condensation in the heating chamber decreased its outlet pressure. This should be considered in designing a similar active system to control erosion of rotor blades. The measured profile losses of kinetic energy downstream of the vane cascade for different temperature difference values are presented. The kinematic characteristics of the liquid phase downstream of the vane trailing edge are determined. Large temperature differences are found to have a negative effect on droplets and can reduce the erosion resistance of the blades as compared with profiles without any active erosion control methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed network model is developed by considering number of antennas at each BS alongside a single antenna at each user with the use of the conventional spectrum re-utilization approach. Then, Coverage probability and EE expressions for the dual-layer cellular networks are exclusively derived analytically. It is also demonstrated that simulation results are almost inline with the analytical one in the PPP-based model.

The exact amount of silica produced was measured using DTA, which precisely matched the theoretical yield. These results are particularly relevant to the direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) when carbonate is used as an electrolyte and coal char is used as a fuel, given that silica is an abundant mineral in high-rank coals.

Specifically, we propose the allocation which are feasible for the practical scenario with self-interference (SI) taken into account, because the jamming signals from FDR not only confuse the eavesdropper but also inevitably cause SI at the FDR. Due to the nolinear and coupling of the antenna allocation optimization problem, we transform the original problem into an integer programming problem. Then, we derive the optimal solution and the corresponding beamforming matrices in closed-form by means of combining spatial alignment and null-space projection method.

981,The soil is modeled as coupled elastoplastic to account for the elastic stiffness degradation during plastic yielding. In such model the irreversible strain rate results from a combination of a plastic part and a coupled part of strain rates. The former arises from plastic yielding and the latter is generated by the variation in the elastic stiffness. This leads to non associated and coupled flow rules in which the outward direction of the irreversible strain rate do not coincides neither with the outward normal to the yield surface nor the outward normal to the plastic potential. In this paper an extension of the static shakedown theorem to soil is proposed in the framework of the coupled elastoplasticity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
982,"The structural vibrations of a flat plate induced by fluctuating wall pressures within wall-bounded transonic jet flow downstream of a high-aspect ratio rectangular nozzle are simulated. The wall pressures are calculate using Hybrid RANS/LES CFD, where LES models the large-scale turbulence in the shear layers downstream of the nozzle. The structural vibrations are computed using modes from a finite element model and a time-domain forced response calculation methodology. At low flow speeds, the convecting turbulence in the shear layers loads the plate in a manner similar to that of turbulent boundary layer flow. However, at high nozzle pressure ratio discharge conditions the flow over the panel becomes transonic, and the shear layer turbulence scatters from shock cells just downstream of the nozzle, generating backward traveling low frequency surface pressure loads that also drive the plate. The structural mode shapes and subsonic and transonic surface pressure fields are transformed to wavenumber space to better understand the nature of the loading distributions and individual modal responses. Modes with wavenumber distributions which align well with those of the pressure field respond strongly. Negative wavenumber loading components are clearly visible in the transforms of the supersonic flow wall pressures near the nozzle, indicating backward propagating pressure fields. In those cases the modal joint acceptances include significant contributions from negative wavenumber terms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As to the selection of the regularisation parameter, the cross-validation technique is exploited. At the analysis stage, the performance of the RML/ARML procedure is evaluated based both on simulated and challenging knowledge-aided sensor signal processing and expert reasoning data, also in comparison with some other outlier excision methods available in the open literature.

984,"The article presents the influence of using REACH and LCA systems on the properties and functional parameters of a group of hazardous substances - explosive materials. The most commonly used explosives include dynamite and emulsion explosive materials. Dynamites are generally viewed as dangerous due to the content of nitroglycerin and nitroglycol, whereas emulsion explosive materials are considered safe in environmental terms. However, they have worse functional parameters related to the energy efficiency of the detonation process compared to dynamites. Undoubtedly, the application of REACH regulation will lead to reducing the use of environmentally hazardous substances. On the basis of this principle, an alternative composition of an explosive material consisting of a mixture of emulsion matrix and penthrite with the energy efficiency parameters comparable to those of dynamites was developed. The analysis of research results allows concluding that the criteria for substance qualification specified in REACH regulation are insufficient to thoroughly evaluate the safety of its use, and should be supplemented with LCA analysis elements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study attempted to examine how the skewed angle change affects the seismic response of curved and skewed bridges. To this end, a software model of two curved and skewed bridges verified through a field test was obtained. The results showed that the skewed angle change in far-fault zones has no significant effect on the seismic responses of these bridges, while in near-fault zones its effect is remarkable. In ramp bridges, the torsional force increases in the columns next to the abutment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
994,"The Real Time Protocol (RTP) provides a well established mechanism for media transmission that typically relies on the packetization on top of the User Datagram Protocol. One serious problem of datagram based traffic, however, is that highly restrictive firewalls prevent their traversal making Real Time Communication not possible. The alternative of transporting RTP on top of the Transport Control Protocol , while reliable, it is not effective as ever-present network packet loss introduces latency that degrades media quality and negatively affects user experience. In this paper, a scheme that relies on multiplexing media frames over multiple streams is proposed. This mechanism is analyzed through a novel analytical model that links application and network packet loss in the context of wireless multiple stream transport. The model is later validated by means of an experimental framework that relying on state of the art speech codecs and quality metrics quantifies its advantages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
995,"This paper deals with the problem of minimizing roundoff noise and pole sensitivity simultaneously subject to l(2)-scaling constraints for state-space digital filters. A novel measure for evaluating roundoff noise and pole sensitivity is proposed, and an efficient technique for minimizing this measure by jointly optimizing state-space realization and error feedback is explored, namely, the constrained optimization problem at hand is converted into an unconstrained problem and then the resultant problem is solved by employing a quasi-Newton algorithm. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed technique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
996,"Primary health care facilities are widely regarded as the backbone of the South African healthcare system. For this reason, formalised standards such as the 'ideal clinic' and 'national core standards' dictate expected service levels for clinics. Although this is a big step towards the improvement of service delivery at the facilities, the level of uptake of and adherence to these standards is concerning. Service quality plays a huge role in the level of patient satisfaction, and emphasis is placed on the features of quality that are of importance to the patient. To this end, the focus on the patient is an important dimension in healthcare quality management in order to improve the service quality in healthcare facilities. This article provides an overview of quality and how it is managed in the context of clinics in South Africa. It outlines the gaps, aligned with how well quality is managed, from a patient perspective. The paper proposes a decision support framework aimed at continuous improvement of quality in clinics. The tool was developed using the Six Sigma methodology, complemented by service quality assessment instruments. The structure of the tool provides an integrated systematic approach that can assist the healthcare decision-maker in tracking the continuous improvement of processes and activities in clinics. The tool also takes the first step towards digitising a typical paper-based system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
997,"Design research projects are often more complex than initially perceived due to a requirement for novelty, the creativity inherent in the design process, and the limited experience of novice researchers. Also, expectations from institutions and external funding stakeholders must be met. Therefore, a framework was needed to support the research effort in the form of quality research management. The focus of this framework is primarily to align stakeholders. To this end, engineering management methods were consulted to define a quality research management framework that provides review baselines, requirements traceability, and a general process model. The framework is based on the well-known 'house of quality' principle that provides requirements traceability. A series of matrices was developed, with a research validation matrix resulting from the combination of traceability matrices. This matrix allows the allocation of research challenges to a need, concept solutions to research challenges, and specific research solutions to concept solutions. Also, information sources are allocated to challenges and solutions to verify their authenticity. It is thus possible to visualise clearly a summary of the research project. Additional benefits include improved communication, visualisastion of progress, traceability of requirements, and verification and validation, which illustrates the value of quality research management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
998,"GM_PHD (Gaussian mixture of probability hypothesis density) cannot completely track multiple targets, such as the flying birds in the complex low-altitude airspace near the airport, due to the lack of the steps of birth detection, track extraction and death detection. A new algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, which mainly contributes to the following three aspects. First, the k-nearest neighbour algorithm is used to detect the birth of bird targets from measurements which is necessary to construct the birth intensity function. Second, the clustering algorithm is introduced into the probability hypothesis density filter framework to extract the bird targets' tracks from the filtering results. Third, an algorithm is added to detect the death of bird targets for better tracking. The Gaussian mixture implementation of the algorithm denoted as BT_GM_PHD (Bird Tracking GM_PHD) is presented. The test results on simulation and ground-truth data show that the proposed BT_GM_PHD algorithm can effectively track the multiple flying bird targets in the complex low-altitude airspace near the airport, outperforming the GM_PHD filter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
999,"Early detection of anomalies is crucial for maintaining high productivity in industrial plants. To meet that requirement, anomaly detection systems based on adaptive resonance theory (ART) have been developed. Although various anomaly detection methods based on ART have been proposed, their performances have not yet been evaluated systematically. A new anomaly detection criterion is proposed, and the performances of ART-based anomaly detection systems, using different anomaly detection criteria and different anomaly detection structures, are evaluated. The performance evaluation results show that distributed model based systems, which use an ART model for each part of the plant, attain higher anomaly detection performance than that of systems using an ART model for the entire plant. They also show that an anomaly detection system using a new anomaly detection criterion, based on the distance between samples, attains almost the same anomaly detection performance as that of a system using generation of new categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1000,"The aim of this questionnaire survey study is to find out if the three socio-demographic aspects gender, age and household size have any influence on washing-up behaviour and whether people's washing-up behaviour changes due to them. The data was collected via a questionnaire created and carried out by Forum Waschen"" that could be answered by German consumers either on the internet or on the day of sustainable washing created by Forum Waschen"". In addition to the socio-demographic facts, the questionnaire involved questions about both manual and automatic dishwashing. The results of this study vary; some aspects of washing-up behaviour are correlated and some are not. Only some aspects are dependent on gender, more the manual dishwashing behaviour than the automatic. By contrast, most aspects depend on or correlate with the participant's age. The biggest difference between households of different size are the quantities of dishes used and need to be washed per day. Besides the connections to socio-demographic aspects, there are also connections between different aspects of dishwashing behaviour itself, such as the positive correlation between the frequency of changing the tea-towel and its usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
