0,"Noncoding RNAs were not only classified based on their structural variation but also on the basis of their regulatory roles in diverse cellular pathways. During the last two decades, several studies on noncoding RNAs have been reported and now it is well known that they regulate expression of genes involved in diverse biological functions. Therefore, in gene regulatory network, noncoding RNAs are considered as the important top-tier regulators. In Solanaceae plants, several studies on noncoding RNAs especially small noncoding RNAs are reported mostly in Tomato. However, in Capsicum (pepper), one of the most important vegetable crops, belonging to the same family Solanaceae as of Tomato, the identification and characterization of noncoding RNAs are still limited. Furthermore, recently the identification and characterization of long noncoding RNAs are being reported in plants including Solanaceae plants. Therefore, in this chapter, an attempt is being made to highlight the identification and characterization of noncoding RNAs in Capsicum species.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes
1,"Lectins are a divergent group of carbohydrate-binding proteins of non-immune origin that are widely spread in all kingdoms of life. Several postulations have been put forward to describe the physiological obscure functions of plant lectins. Functions such as storage proteins, defensive role against predators or as endogenous enzyme stabilizer were suggested. This work was undertaken to enable further investigation on the possible role of plant lectins. Dry good quality seeds of Erythrina Abyssinica (ErA) and Abrus precatorius (AbP) were germinated under humid conditions for 21 days. Two-gram seeds were harvested and proteins were extracted every other day. Protein content and lectin activity were monitored. The two seeds under study showed that their protein content was gradually degraded. The three isoforms of lectin, obtained by AmS fractionation, also exhibited a gradual decline in their activities, however, they did not follow similar degradation patterns and some of them prevailed active during the entire germination course. These results support the theories that emphasize a physiological, yet to be disclosed significance for legume lectin other than merely being as a storage protein, and may, therefore, represent a mosaic piece in our race for revealing the exact physiology of plant lectin.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

Animal models that involve exposure to organic compounds, teratogenicity studies, or exposure to suboptimal environments during early development often result in deficits in female fertility.

6,"Acrylonitrile (AN) was copolymerized with itaconic acid metal complexes [Co(II),Ni(II),Cu(II)] aiming to synthetize self-colored acrylonitrile fiber. The copolymerization occurred in water at 60 degrees C using sodium bisulfite and potassium persulfate as redox initiators. The resulting copolymers are colored and exhibited high thermal stability as shown from their TGA curves. The investigated copolymers exhibited comparable thermal stability as that of PAN. The AN/itaconic acid Co(NO3)(2) copolymer was considerably the most thermal stable copolymer while that of Ni(II) copolymer was the less stable one. Cu(II) copolymer showed an intermediate stability. The data also revealed that the maximum degradation occurred after 300 degrees C (the cyclization temperature). Thus, neither the copolymerization nor the complexation affected the nitrile oligomerization reaction. The effect of adding ammonium hydroxide solution to acrylonitrile-itaconic acid copper(II) complex copolymer on the thermal stability of copolymer was also studied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"This research has proposed formulas, in which the atomic number and neutron numbers to any element in the periodic table are determined according to element position in the periodic table. These formulas have been arranged to fit with periodic system of elements in the IUPAC's Periodic Table. The main outcome is to introduce layout regularity, which may reflect the regularity of the periodic law more faithfully. In this research, atomic number to any element in the periodic table is predictably calculated by the group and period numbers which were displayed into 7 Periods horizontally, and 18 Groups vertically, determining and dispensing altogether the elements positions at the periodic system. Application of these proposed formulas showed linearity from has good agreement with these separated elements of Lanthanum in the f-block elements (Lanthanides and Actinides), which were in no interruptions in the sequence of increasing atomic numbers. In addition, the relationship of the f-block to the other blocks of the periodic table also becomes easier to see. In addition, the formulas are extensible to expanding future table and allowed determining the atomic number of the future elements starting from 119 till the element of 136, at the main body of the periodic table, and can be used as a simple and alternative method for determine the numbers of atomic and neutron in the IUPAC's Periodic Table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"A novel breakdown (BD) mechanism of shallow impurity (SI) under the electric field at low temperatures is suggested for n-GaAs samples with the donor concentrations 1014cm-3ND1016cm-3 and the compensation degree 0.3K=NA/ND0.8 with acceptors of concentration NA in the external magnetic fields up to H=6.5T, oriented parallel or perpendicular to the external electric field. Diagnosis of the BD mechanism was performed by SI Zeeman (mainly from the ground state 1s to 2p+1 and other excitation states) and cyclotron resonance photoelectric spectroscopy (PES) methods in the wide interval of the electric field including the BD region too. The obtained results reveal that the BD electric field epsilon BD does not correlate with K and the carrier's mobility of the samples, which contradict to the well-known impact ionization mechanism (IIM). A serious discrepancy with IIM is that epsilon BD does not almost depend on the magnetic field up to H=6.5T when epsilon though the SI ionization energy increases two times. The cyclotron resonance (CR) measurements show that the line width does not depend on the electric field for epsilon<epsilon BD, indicating the lack of free-carrier (FC) heating in contradiction with IIM. A considerable decrease of the free carriers' capture cross section (CCS) area by ionized SI centers with a subsequent increase in the FC concentration n is observed by means of PES investigation of the 1s?2p+1 and CR lines in the electric fields epsilon epsilon BD and at different magnetic fields, applied along (H close=) the electric field or perpendicular (H perpendicular to epsilon) to the electric field. The slope of the 1s?2p+1 line intensity on the electric field for epsilon > does not depend on the magnetic field, which is valid for epsilon BD too. Various effects determined in the PES measurements at epsilon=epsilon BD, such as a drastic narrowing of the 1s?2p+1 and CR lines, a shift of the CR line to higher magnetic fields, and disappearing of the lines to higher excited SI states, were clarified to be a result of screening of the SI Coulomb potential by free carriers. The FC screening at the BD reduces the potential fluctuation and its influence to the PES line shape of 1s?2p+1 and other excited states. It is shown that an increase in the FC concentration reduces the CCS, which can be assumed as the main factor along with the increase in the ionization coefficient for the SI breakdown in the electric field. The screening length rs of the SI Coulomb potential decreases with the increasing FC concentration, reducing the CCS; the latter seems to vanish completely at rs=aB (aB is the effective Bohr radius), when high screening results in vanishing of all the bound states of the Coulomb potential. Note that this limit is similar to the Mott transition. Many experimental facts and our calculation of the CCS support the suggested mechanism for the SI breakdown. The well-known IIM is valid for samples with SI concentrations N<<1013cm-3 and takes place at very high electric fields.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"We analyzed the role of serotonergic system in the protection of an organism of different animal species (mice, fish) from lethal doses of bacterial and chemical toxins. In the first series of experiments, peritonitis was induced in mice by i.p. administration of the pathogenic Escherichia coli strain, and the following i.m. administration of the serotonin-modulated anticonsolidation protein (SMAP) significantly increased their survival rate (75 vs. 30%, p < 0.05). In the second series, Western blot analysis showed that i.m. administration of SMAP to mice led after 5 h to a sharp upregulation of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) in the liver. In the third series, carried out on the common carp Cyprinus carpio L., i.m. administration of SMAP prior to putting the fish into water containing a high concentration of a systemic insecticide Actara led to the survival of all individuals in the experimental group over the period of 5 days, whereas in the control (SMAP-free) group the survival rate over the same period was only 35% (p < 0.001). In the fourth series, administration of anti-SMAP polyclonal antibodies to C. carpio caused death of 75% of individuals that were put for 5 days into the water containing the sublethal Actara dose, whereas in the intact and control groups all individuals survived under the same conditions (p < 0.001).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,"The obligate human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae colonizes primarily the mucosal columnar epithelium of the male urethra and the female endocervix. In addition, gonococci can infect the anorectal, pharyngeal, and gingival mucosae and epithelial cells of the conjunctiva. More rarely, the organism can disseminate through the bloodstream, which can involve interactions with other host cell types, including blood vessel endothelial cells and innate immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. ""Disseminated gonococcal infection"" is a serious condition with various manifestations resulting from the seeding of organs and tissues with the pathogen. The host response to gonococcal infection is inflammatory. Knowledge of the biology of gonococcal interactions has been served well through the use of a wide variety of ex vivo models using host tissues and eukaryotic cell monocultures. These models have helped identify bacterial surface adhesins and invasins and the corresponding cell surface receptors that play roles in gonococcal pathogenesis. Furthermore, they have been useful for understanding virulence mechanisms as well as innate and adaptive immune responses. In this chapter, readers are provided with protocols for examining the basic interactions between gonococci and a representative human cell line.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Background: In eukaryotic cells, apoptosis signaling pathways are controlled mainly by aspartic acid cysteine proteases (caspases). However, certain unicellular microorganisms, such as Giardia duodenalis, lack these proteins. Thus, other cysteine proteases may play an important role in the parasite apoptosis signaling pathway. Objective: To understand the effect of cathepsin B-like inhibition on the cell viability of Giardia duodenalis and its cell death process. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify apoptotic proteases. Analysis showed that cathepsin B-like protease genes from G. duodenalis were the best candidate. A homology modeling technique was used to explore in silico the inhibitory effect of E-64 against cathepsin B-like proteases from G. duodenalis genome and to examine the effect of curcumin on cathepsin B-like activity regulation. In addition, the effect of E-64 on parasite survival and DNA fragmentation was tested. Results: Eight cathepsin B-like protease coding genes were identified in silico. Interestingly, while these sequences lacked the cathepsin B characteristic occluding loop, they maintained the catalytic active-site responsible for cathepsin B activity, which was evidenced by the increase in the degradation of the Z-RR-AMC substrate, suggesting the upregulation of the activity of these proteins. Additionally, inhibition of E-64 against G. duodenalis trophozoites caused a decrease in DNA fragmentation compared to control cells and had a positive effect on parasite survival after exposure to curcumin. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggested that Giardia duodenalis might have a cell death mechanism in which cathepsin B-like proteases play an important role.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Mast cells are key effector cells in inflammatory and allergic immune responses such as asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Activation of mast cells leads to immediate release of preformed mediators such as histamine and proteases, which can regulate vascular permeability and the function of a number of immune and nonimmune cells. Engineered nanomaterials (ENM) have been utilized for a wide range of applications and introduced into a number of consumer products; yet the consequent increase in human exposure and any potential adverse effects have not been fully evaluated. Modulation of the immune system function has been shown to be a major toxicological consequence of ENM exposure. The implication of mast cells in ENM-mediated toxicity, including the most widely utilized carbon and metal-based ENMs, has been previously demonstrated; and therefore, understanding direct ENM interaction with mast cells at the cellular and molecular level is of critical importance for the safe implementation of ENMs into consumer products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"This work aims to develop green linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) composites that are commercially viable due to the low cost of the date palm leaflet filler, which is a local renewable resource. The filler was naturally treated with gum arabic solution. FT-IR, XRD, and SEM techniques were used to characterize the samples. The thermal and mechanical properties were measured by TGA, DSC, and tensile testing. The results showed noticeable changes in the properties of the composites compared to those of the original LLDPE sample. TGA revealed TGA revealed that the composite started thermally. The composites started thermally degrading before the original polymer, owing to the degradation of the natural components in the filler. The findings from DSC suggested that the crystallinity was affected. The tensile testing results indicated that the composites were appropriate for applications requiring low tensile strength at break and high Young's modulus. A comparison of these results with earlier ones exhibited that the basic additives in the polymer may have an effect on the filler performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A breakthrough in Agrobacterium-mediated sorghum transformation was achieved with the use of super-binary cointegrate vectors based on plasmid pSB1. However, even with pSB1, transformation capability was restricted to certain sorghum genotypes, excluding most of the important African sorghum varieties.

21,"Calpains are a family of calcium-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases that regulate important physiological processes by substrate cleavage. Despite the fact that the role of calpains in cell migration and other processes has been extensively studied in vitro, the same does not apply to cell migration and morphogenetic events during embryogenesis, in vivo. Herein, we describe the use of three different methods to selectively block calpain activity in vivo in order to investigate the impact on Xenopus gastrulation and neurulation, namely, a calpain inhibitor, a dominant negative, and a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MO).

23,"Background: Acetohydroxyacid Synthase (AHAS) is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of the branched chain amino acids. AHAS is the common target site of five herbicide chemical groups: sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, triazolopyrimidine, pyrimidinyl-thiobenzoates, and sulfonyl-am inocarbonyl-triawlinone Objective: The purification of protein enabled us to study the physical and biochemical properties of the enzyme. In addition in vitro activity of this enzyme was tested in the presence of four different sulfonylureaberbicides and the feedback regulation of enzyme was analyzed in the presence of branched amino acids. Methods: The gene encoding catalytic subunit of rice AHAS (cOsAHAS) without part of the chloroplast transit sequence was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET41a and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as carboxy-terminal extensions of glutathione-S-transferase (GST).The soluble protein was purified using affinity chromatography. The measurement of GST-OsAHAS activity was performed under optimized conditions at present of branched-chain amino acids and sulfonylurea herbicides independently. Results: The optimum pH and temperature for GST-cOsAHAS activity was 8.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The specific activity and Km value of this enzyme toward pyruvate were 0.08 U/mg and 30 mM, respectively.GST-cOsAHAS was inhibited by herbicides tribenuron, sulfosulfuron, nicosulfiiron and bensulfuron while the enzyme was insensitivieto end products. Conclusion: These results suggest that the recombinant form of GST-cOsAHAS is functionally active and carries the binding site for sulfynylurea herbicides. Furthermore, GST-cOsAHAS was insensitive to feedback inhibition by endproducts which indicates the existence of a regulator subunit in rice AHAS as previously has been described in other plant AHASs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

26,"A wide variety of posttranslational modifications of expressed proteins are known to occur in living organisms (Krishna R, Wold F. Post-translational modification of proteins. In: Meister A (ed) Advances in enzymology and related areas of molecular biology. Wiley, New York, 1993, pp 265-296). Although their presence in an organism cannot be predicted from the genome, these modifications can play critical roles in protein structure and function. The identification of posttranslational modifications is critical to our understanding of the functions of proteins involved in important biological pathways and mass spectrometry offers a fast, accurate method for observing them. A combined top-down/bottom-up approach can be used for identification and localization of posttranslational modifications of ribosomal proteins. This chapter describes procedures for analyzing Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins and their modifications by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. It also covers the analysis of gram-negative Caulobacter crescentus and gram-positive Bacillus subtilis ribosomal proteins by electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-QTOF) mass spectrometry.

27,"Background: There is some evidence suggesting an interaction between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Recently, the number of patients who have been diagnosed as asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism among patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has been increasing steadily. Although there are many studies on cardiovascular outcomes in primary hyperparathyroidism, there is not enough data on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism yet. Objective: Our objective was to investigate plasma renin levels and aldosterone concentrations in patients with asymptomatic PHPT. Study design: 32 patients with asymptomatic PHPT and 22 healthy control subjects were recruited for this study. Materials and methods: The levels of renin, aldosterone concentration, PTH, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, and creatinine clearance were investigated. Results: Median PTH and calcium levels were higher and phosphorus levels were lower in patients with asymptomatic PHPT than control group (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of plasma renin levels (5.9 (3.3 - 9.0) vs. 5.0 (1.8 - 14.5) mU/L, p = 0.62) and aldosterone concentrations (95.0 (52.3 - 132.4) vs. 105.9 (93.2 - 206.5) pg/mL, p = 0.08) between the groups. Also, there were no correlations between calcium, PTH levels and renin levels and aldosterone concentrations (p > 0.05).

28,"Small RNAs in bacteria are noncoding RNAs that act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Over time, they have gained importance as fine-tuners of expression of genes involved in critical biological processes like metabolism, fitness, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. The availability of various high-throughput strategies enable the detection of these molecules but are technically challenging and time-intensive. Thus, to fulfil the need of a simple computational algorithm pipeline to predict these sRNAs in bacterial species, we detail a user-friendly ensemble method with specific application in Acinetobacter spp. The developed algorithms primarily look for intergenic regions in the genome of related Acinetobacter spp., thermodynamic stability, and conservation of RNA secondary structures to generate a model input for the sRNAPredict3 tool which utilizes all this information to generate a list of putative sRNA. We confirmed the accuracy of the method by comparing its output with the RNA-seq data and found the method to be faster and more accurate for Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978. Thus, this method improves the identification of sRNA in Acinetobacter and other bacterial species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, LEP is extracted from the LAB cell wall digestion fraction using Blue Native PAGE. Then LEP is identified by the elimination activity of LPS on gel pieces. Results show that the LEP is an approx. 200 kDa protein part of heat shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.

30,"Highly soluble and stable proteins are desirable for many different applications, from basic science to reaching a cancer patient in the formof a biological drug. For X-ray crystallography-where production of a protein crystal might take weeks and even months-a stable protein sample of high purity and concentration can greatly increase the chances of producing a well-diffracting crystal. For a patient receiving a specific protein drug, its safety, efficacy, and even cost are factors affected by its solubility and stability. Increased protein expression and protein stability can be achieved by randomly altering the coding sequence. As the number of mutants generated might be overwhelming, a powerful protein expression and stability screen is required. In this chapter, we describe a colony filtration technology, which allows us to screen random mutagenesis libraries for increased thermal stability-the Hot CoFi blot. We share how to create the random mutagenesis library, how to perform the Hot CoFi blot, and how to identify more thermally stable clones. We use the Tobacco Etch Virus protease as a target to exemplify the procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

36,"Background: In recent years, the rapid growth of biological datasets in Bioinformatics has made the computation of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) become extremely slow. Using the GPU to accelerate MSA has shown to be an effective approach. Moreover, there is a trend that many bioinformatic researchers or institutes setup a shared server for remote users to submit MSA jobs via provided web-pages or tools. Objective: Given the fact that different MSA jobs submitted by users often process similar datasets, there can be an opportunity for users to share their computation results between each other, which can avoid the redundant computation and thereby reduce the overall computing time. Furthermore, in the heterogeneous CPU/GPU platform, many existing applications assign their computation on GPU devices only, which leads to a waste of the CPU resources. Co-run computation can increase the utilization of computing resources on both CPUs and GPUs by dispatching workloads onto them simultaneously. Methods: In this paper, we propose an efficient MSA system called GMSA for multi-users on shared heterogeneous CPU/GPU platforms. To accelerate the computation of jobs from multiple users, data sharing is considered in GMSA due to the fact that different MSA jobs often have a percentage of the same data and tasks. Additionally, we also propose a scheduling strategy based on the similarity in datasets or tasks between MSA jobs. Furthermore, co-run computation model is adopted to take full use of both CPUs and GPUs. Results: We use four protein datasets which were redesigned according to different similarity. We compare GMSA with ClustalW and CUDA-ClustalW in multiple users scenarios. Experiments results showed that GMSA can achieve a speedup of up to 32X. Conclusion: GMSA is a system designed for accelerating the computation of MSA jobs with shared input datasets on heterogeneous CPU/GPU platforms. In this system, a strategy was proposed and implemented to find the common datasets among jobs submitted by multiple users, and a scheduling algorithm is presented based on it. To utilize the overall resource of both CPU and GPU, GMSA employs the co-run computation model. Results showed that it can speed up the total computation of jobs efficiently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"High-throughput targeted repeat element bisulfite sequencing (HT-TREBS) is designed to assay the methylation level of individual retrotransposon loci of a targeted family, in a locus-specific manner, and on a genome-wide scale. Briefly, genomic DNA is sheared and ligated to Ion Torrent A adaptors (with methylated cytosines), followed by bisulfite-conversion, and amplification with primers designed to bind the targeted retrotransposon. Since the primers carry the Ion Torrent P1 adaptor as a 5'-extension, the amplified library is ready to be size-selected and sequenced on a next-generation sequencing platform. Once sequenced, each retrotransposon is mapped to a particular genomic locus, which is achieved through ensuring at least a 10-bp overlap with flanking unique sequence, followed by the calculation of methylation levels of the mapped retrotransposon using a BiQ Analyzer HT. A complete protocol for library construction as well as the bioinformatics for HT-TREBS is described in this chapter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"The necessity of taking into account various factors in the process of improvement of the territory of preschool institutions (PI) is considered. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach, associated with the great importance of healthy and proper education of the growing generation. By authors it is established that the landscape organization of the territory of preschool institutions with a set of planning elements, subordinates to the general plan, despite the obvious appeal, can meet serious obstacles in the form of need of zoning of the site for groups of children of different age. Laying of the ""an ecological track"" playing an important role in the system of accumulation by each child of personal experience of the correct interaction with the nature can be the decision. By authors it is also shown that the correct planning of the territory of preschool institutions is impossible without competent solution of questions of gardening.

The physical properties of PDDD were characterized by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, as well as viscosity and solubility measurements. The anticancer, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activity of PDDD were evaluated to investigate its potential biomedical applications. Good results were obtained. It is evident that the copolyester exhibits favorable and tunable physical, thermal and biological properties and so is a suitable candidate for biomedical applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonvascular land plants, like the ancestors of modern mosses, are believed to have been among the first plants to occupy the land. To understand the evolutional history of shoot phototropism in land plants, we have established a system for experimentally studying phototropism in gametophores of the moss Physcomitrella patens. Here we will describe the key points in our system, including obtaining etiolated gametophores, the light sources used for inducing bending, and the methods for evaluation of phototropic responses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of protein function can be greatly assisted by grouping proteins with their neighbors. Rather than relying on affinity, proximity labeling targets proteins proximal to the target of interest.

43,"The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery comprises five complexes that act sequentially to recruit and cluster transmembrane cargo proteins (ESCRT-0), drive membrane curving (ESCRT-I and II), catalyze fission of cargo-containing vesicles (ESCRT-III and VPS/VTA1), and disassemble and recycle the ESCRT-III complex (VPS/VTA1). Since interactions between ESCRT components and cellular or microbial proteins are typically weak, transient, and involve membrane proteins, they are often difficult to study by standard technologies. Here, we describe the utility of high-throughput proteinfragment complementation assays based on the reconstitution of a split luciferase reporter to screen for interactions between any protein and a library of ESCRT proteins in mammalian cells and provide a detailed protocol for these assays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

46,"Insertion sequences are small mobile regions of DNA (transposable elements) found primarily in prokaryotes. The identification of insertion sequences in bacteria is a growing field of study because of their applications in evolution, genetics, and medicine. One of the first steps in characterizing the insertion sequences found in an organism is to perform a genome-wide survey to identify all insertion sequences using in silico methods. This includes a thorough scan of the genome to locate all copies of different families of insertion sequences and the identification of the key characteristics of each element. The results provide an extensive catalog of the insertion sequences which can be used to further other analyses or manipulation of the genome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"In the past two decades, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and array CGH have become indispensable tools in clinical diagnostics and toxicological risk assessment. Initially developed for the genome-wide screening of chromosomal imbalances, that is, copy-number variations in tumor cells, both CGH and array CGH have been employed in genotoxicology and most recently in toxicogenomics. The latter allows a multi-end point analysis of how particular genes react to toxic agents, revealing changes in signaling pathways and other underlying molecular mechanisms. This chapter provides background on the use of CGH and array CGH in the context of genotoxicology, and also a protocol for conventional CGH, so that the basic principles of this methodology can be better understood. Conventional and array CGH investigate DNA expression patterns, copy-number variations across the whole genome, and loss of heterozygosity after genotoxic damage. Array CGH is still cost-intensive but produces exponentially more data, requiring suitable analytical algorithms and sophisticated bioinformatic analysis. As toxicogenomics is an emerging sub-discipline of toxicology research, effectively evaluating toxicogenomic microarray data can be hugely advantageous for human risk assessment, even though international regulatory guidelines on toxicogenomics have yet to be fully agreed and implemented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays allow for the study of protein-DNA interactions in physiological contexts. Briefly, ChIPs consist of the purification and enrichment of a protein of interest together with its associated chromatin and its later identification. Hence, this technique proves to be particularly useful when assessing novel target genes for nuclear receptors. In the field of metabolic liver diseases, the validation of putative nuclear receptor targets is key for furthering the development of nuclear receptor modulators as therapeutic compounds. In this chapter, the protocol described has been optimized for ChIP on mouse fatty (steatotic) livers. Thanks to the use of a ""two-step"" (double) cross-linking method, this protocol can also be used for the study of other proteins with weaker interactions or that are present in large complexes, such as cofactors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

51,"The activity of innovation relations in the economic system depends on external and internal factors inherent in different phases of the economic cycle. The most important factor is the parameters of demand for innovative objects of different nature. It is these parameters that determine the strategy of a small innovative enterprise (MIP) during periods of recession, depression, and economic activity in the country. So, for example, let us ask ourselves what strategy MIP should use during the recession, what products of its activity should it bring to the market? The most common answer to this question is that it is necessary to bring to the market innovations of only incremental nature at extremely low prices. This is explained by a decrease in the level of income of the population due to rising unemployment, bankruptcy of enterprises and other reasons. At the same time, this approach does not take into account the most important factor - the stratification of the population by income level. Having estimated the degree of this stratification, MIP can significantly change its strategy. For such an assessment, you can use the well-known Ginny coefficient. The Ginny coefficient (income concentration index) characterizes the degree of deviation of the actual distribution of monetary incomes of the population from the line of their uniform distribution. The value of the coefficient can vary from 0 to 1, at the same time, the higher the value of the indicator, the more unevenly distributed income in the society. During the recession, the degree of population stratification in the Russian Federation has grown. Thus, according to the data of the State Statistics Committee of the Russian Federation in 2018, the Ginny coefficient indicates an increase in the degree of population stratification by income level, and therefore, in terms of demand parameters for objects of innovation of a different nature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"In the framework of the measurement system used by Russian statistics, it is possible to identify those industries that provide the largest share in the cost of products and services in the region, as well as show good dynamics of development and economic efficiency. However, the current classifiers are focused on data aggregation within the industry, therefore, based only on the basis of the State Statistics Committee, clusters cannot be identified (or, when this is done at the all-Russian level, it is possible with a large degree of conditionality). Therefore, in order to further analyze the industry enterprises (which of them are included and which are not included in the cluster under study), it is necessary to conduct a primary statistical survey, which requires a survey. The questionnaire provides questions regarding: general resources, with the help of which it is planned to single out the cluster core, the performance indicators of these enterprises, with which it is supposed to evaluate further development trends of the cluster. The effectiveness of the influence of the cluster form of processing raw materials on regional economic systems is due to the development of partnerships between business entities. The cluster form of activity in the commodity sector, organized in the form of horizontal rather than vertical ties, is particularly relevant in the conditions of high monopolization of oil producing companies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chapter provides generalities regarding some important aspects of plant lipolytic enzymes from either higher plants or algae, such as sources, reactions catalyzed, and specificities.

Plant lipases and phospholipases are ubiquitous proteins found either in basic or higher organs of plants. This chapter provides an overview of the diverse functions of these enzymes. The chapter addresses the issue of the importance regarding the functions of plant lipolytic enzymes (i.e., lipases and phospholipases) and their different forms not only for plants but also for external applications. The commercial exploitation of such plant proteins as industrial enzymes would be made as a potentially attractive alternative.

In fact, plant lipases have interesting features, particularly biochemical properties (e.g., pH and temperature), and with respect to their specific hydrolytic properties would make these enzymes alternative remedies for treatment of many diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and of pancreatic insufficiency with exogenous plant acid stable lipases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,"Plant phospholipases C (PLCs) that hydrolyze the phosphodiesteric linkages of the head group of phospholipids can be grouped into three major types-non-specific PLC (NPC), phosphoinositide-specific PLC (PI-PLC), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-PLC-according to the specificity of substrate and the cellular functions. After an overview of the main features in these plant enzymes, a case study of oat (Avena sativa) PI-PLCs isoforms is presented in this chapter to highlight insights into structure characterization of such predicted isozymes. Although oat PI-PLCs could not be purified to homogeneity due to their association with other proteins, particularly the actin cytoskeleton, the intended enzymes could be identified, analyzed, and characterized by functional proteomics, bioinformatics, and in silico approaches. In this chapter, sequence and structure analyses, as well as phylogenetic evolution of the predicted oat PI-PLCs, were reported to show the specific motifs and the main putative catalytic residues characteristics of such plant enzymes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the chapter, functional proteomics and bioinformatic approaches were used to identify and characterize isoforms of oat PLD. Insights into structural characterization of oat predicted isozymes were analyzed using in silico approaches. Primary structures were analyzed, and a phylogeny analysis and protein motif/domain identification were presented. A multiple sequence alignment of the putative oat PLD revealed consensus sequences with the well-known important putative catalytic residues characterized by such enzymes.

The chapter suggests a strategy based on the phylogenetic distribution and homology conservation in plant lipolytic enzymes for possible depiction of their biological evolution. Extensive databases and online resources for lipidomics and related areas are useful tools to analyze the different lipolytic enzymes in the three major super kingdoms of life, including higher plants kingdom and confined organisms such as algae that have recently gained much interest due to their promising potential applications in lipids hydrolysis and biosynthesis. Multiple sequence alignments of the identified lipolytic enzymes from databases could serve to the identification of globally conserved residues as well as conserved sequence motifs.

Recent studies have revealed that the zinc transporters, especially zinc importers belonging to the Zrt-Irt-like (ZIP) family, play crucial roles in skin homeostasis. Fourteen ZIP members have been identified in humans, with at least 6 members being related to skin development and maintenance. ZIP1, ZIP2, ZIP4, and ZIP10 are associated with epidermal morphogenesis and disorders, whereas ZIP7 and ZIP13 are essential for dermis formation and collagen metabolism. Mouse models in combination with clinical data have shown the molecular pathogenic mechanisms involving ZIP members. Although other family members have not been well studied with respect to their role in the skin, their direct or indirect associations are also considerable and they are believed to be drug targets for skin diseases. Therefore, precise analysis and understanding of ZIP family members are indispensable for the care and treatment of skin disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a desperate need for a better understanding of the basic biology of these tumors, in order to devise novel, more specific and effective therapeutics. The handling of GBM represents a daunting challenge to clinicians, also considering the few therapeutic options available, none of which can significantly alter the inevitable lethal outcome of these tumors. Hence, the development of effective therapies would greatly benefit from the availability of in vivo GBM models that can reliably mimic the characteristics of malignant cells and the features of the human disease. Candidate new drugs have to be tested in these in vivo models by adopting settings concerning direct intra-brain delivery in order to define their overall therapeutic efficacy under clinical-like conditions.

67,"The cellular components of the enteric nervous system (ENS), namely enteric neurons and glia, display plasticity and respond to environmental cues deriving from growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, and cell-surface molecules, both in physiological and pathological conditions. ECM, in particular, provides an important framework for the enteric microenvironment and influences the homeostasis of myenteric neuronal circuitries. Isolation of pure myenteric plexus preparations from adult tissue permits to investigate changes in the ENS involving specific ECM, such as hyaluronan. This approach is based upon the possibility to isolate myenteric ganglia from the intestinal wall of either adult animals or humans, after microdissection and subsequent enzymatic digestion of the tissue. Enteric ganglia are free of connective tissue, extracellular collagen, and blood vessels, and thus treatment of intact intestinal segments with highly purified collagenases permits ganglia isolation from the surrounding smooth muscle cells. In this chapter, we describe methods for visualizing HA in isolated primary cultures of adult rat small intestine myenteric ganglia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Key methodologies used include gel filtration chromatography, glycerol density gradient analysis, multi-angle light scattering, liposome co-flotation, and single-liposome fluorescence microscopy. Collectively, these studies have enabled us to define subunit stoichiometry of soluble C. elegans ESCRT complexes and to demonstrate that the late-acting ESCRT-III complex facilitates membrane bending and remodeling, at least in part by virtue of its ability to sense the curvature of lipid bilayers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

70,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) continues to cause outbreaks of viral hepatitis, which remains a socially significant disease despite existing vaccines. During the production of vaccines, HAV strains that require prolonged incubation of infected cell cultures, up to 4 weeks, are used. Several HAV strains, which are fast-growing on cell cultures, up to 7-10 days, are known. This paper presents the results of virological characterization and analysis of the genome of the HAV strain MB-7/293 (HepA-293) derived from MB-7/4647, one of the fast-growing strains, which was obtained by adapting it to HEK293 cell culture (human embryonic kidney cells). It was shown that the MB-7/293 strain significantly exceeds the parent MB-7/4647 strain in productivity when cultured on HEK293 cell culture, i.e., in the yield of the infectious virus and the virus-specific antigen. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of full-length genomic RNA of the MB-7/293 strain showed that it differs from the genome sequence of MB-7/4647 in three nucleotide substitutions in the 5'-untranslated region and 20 nucleotide substitutions in the coding region, which lead to substitutions of ten amino acid residues in the proteins VP3, VP1, 2B and 2C. Comparative analysis of the genomic sequences of the strains MB-7/293, MB-7/4647, and other HAV strains, including the previously described fast-growing strains, allowed to reveal mutations that affect the reproductive properties of the virus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"The genetic improvement of field crops through plant breeding and genetic modification is highly dependent on understanding, measuring, selecting, and manipulating phenotypes. Most phenotypes result from the complex interaction of a crop's genetics with the environment and management practices in which that crop is grown. Linking gene to phenotype in field environments to create superior crop varieties can therefore be challenging, particularly for genetically complex traits that are difficult to measure. This chapter is designed to help readers overcome these difficulties by describing tools and techniques used in successful crop improvement programs. It provides methodologies that can be broadly applied across numerous situations irrespective of field crop, environment, modest financial resources, or other factors. The chapter's focus is primarily on small- and large-scale, replicated, research plot-based screening trials since these trials are crucial, ubiquitous, and costly for both public- and private-sector crop improvement programs. To ease the understanding of the protocols discussed, this chapter's materials and methods section is composed of ten subsections, with each subsection covering a critical portion of the field crop phenotyping process: regulatory, environmental, and safety considerations; trait identification and prioritization; environment characterization; field site selection; experimental design; field design, preparation, and management; crop and soil measurements; environmental monitoring; in-field data recording; and data management and analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

73,"Visualizing tooth organs from their earliest inception as they actually appear in three dimensions has, until recently, been difficult due to the technical obstacle of imaging these tiny, translucent, low-density embryonic craniodental tissues. Related to this obstacle, quantifying craniodental morphology has been confounded by the time consuming need to physically section and then digitally photograph and reconstruct these images of tissues into 3D volumes. Here we provide a simple solution in the form of an overnight silver albumin tissue stain for whole embryos. Because it is differentially absorbed by embryonic tissues, this stain generates the contrast needed to detect and visualize unmineralized dental tissues. Stained specimens can be scanned using either desktop or synchrotron micro-computed tomography systems, generating digital 3D datasets of whole embryos that can immediately be used to assess dental morphology and histology. Craniodental structures can then be measured with high precision and accuracy using 3D image analysis software.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of this process in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling has been fully demonstrated for many different receptors. For direct interactions, determining the interface regions, on beta-arrestins and on the partners, is crucial for understanding the function of the complex. Indeed, this brings information on which proteins can interact simultaneously with beta-arrestins, or, on the contrary, which partners are exclusive.

Western blotting using serum allows us to identify a protein within an allergenic extract that specifically binds to a serum antibody, immunoglobulin E. This specific IgE binding protein can then be detected with a highly sensitive chemiluminescence detection substrate. Proteins detected by western blotting can be analyzed by mass spectrometry following an in-gel digestion protocol. The protein band of interest is excised from the gel and digested with trypsin to form peptides. Mass spectrometry will almost certainly have a pre-chromatographic step in which these peptides are separated before becoming ionized and entering a mass analyzer.

79,"Objective: Is there any relationship between nutritional status and the status of trace elements in patients with advanced head and neck cancer? Material and methods: We have analyzed the register data of 42 head and neck cancer patients. Survival data of 22 women and 20 men were included. The mean age was 67.3 +/- 10.77 years. Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) was measured by Biocorpus 4000 RX (MEDIcal Health Care GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and was summarized in individual phase angle (PA) of each patient. Trace elements (selenium, zinc, iron) were measured in serum samples at the same time, so we got individual data sets for each patient. Results: Patients with normal PA > 5.0 degrees have a significantly better survival (p = 0.016). The median survival time is 13.84 months (range 0.69 - 125.19) in malnourished patients (PA < 5.0) compared to 51.16 months (range 7.02 - 116.79) in normally nourished head and neck cancer (HNC) patients (PA > 5.0). Age-adjusted body mass index has a similar impact on prognosis (p = 0.068) in the investigated study groups. Trace element (TE) deficits are seen more often in PA < 5.0 degrees patients for selenium (p = 0.064) and zinc (p = 0.116). No relationship between nutritional status and TE status was seen for iron. Conclusion: BIA is able to document the impact of malnutrition on survival in the group of head and neck cancer patients. Furthermore, it filters the selenium- and zinc-deficient patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this paper is to review the hedging instruments in Russia and abroad and to identify the effectiveness of their use. In addition, attention is paid to the comparison of the applied financial instruments for hedging currency risks in Russia and in countries that are the world financial centers. We also revealed some differences in the management and use of methods aimed at monitoring the economic condition of credit institutions. Presumably, they are related to the specifics of economic activity in the country, financial literacy on a mass scale and historical prerequisites, expressed in the still fragile and relatively young banking and economic system as a whole. After the comparison and analysis of possible options for implementing the financial management levers, we have presented a theoretical hedging model, which is designed to help reducing the risks of currency losses in the conditions of macroeconomic instability.

81,"Amyloid- peptide (1-42) (A(1-42)) is a key player in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related pathologies, determined by formation of protein aggregates in the central nervous system. A(1-42) binding to crucial intracellular targets (and their subsequent inactivation) obviously represents one of the earliest events preceding extracellular pathogenic oligomerization/aggregation of A(1-42). It is reasonable to expect that dissociation of the A(1-42) complexes with intracellular proteins by means of inhibitors followed by subsequent degradation of A(1-42) would not only protect critically important proteins but also prevent intracellular accumulation of ?(1-42). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the neuroprotector isatin (100 mu M) on interaction of known A-binding proteins, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and pyruvate kinase, with A(1-42) and its fragments (A(1-28), A(12-28), A(25-35)). A(1-42) and its fragments (A(1-28), A(12-28), A(25-35)) immobilized on the Biacore optical biosensor chip interacted with GAPDH and pyruvate kinase. The lowest and basically equal K-d values were determined for GAPDH and pyruvate kinase complexes with immobilized A(1-42) and A(25-35). The presence of 100 mu M isatin caused a significant (more than fivefold) increase in the K-d values for GAPDH complexes with all A peptides except A(1-28). In contrast to GAPDH isatin increased dissociation of pyruvate kinase complexes only with A(1-42) (causing a 30-fold increase in K-d) and to a lesser extent with A(12-28) and A(25-35) (a 10-fold increase in the K(d)value). It should be noted that in the presence of isatin the K-d values for GAPDH and pyruvate kinase complexes with all A studied were in a narrower concentration range (10(-7) M-10(-6) M) than in the absence of this neuroprotector (10(-8) M-10(-6) M). Data obtained suggest existence of principal possibility of (pharmacological) protection of crucial intracellular targets against both A(1-42), and its aggressive truncated peptides (A(25-35)).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We understand that there are approaches not covered here and appreciate that alternative strategies have their own value and utility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"Bioinformatics applies unbiased approaches to develop statistically robust insight into health and disease. At the global, or ""20,000 ft"" view bioinformatic analyses of NR signaling can measure how the NRs are implicated in human health and disease through the impact of genome-wide significant genetic variation, family-wide NR expression patterns or considering where NRs are significantly identified in other high-dimensional data analyses. With a more NR-centric, or ""2000 ft"" view, bioinformatic approaches can interrogate events downstream of a given NR. Integrative approaches aim to combine multiple NR-centric high-dimensional data both derived in cell models and primary human tissue to reveal how NR-transcriptional networks relate to human health and disease. Bioinformatic approaches to such high-dimensional data are central and require specialist statistical insight and computational skills, coupled with a dexterous understanding of the biological question. A current challenge is determining the optimal mechanism to share such bioinformatic approaches through the biological research community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,"Calcium (Ca2+) is a key player in cardiomyocyte homeostasis, and its roles span from excitation-contraction coupling to metabolic and structural signaling. Alterations in the function or expression of Ca2+-handling proteins are common findings in failing cardiomyocytes, which have been linked to impaired contractility and detrimental remodeling of the cellular structure. For these reasons, the study of intracellular Ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes represents a central method in experimental molecular cardiology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"Mass spectrometry is a sensitive and selective analytical technique that enables detection and quantitation of low abundance compounds in a complex sample matrix. Targeted metabolomics allows for quantitative analysis of metabolites, providing kinetic information of production and consumption rates, an essential step to investigate microbial metabolism. Here, we describe a targeted metabolomics protocol for yeast samples, from sample preparation to mass spectrometry analysis, which enables the identification of metabolic fluxes after xylose consumption. Sample preparation methods were optimized for quenching of yeast metabolism followed by intracellular metabolite extraction, using cold methanol and boiling ethanol protocols. Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) methods using ion pair chromatography (IPC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) allowed for the quantitation of 18 metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle). The protocol here described was successfully applied to quantify metabolites in Scheffersomyces stipitis, Spathaspora passalidarum, Spathaspora arborariae, and Candida tenuis samples after xylose consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

89,"IgG(4) and its role in immune tolerance has been investigated widely. Symptom reduction and improved clinical outcomes in immunotherapy trials are associated with significant increases in allergen-specific IgG(4) antibodies. Natural immune tolerance observed in beekeepers and cat owners has also been associated with elevated levels of bee venom and cat allergen-specific IgG(4), respectively. Functionally, allergen-specific IgG(4) has been shown to reduce the binding of IgE-allergen complexes to B cells, a key step in the initiation of the type 1 hypersensitivity allergic response. In laboratory animal allergy, IgG(4) has been described as a ""protective/blocking"" antibody. However, a consensus on the exact relationship between exposure, IgG(4), and tolerance has yet to be reached. In this chapter, we review the factors that require consideration when developing an ELISA for the quantification of allergen-specific IgG(4).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,"The discovery of biomarkers is considered a critical step towards an improved clinical management of psychiatric disorders. Despite the availability of advanced computational approaches, the lack of strong individual predictors of clinically relevant outcomes, combined with the usually high dimensionality, significantly hamper the identification of such markers. Consistent with the often observed lack of diagnostic specificity of biological alterations, research suggests an underlying genetic pleiotropy between psychiatric illnesses and frequently comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular illnesses. As research is transitioning away from conventional diagnostic delineations towards a dimensional understanding of psychiatric illness, gaining insight into such pleiotropy and its downstream biological effects bears promise for identification of clinically useful biomarkers. In this review, we summarize the computational methods for identifying biological markers indexing pleiotropic effects and discuss recent research findings in this context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III proteins are known to assemble into filaments that mediate membrane remodeling and fission in various biological processes, including the formation of endosomal multivesicular bodies, viral budding, cytokinesis, plasma membrane repair, nuclear pore quality control, nuclear envelope reformation, and neuron pruning. The study of the regulation and function of ESCRT-III proteins is therefore crucial to understand these events and requires a combination of in vivo and in vitro experimental techniques. Here we describe two protocols for the purification of human and Drosophila ESCRT-III proteins from bacteria and their use in in vitro phosphorylation assays and atomic force microscopy experiments on membrane lipid bilayers. These protocols can also be applied for the purification of other proteins that are insoluble when expressed in bacteria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"During exposure of cells to acute high dose-rate ionizing radiation (IR), oxidants from the radiolysis of water can overwhelm antioxidant systems. Protecting flora from the effects of IR released from a nuclear industry of increasing global significance and managing the growth of plants during space flight both necessitate estimating the effects of chronic low dose-rate exposure to IR. In contrast to effects at acute high-dose rates, under chronic low dose-rate exposure it is subtle, progressive, long-term effects on antioxidant systems that it is important to estimate. Here, we outline a method that combines biochemical measurement and mathematical modeling to predict the effects of chronic low dose-rate IR on redox potential in plant cells over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"The gene expression of the extracellular matrix macromolecules is critical in the analysis of various pathologies. The use of a RT-PCR directly on a fixed tissue enables the recognition of the real expressing cells for any ECM molecules together with the tissue localization. The method here described is easy to performusing the same material as for common immunostaining and the same primers used for quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, the used primers, designed with a final amplicon that spans the exon-exon junction, allow to detect the cDNA but not the gDNA sequences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"Detecting calpain activity in Drosophila tissues is a fundamental tool to study calpain function. We use differential centrifugation to prepare membrane- versus cytosol-enriched fractions for measuring calpain activity with the fluorogenic substrate N-LY-AMC. With this method one can measure calpain A activity in wild-type flies and in several mutant fly backgrounds, revealing a strong correlation between in situ membrane distribution and in vitro determined activity measurements. Here we describe the steps for tissue preparation and calpain activity measurement in the Drosophila embryo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"Outer membrane and secreted proteins in Gram-negative bacteria constitute a high percentage of virulence factors that are critical in disease initiation and progression. Despite their importance, it is often difficult to study these proteins due to challenges with expression and purification. Here we present a suite of vectors for the inducible expression of N-terminally 6His-tagged outer membrane, periplasmic, and secreted proteins in E. coli and show this system to be capable of producing milligram quantities of pure protein for downstream functional and structural analysis. This system can not only be used to purify recombinant virulence factors for structural and functional studies but can also be used to create gain-of--function E. coli for use in phenotypic screens, and examples of each are provided herein.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"MicroRNAs regulate genes involved in various biological processes and may play oncogenic or tumor suppressive roles. Many studies have investigated the relationships between microRNAs and their target genes using mRNA and microRNA expression data. Integrating different types of molecular data could lead to a better understanding of the regulatory network of disease-causing pathways. For this potential to be fully realized, methods for properly integrating omics data are necessary. Here, the computational methods for addressing these challenges are described, and key considerations for analyzing and interpreting profiling data are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"Cancer cells are known to inactivate tumor suppressor proteins by triggering their anomalous subcellular location. It has been well established that the aberrant location of FOXO proteins is linked to tumor formation, progression of the same, or resistance to anti-neoplastic treatment. Furthermore, the abnormal location of FOXO has also been considered a potential biomarker for diabetic complications or longevity in different organisms. Here, we describe the immunodetection of endogenous FOXO by confocal microscopy, which can be used as a chemical tool to quantify FOXO expression levels, its cellular location, and even its active/inactive forms with relevant antibodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"Brucella spp. are bacteria that naturally infect a variety of domesticated and wild animals leading to abortions and infertility, and these bacteria are also capable of causing debilitating human infections, which often result from human exposure to infected animals and animal products. The brucellae are intracellular pathogens that reside in host cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, and it is paramount for the pathogenesis of Brucella that the bacteria are able to survive and replicate in these host cells. The methods outlined in this chapter can be employed to study the interactions between Brucella strains and primary murine peritoneal macrophages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT qPCR) is widely used for assessing the levels of expression of specific genes in various organisms. Here we describe a RT qPCR assay designed to determine the level of expression of fHbp in multiple isolates of Neisseria meningitidis. The level of expression is measured by a two-step qPCR and is associated with a promoter region analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
