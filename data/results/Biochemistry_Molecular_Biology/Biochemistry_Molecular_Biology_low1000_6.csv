0,"An algorithm to extract kinetics of the ion radical bands from the strong absorption background in the transient absorption spectra of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centers upon femtosecond excitation of the primary electron donor is suggested. The rising kinetics of the transient absorption band at 1020 nm and the bleaching kinetics of the 545-nm band constructed using the proposed method are adequately fitted by the kinetic equations for sequential electron transfer from the excited primary donor to the B-A (monomeric bacteriochlorophyll) molecule, and then to the H-A (bacteriopheophytin serving as an electron acceptor) molecule with the rate constants of 3.5 +/- 0.2 and 0.8 +/- 0.1 ps, respectively. The kinetics of the bacteriochlorophyll absorption band at 600 nm shows both the ultrafast bleaching of the P-870 dimer and slower bleaching of the B-A monomer due to its transition to the anion radical. The plotted kinetics of the ion radical bands is in agreement with the concentration profiles of the charge-separated states produced by the global target analysis of experimental data using the model of sequential electron transfer in the reaction centers.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
1,"Many biological studies involve either (i) manipulating some aspect of a cell or its environment and then simultaneously measuring the effect on thousands of genes, or (ii) systematically manipulating each gene and then measuring the effect on some response of interest. A common challenge that arises in these studies is to explain how genes identified as relevant in the given experiment are organized into a subnetwork that accounts for the response of interest. The task of inferring a subnetwork is typically dependent on the information available in publicly available, structured databases, which suffer from incompleteness. However, a wealth of potentially relevant information resides in the scientific literature, such as information about genes associated with certain concepts of interest, as well as interactions that occur among various biological entities. We contend that by exploiting this information, we can improve the explanatory power and accuracy of subnetwork inference in multiple applications. Here we propose and investigate several ways in which information extracted from the scientific literature can be used to augment subnetwork inference. We show that we can use literature-extracted information to (i) augment the set of entities identified as being relevant in a subnetwork inference task, (ii) augment the set of interactions used in the process, and (iii) support targeted browsing of a large inferred subnetwork by identifying entities and interactions that are closely related to concepts of interest. We use this approach to uncover the pathways involved in interactions between a virus and a host cell, and the pathways that are regulated by a transcription factor associated with breast cancer. Our experimental results demonstrate that these approaches can provide more accurate and more interpretable subnetworks. Integer program code, background network data, and pathfinding code are available at https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/subnetwork_inference Author summary There is a multitude of publicly available databases that contain information about biological entities (i.e., genes, proteins, and other small molecules) as well as information about how these entities interact together. However, these databases are often incomplete. There is a wealth of information present in the text of the scientific literature that is not yet available in these databases. Using tools that mine the scientific literature we are able to extract some of this potentially relevant information. In this work we show how we can use publicly available databases in conjunction with the information extracted from the scientific literature to infer the networks that are involved in specific biological processes, such as viral replication and cancer tumor growth.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes
2,"Background: Understanding how neuronal signals propagate in local network is an important step in understanding information processing. As a result, spike trains recorded with multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) have been widely used to study the function of neural networks. Studying the dynamics of neuronal networks requires the identification of both excitatory and inhibitory connections. The detection of excitatory relationships can robustly be inferred by characterizing the statistical relationships of neural spike trains. However, the identification of inhibitory relationships is more difficult: distinguishing endogenous low firing rates from active inhibition is not obvious. New method: In this paper, we propose an in silico interventional procedure that makes predictions about the effect of stimulating or inhibiting single neurons on other neurons, and thereby gives the ability to accurately identify inhibitory effects. Comparison: To experimentally test these predictions, we have developed a Neural Circuit Probe (NCP) that delivers drugs transiently and reversibly on individually identified neurons to assess their contributions to the neural circuit behavior. Results: Using the NCP, putative inhibitory connections identified by the in silico procedure were validated through in vitro interventional experiments.

3,"FimH is the adhesin of type I fimbriae expressed on Escherichia coli that can mediate specific adherence to host cells. High binding mutations in FimH are related to the adaptive evolution of bacteria. However, additional roles that these allelic variations may play remain elusive. To investigate novel biological functions of the mutations in FimH, we introduced four different variants of FimH by incorporating single amino acid substitutions at specific sites, namely A25P, G73R, A106, and T158P, respectively. In this study, adjuvant potential of FimH variants was evaluated by investigating their ability to trigger innate immune response to DC2.4 and adaptive immunity to improve immunological characteristics. The data revealed that purified A106 and T158P up-regulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules critically involved in DC2.4 activation by interaction with TLR4, whereas A25P and G73R did not induce the phenotypic maturation of DC2.4. Besides, the culture of DC2.4 with A106 and T158P enhanced the release of cytokines and protein phagocytosis. When formulated with PAc, T158P elicited more robust PAc-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses compared to PBS, PAc and PAc +K12 groups and inhibited bacteria colonization. Collectively, the results confirmed that the T158P mutation located around the inter-domain interface of the protein induced a specific enhancement effect on adjuvant characteristics.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

5,"We developed a new GeneFields (R) EHEC/SS PCR dipstick DNA chromatography kit for the simultaneously detection of invA, ipaH, and six genes in Salmonella enterica (56 strains), Shigella spp. (44), and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) (28), respectively, and evaluated the sensitivity and specificity with other bacteria (57) by this kit. The sensitivity and specificity were 100%, respectively. The detection limit of various methods was determined using 5% (w/v) stool suspensions spiked with each bacterium. The detection limit of the GeneFields (R) EHEC/SS kit ranged from approximately 10(2) -10(3) CFU/g. Additionally, the relative sensitivities and specificities of the GeneFields (R) EHEC/SS kit vs two commercially available real-time PCR kits were > 85.0% and > 90.0%, respectively. These results indicate that the GeneFields (R) EHEC/SS kit can be used for genetic screening of S. enterica, Shigella spp., and EHEC in human stool specimens with sensitivities and specificities similar to those of the commercially available real-time PCR kits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"8-Arylethynylxanthine derivatives are potent, selective adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists, which represent (potential) therapeutics for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's dementia, and the immunotherapy of cancer. 6-Amino-5-amidouracil derivatives are important precursors for the synthesis of such xanthines. We noticed an unexpected duplication of NMR signals in many of these uracil derivatives. Here, we present a detailed analytical study of structurally diverse 6-amino-5-carboxamidouracils employing dynamic and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and X-ray analysis to explain the unexpected properties of these valuable drug intermediates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a well studied phytopathogen given its various applications for deciphering host-pathogen interactions, bacterial communication, and capacity to transfer DNA fragments into host cells via a membrane protein system, the type IV secretion system (T4SS). T4SS mechanism is similar to the one responsible for antibiotic resistance gene transmission, and new knowledge gained could be applied to other organisms using such a mechanism. As well, A. tumefaciens is of economic importance in biotechnology due to its capacity to generate genetically modified plants. Agrobacterium tumefaciens harbours a plasmid known as Ti plasmid encoding T4SS function genes used for transferring genetic information and plant colonization. In this review, the authors describe the molecular basis of infection, from detection of host signals, to the description of different regions of Ti plasmid key to infection, ending with substrate transfer through bacterial wall.

8,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) is involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis and inflammation. PPAR expression level has been widely studied in multiple tissues; however, there are few reports of preceding attempts to produce full-length human PPAR (hPPAR) in cellular models, and generally, expression level is not known or measurable. We propose an alternative strategy to express recombinant hPPAR1, using a transient transfection with an inducible Tet-On 3G system where target and reporter gene were cloned in the same open reading frame. We transiently co-transfected human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells with pTRE-ZsGreen1-IRES2-hPPAR1 and pCMV-TET3G for inducible expression of hPPAR1. Relative expression of the transcript was evaluated by RT-qPCR 48h after transfection, obtaining a high expression level of hPPAR (530-fold change, p<0.002) in co-transfected HEK293T cells in the presence of doxycycline (1g/mL); also a significantly increased production of the reporter protein ZsGreen1 (3.6-fold change, p<0.05) was determined by fluorescence analysis. These data indicated that HEK293T cells were successfully co-transfected and it could be an alternative model for hPPAR expression in vitro. Additionally, this model will help to validate the quantification of inducible hPPAR expression in vivo models for future research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"We assessed the capacity of Kingella kingae to grow in blood culture bottles (BCB), taking into account the concentrations of the microorganism and blood in the culture medium. An initial suspension (McFarland 0.5) of 32 strains of K. kingae was serially diluted. One mL of the initial suspension and 1 mL of the subsequent dilutions were inoculated in two BCB, together with 1 mL of human blood in the 2nd BCB. Also, 1mL serial dilutions of human blood were added to BCBs previously inoculated with 1 mL of K. kingae dilution 1/10(4). In non-blood-supplemented BCB, 23 strains grew with the initial suspension and only one with the first processed dilution, as compared to all strains with the initial suspension and the 3 first dilutions, 22 with the 4th dilution, and one with the 5th dilution in blood-supplemented BCB. In BCB inoculated with K. kingae dilution 1/10(4) and decreasing concentrations of human blood, all strains grew with blood dilutions 1/2 and 1/4, 26 with dilution 1/8, 19 with dilution 1/16, 10 with dilution 1/32, and none with dilution 1/64. Increasing time to positivity was observed with both decreasing bacterial (p = .001) and blood concentrations (r = - 0.632, p < .0001). The addition of human blood was essential to boost the growth of K. kingae in BCB. If replicated in vivo, these findings would increase the isolation of fastidious K. kingae organisms from pediatric osteoarticular exudates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"Homeodomain transcription factors (HD TFs) are a large class of evolutionarily conserved DNA binding proteins that contain a basic 60-amino acid region required for binding to specific DNA sites. In Drosophila melanogaster, many of these HD TFs are expressed in the early embryo and control transcription of target genes in development through their interaction with cis-regulatory modules. Previous studies where some of the Drosophila HD TFs were purified required the use of strong denaturants (i.e. 6 M urea) and multiple chromatography columns, making the downstream biochemical examination of the isolated protein difficult. To circumvent these obstacles, we have developed a streamlined expression and purification protocol to produce large yields of Drosophila HD TFs. Using the HD TFs FUSHI-TARAZU (FTZ), ANTENNAPEDIA (ANTP), ABDOMINAL-A (ABD-A), ABDOMINAL-B (ABD-B), and ULTRABITHORAX (UBX) as examples, we demonstrate that our 3-day protocol involving the overexpression of His(6)-SUMO fusion constructs in E. coli followed by a Ni2+-IMAC, SUMO-tag cleavage with the SUMO protease Ulp1, and a heparin column purification produces pure, soluble protein in biological buffers around pH 7 in the absence of denaturants. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirm that the purified HD proteins are functional and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra confirm that the purified HDs are well-folded. These purified HD TFs can be used in future biophysical experiments to structurally and biochemically characterize how and why these HD TFs bind to different DNA sequences and further probe how nucleotide differences contribute to TF-DNA specificity in the HD family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"In this study we report the design, construction and validation of a novel transposon aimed to systematically screen for protein localization and expression patterns in prokaryotes using fluorescence microscopy. Upon random insertion in an open reading frame in the proper frame and orientation, the transposon creates an N-terminal fluorescent protein fusion to the msfGFP reporter. Moreover, in order to examine the localization of fusion proteins whose native expression might be too low or absent, the transposon was fitted with a PLtetO-1 promoter that makes the expression of the generated fluorescent protein fusions controllable by anhydrotetracycline. Importantly, upon flipping out the PLtetO-1 promoter and neighboring antibiotic resistance marker, an in-frame ""sandwich"" msfGFP fusion is created in which the N- and C-terminal portions of the targeted protein are again controlled by its native promoter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"BackgroundAmong several key protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions within the replisome, the interaction between -clamp and the DNA polymerase (Pol) III is of crucial importance. This interaction is mediated by a five or six-residue conserved sequence of the DnaE subunit of Pol III, referred to as the Clamp Binding Motif (CBM). In E. coli, DnaE contains two CBMs designated as e-CBM and i-CBM. A consensus sequence (QL[S/D]LF) for the CBMs has previously been proposed and studies involving mutagenesis of both the CBMs have evaluated their protein-binding properties. Surface Plasmon Resonance has been used to show that replacing i-CBM in DnaE with the consensus sequence enhances its binding to -clamp 120-fold.ObjectiveThe current study was aimed to evaluate in vivo interaction between DnaE bearing the consensus i-CBM and -clamp.MethodThe C-terminal 405 residues of DnaE, bearing either the consensus i-CBM or the WT i-CBM, with -clamp were co-expressed in E. coli followed by co-purification of the protein complexes. The interaction was assessed by the ability of the co-expressed proteins to form stable complexes during both affinity and gel filtration chromatography.ResultThe interaction of -clamp with DnaE755M containing the consensus i-CBM was found to be more stable than with WT DnaE755, consistent with the in vitro data previously reported.ConclusionThe presence of the pieces of sheared DNA generated during sonication promote the interaction of DnaE755M with -clamp by binding the OB-fold of DnaE755M and -clamp and serves as a bridge between them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"The confluence of protein engineering techniques and delivery protocols are providing new opportunities in cell biology. In particular, techniques that render the membrane of cells transiently permeable make the introduction of nongenetically encodable macromolecular probes into cells possible. This, in turn, can enable the monitoring of intracellular processes in ways that can be both precise and quantitative, ushering an area that one may envision as cellular biochemistry. Herein, the author reviews pioneering examples of such new cell-based assays, provides evidence that challenges the paradigm that cell penetration is a necessarily damaging and stressful event for cells, and highlights some of the challenges that should be addressed to fully unlock the potential of this nascent field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Transgenic chickens are of great interest for the production of recombinant proteins in their eggs. However, the use of constitutive strong promoters or the tissue-specific ovalbumin promoter for the generation of the transgenic chickens have different drawbacks that have to be overcome in order to make chicken bioreactor an efficient production system. This prompted us to investigate the use of an alternative tissue-specific promoter, the vitellogenin promoter, which could overcome the difficulties currently found in the generation of chicken bioreactors. In the present work we establish and characterize a DNA construct consisting of a fragment of the 5 '-flanking region of the chicken vitellogenin II gene cloned in a reporter vector. This construct is capable of showing the ability of the promoter to drive expression of a reporting gene in a tissue-specific manner and in a way that closely resembles physiologic regulation of vitellogenin, making it an ideal candidate to be used in the future for generation of avian bioreactors. Besides, we validate an in vitro culture system to test the performance of the DNA construct under study that could be used as a practical tool before generating any transgenic chicken. These results are important since they provide the proof of concept for the use of the vitellogenin promoter for future genetic modification of chickens bioreactors with improved characteristics in terms of quality of the recombinant protein produced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Chemical proteomics enables comprehensive profiling of small molecules in complex proteomes. A critical component to understand the interactome of a small molecule is the precise location on a protein where the interaction takes place. Several approaches have been developed that take advantage of bio-orthogonal chemistry and subsequent enrichment steps to isolate peptides modified by small molecules. These methods rely on target identification at the level of mass spectrometry making it difficult to interpret an experiment when modified peptides are not identified. Herein, an approach in which fluorescence-triggered two-dimensional chromatography enables the isolation of small molecule-conjugated peptides prior to mass spectrometry analysis is described. In this study, a bromocoumarin moiety has been utilized that fluoresces and generates a distinct isotopic signature to locate and identify modified peptides. Profiling of a cellular cysteinome with the use of a bromocoumarin tag demonstrates that two-dimensional fluorescence-based chromatography separation can enable the identification of proteins containing reactive cysteine residues. Moreover, the method facilitates the interrogation of low abundance proteins with greater depth and sensitivity than a previously reported isotope-targeted approach. Lastly, this workflow enables the identification of small-molecule modified peptides from a protein-of-interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"Plant cell balances energy consumption for its different biological processes under oxidative circumstances. The aim of the present study is to deepen our knowledge of the regulation of Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) responsive genes, especially thediscussion on energy index from DNA to protein. The cis- and trans-responsive elements, the translation efficiency and accuracy, the codon adaptation, the amount of entropy in the codon usage of a sequence and finally, co-expression patterns of up-regulated genes by MeJA in shoot and root of Arabidopsis plant under 8 different abiotic stresses (UV, cold, drought, heat, wounding, osmotic, oxidative, and salinity) were analyzed. We designed an R package, namely SADEG (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SADEG/) to estimate the relative stability of the DNA sequence. Cost of amino acids biosynthesis was weakly correlated with the energy consumption for each triplet-triplet binding related to each amino acid during thetranslation process. Our results also demonstrated that natural selection, gene length, gene expression levels, and influence of GC3s on the codon bias could affect the codon usage patterns of MeJA-responsive genes in Arabidopsis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"Clinical genetic testing in cardiovascular genetic medicine has undergone rapid changes. Next generation sequencing allows simultaneous testing of all genes associated with any cardiovascular phenotype, and molecular genetic testing for multiple genes has become the standard of practice for cardiovascular medicine. While technical and clinical advantages of multigenic approaches are evident, informed consent procedures have become more complex and challenging to the physician ordering such a test, particularly due to the increased potential for unsolicited findings. Based on the EuroGentest ""Guidelines for diagnostic next-generation sequencing"" we here propose a set of disease-specific requirements for obtaining informed consent for NGS-based genetic testing in a cardiogenetic clinic. We can show that it is often not feasible to obtain informed consent for every detail and suggest, in such cases, to reach general consent beforehand and discuss specific implications of unsolicited findings after the test results are available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"Antimicrobial peptides are essential components of innate defense mechanisms and make promising candidates for novel anti-infective agents. The advantages of these peptides in clinical applications include their potential for broad-spectrum and rapid bactericidal activities, and low propensity for resistance development, whereas possible disadvantages include their high cost, limited stability, and unknown toxicology and pharmacokinetics. Granulysin (Gr) is a cytolytic and proinflammatory molecule expressed by activated human cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. This paper aims to study bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by synthetic analogues of human Gr between 12 and 26 amino acids (AA) and their acyl derivatives. Considering results of previous studies, five new peptides were designed: a cyclic of 20 AA (Gr-SL1); one of 21 AA (linear) (Gr-SL2), another of 12 AA (cyclic) (Gr-SL3) and two lipopeptides (Gr-SL3-lauric and Gr-SL3-palmitic). Peptides were manually synthesized as C-terminal carboxamides by the solid-phase method following Fmoc chemistry. Gr synthetic analogues were purified by reverse phase HPLC and analyzed by analytical C18RP-HPLC and Maldi Tof. The antimycobacterial activity of synthesized Gr analogues was assessed using a microdilution susceptibility test as described previously. Although peptides studied here had neither higher antimycobacterial activity nor lower toxicity than analogs of human Gr previously evaluated, fresh knowledge concerning the influence of acylation and structural aspects analyzed will optimize the design of novel peptides combining the most favorable aspects for the maintenance of antimycobacterial activity with minimum toxicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"We have demonstrated the use of a simple single ion trap mass spectrometer to identify classes of compounds as well as individual components in complex mixtures. First, a neutral reagent was used to mass tag oxygen-containing analytesusing a gas-phase ion/molecule reaction. Then, a neutral loss scan was used to indicate the carboxylic acids. The lack of unit mass selectivity in the neutral loss scan required subsequent product ion scans to confirm the presence and identity of the individual carboxylic acids. The neutral loss scan technique reduced the number of data-dependent MS/MS scans required to confirm identification of signals as protonated carboxylic acids. The method was demonstrated on neat mixtures of standard carboxylic acids as well as on solutions of relevant pharmaceutical tablets and may be generalizable to other ion/molecule reactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Cross-modal learning refers to learning that involves obtaining information from multiple modalities and then integrating and utilizing it. Multisensory integration is an important basis of cross-modal learning. Although cross-modal conditions are more like the real-life environment of human learning, most studies still use single-modal stimuli, and the results of cross-modal learning are still somewhat messy and unsystematic. In order to better summarize the characteristics of cross-modal learning and its related mechanisms, the current review first introduces multisensory integration effects and the factors that influence them, as well as the experimental and theoretical researches on the modality non-specificity of primary cortexes. Then, we sum up the researches on consciousness, representation type, and transfer effect in cross-modal learning, and research progress for neural mechanism of cross-modal learning by adopting the techniques such as neuronal recording, ERP and fMRI. Finally, we summarize the current research results of cross-modal learning, and examine prospects for the potential applications of these research findings and future research issues in this area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"Severe placental abruption is associated with high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Prompt delivery is usually mandatory in this situation. We report a case of a 33-year-old woman, gravida 5, para 3 + 1, at 26 weeks + 3 days' gestation who had severe placental abruption involving 40% of the placental surface complicated with maternal moderate anaemia and thrombocytopenia. In view of the extreme foetal prematurity and stable condition of both mother and foetus, expectant management was undertaken. The pregnancy was further complicated by foetal growth restriction detected 2 weeks later. At 30 weeks of gestation, an emergency caesarean section was performed for foetal distress. The surgery was uneventful and she delivered a live baby with good Apgar scores. This case report illustrates an atypically satisfactory pregnancy outcome of severe placental abruption. Conservative management of severe placental abruption is possible in rare cases, taking into consideration the gestational week as well as the maternal haemodynamic condition and foetal well-being. When severe placental abruption is confounded by severe prematurity, a decision on whether to prolong the pregnancy to improve the perinatal outcome and neonatal survival needs to be carefully weighed against the usual management option of immediate delivery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The key step of the synthesis is the in situ generation of N-protected diacyldiselenide using NaBH2Se3 as selenating reagent, followed by trapping with an amino acid ester leading to the peptide. The formation of N-protected diacyldiselenide was confirmed through TLC and HRMS analysis using crude sample.

23,"Anillin is an actin binding protein and plays crucial roles during mitotic cell cycle progression in metazoan. However, the sequence and functions of the Anillin gene have not been yet characterized in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA sequence of the silkworm Anillin (BmAnillin) gene. The deduced amino acid sequence for BmAnillin protein comprises an Anillin homology region (AHR) covering an Anillin homology domain and a pleckstrin homology domain. Phylogenetic analysis and multiple alignments of the Anillin genes from silkworm and other organisms indicated evolutionary conservation in the AHR containing conserved phosphorylation sites. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments confirmed that the BmAnillin gene was highly expressed during larval development of gonads in which cells undergo mitotic cycles and exhibited an unexpected high expression in silk gland with endocycle during larval molting. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the BmAnillin gene in silkworm BmN4-SID1 cells derived from ovary disrupted chromosome separation and resulted in a loss of the F-actin filament at cleavage furrow during anaphase, suggesting that the BmAnillin gene is essential for cytokinesis in silkworm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"5T4, a membrane protein, is overexpressed in many tumor tissues but rarely expressed in normal tissues. Here, CHO-5T4(+) cells were generated and served as the antigen to immunize mice. Hybridoma techniques were employed to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The recombinant protein of human IgG Fc-fused extra cellular domain of 5T4 (5T4 ECD-Fc) was obtained from transient expression in HEK293F cells. The fusion protein 5T4 ECD-Fc and CHO-5T4(+) cells were respectively utilized to screen anti-5T4 antibodies that could bind to the native antigen. In preliminary screening, three hundred and fifty mAbs were obtained. Via surface plasmon resonance and flow cytometry screening, seven anti-5T4 mAbs stood out. Among them, H6 showed a high affinity (K-D = 1.6 x 10(-11) M) and internalization percentage (36% for 1 h and 80% for 4 h). The molecular weight and isoelectric point of H6 were determined by LC-MS and iCIEF. Moreover, the specific reactivity of H6 was demonstrated by western blotting, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In conclusion, we produced human recombinant protein of 5T4 extracellular domain and developed high-affinity internalizing monoclonal antibodies which may be applied in the 5T4-targeting ADC therapy and basic research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"Endocytic organelles maintain their acidic pH using the V-type ATPase proton pump. However, proton accumulation across the membrane generates a voltage and requires the movement of an additional ion, known as a counterion, to dissipate charge buildup. The role of counterion movement in endosomes is not clear, but a subpopulation of early endosomes, clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), has previously been shown to use external chloride (Cl-) to allow V-ATPase-dependent acidification. We aimed to determine the identity and function of this presumed Cl- transporting protein. Our sample of highly enriched bovine brain CCVs exhibited V-type ATPase-facilitated acidification in the presence of external Cl-, independent of the monovalent cations present. While unsuccessful at identifying the mechanism of anion transport, we used glutamate-facilitated acidification, density gradients, and mass spectrometry to show that most brain CCVs are synaptic vesicles, complementing results from earlier studies that argued similarity only on the basis on protein content. The source of Cl--dependent acidification in brain CCVs may be vGLUT1, a synaptic vesicle glutamate transporter with known Cl- permeability, although CCVs in other tissues are likely to utilize different proteins to facilitate acidification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structures were established by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS analysis, NMR spectroscopy and comparison with literature data.

27,"Cardosin A is an aspartic protease present in large amount in the pistils of cardoon flowers. This protease is known to contain an -Arg-Gly-Asp- (RGD) motif located on the molecular surface. In this study, we found that isolated recombinant cardosin A attached to human epithelial cells A549, mediated by the binding of its RGD motif to cell surface integrins. The cell bound cardosin A was internalized to endosomes and lysosomes and triggered the permeability of lysosomal membrane leading to apoptosis of the epithelial cells. These events are identical to those observed for three RGD-containing aspartic proteases, Saps 4-6, secreted by Candida albicans. Such a process, which has been called the Trojan Horse mechanism, is believed to benefit the invasion of C. albican into the epithelium of the host. The location of the RGD motifs of cardosin A and Saps 4-6 are on the opposite ends of the homologous three-dimensional structures, suggesting that the Trojan Horse mechanism is insensitive to the RGD position. Current finding also suggests that cardosin A may have a defensive function against the ingestion of cardoon flowers by human, insects, and other herbivores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of the GB1 and Tf genome sequences revealed that the genomes were highly similar in gene content and showed a high level of synteny. At the genome scale, there were several large sections of DNA that appeared to be from lateral gene transfer into the GB1 genome. Tf did have unique genetic content but at a much smaller scale: 300 genes in Tf verses 857 genes in GB1 that matched at <= 90% sequence similarity. Gene complement and copy number of genes for the glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain pathways were identical in both strains. While Tf is an obligate aerobe, it possesses the gene complement for an anaerobic lifestyle (ldh, ak, pta, adhE, pfl). As a species, other strains of C. debilis should be expected to have the potential for anaerobic growth. Assaying the whole cell lysate for alcohol dehydrogenase activity revealed an approximately 2-fold increase in the enzymatic activity in GB1 when compared with Tf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,"Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) family is commonly considered a protective barrier for the mRNA poly(A) tail. As a member of PABP family, cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein-1(PABPC1) binds to A-rich mRNA sequences with high affinity and plays an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation. In addition, PABPC1 also participates in many metabolic pathways of mRNA, including polyadenylation / deadenylation, mRNA transport, mRNA translation, degradation and microRNA-associated regulation. Recently, numerous studies demonstrate that PABPC1 associated with the growth of germ cells, the hypertrophy of myocardium and the development of tumors, suggesting a close relationship between PABPC1 and the growth and development of cells. In this review, we will mainly summarize the structure, expression regulation, function and biological function of PABPC1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"Selective determination of peptides in mixtures or biological samples requires specific techniques for analysis. Herein, we report 3-methylcatechol (3-MC) as a novel fluorogenic reagent for the selective determination of dipeptides by a simple fluorescence (FL) derivatization reaction. After extensive screening of 31 different catechol analogues, 3-MC was found to generate FL with peptides. The reaction was performed at 100 degrees C for 10min in the presence of borate buffer (pH 7) and sodium periodate. The resulting FL intensities were measured by spectrofluorometer at excitation wavelengths of 380nm and emission wavelengths of 500nm. Different reaction conditions such as concentration of sodium periodate, reaction time and pH of the borate buffer were studied to determine the optimum reaction conditions. Linearity was obtained between FL intensity and peptide concentrations from 10 to 160 mu M with a lower detection limit of 10 mu M (S/N=3). Dipeptides containing Ala, Phe, Leu and Val at the N-termini generated significant FL in comparison to the reagent blank (**p<0.005, ***p<0.0005). The reaction is simple, rapid, selective and sensitive which can be applied for the determination of the dipeptides as biomarkers or to determine enzyme activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"Fusion between cells of different organisms (i.e., xenogeneic hybrids) can occur, and for humans this may occur in the course of tissue transplantation, animal handling, and food production. Previous work shows that conferred advantages are rare in xenogeneic hybrids, whereas risks of cellular dysregulation are high. Here, we explore the transcriptome of individual xenogeneic hybrids of human mesenchymal stem cells and murine cardiomyocytes soon after fusion and ask whether the process is stochastic or involves conserved pathway activation. Toward this end, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze the transcriptomes of hybrid cells with respect to the human and mouse genomes. Consistent with previous work, hybrids possessed a unique transcriptome distinct from either fusion partner but were dominated by the cardiomyocyte transcriptome. New in this work is the documentation that a few genes that were latent in both fusion partners were consistently expressed in hybrids. Specifically, human growth hormone 1, murine ribosomal protein S27, and murine ATP synthase H+ transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex subunit C2 were expressed in nearly all hybrids. The consistent activation of latent genes between hybrids suggests conserved signaling mechanisms that either cause or are the consequence of fusion of these 2 cell types and might serve as a target for limiting unwanted xenogeneic fusion in the future.-Yuan, C., Freeman, B.

32,"Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by immune injury to the salivary and lacrimal glands with other systemic manifestations. Recent studies showed the adaptive autoimmune responses induced by muscarinic acetylcholine 3 receptor (M3R) contribute to the dysfunction of exocrine glands in the pathogenesis of pSS. Although the M3R-induced mononuclear cells infiltration are observed in exocrine glands in pSS patients and animal models, the role of M3R in lymphatic vessels formation has not been explored. In current study, we found the expression of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1) increased in intestine of the M3R immunized mice and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mimotope could inhibit this behavior. Our results suggested that the M3R/EGFR transactivation signaling may help mononuclear cells infiltrate in exocrine glands by promoting lymphangiogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"We propose a high-dynamic optical angiography(HDOA) method to obtain blood flow images of a small biological specimen in vivo. High dynamic range exposure time is set to achieve high-dynamic integrated time modulation, which involves dynamic integrated effect and absorption effect. With this method, each-level vessels can be imaged with similar clarity. Moreover, the vessels in locations with different thickness and absorption coefficient can be reconstructed in the same image. Experiments on phantom and in vivo Gold Pristella Tetra were performed to demonstrate that HDOA can achieve each-level vessels imaging based on dynamic integrated effect and absorption effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Evidence indicated that key changes in macrophage uptake of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and macrophage polarization in atherosclerotic plaques are closely related to dysfunctional autophagy. Wnt5a (wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 5a) is highly expressed in the macrophage-rich region of atherosclerosis (AS) lesions. However, whether Wnt5a is involved in macrophages autophagy is not clear. In this study, we established macrophages-derived foam cell induced by ox-LDL to explore the effects of Wnt5a/PKC delta pathway on autophagy. RAW 264.7 macrophages were incubated with 60 mg/L ox-LDL for 6h. The expression of autophagy marker, LC3 II / I was significantly increased and p62 was decreased obviously. Moreover, the expressions of Wnt5a, PCK delta and STAT3 were also elevated. Knockdown of Wnt5a reduced the expressions of LC3/ I and PKC delta, induced the expression of p62, inhibited cellular lipid accumulation. Furthermore, PKC delta inhibitor (Rottlerin) was downregulated the levels of LC3 II / I and STAT3, upregulated p62 level, inhibited cellular lipid accumulation. Therefore, ox-LDL induces autophagy in macrophages may be associated with Wnt5a/PKC delta signaling pathway. The present study indicates that Wnt5a/PKC delta signaling pathway may be underlying target for autophagy and drug intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"This study aimed to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the protective effects of phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase (PSTK) against cisplatin-induced podocyte injury. PSTK overexpression and knockdown vectors were generated and transfected into murine podocyte cells-5. PSTK levels were measured, and transcriptome sequencing was conducted. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that were positively and negatively correlated with PSTK. We selected 10 candidate genes identified via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis for further analysis. As expected, PSTK levels were significantly higher in PSTK-overexpressing podocytes and significantly lower in PSTK-knockdown podocytes. PSTK overexpression resulted in the upregulation of 122 genes and downregulation of 372 genes in podocytes. On the other hand, PSTK knockdown resulted in the upregulation of 231 genes and downregulation of 445 genes. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that 11 genes were positively correlated with PSTK, whereas 20 genes were negatively correlated with PSTK. The obtained PSTK-regulated genes were primarily involved in molecular function, biological process, and cellular component, as well as the angiogenesis pathway. The Wnt family member 10A levels were significantly higher after PSTK overexpression, but were significantly lower after PSTK knockdown. In addition, Na+/K+ ATPase subunit -2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels were significantly downregulated after PSTK overexpression, but significantly upregulated upon PSTK knockdown. Cell proliferation was significantly increased upon PSTK overexpression, but significantly decreased upon PSTK suppression. The results of this study not only identified several significant PSTK-regulated genes for further validation, but also provided insights into the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of PSTK on podocytes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"BackgroundThe quantity of documents being published requires researchers to specialize to a narrower field, meaning that inferable connections between publications (particularly from different domains) can be missed. This has given rise to automatic literature based discovery (LBD). However, unless heavily filtered, LBD generates more potential new knowledge than can be manually verified and another form of selection is required before the results can be passed onto a user. Since a large proportion of the automatically generated hidden knowledge is valid but generally known, we investigate the hypothesis that non trivial, interesting, hidden knowledge can be treated as an anomaly and identified using anomaly detection approaches.ResultsTwo experiments are conducted: (1) to avoid errors arising from incorrect extraction of relations, the hypothesis is validated using manually annotated relations appearing in a thesaurus, and (2) automatically extracted relations are used to investigate the hypothesis on publication abstracts. These allow an investigation of a potential upper bound and the detection of limitations yielded by automatic relation extraction.ConclusionWe apply one-class SVM and isolation forest anomaly detection algorithms to a set of hidden connections to rank connections by identifying outlying (interesting) ones and show that the approach increases the F-1 measure by a factor of 10 while greatly reducing the quantity of hidden knowledge to manually verify. We also demonstrate the statistical significance of this result.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"Based on an official standard method of lutein analysis, an improved high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for simultaneously detecting lutein and zeaxanthin was developed as focusing on the sample preparation protocol. The optimal pretreatment conditions included a saponification in a water bath for 15 min at a constant temperature of 50 degrees C, using a 10 mL 60% (w/v) potassium hydroxide solution, followed by extraction using 100 mL mixture of n-hexane, ethyl ether and cyclohexane (40: 40: 20, v/v/v). A mixture of dichloromethane, acetonitrile and methanol (20: 30: 50, v/v/v) was validated to elute lutein and zeaxanthin on a C-30 column (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 mu m). The resolution between lutein and zeaxanthin is >= 2.5. A millet sample was used for methodological verification and the results showed that the linear relations for lutein and zeaxanthin were good in ranges of 0.23-9.37 mu g/mL and 0.30-12.02 mu g/mL, respectively. The relative standard deviations of lutein and zeaxanthin were 1.40% and 5.09%, respectively, and their spiked recoveries were between 86.60% and 98.75%. The lutein and zeaxanthin results from this modified HPLC method are superior to those from the Chinese official method and ultrasonic extraction method.

38,"We evaluated correlations between yield, meteorological and bromatological characters in five genotypes of dual-purpose wheat submitted to different cutting management systems. The experiments were carried out in 2014 and 2015. The experimental design was a randomized block, organized in a factorial scheme, with five genotypes of dual purpose wheat (BRS Taruma, BRS Umbu, BRS Figueira, BRS Guatambu and BRS 277), three cutting managements (one, two and three cuts), with three replicates. The data of each cut management were submitted to linear correlation analysis, canonical correlations and stepwise predictions. We conclude that yield and bromatological components of the forage are closely related to the meteorological attributes and cut management. Neutral and acid detergent fiber, hemicellulose, mineral matter and total carbohydrates are influenced by maximum and minimum air temperature, as well as by incident solar radiation. The canonical interrelationships and the predictive models developed for the morphological, bromatological and grain yield attributes are specifically dependent on cut management in dual purpose wheat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"Most of the drugs binding to human serum albumin (HSA) are transported to various parts of the body. Here, we have studied the molecular interaction between HSA and synthesized uridine derivatives, 1-[(3R, 4S, 5 R)-2-methyl-3, 4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-2-yl]pyrimidine-2,4-dion.)(C-MU); [(2R,3R,4R,5R)-5-(2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)-3,4-dihydroxy-4-methyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl] methyl methyl phosphochloridate (CM-MU) and [(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-(2,4-dioxopyrimidin-1-yl)-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroxyoxolan-2-yl] methyl dihydrogen phosphate (P-MU). Cytotoxic studies of these synthesized compounds with mouse macrophages (RAW 246.7) and HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cells) and binding mechanism of these uridine derivatives with HSA were performed. Subsequently, fluorescence quenching was observed upon titration of uridine derivatives with HSA via static mode of quenching, and the binding constants (K2-C-MU = 4 +/- 0.03 x 10(4)M(-1), K5-CM-MU = 1.95 +/- 0.03 x 10(4) M-1 and K5-P-MU =1.56 +/- 0.03 x 10(4) M-1) were found to be in sync with the computational results. Further, molecular displacement and molecular docking data revealed that all the derivatives are binding in the subdomain IIA and IIB regions of HSA. The protein secondary structure of complexes was determined by circular dichroism, indicating partial unfolding of the protein upon addition of the uridine derivatives. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy data reveal the change in topology upon binding of 2-C-MU, 5-CM-MU and 5-P-MU with HSA, indicating change in the microenvironment around tryptophan region. Additionally, cytotoxicity studies on HeLa and Raw Cell lines suggested that these molecules have significant anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. Hence, the study may be of help for development of new drugs based on uridine derivatives which may be helpful for combating various potential diseases. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

40,"In cold and harsh environments such as glaciers and sediments in ice cores, microbes can survive by forming spores. Spores are composed of a thick coat protein, which protects against external factors such as heat-shock, high salinity, and nutrient deficiency. GerE is a key transcription factor involved in spore coat protein expression in the mother cell during sporulation. GerE regulates transcription during the late sporulation stage by directly binding to the promoter of cotB gene. Here, we report the crystal structure of PaGerE at 2.09 angstrom resolution from Paenisporosarcina sp. TG-14, which was isolated from the Taylor glacier. The PaGerE structure is composed of four alpha-helices and adopts a helix-turn-helix architecture with 68 amino acid residues. Based on our DNA binding analysis, the PaGerE binds to the promoter region of CotB to affect protein expression. Additionally, our structural comparison studies suggest that DNA binding by PaGerE causes a conformational change in the alpha 4-helix region, which may strongly induce dimerization of PaGerE.

41,"BackgroundTime- and dose-to-event phenotypes used in basic science and translational studies are commonly measured imprecisely or incompletely due to limitations of the experimental design or data collection schema. For example, drug-induced toxicities are not reported by the actual time or dose triggering the event, but rather are inferred from the cycle or dose to which the event is attributed. This exemplifies a prevalent type of imprecise measurement called grouped failure time, where times or doses are restricted to discrete increments. Failure to appropriately account for the grouped nature of the data, when present, may lead to biased analyses.ResultsWe present groupedSurv, an R package which implements a statistically rigorous and computationally efficient approach for conducting genome-wide analyses based on grouped failure time phenotypes. Our approach accommodates adjustments for baseline covariates, and analysis at the variant or gene level. We illustrate the statistical properties of the approach and computational performance of the package by simulation. We present the results of a reanalysis of a published genome-wide study to identify common germline variants associated with the risk of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer patients.ConclusionsgroupedSurv enables fast and rigorous genome-wide analysis on the basis of grouped failure time phenotypes at the variant, gene or pathway level.

42,"Z(basic)-Delta I-CM is a novel intein-based self-cleavable tag we developed to accelerate the soluble expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Previously we found that intein activity could be interfered by its flanking exteins, and thus reducing the production efficiency and final yield. In this work, we used CXC-chemokine 9 (CXCL9) as a model C-extein, which fusion with Z(basic)-Delta I-CM showed high intein activity. When the fusion protein got soluble expression, CXCL9 was released immediately and purified directly from cell lysis supernatant. The results demonstrated that Z(basic)-Delta I-CM tag had successfully mediated the efficient production of high-quality CXCL9 with reduced time and resources consumption in comparison with inclusion bodies expression. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the improved cleavage activity of Z(basic)-Delta I-CM upon fusion with CXCL9 may be due to the higher dynamics of the first half loop and stabilization of the second half loop of intein. Our results proved that the self-cleavable Z(basic)-Delta I-CM mediated soluble expression could be a feasible process for cytokines like CXCL9, thus of attractive potentials for production of therapeutic proteins using E. coli expression system.

43,"Analysis of variations in water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) delta C-13 of leaves and phloem can efficiently describe the delta C-13 distributions within plants and identify the temporal variation of delta C-13. In this study, WSOM delta C-13 values of both leaves and phloem (twig, stem, and root) of Platycladus orientalis were measured during seven sunny days, including 2-hour interval measurements at three days for diel pattern analysis and 6-hour interval measurements at the remaining four days for day-to-day variation analysis. Analysis of WSOM delta C-13 in different plant organs showed that C-13 was generally depleted from leaves to twigs, then enriched in stems and subsequently depleted in roots. Stems were significantly C-13-enriched compared to twigs (p < 0.05), while delta C-13 differences between stems and other organs and among leaves, twigs and roots were not significant (p > 0.05). No clear diel patterns in delta C-13 of leaves and phloem were found. Daily average delta C-13 values indicated that all plant organs had more positive values on sunny days during the dry season than during the wet season. Both photosynthetic and post-photosynthetic fractionation influence variations in WSOM delta C-13.

44,"BackgroundIn standard high throughput sequencing analysis, genetic variants are not assigned to a homologous chromosome of origin. This process, called haplotype phasing, can reveal information important for understanding the relationship between genetic variants and biological phenotypes. For example, in genes that carry multiple heterozygous missense variants, phasing resolves whether one or both gene copies are altered. Here, we present a novel approach to phasing variants that takes advantage of unique properties of paired tumor:normal sequencing data from cancer studies.ResultsVAF phasing uses changes in variant allele frequency (VAF) between tumor and normal samples in regions of somatic chromosomal gain or loss to phase germline variants. We apply VAF phasing to 6180 samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and demonstrate that our method is highly concordant with other standard phasing methods, and can phase an average of 33% more variants than other read-backed phasing methods. Using variant annotation tools designed to score gene haplotypes, we find a suggestive association between carrying multiple missense variants in a single copy of a cancer predisposition gene and earlier age of cancer diagnosis.ConclusionsVAF phasing exploits unique properties of tumor genomes to increase the number of germline variants that can be phased over standard read-backed methods in paired tumor:normal samples. Our phase-informed association testing results call attention to the need to develop more tools for assessing the joint effect of multiple genetic variants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"Transcriptional activation by PML-RAR alpha, an acute promyelocytic leukemia-related oncofusion protein, requires pharmacological concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, the mechanism by which the liganded PML-RAR alpha complex leads to the formation of the preinitiation complex has been unidentified. Here we demonstrate that the Mediator subunit MED1 plays an important role in the ATRA-dependent activation of the PML-RAR alpha-bound promoter. Luciferase reporter assays showed that PML-RAR alpha induced significant transcription at pharmacological doses (1 mu M) of ATRA; however, this was submaximal and equivalent to the level of transcription driven by intact RAR alpha at physiological doses (1 nM) of ATRA. Transcription depended upon the interaction of PML-RAR alpha with the two LxxLL nuclear receptor recognition motifs of MED1, and LxxLL -> LxxAA mutations led to minimal transcription. Mechanistically, MED1 interacted ATRA-dependently with the RAR alpha portion of PML-RAR alpha through the two LxxLL motifs of MED1. These results suggest that PML-RAR alpha initiates ATRA-induced transcription through its interaction with MED1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by xanthine oxidase (XO), the enzymatic antioxidant system and oxidative damage in soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of growing rats fed a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC; 6% protein, 74% carbohydrate) diet for 15 days. The LPHC diet increased the total antioxidant capacity by 45% and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase and catalase in the soleus muscles. There was an increase in the carbonylated proteins with no increase thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), although the XO activity had increased 20%. In EDL muscles, the LPHC diet increased XO activity by 66% and the TBARS levels by 80%, and only GPx had its activity increased. These results suggest that the enzymatic antioxidant system of the soleus muscle has a better response to the increase of ROS production stimulated by LPHC diet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"The estimation of genetic variability in germplasm banks is important not only for the conservation of genetic resources, but also for their use in plant breeding. However, a large number of traits from different categories (qualitative and quantitative) can make the analysis and interpretation of the results difficult, often resulting in an incomplete distinction among accessions. We characterized 45 accessions of food-type soybean (Glycine max) from the Soybean Germplasm Bank of Londrina State University based on morphoagronomic traits. The experiment was carried out in the university farm using a randomized block design with three replicates. Twelve traits were evaluated: flower color, pubescence color, tegument color, hilum color, days until flowering, days until maturation, plant height, height of insertion of the first pod, mass of 100 grains, grain yield per plot, agronomic value, and lodging index. The quantitative trait data were submitted to deviance analysis. The genetic divergence among the accessions was examined by Gower's distance and clustering of the accessions was made based on Ward's hierarchical method. Morphoagronomic descriptors proved efficient in detecting the levels of genetic variability among the accessions maintained in the germplasm collection. Gower's distance was efficient in the discrimination of accessions, showing that simultaneous analysis of quantitative and qualitative traits is useful to evaluate the variability in a germoplasm bank. These results can be used as an additional source of information to be exploited in food-type soybean breeding programs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"Cancer arises from successive rounds of mutations, resulting in tumor cells with different somatic mutations known as clones. Drug responsiveness and therapeutics of cancer depend on the accurate detection of the clones in a tumor sample. Recent research has considered inferring clonal composition of a tumor sample using computational models based on the short read data of the sample generated using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Short reads (segmented DNA parts of different tumor cells) are noisy; therefore, inferring the clones and their mutations from the data is a difficult and complex problem. Existing methods to infer clones from noisy NGS data do not consider the presence of long-range mutational influences. Therefore, we develop a new model, called extended multiple sample tumor heterogeneity prediction by factorial Hidden Markov model (emHetFHMM), based on factorial hidden Markov models to infer clones and their proportions by capturing the long-range mutational influences. In our model, each hidden chain represents the genomic signature of a clone, and a mixture of chains results in the observed data. We make use of Gibbs sampling and exponentiated gradient algorithms to infer the hidden variables and mixing proportions. We compare our model with strong models from the previous work (PyClone, PhyloSub, and HetFHMM) based on both synthetic data and real cancer data from acute myeloid leukemia. Empirical results confirm that emHetFHMM infers clonal composition of a tumor sample more accurately than previous studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"Oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) causes atherosclerosis. Detection of oxidation of LDL-mimetic liposomes using an electrode might serve as a convenient tool in the search of antioxidants for the prevention of atherosclerosis. This report proposes a reaction mechanism between LDL-mimetic liposomes and an acid-treated carbon nanotube (CNT) electrode. Oxidation of the liposomes, mediated by Cu2+, was monitored by the change in electrode potential, and the fluorescence intensity generated by diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine (DPPP) as control. The electrode potential and fluorescence intensity increased concomitantly during oxidation, followed by a gradual decrease. Although the electrical potential peaked faster than the fluorescence intensity, addition of CNT to the DPPP reaction accelerated the latter, suggesting the role of CNT as an accelerator of liposome oxidation. Atomic force microscopy showed increased binding of liposomes to CNT along with liposomal deformation. Further, binding of Cu2+ to the liposome-bound CNT surface was observed by quartz crystal microbalance. In conclusion, the interaction of liposomes with Cu2+ and CNT surface explains the rapid response of the electrode in liposome oxidation.

50,"To explore the anti-atherosclerotic effects of recombinant high-density lipoproteins (rHDL) of apolipoprotein AI wild-type (apoA-Iwt), apolipoprotein AI Milano (apoA-IM), apolipoprotein AI (N74C) (apoA-I (N74C)) and apolipoprotein AV (apoA-V). We constructed rHDL liposomes (rHDLs), which included apoA-Iwt, apoA-IM, and apoA-I (N74C), followed by the synthesis of rHDLs, with the indicated ratios of apoA-Iwt, apoA-IM, apoA-I (N74C) and apoA-V. We investigated the anti-atherosclerotic effects by experiments including the DMPC clearance assay and experiments that assessed the in vitro antioxidation against low-density lipoprotein, the cellular uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and the in vitro intracellular lipid accumulation. Electron microscopy results revealed that as more apoA-V was present in rHDLs, the particle size of rHDLs was larger. The DMPC clearance assay subsequently showed that rHDL protein mixtures could promote DMPC turbidity clearance when more apoA-V was included in the reactionmixtures, with apoAV-rHDL showing the strongest turbidity clearance ability (P<0.05 vs AI-rHDL). In vitro antioxidation against low-density lipoprotein assays indicated that rHDLs containing apoA-V had increasing oxidation resistance against low-density lipoprotein (LDL) with higher apoA-V contents. Finally, cellular uptake of oxLDL and intracellular lipids suggested an apparent oxidation resistance to LDL oxidation in vitro and a reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in THP-1-derived macrophages, with AIM-rHDL demonstrating the greatest ability to decrease intracellular lipid accumulation. Different proportions of apolipoprotein A-I cysteine mutants and apolipoprotein A-V of rHDL changed the lipid binding capacity, particle size, and antioxidant capacity. These changes may show a beneficial effect of rHDL on atherosclerosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"Noise-induced hearing loss leads to anatomic and physiologic changes in primary auditory cortex (A1) and the adjacent dorsal rostral belt (RB). Since acetylcholine is known to modulate plasticity in other cortical areas, changes in A1 and RB following noise damage may be due to changes in cholinergic receptor expression. We used [H-3]scopolamine and [F-18]flubatine binding to measure muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression, respectively, in guinea pig A1 and RB 3 weeks following unilateral, left ear noise exposure, and a temporary threshold shift in hearing. [H-3]Scopolamine binding decreased in right A1 and RB (contralateral to noise) compared to sham controls across all cortical layers. [F-18]Flubatine binding showed a nonsignificant upward trend in right A1 following noise but only significantly increased in right RB and 2 layers of left RB (ipsilateral to noise). This selective response may ultimately influence cortical plasticity and function. The mechanism(s) by which cholinergic receptors are altered following noise exposure remain unknown. However, these data demonstrate noise exposure may differentially influence mAChRs that typically populate interneurons in A1 and RB more than nAChRs that are traditionally located on thalamocortical projections and provide motivation for cholinergic imaging in clinical patient populations of temporary or permanent hearing loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is the first cloned hematopoietic growth factor available for pharmaceutical treatment, especially anemia, since 1988. Unfortunately, the ability of rHuEPO in boosting erythropoiesis, and thus aerobic capacity has led to its abuse in endurance sport. Besides, the expiry of the original rHuEPO patent has resulted in many biosimilars being produced which led to special requirements regarding quality control. As a consequence, there is a huge demand for all rHuEPOs to be well characterized for the ease of identification, differentiation, and detection. Glycoproteomic mass spectrometry, the most current promising approach for rHuEPOs analysis, was employed to characterize 4 rHuEPOs including epoetin-alpha, epoetin-beta, darbepoetin-alpha and Mircera. Via nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS, distinct glycoproteomic profiles of each rHuEPO have been achieved for differential analysis. With two different fragmentation methods, collision-induced dissociation (CID) and higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD), maximum of 75%, 70%, 70%, and 77% protein sequence coverages were attained for epoetin-alpha, epoetin-beta, darbepoetin-alpha and Mircera, respectively. From the peptides/glycopeptides mixture, similar and unique peptides/glycopeptides (biomarkers) for each rHuEPO have been identified. With the discovery of high quality and unique biomarkers, a more standardized and efficient method for quality control and rHuEPO abuse detection can be developed.

53,"Background: The immune response of the critically ill after severe trauma is sex-specific and may explain the different progression of the disease. This may be explained by a different gene regulatory program of their peripheral immune cells. We investigated the progression of the transcription profiles of peripheral immune cells of the patients to elucidate their distinct physiological response and clinical course. Methods: We compared transcription profiles of whole blood of male and female patients from a larger longitudinal study of critically ill patients after trauma. We developed a statistical analysis pipeline that synchronized the time lapse of the profiles based on the temporal severity score of each patient. Results: This enabled to categorize the temporal progression of the disease into two pre-acute, an acute and two post-acute phases. Comparing gene regulation of male and female patients at each phase, we identified distinctively regulated molecular processes mainly in the immune response, but also in the regulation of metabolism allowing to cluster these discriminative gene sets into sets of highly related cellular processes. Compared to male patients and healthy controls, female patients showed upregulation of gene sets of innate immunity in the early phase, upregulation of wound healing processes during the acute phase and upregulation of adaptive immunity in the late phase indicating early recovery. In turn, during the pre-acute and acute phase, male patients showed less suppression of gene sets coding for enzymes of energy metabolism and anabolism, most prominently the tricarboxylic acid cycle and beta-oxidation, and cellular maintenance, such as cell cycle, DNA replication and damage response, and RNA metabolism. Conclusions: A stronger innate immune response at the very early phase of the disease may support early clearance of the pathogen and its associated molecular patterns. Upregulation of wound healing processes may explain reduced multiple organ failure during the acute phase. Down regulated energy metabolism during the acute phase may make female patients less susceptible to oxidative stress, the upregulated adaptive immune system reflects an earlier recovery and rebuilding of the adaptive immune system that may protect them from secondary infections. Follow up studies need to be performed confirming these observations experimentally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"Endometriosis is a chronic disease with adverse implications for fertility. We investigated the G894T polymorphism in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene in fertile and infertile women with endometriosis. This prospective study included a group of 52 women with a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis. DNA was extracted from blood obtained from 47 patients and analyzed by PCR. The overall cohort was divided into infertile (n = 24) and fertile (n = 23) subgroups and compared in terms of genotypic and allelic frequencies. The genotypic distribution followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (chi(2) = 2.21, P = 0.137) and included the GG genotype in 28/47 GT in 14/47, and TT in 5/47 of the samples. Genotypic and allelic frequencies between fertile and infertile women with endometriosis showed that absence of the TT genotype was associated with fertility in endometriosis patients (P = 0.0623). The T allele was present in 17 patients of the infertile group and 7 patients of the fertile group (P = 0.025). This allele was significantly associated with infertility (relative risk = 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.56 - 3.08) for the recessive model of inheritance. Our findings suggest that women with endometriosis and the G894T polymorphism in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene are at increased risk of infertility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,"Rationale The carbon stable isotope composition (delta C-13 value) of a plant can reflect prolonged drought and salinity, as different isotopic signals resulting from drought and salinity can be retained in plant tissue. Commonly, drought and salinity are interrupted by intermittent precipitation or irrigation. It remains unclear whether the delta C-13 values reflect the cumulative duration of intermittent drought or salinity stress. Methods Drought (5% and 10% polyethylene glycol) and salinity (35 mM and 85 mM NaCl) were imposed on annual ryegrass consistently or cyclically; throughout the treatments, the stress duration for cyclic drought/salinity was half that of the corresponding prolonged stress treatment. The shoot delta C-13 values were measured using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Results Prolonged drought restrained growth and increased shoot delta C-13 values relative to the control group. However, the shoot biomass was even lower under cyclic drought than under prolonged drought. Furthermore, the shoot delta C-13 value under cyclic drought was close to that of the control group. The low NaCl concentration treatment actually enhanced shoot growth. The shoot delta C-13 value varied with both duration and intensity of salinity across all groups. Conclusions The shoot delta C-13 value in annual ryegrass did indicate cumulative stress from cyclic low salinity, but not that from cyclic drought, in a manner that was mediated by the effect of re-watering on the mass and allocation of the photosynthates produced during stress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,"Rationale Stable isotope ratios can provide a 'fingerprint' to enable differentiation of sources of monofluoroacetate (MFA), hence providing a means to eliminate potential sources of MFA in a blackmail case involving the contamination of milk. Methods The stable isotopic compositions (delta H-2, delta C-13 and delta O-18 values) of a library of 43 samples of MFA were determined and multivariate models constructed to differentiate samples of different composition. The data from the MFA library were compared with those obtained from MFA extracted from contaminated milk powder (the case samples). The isotopic composition of the extracted samples was measured on dichloroaniline derivatives. Results A wide range of values was found for delta H-2, delta C-13 and delta O-18 of the MFA samples, much greater than the analytical repeatability between subsamples. Stable isotope data, therefore, provide a means of distinguishing samples of MFA. Of the 43 MFA samples tested, all but 6 could be eliminated as potential sources of the contamination, i.e. they had a distinctly different isotopic composition such that they must have had different histories and/or origins. Conclusions Stable isotope measurements of bulk and derivatized MFA provide an effective means of discriminating MFA samples. Three of the library samples that could not be differentiated from the case samples were directly connected to the suspect, and this evidence contributed to the suspect's admission of guilt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,"Given that the biological functions of proteins may decrease or even be lost due to degradation by proteases, it is of great significance to identify potential proteases that degrade protein drugs during systemic circulation. In this work, we describe a method based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to identify key proteases that degrade therapeutic proteins in blood, including endopeptidases and exopeptidases. Here, the degradation of proteins was detected by competition with standard substrates of proteases and is shown as the relative residue rate. Four protein drugs were subjected to this method, and the results suggested that growth hormone was degraded by aminopeptidase N and kallikrein-related peptidase 5, pertuzumab was hardly degraded by the proteases, factor VII was degraded by carboxypeptidase B, neprilysin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and peptidyl di-peptidase A, and fibrinogen was degraded by carboxypeptidase B and kallikrein-related peptidase 5, findings consistent with the literature. The results were confirmed by microscale thermophoresis; additionally, activity detection in vitro substantiated that the degradation of factor VII decreased its activity. We demonstrate that this method can be used to identify key proteases of proteins with high accuracy, precision and durability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,"Interest in -globin point mutations has increased in the past few years because nondeletional variations can affect protein function and stability, giving rise to hemoglobin (Hb) variants that present a wide spectrum of phenotypes, from asymptomatic forms to hemolytic anemia. We describe a novel 1-globin gene variant, which we have named Hb Milano [109(G16)LeuPro (CTG>CCG); HBA1: c.329T>C]. We performed high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to carry out Hb analysis, capillary electrophoresis (CE) for Hb separation and quantitation of Hb subtypes, two tests on stroma-free lysates for evaluating Hb stability, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect deletions/duplications within the gene cluster and Sanger sequencing of the -globin genes. No abnormal Hb variants were identified by HPLC and CE. Isopropanol and stability tests were negative. The peripheral blood film showed no inclusions such as Hb H or Heinz bodies. Multiplication ligation-dependent probe amplification of the -globin gene cluster detected a heterozygosity for the -(3.7) (rightward) deletion. Direct sequencing of the -globin genes identified the Hb Milano variant on the HBA1 gene. No mutations were found on the HBA2 gene. The clinical consequences of the Hb Milano variant differ based on the genotype: according to our study, the hematological parameters range from a marked microcythemia with mild anemia if the variant is coinherited with an gene deletion, to mild microcytosis when the variant is not associated with gene deletions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,"Corn is considered one of the most important crops in the world agricultural scenario. In order to improve production, it is crucial to understand and quantify the genetic variation involved in the phenotypic manifestation of this species. We characterized corn genotypes using a multivariate approach and examined canonical interrelations between characters of agronomic importance. The study was carried out in the 2016/2017 crop year in the southernmost state of Brazil, in the northwest region of Rio Grande do Sul. The treatments were composed of six open-pollinated corn genotypes (PL 712, PL 725, PL 796, PL 804 and PL 861). The experimental design was a randomized block with four replications. Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference at 5% of probability by the F test for the attributes plant height, ear insertion height, stem diameter, ear length, number of seed rows per ear, number of seeds per row of ear, thousand seed weight, seed yield, percentage of germination, first germination count, emergency percentage and cold test. Genetic variability analysis showed genotype PL 712 to have superior seed productivity. The physiological quality of the seeds produced was variable among the genotypes, but it followed the trend of superiority for PL 712. Linear associations revealed a tendency for tall stature plants to increase seed yield of open pollinated corn. The most polymorphic characters were plant height and ear insertion, response to cold test, and thousand seed weight. The productivity and seed quality trends that were observed will allow us to plan further research on open pollinated varieties to allow selection and development of superior genotypes for seed productivity and quality in the extreme south of Brazil.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified chromosome 12p13 rs12425791 and rs11833579 as susceptibility loci of ischemic stroke (IS) in a European population. However, conflicting results were obtained in subsequent replication analysis. miR-200c, located on chromosome 12p13, was found to have a neuroprotective effect on ischemia. Our aim of this study was to investigate the association of the rs12425791, rs11833579 and rs12904 in the binding site of miR-200c with the risk of IS. The rs12425791, rs11833579, and rs12904 were genotyped using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. The results were verified by Sanger sequencing. We found that the rs12904 AG/GG genotypes and G allele were associated with a decreased risk of IS (AG/GG vs. AA: adjusted OR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.44-0.95; G vs. A: adjusted OR=0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.93). The combined genotypes of the rs11833579AG/AA and rs12904AG/GG were also associated with a reduced risk of IS (OR=0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.93). These findings suggest that the rs12904 may have a jointly protective effect against the risk of IS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

62,"Multiple RNA interaction can be modeled as a problem in combinatorial optimization, where the ""optimal"" structure is driven by an energy-minimization-like algorithm. However, the actual structure may not be optimal in this computational sense. Moreover, it is not necessarily unique. Therefore, alternative sub-optimal solutions are needed to cover the biological ground. We present a combinatorial formulation for the Multiple RNA Interaction problem with approximation algorithms to handle various interaction patterns, which when combined with Gibbs sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), can efficiently generate a reasonable number of optimal and sub-optimal solutions. When viable structures are far from an optimal solution, exploring dependence among different parts of the interaction can increase their score and boost their candidacy for the sampling algorithm. By clustering the solutions, we identify a few representatives that are distinct enough to suggest possible alternative structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,"In this study, a D-A cycloalkanone (K1) has been investigated by steady state absorption and fluorescence in neat solvents and in three binary mixtures of nonpolar aprotic/polar protic, polar aprotic/polar protic, and polar protic/polar protic solvents. The experimental findings were complemented by density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), and NBO quantum-mechanical calculations. Experimentally, effective changes in absorption and fluorescence were observed by solute-solvent interaction. The binary K1-solvent(1)-solv(2) configuration, modeled at the B3LYP-DFT level, confirms involvement of inter-molecular H-bonding with the carbonyl C=O in the fluorescence deactivation process (quenching). This is supported by considerable electron delocalization from C=O to the solvent's hydroxyl (n(O)sigma*(H-O)). This type of hyperconjugation was found to be the main driver for solute-solvent stabilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"The treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana plants with exogenous cytokinin (CK) followed by heat shock (HS) activated the expression of the genes for the plastid transcription machinery but adversely affected the plant viability. Abscisic acid (ABA), conversely, promoted maintaining the resistance to HS and had differentially affected different components of the plastid transcriptional complex. This hormone suppressed the accumulation of transcripts of PEP genes and the genes encoding PAP proteins, which are involved in DNA-RNA metabolism. However, it had no effect or activated the expression of NEP genes and PAP genes, which are involved in the redox regulation, as well as the genes encoding the stress-inducible trans-factor (SIG5) and the plastid transcription Ser/Thr protein kinase (cpCK2). Thus, for the adaptation of plants to elevated temperatures, both increase and decrease in the expression of the genes for the plastid transcriptional machinery with the involvement of various regulatory systems, including phytohormones, are equally significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"Human thrombopoietin (hTPO) is a primary hematopoietic growth factor that regulates megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. The non-glycosylated form of 1-163 residues of hTPO (hTPO(163)) including the N-terminal active site domain (1-153 residues) is a candidate for treating thrombocytopenia. However, the autoantigenicity level of hTPO(163) is higher than that of the full-length glycosylated hTPO (ghTPO(332)). In order to clarify the structural and physicochemical properties of hTPO(163), circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed. CD analysis indicated that hTPO(163) undergoes an induced-fit conformational change (+19.0% for helix and -16.7% for beta-strand) upon binding to the neutralizing antibody TN1 in a manner similar to the coupled folding and binding mechanism. Moreover, DSC analysis showed that the thermal transition process of hTPO(163) is a multistate transition; hTPO(163) is thermally stabilized upon receptor (c-Mpl) binding, as indicated with raising the midpoint (T-m) temperature of the transition by at least +9.5 K. The conformational variability and stability of hTPO(163) indicate that hTPO(163) exists as a molten globule under native conditions, which may enable the induced-fit conformational change according to the type of ligands (antibodies and receptor). Additionally, CD and computational analyses indicated that the C-terminal domain (154-332 residues) and glycosylation assists the folding of the N-terminal domain. These observations suggest that the antibody affinity and autoantigenicity of hTPO(163) might be reduced, if the conformational variability of hTPO(163) is restricted by mutation and/or by the addition of C-terminal domain with glycosylation to keep its conformation suitable for the c-Mpl recognition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"Motivation Standardization and semantic alignment have been considered one of the major challenges for data integration in clinical research. The inclusion of the CDISC SDTM clinical data standard into the tranSMART i2b2 via a guiding master ontology tree positively impacts and supports the efficacy of data sharing, visualization and exploration across datasets. Results We present here a schema for the organization of SDTM variables into the tranSMART i2b2 tree along with a script and test dataset to exemplify the mapping strategy. The eTRIKS master tree concept is demonstrated by making use of fictitious data generated for four patients, including 16 SDTM clinical domains.

67,"Lactic acid bacteria produce various antibacterial peptides such as bacteriocins that are active against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. Very little attention has been paid to the production of lysozyme as an antimicrobial enzyme. The present work represents one of the few studies reporting lysozyme production by enterococci. Indeed, this study was first conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus lactis Q1, an enterocin P-producing strain previously isolated from fresh shrimp (Penaeus vannamei), against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Results showed significant inhibitory activity (P<0.05) towards diverse pathogens. The purification of the antimicrobial substances produced by Q1 strain leads to the isolation of two active fractions. The SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses of fraction number 2 (fraction 2) revealed the presence of a protein with molecular mass of 14.3kDa. Additionally, the experimental results are consistent with mass spectra of industrial lysozyme (Fluka ref. 62970). The lysozyme produced by Enterococcus lactis Q1 strain was confirmed by a plate method against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698. Also, sensitivity of the Q1 strain to different concentrations of lysozyme was investigated. For the first time, this study shows that E. lactis Q1 produces lysozyme which could be an excellent candidate in food biopreservation or production of functional foods to promote health benefits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dimeric biological assembly and the sequence and fold conservation are typical of F-420 cofactor binding enzymes. Despite Rv2991 still being of unknown function, sequence and structural comparison with similar proteins enable a role to be proposed for its C terminal stretch of residues in recognizing and orienting the substrate. In addition, the C-terminus is involved in both protein folding and determining the size of the active site cavity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"beta-Cells contain a prominent endoplasmic reticulum (ER), disrupting ER homeostasis and function, activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). Currently, no direct protocols measure the UPR initiation. Current methods to measure ER stress include the quantification of nitric oxide (NO) (indirect method), Western blotting, and qRT-PCR of downstream components. However, these methods do not account for the overlap with mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, INS-1E cells were exposed to proinflammatory cytokines to induce ER stress, as determined using NO, thioflavin T (ThT) binding, and beta-cell functionality (insulin production). ER stress was confirmed through the upregulation of CHOP. Cell viability was monitored using MTT, sulforhodamine B, and the xCELLigence system. Morphological changes were monitored using electron microscopy. IL-1 beta exposure-induced beta-cell stress after 4 H, decreased insulin levels, and increased thioflavin binding were noted. Increased NO production was only detected after 10 H, highlighting its lack of sensitivity, and the need for a continuous, selective, rapid, convenient, and economical detection method for early onset of ER stress. Standard methods (MTT and NO) failed to detect early ER stress. The xCELLigence coupled with a functional assay such as the detection of insulin levels or ThT are better predictors of ER stress in INS-1E cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"In this work, we calculate the rovibrational energies and spectroscopic constants for the systems formed by ammonia (NH3) and noble gases (Ng=He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe). For the spectroscopic constant calculations, we used two different methods: Dunham and another one that use rovibrational energies (here calculated by discrete variable method). In both cases, we used the improved Lennard-Jones potential energy curves (PECs). These PECs, which describe very well van der Waals systems, were built using the dissociation and equilibrium distance obtained from experiments of crossed molecular beams. The spectroscopic constant results, obtained by both methods were in excellent agreement with each other for all NH3-Ng studied systems. Also in relation to NH3-He system, we realize that although this system has a relatively small dissociation energy, it has one vibrational level. Finally, the spectroscopic constants and fundamental rovibrational energy results were used to verify the stability of each system through the lifetime decomposition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"Lithium ion, commonly used as the carbonate salt in the treatment of bipolar disorders, has been identified as an inhibitor of several kinases, including Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 beta, for almost 20 years. However, both the exact mechanism of enzymatic inhibition and its apparent specificity for certain metalloenzymes are still a matter of debate. A data-driven hypothesis is presented that accounts for the specificity profile of kinase inhibition by lithium in terms of the presence of a unique protein environment in the magnesium-binding site. This hypothesis has been validated by the discovery of two novel potential targets for lithium, namely NEK3 and MOK, which are related to neuronal function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"It is known that long (200-300 nucleotides and longer) non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) tissue-specifically expressed from the regulatory regions of developmental genes can regulate the transcription of the mRNA of these genes. In this study, an attempt is made to identify differentially expressed ncRNAs in the extended promoter region of the fork head (fkh) gene of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We investigated four preparations of the total RNA: from embryos, from adult flies (separately from females and males), and from the S2 cell line of cultured Drosophila cells. In the total RNA preparations from embryos and adult flies, the levels of fkh expression differed substantially, whereas in S2 cells its expression is not detected at all (shown in this work). We perform classical Northern blot analysis of gel-separated RNAs hybridized to a series of radioactively labeled DNA fragments corresponding to the adjacent and partially overlapping regions of the promoter region of the fkh gene. Several previously unknown differentially expressed ncRNAs are detected, including those in the regions overlapping with the previously detected regulatory elements (TRE1 and salivary gland enhancer sgE) and the transcription start site of the fkh gene. The collected data complement and clarify the results of the previously conducted RNA-seq experiments, in particular, in terms of the length of the detected RNAs. These results may serve as a foundation for further studies of the mechanisms of tissue-specific regulation of the fkh gene expression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"Neutrophil recruitment / infiltration is a characteristic manifestation of pulmonary inflammatory diseases and is the first line of defense against pathogenic microbial invasion in the lungs, killing pathogenic microorganisms mainly through phagocytosis. However, new research has found that neutrophils can form a network called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that are DNA-based and inlaid with a large amount of active protein. This biological structure can capture and kill pathogenic microorganisms. Although it is beneficial for lung inflammatory diseases in terms of the biological function of NETs, more and more studies have shown that NETs have direct cytotoxic effects on lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells, and may promote the lung inflammatory diseases. In order to systematically understand the relationship between NETs and lung-related inflammatory diseases, this review first briefly describes the structure, function and formation process of NETs, and then describes the relationship of NETs and asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, influenza virus infection and acute lung injury, finally summarizes the potential research directions and targeted treatment strategies of NETs in pulmonary inflammatory diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

77,Proteins with homo-repeats of more than 4 amino acid residues in length were examined to understand whether some splicing sites in pre-mRNA may be attributed to homo-repeats in human proteins. The human proteome was found to contain a total of 404 proteins with homo-repeats that account for at least one splicing site in pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA splicing sites were more often found in the C-terminal part (67%) than in the middle or N-terminal part of a homo-repeat. Ten homo-repeats were identified to have two splicing sites per repeat. The repeats were lysine homo-repeats in all but one case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"Accumulating evidence suggested that transient receptor potential melastatin 2-antisense RNA (TRPM2-AS) played crucial roles in the progression of human cancers. However, the role of TRPM2-AS was still unknown in osteosarcoma. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical significance of TRPM2-AS in osteosarcoma patients, and determine the role of TRPM2-AS on osteosarcoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. In our results, we identified a novel oncogenic long noncoding RNA TRPM2-AS, which was overexpressed in osteosarcoma tissues and cells, and correlated with advanced Enneking stage, large tumor size and high histological grade in osteosarcoma cases. Survival analysis indicated that osteosarcoma patients with high TRPM2-AS expression had an obviously shorter overall survival time than those with low TRPM2-AS expression. Loss-of-function studies suggested that suppression of TRPM2-AS expression inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis through upregulating cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 expression. In conclusion, TRPM2-AS acts as an oncogenic long noncoding RNA and predicts poor prognosis in osteosarcoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of Pbx1 and Prep1, proteins of the TALE family (the three amino acid loop extension), was previously established in adipocyte differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells and 3T3-L1 cell line. In this study, with the use of RNA interference technology we show that another transcription factor from the same family, Meis1, which is a core protein of mature cardiomyocytes, represses adipogenesis to a greater degree than its paralog Meis2. A number of Meis target genes, markers of adipocytes, are identified. This may indicate the transcriptional mechanism of the effect of Meis1 on the adipocytedifferentiation of mouse preadipocytes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

81,The short-range combined water model (SRCW model) for the calculation of the hydration free energy of the non-polar solutes is presented. A mixed explicit/implicit representation of the solvent is used in the model. A thermodynamic basis for the boundary potential between explicit and implicit parts of the simulation area is derived. A simple functional form for the boundary potential minimizing the water density fluctuations in the explicit part is found. Hydration free energies of the model solutes are calculated in the frame of the developed model. Obtained values are in the good agreement with results of the Monte Carlo simulation using the periodic boundary conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

82,"Interferon beta (IFN beta) is used as a first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously (s.c.). The subcutaneous route is considered more immunogenic as it is associated with increased antidrug antibody-positive patients. The skin contains dendritic cells (DCs) and it is unclear whether these contribute to immunogenicity. To assess the effect of IFN beta on skin-resident cells, IFN beta was injected intradermally (i.d.) ex vivo using a human skin explant model or s.c. in vivo in MS patients. Ex vivo, intradermal IFN beta injections reduced migration and enhanced surface CD86 expression of dermal DCs, and an increased expression of HLA-DR+ was observed in skin biopsies taken after subcutaneous IFN beta injection (in vivo). In both models, IFN beta elevated the expression of several inflammatory cytokines when compared to the control biopsies. Our results show that 3 different IFN beta preparations, normalized in dose and injection site, induce similar immune responses, suggesting that the differences in immunogenicity are likely due to the route and frequency of administration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that there is a metabolic distinction between different fields of the solid tumor. In this way, there is a significant difference between the ascites and solid type of Ehrlich carcinoma. In the central area of the tested sample of tumor tissue, there is a high intensity of energetic metabolism and biosynthetic processes as opposed to the peripheral areas. Previously, we proposed the concept of nonspecific metabolic reaction of the cell in organism upon the influence of negative factors.

84,"Transcriptional regulation involves a series of sophisticated protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (PPI and PDI). Some transcriptional complexes, such as c-Fos/c-Jun and their binding DNA fragments, have been conserved over the past one billion years. Considering the thermodynamic principle for transcriptional complex formation, we hypothesized that the c-Fos/c-Jun complex may represent a thermodynamic summit in the evolutionary space. To test this, we invented a new method, termed One-Pot-seq, which combines cDNA display and proximity ligation to analyse PPI/PDI complexes simultaneously. We found that the wild-type c-Fos/c-Jun complex is indeed the most thermodynamically stable relative to various mutants of c-Fos/c-Jun and binding DNA fragments. Our method also provides a universal approach to detect transcriptional complexes and explore transcriptional regulation mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"Diagnostic molecular biology is a fast developing discipline of laboratory medicine widely used in numerous medical branches such as oncology, hematology, immunology, internal medicine, or infectious diseases, which will certainly have a major impact on clinical medicine in the near future.

Hence, in view of the foregoing, it appears obvious that modern medical education should put particular stress on selective acquiring, interpreting, and applying integrated multidisciplinary knowledge rather than on just absorbing and memorizing huge amount of scattered information. The presented case study aims at familiarizing the students with basic molecular biology techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Importantly, it is not limited only to discussing and learning the principles of the assays mentioned earlier, but it also shows their practical application in a particular diagnostic process and give the guidelines on how to explain and interpret exemplary results. In parallel, the way the case study is constructed allows a tutor to lead students into discussion on clinical aspects related to HIV infection what should eventually create complete picture of a HIV diagnostic process, thereby integrating basic knowledge of molecular biology laboratory techniques, HIV biology, and immunological response.

86,"The sedimentary Marl mudstone soil is composed primarily of CaCO3, and is an important pedologic and geomorphologic element known as Marl, extensively dispersed in slopes and ridges in the northern Negev Desert, Israel. The wide Marl soil-layer areas are barren, with well-developed streamsides and no perennial vegetation cover. Soil systems in the Negev Desert have been widely studied, yet very little information was collected on Marl soils, and even less on the microbiome present in the Negev. Thus, an evaluation of the microbial-community inhabitants in a Marl soil layer was conducted in an attempt to distinguish between Marl with surface green mat and bare Marl soil layer. Our objective was to investigate the microbiome and abiotic components of the upper layer (0-5cm) of Marl and Marl-with-green-mat soil collected in the Negev Desert. Plate-counting enabled the estimation of fungal and bacterial population size, while nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and Ion Torrent sequencing were used to analyze biological diversity. The results indicate significant differences in microbial biomass and microbial-community diversity between Marl and Marl-green mat, despite similar pH levels. Further study is needed to enhance understanding of the activity of the biotic components and their contribution to slope stabilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"The temperature dependence of the efficiency of energy migration from the CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with a fluorescence maximum at 580 nm to the reaction centers (RCs) of the bacteria Rb. sphaeroides is practically constant over the temperature range from 100 to similar to 230-240 K but then decreases 2.5-3 times as temperature further increases to 310 K. The analysis on this dependence on the basis of Forster's theory showed that the major changes in the energy transfer efficiency are associated with the temperature change in the quantum yield of QD fluorescence, which is due to the activation of intramolecular mobility in the RC structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,"To select the optimum method for disinfecting scaffolds before recellularization, the effects of octenisept and chlorhexidine at different concentrations on lung biological matrices before and after decellularization were studied by using morphological methods (studies of biomechanical strength of extracellular matrix fibers) and by analyzing chemiluminescence in rats. Chlorhexidine diluted 1 : 10 had the least damage on the matrix properties and to the greatest extent contributed to disinfection of scaffolds for their further storage and experimental studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"As of 2017, tuberculosis had infected 1.7 billion people (23% of the population of the world) and caused ten million deaths. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is quickly evolving, and new strains are classified as multidrug resistant. Thus, the identification of novel druggable targets is essential to combat the proliferation of these drug-resistant strains. Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z (FtsZ) is a key protein involved in cytokinesis, an important process for Mtb proliferation and viability. FtsZ is required for bacterial cell division because it polymerizes into a structure called the Z-ring, which recruits accessory division proteins to the septum. Here, the crystal structure of the MtbFtsZ protein has been determined to 3.46 angstrom resolution and is described as a dimer of trimers, with an inter-subunit interface between protomers AB and DE. In this work, a novel conformation of MtbFtsZ is revealed involving the T9 loop and the nucleotide-binding pocket of protomers BC and EF.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,"To develop a quantum-dot-based multiplexed imaging system for the simultaneous monitoring of Hsf-1/Hsp70 after heat shock, and to evaluate the effects of combined thermotherapy and leucine deprivation therapy on Hsf-1 inactivation. SCC-25 cells were leucine starved for 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 days following which the cells underwent heat shock at 42 degrees C for 30 min. At 6 h after heat shock, Hsf-1 activation and translocation to the nucleus was observed in cells that were leucine starved for 0, 1 and 2 days, and the synthesis of Hsp70 and Hsf-1 reached their maximum values and had a tendency to gather in the nucleus. However, in cells that were leucine starved for 3 and 4 days, Hsf-1 activity and Hsp70 synthesis level was dramatically decreased. Dietary restriction of leucine for at least three days could result in the inactivation of Hsf-1, leading to a reduction in Hsp70 synthesis. The combination of thermotherapy and short-term leucine deprivation therapy may become effective approach for the treatment of oral tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"A series of novel 2-(4-(acridin-9-ylamino)phenyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione derivatives were designed and synthesized namely 2-(4-(4-methoxyacridin-9-ylamino)phenyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione [S1], 2-(4-(3-chloroacridin-9ylamino)phenyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione [S2], 2-(4-(2-fluor oacridin-9ylamino)phenyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione [S3], 2-(4-(1,4-dichloroacridin-9ylamino) phenyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione [S4]. The photophysical, thermal properties of these compounds were characterized by the spectroscopic and thermographic method. The absorbance and fluorescence spectra of these derivatives were recorded in different solvents to understand the role of solute and solvent interaction. The compounds showed high thermal stability with thermal decomposition temperatures at 5% weight loss in a range of 250-287 degrees C. Compared with these compounds, donor groups containing derivatives exhibited excellent properties as fluorescent compounds. Computational studies were done using DFT (Density Functional Theory) G09 software (B3LYP/6-311G++V(d,p)) basis sets in order to calculate the optical band gap and FMO (Frontier Molecular Orbital) energies. The chemical stability of the four derivatives was determined by means of chemical hardness (eta) using HOMO-LUMO energies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"In the course of developing an assay to identify genes responsible for antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria, it has been found that standard (not DNA-free) Taq DNA polymerases were contaminated with bla(TEM), gene fragments that varied in length and quantities. The complete bla(TEM) gene sequence was either absent or was detected in infinitesimal amounts. We developed an approach to avoid false-positive findings caused by contaminating bla(TEM) gene sequences in conventional polymerases. The method is based on selection of a target sequence to be detected within the bla(TEM) gene in such a way that the chosen sequence is amplified with primers incapable of amplifying contaminating DNA sequences of the polymerase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone which promotes red cell replenishment and is also a global biotherapeutic medicine widely used to treat anaemia resulting, for example, from chemotherapy. Requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia stipulate that the level of dimer must be quantified in clinical EPO products (with a limit of 2%). Quantification is hampered by the lack of reference preparations containing stable measurable levels of EPO dimer, but the reproducible generation of a stable dimerised EPO preparation is challenging. We describe here the development of a lyophilised, chemically cross-linked EPO preparation, which has good stability and may be used for calibration and system suitability assurance for the size exclusion chromatographic separation of EPO preparations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"The endogenous gaseous transmitters (GTs) -nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-make up a special neuromodulatory system which mediates the development, maturation and plastic modification of nervous centers. We addressed immunolocalization of the key enzymes of GT synthesis, cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2) and constitutive NO synthase (nNOS), at different ontogenetic stages of the human fetal retina. CBS, CSE and HO-2 were found to be expressed in photoreceptor, bipolar and amacrine neurons, the number of which increases in the first and decreases in the third trimesters of gestation. The number of nNOS-immunopositive amacrine and ganglion neurons demonstrates inverse dynamics with maximal values in the third trimester. Uneven distribution patterns of the marker enzymes are discussed in the light of the modulatory function of GTs in neurogenesis of the human retina and their involvement in cytoprotective mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"This work determined the potency of hexyl-ciprofloxacin molecules that reversibly interact with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) passivated with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) on Escherichia coli cells. For this, partition of modified antibiotic between different compartments of the gold colloid was determined using analytical techniques. First, concentration of hexyl-ciprofloxacin was determined in the continuous phase of the colloid. Subsequently, the colloid was exposed to a volume of organic immiscible solvent and concentration of the transferred molecules was determined in the organic phase. Comparison of the amount of hexyl-ciprofloxacin in each phase revealed that interaction between molecules and nanoparticles was reversible. Later, this work determined the potency of a population of hexyl-ciprofloxacin molecules contained in a volume of the colloid, and the potency of other population of molecules that only interact with the continuous phase of the colloid. The absolute difference between these two values was proportional to the potency of a number of molecules that interact with the nanoparticles of the colloid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease, affects a large number of people worldwide, leading to death. Here, we analyzed the compositional features and trends of codon usage of the genes influencing COPD to understand molecular biology, genetics, and evolutionary relationships of these genes as no work was reported yet. Coding sequences of COPD genes were found to be rich in guanine-cytosine (GC) content. A high value (34-60) of the effective number of codons of the genes indicated low codon usage bias (CUB). Correspondence analysis suggested that the COPD genes were distinct in their codon usage patterns. Relative synonymous codon usage values of codons differed between the more preferred codons and the less-preferred ones. Correlation analysis between overall nucleotides and those at third codon position revealed that mutation pressure might influence the CUB of the genes. The high correlation between GC12 and GC3 signified that directional mutation pressure might have operated at all the three codon positions in COPD genes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strains produce Cry (crystal) and Cyt (cytolytic) proteins belonging to the group of bacterial toxins known as pore-forming toxins (PFTs), which interact with midgut cells of target insects to create pores, disruption of ion homeostasis and eventual death. PFTs have synergistic insecticidal activities and have been used as biopesticides against agriculturally important insects. Identification of new Cyt proteins is important because of their specific toxicity towards hemipteran pests, against which the Cry proteins are not effective. We have structurally characterized a cyt (cyt1007) gene from an Indian Bt isolate SK-1007. The presence of a Bacillus thuringiensis toxin domain and maximum identity of 36% with Cyt2Ca in the deduced amino acid sequence indicated Cyt1007 protein to be a new member of Cyt family. Three dimensional (3D) modeling (PMDB ID: PM0081490) revealed that it adopts a typical ferredoxin-like fold, and is composed of a single domain of / architecture, in which a single sheet is surrounded by two helical layers. The putative lipid binding site and probable mode of action of Cyt1007 protein were predicted through comparative analysis with other Cyt toxins and their distant homologs Evf (Erwinia virulence factor) and VVA2 (Volvatoxin A2). Heterologous expression of cyt1007 gene as a 25kDa protein in Escherichia coli was achieved at high levels in both soluble and insoluble fractions. Affinity chromatography-based purification yielded 83.6% purified Cyt1007 protein, which can be used for downstream applications for the investigation of its toxicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"BackgroundShort hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) expressed from vectors have been used as an effective means of exploiting the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in mammalian cells. Genome-scale screening with shRNA libraries has been used to investigate the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes on a large scale. Although several methods have been developed to construct shRNA libraries, their broad application has been limited by the high cost of constructing these libraries.ObjectiveWe develop a new method that efficiently constructs a shRNA library at low cost, using treatments with several enzymes and an oligonucleotide library.MethodsThe library of shRNA expression cassettes, which were cloned into a lentiviral plasmid, was produced through several enzymatic reactions, starting from a library of 20,000 different short oligonucleotides produced by microarray-based oligonucleotide synthesis.ResultsThe NGS sequence analysis of the library shows that 99.8% of them (19,956 from 20,000 sequences) were contained in the library: 63.2% of them represent the correct sequences and the rest showed one or two base pair differences from the expected sequences.ConclusionConsidering the ease of our method, shRNA libraries of new genomes and of specific populations of genes can be prepared in a short period of time for genome-scale RNAi library screening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"To perform optogenetic prosthetics of the retinal ganglion cell receptive field, a bicistronic genetic construct carrying the genes encoding the excitatory (channelrhodopsin-2) and inhibitory (Guillardia thetaanion channelrhodopsin GtACR2) rhodopsins was created. A characteristic feature of this construct was the combination of these two genes with a mutant IRES insertion between them, which ensures the exact ratio of expression levels of the first and second genes in each transfected cell. Illumination of the central part of the neuron with light with a wavelength of 470 nm induced the action potential generation in the cell. Stimulation of the peripheral neuronal region with light induced the inhibition of action potential generation. Thus, using optogenetics methods, we simulated the ON-OFF interaction in the retinal ganglion cell receptive field. Theoretically, this construct can be used for optogenetic prosthetics of degenerative retina in the case of its delivery to the ganglion cells with lentiviral vectors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
