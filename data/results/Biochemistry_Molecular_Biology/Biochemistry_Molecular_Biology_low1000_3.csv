The current study reports basic principles of chemical enhancement with aluminium sulphate coagulant in biofilm-MBR (Bf-MBR) based on results of total recycle tests performed at different dosages of the chemical enhancer and properties characterization of filtrates, supernatants and sediments. It demonstrates a possibility to achieve lower membrane fouling rates with dosing of aluminium sulphate coagulant into MBBR and IFAS mixed liquors by extending operational cycles by 20 and 80 time respectively as well as increasing operating permeability of membrane separation by 1.3 times for IFAS. It has been found that charge neutralization is the dominating mechanism of aluminium sulphate action as a chemical enhancer in Bf-MBR, however, properties of the membrane surface influencing charge repulsion of foulants should be considered together with the secondary ability of the coagulant to improve consolidation of sediments.",10.3390/membranes9100135,0,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

An ex vivo study was done by isolating neutrophils from the animals post artificial insemination (AI) at defined intervals and analyzing the expression changes of Glucocorticoid receptor-a (GR alpha) and Interleukin-8 receptor (CXCR1) genes. An in vitro study was also done isolating neutrophils from prepubertal heifers subjecting them to IFNT and Progesterone P-4 supplementation separately. We observed that from day 14 post Artificial Insemination, there is a significant up-regulation of neutrophil GR alpha and CXCR1 in pregnant and non-pregnant cows respectively. The in vitro study showed that IFNT significantly up-regulates GR alpha whereas P-4 significantly up-regulates CXCR1. The total leukocyte count and neutrophil count were also significantly higher in non-pregnant cows. We conclude that IFNT efficiently mediates neutrophil immunosuppression during peri-implantation period in cows by interacting with Interleukin 8 receptor and can also exert ligand independent actions on GR alpha.

The present study determined the possible effects of Tsukamurella inchonensis (Ti) on diabetes enteropathy on rat small intestine. Materials and methods: A total of 40 rats were divided into four groups of 10. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Oral administration of Ti at dose of 10(5) and 10(7) CFU/rat was performed in two groups continuously for 14 days. The third and fourth groups received normal saline as the diabetic and negative control groups, respectively. The blood and intestine tissue samples were taken on 21st day post treatment for biochemical and pathological evaluations. Results: Significant differences were found in serum glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides values together with in CAT and SOD activities, MDA level and IL-6 concentration in both Ti treated groups in comparison with the diabetic rats. Moreover, there were severe pathological changes including degeneration of intestinal mucosa, mononuclear cell infiltration, decreasing number of goblet cells and villous length associated with increasing in villous thickness on the diabetic rats which markedly attenuated in both Ti recipient groups.

Pristipomoides filamentosus constitutes a significant portion of catch landed in demersal fisheries throughout the species' distribution range. Despite the species' economic importance, there is insufficient data to guide the species' conservation management, especially within the south-western (SW) Indian Ocean region. The aims of the present study were to conduct a population genetic analysis to determine the spatial genetic structure of the species and, whether different management units could be established in the region, using an analysis of both mitochondrial DNA fragment (mtDNA), and nuclear microsatellite loci. A total of 193 fin clips were collected from Seychelles, Kenya, Tanzania, Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and South Africa, with each having an established fishery of the species. Both haplotype diversity (h) and expected heterozygosity (H-E) for mtDNA and microsatellite loci respectively were generally high for all localities, except for Seychelles where both diversity indices were at the lowest (i.e. h = 0.429 +/- 0.134; H-E = 0.647 +/- 0.059). Even though mtDNA failed to detect population differentiation, the hypervariable microsatellite loci consistently indicated presence of four genetic clusters irrespective of the clustering approach applied. Based on present results, we propose recognising the four clusters as distinct fisheries management units of the species in the SW Indian Ocean region.",10.1007/s11033-019-04962-w,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, cytotoxicity of GGA has also been reported. Some studies have reported that GGA suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis in cell models of human leukemia, ovarian carcinoma, and colon cancer in vitro. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether GGA can have a cytotoxic effect on a human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2), and human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK) in normal-glucose and high-glucose environments (NG and HG, respectively). The results showed that 100 mu M GGA inhibited proliferation of HeLa cells only in NG environment despite inhibiting proliferation of Caco-2 and HEK cells regardless of glucose concentration. Cell viability assay revealed that GGA decreased viability of HeLa, Caco-2, and HEK cells only in NG environment. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the type of cell death was a combination of necrosis and apoptosis. Our study revealed that difference in cytotoxicity of GGA is influenced by glucose condition. The cytotoxic effects of GGA are attenuated in the HG condition. Since both cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects are reported about GGA, further research is needed about the mechanism of the cytotoxic effects.",10.1089/biores.2018.0041,4,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

Based on spectral data, the name and structure of the antibiotic SBR-22 were identified as 1,5-dihydroxy- 5-methyl- 7- (N,N-dimethyl) amino- 6,8,11,12- tetraoxo- 7,9,10 -hexahydro- naphthacene. Unlike the standard oxytetracycline pharmacophore (OTP) at C2 and C1 positions, the SBR-22 molecule lacked (C9) -carbamido and (C10) keto functional groups. Furthermore, the oxidation of the B-ring, caused by the presence of two keto carbonyls at opposite positions, resulted in a Quinone ring system, making it an effective antibiotic. Unlike the OTP molecule, four prime functional groups in the A and B-rings were either absent or altered in this native novel molecule SBR-22, which successfully retained its bioactivity against inhibit multidrug resistant strains of bacteria. Hence, this new analogue SBR-22 is effective (64 mu g/ml(-1) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90)) against methicillin resistant Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and human pathogenic fungi Aspergillus wentii and A. niger (42 mu g/ml(-1) of MIC90).

Disulfiram is the first approved drug by the Food and Drug Administration for alcohol-dependent patients, which targets the ALDH2 enzyme. Several genes are known to be involved in alcohol metabolism; mutations in any of these genes are known to be associated with AUD. The E504K mutation in the ALDH2 of the precursor protein or the E487K of the mature protein (E504K/E487K; ALDH2*2 allele) is carried by approximately 8% of the world population. In this study, we aimed to test the known inactive allele ALDH2*2, to validate the use of our extensive computational pipeline (in silico tools, molecular modeling, and molecular docking) for testing the interaction between the ALDH2*2 allele, NAD(+,) and Disulfiram. In silico predictions showed that the E504K variant of ALDH2 to be pathogenic and destabilizing with the maximum number of prediction in silico tools. Consequently, we studied the effect of this mutation mainly on the interaction between NAD(+)-E504K and Disulfiram-E504K complexes using molecular docking technique, and molecular dynamics (MD) analysis. From the molecular docking analysis with NAD(+), we observed that the interaction affinity of the NAD(+) decreases with the impact of E504K variant. On the other hand, the drug Disulfiram showed similar interaction in both the native and mutant ALDH2 proteins. Further, the comprehensive MD analysis predicted that the E504K destabilizes the protein and influences the NAD(+) and Disulfiram interactions. Our findings reveal that the interaction of NAD(+) to the protein is disturbed by the E504K/E487K variant whereas the drug Disulfiram has a similar effect as both native ALDH2 and ALDH2 bearing E504K/E487K variant. This study provides a platform to understand the effect of E504K/E487K on the molecular interaction with NAD(+) and Disulfiram.",10.1002/jcb.28964,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed analytical procedure consists of few steps: dilution of urine or drug in distilled water, centrifugation for 2 min (12,000g), separation by MEKC and ultraviolet-absorbance detection of NKD at 260 nm. The background electrolyte used was 0.035 mol/L pH 9 borate buffer with the addition of 0.05 mol/L sodium dodecyl sulfate and 6.5% ACN. Effective separation was achieved within 5.5 min under a voltage of 21 kV (~90 mu A) using a standard fused-silica capillary (effective length 51 cm, 75 mu m i.d.).

Despite its many functions, the central event in the complement system is the proteolytic activation of the 185 kDa complement component 3 (C3) into its opsonin and anaphylatoxin fragments known as C3b (175 kDa) and C3a (10 kDa), respectively. The C3 protein is comprised of thirteen separate structural domains, several of which undergo extensive structural rearrangement upon activation to C3b. In addition to this, the C-terminal C345c domain found in C3, C3b, and the terminal degradation product, C3c (135 kDa), appears to adopt multiple conformations relative to the remainder of the molecule. To facilitate various structure/function studies, we designed two C3 analogs that could be activated to a C345c-less, C3c-like state following treatment with Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. We generated stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines that secrete approximately 1.5 mg of the highest-expressing C3 analog per liter of conditioned culture medium. We purified this C3 analog by sequential immobilized metal ion affinity and size exclusion chromatographies, activated the protein by digestion with TEV protease, and purified the resulting C3c analog by a final size exclusion chromatography. The conformations and activities of our C3 and C3c analogs were assessed by measuring their binding profiles to known C3/b/c ligands by surface plasmon resonance. Together, this work demonstrates the feasibility of producing a C3 analog that can be site-specifically activated by an exogenous proteolytic enzyme.",10.1016/j.jim.2019.07.005,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which contains four types of histones (H3, H4, H2A and H2B) and approximately 150 base pairs of DNA wrapped around the histone complex. The structure of the nucleosome is highly conserved across several eukaryotic species, and molecular replacement has been the primary phasing method used to solve nucleosome structures by X-ray crystallography. However, there is currently no simple, widely applicable experimental phasing method for the nucleosome. In the present study, it is demonstrated that selenomethionine-incorporated histones H3, H2A and H2B can be reconstituted into nucleosomes and crystallized for structural determination. Unexpectedly, it was found that the nucleosome can be phased with a relatively small number of Se atoms. The structures of nucleosome core particles containing 12 and 16 Se atoms were solved by SAD phasing at 2.5 and 2.4 angstrom resolution, respectively.

TAP, an advanced anaerobic digestion (AD) process, features biogas plasticization that greatly increases gas production and leaves a mineralized residual. Measured residue HHVs are compared to HHV estimates from literature empirical relationships. Two empirical formulations, the Meraz thermodynamic formulation (with 7.4% moisture) (Meraz et al. The Chemical Educator, 7(2), 66-70, (2002) and the Channiwala Universal formulation (Channiwala et al. Fuel, 81(8), 1051-1063, (2002), compared favorably (within +/- 3% mean value) with the bomb measured HHV values. A stoichiometric ICC description for Ucells is derived. The thermodynamic formation potentials of all measured residues are derived including Ucells. An empirical method was used to calculate the entropy of formation ( increment S-f) for all residues and Ucells. Krevelen plots show residue molar ratios of oxygen and hydrogen to carbon (H/C, O/C) are linearly correlated with HHV and formation potentials ( increment (f)G', increment H-f', increment S-f') with strong statistical coefficients of determination (R-2). Residue H/C and O/C ratios fell across the peat classification on the biomass coalification diagram. A wide AD methane fermentation zone <= 18.6 MJ/kg is identified. The methods and correlation relationships presented enable the computation of accurate HHV and thermodynamic formation potentials without the necessity of direct thermal measurement.

It is also unclear whether these associations are the result of excessive changes in lipid metabolism during pregnancy or genetic variability in genes controlling basal lipid metabolism. This study investigates the association between genetic risk scores (GRS) for four lipid components (high-density lipoprotein [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein [LDL-C], triacylglycerols [TAG], and total cholesterol [TC]) with risk for PTB. Subjects included 954 pregnant women from California for whom second trimester serum samples were available, of which 479 gave birth preterm and 475 gave birth at term. We genotyped 96 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which were selected from genome-wide association studies of lipid levels in adult populations. Lipid-specific GRS were constructed for HDL-C, LDL-C, TAG, and TC. The associations between GRS and PTB were analyzed using logistic regression. A higher HDL-C GRS was associated with increased risk for PTB overall and spontaneous PTB. Higher TAG and TC GRS were associated with decreased risk for PTB overall and spontaneous PTB. This study identifies counter-intuitive associations between lipid GRS and spontaneous PTB. Further replication studies are needed to confirm these findings, but they suggest that our current scientific understanding of the relationship between lipid metabolism, PTB, and genetics is incomplete.",10.1002/lipd.12186,13,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The metal complexes were characterized by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic methods, as well as thermogravimetric analysis; the octahedral coordination geometries with water coordination were optimized by DFT calculations. The antioxidant assays showed that [FeL14H(2)O](+) was able to scavenge synthetic radicals with moderate capacity, whereas the other metal chelates did not show significant activity.

Among the many possible causes are changes in species composition (taxon sampling) that could influence phylogenetic accuracy of the methods by altering the relative weight of the evolutionary histories of each individual species. This effect would be stronger in clades that are represented by few lineages, which is common in many prokaryote phyla. Indeed, phyla with fewer taxa showed the most discordance among recent TOL studies. We implemented an approach to systematically test how the identity of taxa among a larger dataset and the number of taxa included affected the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction. Results: Utilizing an empirical dataset within Terrabacteria we found that even within scenarios consisting of the same number of taxa, the species used strongly affected phylogenetic stability. Furthermore, we found that trees with fewer species were more dissimilar to the tree produced from the full dataset. These results hold even when the tree is composed by many phyla and only one of them is being altered. Thus, the effect of taxon sampling in one group does not seem to be buffered by the presence of many other clades, making this issue relevant even to very large datasets. Our results suggest that a systematic evaluation of phylogenetic stability through taxon resampling is advisable even for very large datasets.",10.1093/bioinformatics/btz121,15,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Using thymus tissues, 6091 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in three dietary groups. After clustering of total of 6091 DEGs using Gene Ontology (GO) categories, a total of 400 genes were identified to be involved in immune system process (GO:0002376) GO categories. KEGG pathway and gene co-expression network analysis of these immune-related DEGs were done using String database. The results were confirmed with measuring mRNA expression levels of four selected immune-related DEGs genes (Casp3, Thy1, IL-16 and CD4) using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Results: The expression levels of immune-related genes were different in three RNA-seq data. Conclusion: The results provide useful information to investigate the immune-related transcriptional profiling in thymus tissue of breast cancer mouse model applied to two different types of CR and to identify the specific functional immune related genes in response to CR during cancer development.",10.1515/tjb-2018-0121,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To survive, it must repair its damaged DNA. We have shown that a base excision DNA repair (BER)-specific parasite TcAP1 endonuclease is involved in the resistance to H2O2. However, a putative TcAP1 negative dominant form impairing TcAP1 activity in vitro did not show any in vivo effect. Here, we show that a negative dominant form of the human APE1 apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease (hAPE1DN) induces a decrease in epimastigote and metacyclic trypomastigote viability when parasites were exposed to H2O2. Those results confirm that TcAP1 AP endonuclease activity plays an important role in epimastigote and in infective metacyclic trypomastigote oxidative DNA damage resistance leading to parasite persistence in the insect and mammalian hosts. All along its biological cycle and in its different cellular forms, T. cruzi, the etiological parasite agent of Chagas' disease, is under the attack of reactive species produced by its mammalian and insect hosts. To survive, T. cruzi must repair their oxidative damaged DNA. We have previously shown that a specific parasite TcAP1 AP endonuclease of the BER is involved in the T. cruzi resistance to oxidative DNA damage. We have also demonstrated that epimastigotes and cell-derived trypomastigotes parasite forms expressing a putative TcAP1 negative dominant form (that impairs the TcAP1 activity in vitro), did not show any in vivo effect in parasite viability when exposed to oxidative stress. In this work, we show the expression of a negative dominant form of the human APE1 AP endonuclease fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP; hAPE1DN-GFP) in T. cruzi epimastigotes. The fusion protein is found both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of noninfective epimastigotes but only in the nucleus in metacyclic and cell-derived trypomastigote infective forms. Contrarily to the TcAP1 negative dominant form, the ectopic expression of hAPE1DN-GFP induces a decrease in epimastigote and metacyclic trypomastigote viability when parasites were exposed to increasing H2O2 concentrations. No such effect was evident in expressing hAPE1DN-GFP cell-derived trypomastigotes. Although the viability of both wild-type infective trypomastigote forms diminishes when parasites are submitted to acute oxidative stress, the metacyclic forms are more resistant to H2O2 exposure than cell-derived trypomastigotes.Those results confirm that the BER pathway and particularly the AP endonuclease activity play an important role in epimastigote and metacyclic trypomastigote oxidative DNA damage resistance leading to parasite survival and persistence inside the mammalian and insect host cells.",10.1002/jcb.28931,20,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,

In this study, a full-length cDNA putatively encoding a FACE-1/Ste24p CaaX protease (type I) of the Schistosoma japonicum was isolated. The cDNA, named SjSte24p, composed of 1646 bp and encoded 473 amino acids with predicted Mr/pI as 54.77 kDa/8.04. SjSte24p is a monoexonic gene constantly expressed in the parasite from cercariae to adult stages. It contained the characteristic of CaaX protease topology, including seven trans-membrane domains and a metallo-protease segment with a zinc-binding motif (HEXXH). SjSte24p shared a considerable degree of sequence identity with the type I CaaX proteases. A phylogenetic analysis showed that this protein family is tightly conserved from fungi to vertebrates. The expressed recombinant SjSte24p protein showed a proteolytic activity, which was inhibited by EDTA. Its activity was increased at low doses of the Zn2+ (0.001-0.01 mM); but was reversibly down-regulated at high doses (> 0.1 mM). The native SjSte24p appeared to function in insoluble from.

Existing drug repositioning techniques mainly focus on discovering candidate drugs for a kind of disease, and are not suitable for predicting candidate drugs for an individual sample. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a disorder of glucose homeostasis caused by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta-cell. Here, we present a novel single sample drug repositioning approach for predicting personalized candidate drugs for T1DM. Our method is based on the observation of drug-disease associations by measuring the similarities of individualized pathway aberrance induced by disease and various drugs using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov weighted Enrichment Score algorithm. Using this method, we predicted several underlying candidate drugs for T1DM. Some of them have been reported for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, and some with a current indication to treat other diseases might be repurposed to treat T1DM.

Here, we report a simple and feasible solution to design RNA nanocarriers based on nucleic acid condensation by bi- and trivalent metal ions during thermal cycling. Efficient RNA conversion to nanoparticles with small size (10-50 nm) suitable for transfection was achieved using cations Ni2+, Co2+ or Cu2+ alone or in combination with Ca2+ at the specially selected concentrations (2.0 mM-3.5 mM), low ionic strength, and narrow pH range (8.0-8.5). Other ions - Mn2+, Zn2+, Tb3+, or Gd3+ - caused RNA-cleaving effect that was abolished in the presence of Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+, or Cu2+. Naked RNA-metal ion nanoparticles were extremely unstable in phosphate buffer and sensitive to serum ribonucleases (RNases), and this problem was solved by treatment with polyarginines-16 and 8. Polyarginine-stabilized nanoparticles, containing malachite green (MG) aptamer RNA and metal cations, crossed the cell membrane, dissociated in the cytoplasm, and preserved the functionality of transported RNA, as judged from efficient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The technology, involving RNA condensation by metal cations, can be used as a cheap alternative to produce nanoscale carriers to deliver various RNAs into cells in vitro and in vivo.

The two-dimensional mass cluster plot method (2D m/z cluster plot method) significantly improves separation visualization by measuring the retention time, t(R), and peak width-at-base, w(b), of each analyte peak on a per mass channel, m/z, basis and plotting w(b) versus t(R) as a single point for each peak. Additional selectivity is provided by the peak width dimension, allowing for the differentiation of ""pure"" or selective m/z and shared or overlapped m/z. Analyte clusters in the 2D mass cluster plot are defined based on clustering of individual points, representing the selective m/z for those analytes, and encompassed by a box of user-specified size. The method is applied to simulated chromatographic data with a random, independent distribution of analyte peaks and constant peak w(b). Two levels of chromatographic saturation factor, alpha, and two sets of analyte mass spectra with varying spectral similarity are studied to assess method performance. The percentage of analyte clusters found relative to the number of analytes simulated in the chromatogram increases as the box size (analogous to chromatographic resolution, R-s) is decreased, resulting in an R-s limit of 0.05 for the method. Additionally, the percentage of analyte clusters discovered also increases with lower alpha and greater dissimilarity between analyte mass spectra, demonstrating the immense benefit of improving the chromatographic separation and chemical selectivity in analyte discovery, identification, and quantification.

The results revealed a new conformational state forming following the inward motion of the subunits and stabilized with several hydrogen bonds to residues located on the border or within the C-terminal linker, i.e. a modeled extension of the C-terminus by residues 675-683. Forming of this new, compact Ncd conformation critically depends on the length of the C-terminus extending to at least residue 681.

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of cFXIII gene activation using genetic information from the A-subunit of cFXIII (cFXIII-A). Real-time PCR that amplified the active site (exons 7-8) of cFXIII-A showed increased cFXIII-A mRNA in the retina after ONI, whereas the PCR that amplified the activation peptide (exons 1-2) showed no change. RT-PCR analysis that amplified exons 1-8 showed two bands, a faint long band in the control retina and a dense short band in the injured retina. Therefore, we conclude that activated cFXIII-A mRNA after ONI is shorter than that of the control retina. Western blot analysis also confirmed an active form of 65 kDa cFXIII-A protein in the injured retina compared to the control 84 kDa protein. 5'-RACE analysis using injured retina revealed that the short cFXIII-A mRNA lacked exons 1, 2 and part of exon 3. Exon 3 has two sites of heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) binding consensus sequence. Intraocular injection of HSF inhibitor suppressed the expression of cFXIII-A mRNA in the retina 1 day after ONI to 40% of levels normally seen after ONI. Chromatin immunoprecipitation provides direct evidence of enrichment of cFXIII-A genomic DNA bound with HSF-1. The present data indicate that rapid HSF-1 binding to the cFXIII-A gene results in cleavage of activation peptide and an active form of short cFXIII-A mRNA and protein in the zebrafish retina after ONI without thrombin.

However, even the most stable Trp-cage circular permutants are still less stable than the analogous standard topology (std) Trp-cages. Extending mutational studies of Trp-cage fold stability to cp-species, including analogs lacking chain terminal charges, has uncovered and quantitated some additional stabilizing and destabilizing interactions. Upon protonation, the circular permutants are destabilized to a much greater extent than the standard topology series.

In human, three Gas7 isoforms can be expressed from a single Gas7 gene, while only the longest isoform, hGas7c, possesses an SH3 domain at the N-terminus. To date, the structure and function of hGas7 SH3 domain are still unclear. Here, we reported the solution NMR structure of hGas7 SH3 domain (hGas7-SH3), which displays a typical SH3 beta-barrel fold comprising five beta-strands and one 3(10)-helix. Structural and sequence comparison showed that hGas7-SH3 shares high similarity with Abl SH3 domain, which binds to a high-affinity proline-rich peptide P41 in a canonical SH3-ligand binding mode through two hydrophobic pockets and a specificity site in the RT-loop. However, unlike Abl-SH3, only six residues in the RT-loop and two residues adjacent to but not in the two hydrophobic pockets of hGas7-SH3 showed significant chemical shift perturbations in NMR titrations, suggesting a low affinity and a non canonical binding mode of hGas7-SH3 for P41. Furthermore, four peptides selected from phage-displayed libraries also bound weakly to hGas7-SH3, and the binding region of hGas7-SH3 was mainly located in the RT-loop as well. The ligand identifications through structural similarity searching and peptide library screening in this study imply that although hGas7-SH3 adopts a typical SH3 fold, it probably possesses distinctive ligand-binding specificity.

J,"Ameline, A; Raul, JS; Kintz, P",Testing for midazolam and oxycodone in blood after formalin-embalmment: About a complex medico-legal case,"The stability of compounds in formalin solution is an important factor for drug analysis in a toxicological investigation. In this article, the authors report a complex medico-legal case involving midazolam and oxycodone. The complexity of this case comes from the fact that the body was embalmed with formalin solution before the autopsy. This technique, called thanatopraxy, allows the preservation of corpses from decomposition, the destruction of a maximal number of micro-organisms, and the presentation of the body with a natural appearance to the family. Unfortunately, when thanatopraxy is performed before the collection of biological specimens, the toxicological results are not representative of the time of the death. In addition, the interpretation of the results is difficult, because formalin can cause oxidation of xenobiotics present in the body at the time of the death, alter the pH of the tissues and dilute the compounds. To document the chemical stability of midazolam and oxycodone in formalin solution and interpret the results, a stability study was conducted for 21 days. Blood containing midazolam and oxycodone was spiked with formalin, kept at 4 degrees C and regularly tested for both drugs. This study showed a rapid degradation of midazolam and oxycodone (85% during the first 24 hours for oxycodone). In the peripheral blood of the victim, methanol (1.31 g/L), midazolam (74ng/mL) and oxycodone (152 ng/mL) were identified.

J,"Aydar, E; Palmer, C",Effect of Sigma-1 Receptors on Voltage-Gated Sodium Ion Channels in Colon Cancer Cell Line SW620,"Background: Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) play pivotal roles in the metastatic process in several cancers, including breast and colon cancers. Sigma-1 receptors are known to interact and form complexes with a number of ion channels aiding the delivery of the channel protein to the plasma membrane. Drugs that bind the Sigma-1 receptor are hypothesized to affect this process and reduce the delivery of the channel protein to the plasma membrane, in turn reducing the metastatic potential of the cells. Methods: Human colon cancer cell line SW620 was utilized as a model to investigate the interaction between the neonatal VGSC (nNav1.5) and the Sigma-1 receptor. This was accomplished using drugs that bind the Sigma-1 receptor, Sigma-1 receptor silencing, and antibodies that bind and block the nNav1.5 channel. Results: Sigma-1 receptor drugs SKF10047 and dimethyl tryptamine were found to alter (reduce) the adhesion of these cells by 46-54% at a 20 mu M drug concentration. In a similar manner, gene silencing of the Sigma-1 receptor had a similar effect in reducing the adhesion of these cells to collagen-coated plates by 30%. The Sigma-1 receptor was found to be in a complex with nNav1.5 in SW620 cells, and Sigma-1 drugs or gene silencing of the Sigma-1 receptor results in a reduction of the surface expression of nNav1.5 by similar to 50%. Culture of SW620 cells under hypoxic conditions resulted in upregulation of the Sigma-1 receptor and nNav1.5. In addition, surface expression of nNav1.5 protein increased under hypoxic culture conditions and this was inhibited by the application of SKF10047. Conclusions: It is proposed that in colon cancer cells, upregulated Sigma-1 receptor expression in hypoxia led to increased nNav1.5 protein expression at the plasma membrane and resulted in the cells switching to a more invasive state.",10.1089/bioe.2019.0015,47,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no

Though many drought tolerant genotypes have been developed, there is very poor understanding of the tolerance mechanisms in these genotypes. Whole genome transcriptome analysis is an established high throughput genomic method employed for understanding complex traits like drought tolerance. We have employed RNA-seq analysis for understanding the drought tolerance of maize inbred line Z59 grown in kharif (wet season) and rabi (dry season). The physiological parameters recorded during the plant growth show difference in the values for relative water content and proline level but no significant changes were seen in root and shoot length. Leaf sample of irrigated and water stressed plants at reproductive stage were sequenced, transcripts were assembled, and the abundance were calculated. The results showed overall difference in expression level of genes in kharif (wet season) and rabi (dry season). The data was comparatively analyzed for genes differentially expressed between the irrigated and water stressed plants in both seasons. Taking p >= 0.001 and at least fourfold change in expression, a total of 453 and 774 genes were found to be differentially expressed amongst the irrigated and water stressed plants grown in kharif (wet season) and rabi (dry season)seasons respectively. Out of the 453 genes in kharif (wet season) grown plants, 227 genes were found to be up regulated and 226 genes were down regulated and in the 774 differentially expressed genes in rabi (dry season) grown plants, 460 genes were found to be up regulated and 314 genes were down regulated, in the water stressed sample when compared to irrigated.

In fact, we found that the sequence of the linker between TAD I and III affected the solubility of free miniAdr1 proteins, as well as the stability of their complexes with DNA. miniAdr1-BL is the stable unit able to recognize ADH2 in vitro, and hence it is a promising tool for future studies on nucleosomal DNA binding and transcription machinery assembly in vitro.",10.3390/biom9090497,49,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

In this paper, we implemented a new version of a robust unsupervised clustering method from MR tractography data using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. New method: Conventional DBSCAN clustering methods for MR tractography data use each fiber's start and end point as well as the distance between start and end points. Instead, in this study, we extracted and used a fiber-distance matrix generated for all fiber combinations from the tractography dataset in DBSCAN clustering.

Results: Performing the proposed CSI-optimized DBSCAN-based clustering method on MR tractography data of the superior longitudinal fasciculus generated 6 robust, non-overlapping, clusters that are neuroanatomically related. Comparison with existing methods: Conventional DBSCAN-based clustering methods have intrinsic error potential in the clustering results due to deviations in fiber shape and fiber location.

Following collisional activation via electron capture from nitrogen gas, complexes for n in the range 2-6 exhibit a switch in reaction product as a function of n.

For two isomers of butanol, the n = 3 complexes were found to follow parallel, but different metastable pathways: one leading to the appearance of CaOH+ and another that resulted in proton abstraction to form ROH2+. These differences have been attributed to the precursor complexes adopting geometries where one ROH molecule occupies a secondary solvation shell.

Unfortunately, most of the tumours are refractive to the differentiation cues. The aim of this investigation was to analyse the effects of prolonged treatment with retinoic acid on two cell lines of neural origin refractive to differentiation. Cells were also treated with retinoic acid in combination with a poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor because PARP1 is a known chromatin modulator and can influence the process of differentiation. The main methods comprised tumour cell line culturing and treatment; analysis of RNA and protein expression after cell treatment; as well as analysis of urokinase activity, migration, and proliferation. Both cell lines continued to proliferate under the prolonged treatment and showed increase in urokinase plasminogen activator activity. Analysis of gene expression and cell phenotype revealed different mechanisms, which only in neuroblastoma H4 cells could indicate the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The data collected indicate that the activity of the urokinase plasminogen activator, although belonging to an extracellular protease, does not necessary lead to epithelial-mesenchymal reprogramming and increase in cell migration but can have different outcomes depending on the intracellular milieu.",10.3390/biomedicines7030070,61,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

We used PCR amplicon sequencing of taxonomic markers to assess distribution and co-occurrence patterns of bacterial and fungal species found in 25 chia (Salvia hispanica L.) samples originating from eight different sources. The use of nutrient-rich and oligotrophic media enabled isolation of 71 strains encompassing 16 bacterial species, of which five corresponded to phylotypes represented in the molecular survey. Tolerance to different growth inhibitors and antibiotics was tested to assess the physiological traits of these isolates.

To date, low repetition rate laser sources with over half a millijoule per pulse have been required in order to provide the high peak power densities for effective two-photon excitation over the large area. However, this configuration suffers from reduced signal intensity due to the low repetition rate, saturation effects due to increased excitation fluences, as well as faster photobleaching of the fluorescence probe. In contrast, with the recent advent of high repetition rate, high pulse energy laser systems could potentially provide the advantages of high repetition rate systems that are seen in traditional two-photon microscopes, while minimizing the negatives of high fluences in WF-TeFo setups to date. Here, we use a 100 microjoule/high repetition rate (50-100 kHz) laser system to investigate the performance of a WF-TeFo two-photon microscope. While using micro-beads as a sample, we demonstrate a proportionate increase in signal intensity with repetition rate, at no added cost in photobleaching. By decreasing pulse intensity, via a corresponding increase in repetition rate to maintain fluorescence signal intensity, we find that the photobleaching rate is reduced by similar to 98.4%. We then image live C. elegans at a high repetition rate for 25 min. as a proof-of-principle. Lastly, we identify the steady state temperature increase as the limiting process in further increasing the repetition rate, and we estimate that repetition rate in the range between 0.5 and 5 MHz is ideal for live imaging with a simple theoretical model.

Monophenolase activity was inhibited, and the diphenolase activity was enhanced in the presence of these conjugates. Detailed Michaelis-Menten studies show that both V-max and K-m are modified, consistent with a mixed inhibition mechanism. Collectively, the results show that the compounds interact in the enzyme's active site, but also modify the distribution of the enzyme's oxidation states that are responsible for catalysis.",10.1111/php.13110,80,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

The HCV NS3 protein is an essential protease for viral polyprotein processing and it requires a NS4A protein as a cofactor for full activity. NS3 and its recombinant protease are currently regarded as a potential target for antiviral drugs. Therefore, finding a specific inhibitor is highly important. In this study, 50,000 peptide bond-containing compounds were screened for the ability against NS3 protease. Three compounds with free energy less than - 10 Kcal/mol were selected, in which, (Z)-2-(3-(3-ethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-5-ylidene)-2-oxoindolin-1-yl)-N-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)acetamide showed the highest inhibition against NS3/4A protease. This compound was further investigated in vitro for the ability to inhibit HCV protease and revealed that it competes with substrate to bind into active sites. The kinetic parameter of NS4A-GSGS-NS3 protease with the compound indicated IC50 value of 61.1 mu M and K-i of 6.9 mu M.

J,"Vasudevan, SV; Kumar, A",Antimicrobial peptide ROAD-1 triggers phase change in local membrane environment to execute its activity,"Emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has paved way for development of newer class of drugs that would not be susceptible to resistance. Antimicrobial peptides such as defensins that target the microbial membrane are promising candidates. ROAD-1 is an alpha-defensin present in the oral cavity of rhesus macaque and shares very high sequence similarity to human enteric defensin 5. In this study we have performed microsecond long all atom molecular dynamic simulations to understand the mechanism of action of ROAD-1. We find that ROAD-1 is able to adopt an energetically stable conformation predominantly stabilized by electrostatic interactions only in presence of bacterial membranes. In mammalian membrane even though it gets absorbed onto the bilayer, it is unable to adopt an equilibrium conformation. Binding of ROAD-1 to bilayer induces clustering of POPG molecules up to 15 angstrom around the peptide. POPG molecules show higher order parameters than the neighboring POPE implying coexistence of different phases. Analysis of binding free energy of ROAD-1-membrane complex indicates Arg1, Arg2, Arg7, and Arg25 to play key role in its antimicrobial activity. Unlike its homolog HD5, ROAD-1 is not observed to form a dimer. Our study gives insight into the membrane-bound conformation of ROAD-1 and its mechanism of action that can aid in designing defensin-based therapeutics.",10.1007/s00894-019-4163-8,83,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Here, we further demonstrated that knockdown of Dnmt3a enhanced the proliferation in anchor-independent conditions of B16 cells, but severely disrupted its multipotent differentiation capacity in vitro. Furthermore, transforming growth factor beta 1, a key trigger in stem cell differentiation and tumor cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mainly induced apoptosis, but not EMT in Dnmt3a-deficient B16 cells.

However, as Tiki1 gene is absent in rodents such as mice, it is impossible to use mice or rat to study its role in mammals. In this study, we generated Tiki1 gene modified pigs using CRISPR/Cas9 system combined with somatic cell cloning technology to study the role of Tiki1 gene in pig development. Aligned the human Tiki1 mRNA sequence provided by professor He Xi's team with the pig genome database, we selected two target sites (g1 and g2) with the top 2 highest sequence identity at the predicted pig Tiki1 gene locus. The sgrRNA plasmid was constructed to transfect porcine fetal fibroblasts, and 52 single cell clones were screened and sequenced. We finally selected 5 single-cell clones with biallelic knockout mutations at target site g1 and 3 single-cell clones with biallelic knockout mutations at target site g2 as nuclear donors for constructing Tiki1 knockout pigs. A total of 720 recombinant embryos were constructed and transferred into three surrogate sows and one of them was successfully pregnant monitored by B ultrasound. A total of 13 cloned piglets (ten living piglets and 3 dead piglets ) were produced, and 12 of them were biallelic knockout mutations at Tiki1 locus. Both the living and dead Tikil gene knockout cloned piglets were developed normally and the living piglets have survived healthy till now.

We investigated the expression of candidate genes in immature and mature stages based on the RNA-seq data and Real-time quantitative PCR. Expression profiling revealed that some of these genes were primarily expressed in female rectal glands among different tissues, and were up-regulated in mature females. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays were also adapted to examine tissue-specific expression of selected candidate genes.

Kupffer's vesicle (KV) is a spherical left-right organizer during zebrafish embryogenesis and is derived from a cluster of dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs). Cadherin1 is required for collective migration of a DFC cluster and failure of DFC collective migration by Cadherin1 decrement causes KV malformation which results in defective heart laterality. Recently, loss of function mutation of A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) is reported as a high-risk gene in congenital heart disease patients. In this study, we demonstrated the role of akap12 beta in asymmetric heart development. The akap12 beta, one of the akap12 isoforms, was expressed in DFCs which give rise to KV and akap12 beta-deficient zebrafish embryos showed defective heart laterality due to the fragmentation of DFC clusters which resulted in KV malformation. DFC-specific loss of akap12 beta also led to defective heart laterality as a consequence of the failure of collective migration by cadherin1 reduction. Exogenous akap12 beta mRNA not only restored the defective heart laterality but also increased cadherin1 expression in akap12 beta morphant zebrafish embryos. Taken together, these findings provide the first experimental evidence that akap12 beta regulates heart laterality via cadherin1.",10.5483/BMBRep.2019.52.8.111,89,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,

They rapidly respond to antigen challenge and can activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. To study the role of antigen presentation in NKT cell activation, previous studies have developed several anti-CD1d antibodies that block CD1d binding to T-cell receptors (TCRs). Antibodies that are specific to both CD1d and the presented antigen can only be used to study the function of only a limited number of antigens. In contrast, antibodies that bind CD1d and block TCR binding regardless of the presented antigen can be widely used to assess the role of TCR-mediated NKT cell activation in various disease models. Here, we report the crystal structure of the widely used anti-mouse CD1d antibody 1B1 bound to CD1d at a resolution of 2.45 angstrom and characterized its binding to CD1d-presented glycolipids. We observed that 1B1 uses a long hydrophobic H3 loop that is inserted deep into the binding groove of CD1d where it makes intimate nonpolar contacts with the lipid backbone of an incorporated spacer lipid. Using an NKT cell agonist that has a modified sphingosine moiety, we further demonstrate that 1B1 in its monovalent form cannot block TCR-mediated NKT cell activation, because 1B1 fails to bind with high affinity to mCD1d. Our results suggest potential limitations of using 1B1 to assess antigen recognition by NKT cells, especially when investigating antigens that do not follow the canonical two alkyl-chain rule.",10.1074/jbc.RA119.009403,90,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

J,"Lee, YA; Cho, HY; Kim, SK",Neighboring base sequence effect on DNA damage,"Guanine is the most strongly oxidized base in DNA; generation of a guanine radical cation as an intermediate in an oxidation reaction leads to migration through a resulting cationic hole in the DNA pi-stack until it is trapped by irreversible reaction with water or other free radicals. In the case of normal sequences, the primary position of Guanine oxidations by one-electron oxidants such as carbonate radical anions, BPT(7,8,9,10-tetrahydroxytetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene), and riboflavin are 5 '-G in GG doublets and the central G in a GGG triplet. According to results, the properties of guanine oxidation on abasic site containing sequences are independent from the position of AP(apurinic/apyrimidinic) site in the presence of carbonate radical anions under a short irradiation time, although this radical is exposed to solvent by the existence of an abasic site. The lack of abasic site effect on guanine oxidative damage by the carbonate radical may be due to a sequence-independent property of the initial electron transfer rate in the hole injection step, or may relate to an electron transfer mechanism with large reorganization energy dependency. Consequently, the carbonate radical anions may easily migrate to another single G in the charge re-distribution step. Meanwhile, there is a strong dependency on the presence of an AP(apurinic/apyrimidinic) site in the cleavage patterns of guanine oxidations by physically large oxidizing agents, such as BPT(7,8,9,10-tetrahydroxytetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene) and riboflavin.

The essential components of the bone marrow include mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which play a key role in protecting, regenerating, and proliferating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This feature is vital for HSC after exposure to myelotoxic anticancer agents; nevertheless, the effects of nutlin-3 on MSCs remain to be disclosed. The present research study was conducted to examine the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effectiveness of nutlin-3 in bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs). Materials and Methods Human-derived BMSCs were cultured for different durations, that is, 24, 48, and 72 hours, and treated using various concentrations of nutlin-3, including 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mu M. To investigate the effect of nutlin-3 on the apoptosis, cell vitality and proliferation in BMSCs, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide, propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V assay, as well as real-time polymerase chain reaction, were used.

Such bioconjugation reactions can be facilitated by engineering proteins with chemically activated amino acids at strategically chosen sites. The incorporation of these unnatural amino acids (uAAs) can be achieved by using the nonsense suppression technique. This requires an aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase (aaRS) that exclusively recognizes the uAA and loads it to the corresponding tRNA. Appropriate (aaRS) mutants can be found through reverse engineering using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain MaV203. This strain contains a counterselectable, Gal4p-inducible SPAL10::URA3 fusion and deletions in the endogenous GAL80 and GAL4 genes. Therefore, it has been used extensively for the screening of aaRS mutant libraries. It is generally assumed that the SPAL10 promoter actively represses the URA3 gene in the absence of Gal4p, resulting in MaV203 cells with a Ura(-) phenotype. The current contribution reveals that in a small fraction of MaV203 cells, a basal expression of the URA3 gene occurs. The unexpected URA3 expression is reported for the first time, and the nature of the mutation causing this expression was identified as a spontaneous recessive mutation in a single gene of a protein involved in the repression of the SPAL10 promoter. The basal URA3 expression causes aaRS mutants to be missed, which affects the outcome of the library screening. It is demonstrated that the use of diploid cells can circumvent the MaV203 Ura(+) phenotype, allowing for an optimization of S. cerevisiae library screening.",10.1002/yea.3437,95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, an a priori estimate of trait tractability from the perspective of gene expression is unavailable. Motivated by the concept of entropy in a thermodynamic system, we here propose such an estimate (S-T) by gauging the number (N) of expression states that underlie the same trait abnormality, with large S-T corresponding to large N. By analyzing over 200 yeast morphological traits, we show that S-T predicts the tractability of an expression-trait relationship. We further show that S-T is ultimately determined by natural selection, which builds co-regulated gene modules to minimize possible expression states.

Algorithms have been developed to estimate absolute methylation level from read coverage generated by affinity enrichment-based techniques, but the most accurate one for MBD-seq data requires additional data from an SssI-treated Control experiment. Results Using our previous characterizations of Methyl-CpG/MBD2 binding in the context of an MBD pulldown experiment, we build a model of expected MBD pulldown reads as drawn from SssI-treated DNA. We use the program BayMeth to evaluate the effectiveness of this model by substituting calculated SssI Control data for the observed SssI Control data. By comparing methylation predictions against those from an RRBS data set, we find that BayMeth run with our modeled SssI Control data performs better than BayMeth run with observed SssI Control data, on both 100 bp and 10 bp windows. Adapting the model to an external data set solely by changing the average fragment length, our calculated data still informs the BayMeth program to a similar level as observed data in predicting methylation state on a pulldown data set with matching WGBS estimates. Conclusion In both internal and external MBD pulldown data sets tested in this study, BayMeth used with our modeled pulldown coverage performs better than BayMeth run without the inclusion of any estimate of SssI Control pulldown, and is comparable to - and in some cases better than - using observed SssI Control data with the BayMeth program. Thus, our MBD pulldown alignment model can improve methylation predictions without the need to perform additional control experiments.",10.1186/s12859-019-3011-2,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Ge, QX; Cong, PX; Ji, Y",Serous IFNA3 predicts unfavorable prognosis in lung cancer via abnormal activation of AKT signaling,"This study addresses the demand through datamining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and elucidates mechanistic involvements of interferon alpha 8 (IFNA8) in lung cancer. The overall survival and disease-free survival of lung cancer patients in respect to IFNA8 expression level were analyzed. IFNA8 expression levels in both serum and tumor tissue were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The diagnostic value of serous IFNA8 in lung cancer was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Cell viability and proliferation were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays. in vivo pro-tumor effect of IFNA8 was evaluated using xenograft tumor model. The metastasis-prone behaviors were determined by Transwell chamber assay and tail vein-injection in mice. Protein levels of p-AKT, total AKT, and endogenous reference actin were analyzed by western blot. We uncovered high IFNA8 associated with unfavorable overall survival and disease-free survival in lung cancer patients from TCGA. We further characterized the aberrant over-expression of IFNA8 in both peripheral blood and solid tumor from our clinical patient panel, and ROC analysis suggested its potential diagnostic value. Ectopic over-expression of IFNA8 promoted viability and proliferation in both A549 and H1299 cells in vitro and accelerated xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, IFNA8 facilitated migration, invasion, and metastasis of A549 cells in vivo. Mechanistically, we disclosed the over-activation of AKT signaling in IFNA8-proficient A549 cells, inhibition of which completely abolished the pro-tumor effects of IFNA8. We have identified IFNA8 as a novel biomarker for either diagnostic or prognostic purpose in lung cancer, which is mechanistically associated with abnormal activation of AKT signaling.",10.1002/iub.2152,99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
