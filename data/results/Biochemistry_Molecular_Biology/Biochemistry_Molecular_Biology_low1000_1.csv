0,"The present work illustrates regioselective binding of nonsymmetric axle BuX (X = F, Cl, Br, CN) and 5-bromovaleronitrile (BVN) to the non-symmetric methyl pentyl pillar[5]arene (MPP5). Theoretical calculations reveal that the guest encapsulation within MPP5 is spontaneous and the conformer showing X weakly bound to pentyl rim of MPP5 is favoured over its other conformer wherein it interacts with methyl rim of the host. The noncovalent interactions namely C-H-pi, C-H-X and H\-H prevail over C- H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding in the complexes of MPP5. The manifestations of these to vibrational spectra obtained from the present theory are discussed. The strength of host-guest binding further is shown to correlate well with weakening of the C-X bond through natural bond orbital analyses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

1,"Postnatally, during hypoxia the decrease in oxygen consumption ((V) over dot(O2)) can exceed what expected from the limitation in O-2 availability, meaning that (V) over dot(O2)-downregulation exceeds O-2-conformism. We questioned whether a similar phenomenon could occur prenatally, in chicken embryos at mid- (Ell, out of 20.5 days) or near end(E18) incubation. (V) over dot(O2) was measured with an open-flow system in the sequence of normoxia-normothermia (21%O- (2), 37 degrees C, 30 min), hypoxia in normothermia (Hx-NT, either 18, 15, 12 or 9% O-2, 37 degrees C, 1 hour), hypoxia in hyperthermia (Hx-HT, up to 43 degrees C, 1 hour) and return to normoxia-normothermia (30 min). During Hx-NT (V) over dot(O2) invariably decreased in a [O-2]-dependent fashion. The hypoxic drop in (V) over dot(O2) did not require a post-hypoxic payment of the O-2-debt, implying that the decrease in (V) over dot(O2) reflected hypometabolism. (V) over dot(O2) did not differ significantly between Hx-HT and Hx-NT for [O-2] = 15% or less, as expected by O-2-conformism. Differently, with milder hypoxia (18% O-2), (V) over dot(O2) during Hx-HT significantly exceeded that in Hx-NT, meaning that the value of (V) over dot(O2)( )in Hx-NT was not limited by O-2 supply. We conclude that a phenomenon of hypoxic (V) over dot(O2)( )downregulation like that observed in postnatal mammals can occur also prenatally, in the chicken embryos. The mechanisms at the basis of the downregulation remain unresolved and could combine physiological and cellular processes.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,

4,"absectionBackground Three types of sources can be considered in the analysis of multi-subject datasets: (i) joint sources which are common among all subjects, (ii) partially-joint sources which are common only among a subset of subjects, and (iii) individual sources which belong to each subject and represent the specific conditions of that subject. Extracting spatial and temporal joint, partially-joint, and individual sources of multi-subject datasets is of significant importance to analyze common and cross information of multiple subjects. New method: We present a new framework to extract these three types of spatial and temporal sources in multisubject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. In this framework, temporal and spatial independent component analysis are utilized, and a weighted sum of higher-order cumulants is maximized. Results: We evaluate the presented algorithm by analyzing simulated data and one real multi-subject fMRI dataset. Our results on the real dataset are consistent with the existing meta-analysis studies. We show that spatial and temporal jointness of extracted joint and partially-joint sources in the theory of mind regions of brain increase with the age of subjects. Comparison with existing method: In Richardson et al. (2018), predefined regions of interest (ROI) have been used to analyze the real dataset, whereas our unified algorithm simultaneously extracts activated and uncorrelated ROIs, and determines their spatial and temporal jointness without additional computations. Conclusions: Extracting temporal and spatial joint and partially joint sources in a unified algorithm improves the accuracy of joint analysis of the multi-subject fMRI dataset.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

7,"How do common and rare genetic polymorphisms contribute to quantitative traits or disease risk and progression? Multiple human traits have been extensively characterized at the genomic level, revealing their complex genetic architecture. However, it is difficult to resolve the mechanisms by which specific variants contribute to a phenotype. Recently, analyses of variant effects on molecular traits have uncovered intermediate mechanisms that link sequence variation to phenotypic changes. Yet, these methods only capture a fraction of genetic contributions to phenotype. Here, in reviewing the field, it is proposed that complex traits can be understood by characterizing the dynamics of biochemical networks within living cells, and that the effects of genetic variation can be captured on these networks by using protein-protein interaction (PPI) methodologies. This synergy between PPI methodologies and the genetics of complex traits opens new avenues to investigate the molecular etiology of human diseases and to facilitate their prevention or treatment.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,

9,"Whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators have received extensive attention because of their nonlinear optical application in lasers and sensors. Optical microcavities are excellent candidates for constructing powerful microlasers and label-free biosensors, owing to their low optical losses and small size. However, most of these microcavity syntheses rely on sophisticated fabrication methods and cannot be manipulated easily. To achieve facile and versatile microcavity fabrication, we present a robust microfluidics method for monodispersed self-coupling optical microcavity fabrication with a fine tunability. The microcavity polydispersity was less than 3%. The optical microcavity size could be varied from 10 to 30 mu m with a steady quality factor (Q) of approximately 1000. The lowest laser threshold that we obtained was 0.82 mu J with a microcavity size of 20 mu m. The doped fluorescent dye concentration can be tuned precisely from 0.001 to 0.05 wt% to explore an optimized fluorescent background. The experimental results and theoretical simulation match well in terms of Q and the electrometric resonance field intensity. Compared with previous precise and practical fabrication methods, we have demonstrated a facile approach for versatile optical microcavity fabrication. This method can vary the microcavity materials, size, doped fluorescent dye concentration, WGM resonance spectrum, Q factor, and laser threshold easily to adapt to various circumstances and specific applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"The nonpeptide small molecule, MES207, exhibits 17-fold preferential binding to the neuropeptide FF receptor 1 (NPFFR1) over NPFFR2 and shows antagonist functionality at NPFF receptors. In order to further the development of MES207 as a NPFFR1 probe, an UPLC-MS/MS bioanalytical method was developed and validated to quantify MES207 in rat plasma for a linearity range of 3-200 ng/mL. The method was applied in the analysis of the plasma, brain, and urine samples collected during pharmacokinetic studies in healthy male and female Sprague Dawley rats. The animals were dosed through oral gavage (50 mg/kg) and intravenously (2.5 mg/kg). Test samples were analyzed using the validated bioanalytical method to generate plasma concentration-time profiles. The results were further subjected to non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix 6.4 (R). MES207 exhibits a large volume of distribution (1.2 +/- 0.6 L), high clearance (0.8 +/- 0.1 L/h), and a poor oral bioavailability (1.7 +/- 0.4%). The compound also showed a multiple peak phenomenon with a very short absorption phase. It appears that gender does not significantly influence the differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of this NPFF probe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Lake sediments are subjected to intensive anthropogenic activities such as dumping of industrial waste water and leakage of P fertilisation from agricultural lands. There has a great body of research focusing on examining phosphorus fractions, which provide fundamental data that facilitate understanding the risk of P-induced eutrophication. Here, we have extracted the data of P fractions from 484 sediment samples residing in 48 lakes mainly in EU, China and USA. NH4Cl-P and total phosphorus (TP) displayed a well linear relationship, but not applicable to all lakes. Six groups were categorised as per the slope and intercept by using the clustering analysis. Specific measures were recommended to curb P release risk by considering the characteristics of each group. For instance, TP controlling is deemed as a priority in group with steep linear dependence of NH4Cl-P on TP. A significant correlation was determined between TP and NaOH-P (r(2) = 0.63). Among other findings, larger lake area significantly contributes to lower all P pools. Deeper depth could only pronouncedly influence the BD-P, HCl-P. Additionally, we found lakes in Germany have pronounced higher averaged P pools than other regions. Furthermore, this paper creates awareness of the present status of lake eutrophication for researchers and policy-makers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"Synthesis of carboxy-polyethylene glycol-amine (CA (PEG)(n)) via oxa-Michael addition of amino-polyethylene glycols to either acrylates or propiolates was investigated. Compared with the oxa-Michael addition to acrylates, the corresponding addition to propiolates was found to proceed under mild reaction conditions and afford the adducts in high yields from a broad scope of substrates. A two-step efficient and convenient synthesis of benzyl [1-C-14]-propiolate from (CO2)-C-14 was therefore developed and utilized as a common synthon to afford practical and high yielding access to [1-C-14]-CA (PEG)(n).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Prostaglandin D-2 is one of five chief prostanoids formed in the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid oxidation. Except for a single oxygen atom, PGD(2) is structurally identical to 11-dehydro thromboxane B-2 (11d-TxB(2)), a urinary metabolite of the pro-aggregatory platelet activator, thromboxane A(2). The close structural relationship suggested that one might be transformed to the other. Accordingly, we tested whether the cyclopentanone of PGD(2) can be expanded to the delta-lactone of 11d-TxB(2) in a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. Oxidation of PGD(2) with two standard oxidants showed that 11d-TxB(2) was formed only with H2O2 but not with peracetic acid. Byproducts of the H2O2-mediated oxidation were hydroperoxide derivatives and isomers of PGD(2). Chemical oxidation of PGD(2) to 11d-TxB(2) may be a model for an equivalent enzymatic transformation, suggesting a possible link in the metabolism of PGD(2) and thromboxane A(2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Recording the data necessary to assess the kinetics of a reaction can be labor-intensive. In this technology brief, we show a method to automate this task by utilizing parts of an aKTApurifier chromatography system to automatically take samples from a reaction vessel at predefined time intervals and place them in 96-well plates and also enable correlating the samples with in-line spectral data of the reaction solution. Automatic sampling can reduce experimental bottlenecks by enabling overnight reactions or a higher degree of parallelization. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we performed batch-PEGylation of lysozyme with varying conditions by changing the molar excess of the PEG reagent. We used analytical cation-exchange chromatography to analyze the samples taken during the batch reaction, determining the concentrations of the individual species present at each time step. Subsequently, we fitted a kinetic model on these data. Fitting the model to four different reaction conditions simultaneously yielded a regression coefficient of R-2 = 0.871.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,"A method is described whereby net rate constants can be directly inferred from the progress curves of enzyme intermediates without the need for model specification, numerical analysis, curve fitting, or the steady-state approx-imation. Specifically, if an enzyme intermediate in an ultimately irreversible serial subsequence is perturbed from and returns back to its equilibrium state as the substrate is consumed, then its net rate constant is given by the ratio of the total substrate consumed and the area under the progress curve for the enzyme intermediate. A rigorous analysis demonstrates this result to hold independent of the complete enzymatic reaction in which the subsequence is embedded, making it broadly applicable to a very wide range of kinetic mechanisms, including those complicated by inhibition. As a theoretical consequence, it is shown that traditionally steady-state parameters such as k(cat), k(cat)/K-M, and net rate constants can be expressed as limiting ratios of averages without requiring the steady-state hypothesis. Finally, a mock data set is generated for a system of contemporary interest that can serve as both an example of how the methodology would be used in practice and a proof of concept.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"A large variety of fluorescent molecules are used on a regular basis to tag major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimers for detection of antigen-specific T cells. We have evaluated the way in which the choice of fluorescent label can impact the detection of MHC multimer binding T cells in an exploratory proficiency panel where detection of MHC multimer binding T cells was assessed across 16 different laboratories. We found that the staining index (SI) of the multimer reagent provided the best direct correlation with the value of a given fluorochrome for T cell detection studies. The SI is dependent on flow cytometer settings and chosen antibody panel; hence, the optimal fluorochrome selection may differ from lab to lab. Consequently, we describe a strategy to evaluate performance of the detection channels and optimize the SI for selected fluorescent molecules. This approach can easily be used to test and optimize fluorescence detection in relation to MHC multimer staining and in general, for antibody-based identification of rare cell populations.

19,"Lipids and proteins in the plasma membrane are laterally heterogeneous and formalised as lipid rafts featuring unique biophysical properties. However, the self-assembly mechanism of lipid raft cannot be revealed even its physical properties and components were determined in specific physiological processes. In this study, two-photon generalised polarisation imaging and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy were used to study the fusion of lipid rafts through the membrane phase and the lateral diffusion of lipids in living breast cancer cells. A self-assembly model of lipid rafts associated with lipid diffusion and membrane phase was proposed to demonstrate the lipid sorting ability of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. The results showed that the increased proportion of slow subdiffusion of G(M1)-binding cholera toxin B-subunit (CT-B) was accompanied with an increased liquid-ordered domain during the beta-estradiol-induced fusion of lipid rafts. And slow subdiffusion of CT-B was vanished with the depletion of lipid rafts. Whereas the dialkylindocarbocyanine (DiIC(18)) diffusion was not specifically regulated by lipid rafts. This study will open up a new insight for uncovering the self-assembly of lipid rafts in specific pathophysiological processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Backgrounds PU.1 is a pioneer transcription factor and a master regulator of the myeloid lineage. However, the role of PU.1 in lipopolysaccharide-dependent microglial activation has yet to be investigated. So, this study was conducted to determine the effects of PU.1 in LPS-induced activation of microglial cells. Methods We knocked out PU.1 in murine BV-2 cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to investigate the role of PU.1 in the expression of immune-related genes. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of PU.1 KO and BV-2 cells to analyze the gene expression patterns in PU.1 KO cells and compare them to those in wild-type BV-2 cells. The validation of differential expressions was achieved by qRT-PCR. To explore this regulatory role of PU.1, ChIP sequencing for PU.1 and H3K27Ac was performed. The sequencing result was further confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. Results RNA sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed that the expression of most of the immune-related genes was suppressed in the absence of PU.1. Proinflammatory chemokine genes were differentially expressed in LPS-treated PU.1 KO cells. The ChIP sequencing result followed by ChIP-qPCR revealed a LPS-mediated increase in the enrichment of PU.1 binding in pro-inflammatory chemokine gene promoters and enhancer regions in wild-type BV-2 cells. There was no enrichment of PU.1 in PU.1 KO cells. Conclusion The above-mentioned results suggest that PU.1 is directly involved in regulating the immune response and that this regulation of inflammatory chemokines is LPS-dependent. We hope that PU.1 would be an option for limiting neurodegeneration in a diverse range of neurological disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"Numerous bacterial toxins and other virulence factors use low pH as a trigger to convert from water-soluble to membrane-inserted states. In the case of colicins, the pore-forming domain of colicin A (ColA-P) has been shown both to undergo a clear acidic unfolding transition and to require acidic lipids in the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas its close homologue colicin N shows neither behavior. Compared to that of COlN-P, the COlA-P primary structure reveals the replacement of several uncharged residues with aspartyl residues, which upon replacement with alanine induce an unfolded state at neutral pH. Here we investigate COlA-P's structural requirement for these critical aspartyl residues that are largely situated at the N-termini of alpha helices. As previously shown in model peptides, the charged carboxylate side chain can act as a stabilizing helix N-Cap group by interacting with free amide hydrogen bond donors. Because this could explain COlA-P destabilization when the aspartyl residues are protonated or replaced with alanyl residues, we test the hypothesis by inserting asparagine, glutamine, and glutamate residues at these sites. We combine urea (fluorescence and circular dichroism) and thermal (circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry) denaturation experiments with H-1-N-15 heteronuclear single-quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of COlA-P at different pH values to provide a comprehensive description of the unfolding process and confirm the N-Cap hypothesis. Furthermore, we reveal that, in urea, the single domain COlA-P unfolds in two steps; low pH destabilizes the first step and stabilizes the second.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"In this article, we describe an in-house polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific priming (PCR-SSP) assay designed for undergraduate medical students as part of the experimental pathogen biology and immunology (EPBI) course.

24,"Background Supercomputers have become indispensable infrastructures in science and industries. In particular, most state-of-the-art scientific results utilize massively parallel supercomputers ranked in TOP500. However, their use is still limited in the bioinformatics field due to the fundamental fact that the asynchronous parallel processing service of Grid Engine is not provided on them. To encourage the use of massively parallel supercomputers in bioinformatics, we developed middleware called Virtual Grid Engine, which enables software pipelines to automatically perform their tasks as MPI programs. Result We conducted basic tests to check the time required to assign jobs to workers by VGE. The results showed that the overhead of the employed algorithm was 246 microseconds and our software can manage thousands of jobs smoothly on the K computer. We also tried a practical test in the bioinformatics field. This test included two tasks, the split and BWA alignment of input FASTQ data. 25,055 nodes (2,000,440 cores) were used for this calculation and accomplished it in three hours.

We carefully designed and checked all requirements. And this software fulfilled all the requirements and achieved good performance in a large scale analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"Background A fundamental problem in RNA-seq data analysis is to identify genes or exons that are differentially expressed with varying experimental conditions based on the read counts. The relativeness of RNA-seq measurements makes the between-sample normalization of read counts an essential step in differential expression (DE) analysis. In most existing methods, the normalization step is performed prior to the DE analysis. Recently, Jiang and Zhan proposed a statistical method which introduces sample-specific normalization parameters into a joint model, which allows for simultaneous normalization and differential expression analysis from log-transformed RNA-seq data. Furthermore, an l(0) penalty is used to yield a sparse solution which selects a subset of DE genes. The experimental conditions are restricted to be categorical in their work. Results In this paper, we generalize Jiang and Zhan's method to handle experimental conditions that are measured in continuous variables. As a result, genes with expression levels associated with a single or multiple covariates can be detected. As the problem being high-dimensional, non-differentiable and non-convex, we develop an efficient algorithm for model fitting. Conclusions Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy when a large fraction of genes are differentially expressed in an asymmetric manner, and the performance gain becomes more substantial for larger sample sizes. We also apply our method to a real prostate cancer RNA-seq dataset to identify genes associated with pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"The high demand of the fetus for Docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, is satisfied by a concert of several mechanisms that take place in the placental terminal villi. Scarcity of laboratory data makes the detailed description of these mechanisms elusive. Here, the DHA transport across the placenta is modeled as a boundary value problem that accounts for diffusion, reactions with fatty acids binding proteins, FABPs, and metabolic consumption within the Syncytiotrophoblast, ST. For any given DHA fluxes at the bordering membranes, analytical and numerical solutions yield the DHA concentration profile within the ST. We find that in order to comply with adequate DHA delivery to the fetus and with physiological DHA concentrations in the maternal and fetal circulations, it is essential to have a significant rise of DHA concentration at the microvillus membrane, MVM and a rapid dissociation of the DHA from the FABP. The model establishes the relations between the concentrations of the FABPs in the ST, their equilibrium dissociation constant from the DHA, and the placental DHA metabolic degradation rate, hitherto unknown. We conclude that the bound (to the protein) DHA molecule is degraded at a rate of 0.3-0.45 s(-1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"Human secreted phospholipase A(2) (hsPLA(2)) is a small calcium ion (Ca2+)-regulatory protein secreting from platelets, eosinophils and T-lymphocytes, which has been established as an important biomarker and potential target for the diagnosis and therapy of coronary artery disease. Short peptide inhibitors are used to competitively suppress the enzymatic activity of hsPLA(2). Here, Ca2+ effect on the intermolecular recognition and interaction between hsPLA(2) and its peptide inhibitors is investigated systematically by using molecular modeling and bioinformatics analysis. Dynamics simulations reveal that the hsPLA(2) structure bound with Ca2+ is rather stable and has low thermal motion; removal of Ca2+ considerably increases structural flexibility and intrinsic disorder of the protein. Energetics calculations suggest that presence of Ca2+ can effectively promote the interaction of hsPLA(2) with peptide inhibitors. In particular, the local substructures of hsPLA(2) such as helix H1, loop L2 and double-stranded beta-sheet DS that participate in peptide recognition are involved in or nearby Ca2+-coordinating site and can be directly stabilized by the Ca2+. In addition, a significant concentration-dependent effect of Ca2+ on peptide -hsPLA(2) binding is observed in vitro, that is, a little of Ca2+ can largely improve peptide binding affinity, but high Ca2+ concentration does not increase the affinity substantially. The correlation between calculated free energy and experimental binding affinity over different peptide inhibitors is improved considerably by adding Ca2+ to hsPLA(2). Specifically, the FLSYK peptide can generally bind to Ca2+-bound hsPLA(2) with a moderate or high affinity (K-d ranges between 56 and 210 mu M), but have only a modest affinity or even nonbinding to Ca2+-free hsPLA(2) (K-d > 400 mu M or = n.d.).

28,"Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) serves as a regulator of cell cycle progression and is overexpressed in various human cancer cells. PLK1 contains a conserved polo-box domain (PBD) as well as a kinase domain (KD), like other members of the PLK family. The PBDs of the PLK family interact with phosphopeptides that contain highly conserved Ser-pSer/pThr (S-pS/T) motifs and play significant roles in substrate recognition and subcellular localization. The PBD of PLK1 has been regarded as a promising therapeutic target for cancer therapy. In this study, we investigated whether the phosphopeptide derived from NCAPG2 has a high binding specificity for the PLK1 PDB over those other highly similar PBDs, including PLK2, PLK3, and PLK5. We showed that the PBDs of PLKs have different binding affinities against CDC25c-, PBIP-, and NCAPG2-derived phosphopeptides using the fluorescence polarization binding assay. Unlike CDC25c-phosphopeptide, NCAPG2-phosphopeptide specifically bound to the PLK1 PBD with nanomolar affinity (K-d 48.68 nM), and its specificity was similar to that of the PBIP-derived phosphopeptide. Some of these phosphopeptide-PBD interactions can be explained by calculating the binding free energies using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA). Additionally, NCAPG2-phosphopeptide suppressed the proliferation of cancer cells. The NCAPG2-derived phosphopeptide can be applicable to the discovery of highly selective protein-protein interaction inhibitors targeting the PBD of PLK1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some invertebrate species, MTF-1 orthologues as well as their ability to activate MT genes via MREs have been uncovered. Although earthworm MTs have been well studied, a MTF-1 orthologue has not yet been described and MT gene activation mechanisms are largely unknown. Analyses of the earthworm wMT2 promoter by reporter gene assays have been performed. We could show that the wMT2 promoter was active in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) as well as in mouse MTF-1(-/-)cells (DKO7). The presence of mouse MTF-1 (mMTF1) led to a significant increase in reporter gene activity. We observed that cadmium as well as zinc had an effect on promoter activity. In the presence of zinc, promoter activity doubled in NIH cells, however, we did not observe a significant effect in the DKO7 cell line. Cadmium decreased promoter activity in DKO7 cells, but this effect could be reversed by providing mMTF1 in a co-transfection experiment. We suggest that MT gene expression in the earthworm is not entirely dependent on a MRE binding protein. Interestingly, the shortest promoter fragment including MRE1 showed the highest promoter activity under control conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecologic cancers. The high mortality rate is due to lack of early symptoms and developing drug resistance. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach to treatment of cancer. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG antibody against VEGF A that used in cancer immunotherapy, especially in ovarian cancer therapy. For a successful cancer immunotherapy the different features of therapeutic antibodies such as binding affinity should be improved. Increased affinity enhances the biological action of the antibody, which in turn improves the therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the increased antibody affinity can reduce the therapeutic dose of the antibody, resulting in lower toxicity and handling cost. Considering the importance of this issue, using in silico analysis, we aimed to find the important amino acids of the Bevacizumab antibody, and then replaced these amino acids with others to improve antibody binding affinity. Finally, we examined the binding affinity of antibody variants to antigens. In conclusion, the designed antibodies could be potential candidates for binding to antigens with improved affinity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"The Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT) represents a multi-billion dollar black-market industry whereby wild species are illegally taken from their natural environment and sold. A common question asked by wildlife forensic scientists pertains to species and/or genus identity, which currently requires multi-step processing. Our work details the development of three HyBeacon (R) probes, used for the presumptive detection of rhinoceros, pangolin and key target species in the Panthera genus. The approach can be performed in a single tube using melt curve analysis and provide rapid assessment of sample identity. Using synthetic DNA of representative species, early data suggest the approach is sensitive enough to achieve species identification with < 10 cells. Future development and assay validation can allow the rapid screening of multiple seized items before confirmatory DNA sequencing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

37,"Objective: Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the cardiac muscle. Prognosis is most often good but, in some patients, the disease can be fulminant. Our aim with this study was to determine interleukin-9 (IL-9) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) levels in myocarditis cases with different etiologies. Materials and methods: Thirty one patients with myocarditis and 30 healthy controls of similar age and gender without a history of chronic disease were included in the study. All 31 patients were clinically myocarditis. In some of these patients, the cause of myocarditis is acute rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease. Serum samples of the patients were taken during diagnosis in order to analyze serum IL-9 and IL-17 levels and sedimentation rate, CRP, ASO, proBNP, CK-MB, and Troponin-I tests were performed. Results: It was found that IL-17 levels were statistically significant in all acute rheumatic fever, Myocarditis and Kawasaki patients compared to the control group (p = 0.001) and that cut-off was 4.30 pg/mL. This value was determined to be 71% sensitive and 67% specific for IL-17 (AUC = 0.761). Conclusions: Both of the mean and median levels of IL-17 were significantly higher in pediatric patients with myocarditis than in healthy children. Our study made us think that complications of myocarditis and associated morbidity can be prevented by IL17 inhibitors. 'The high levels of IL17 found in our study may be a reference for future study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"Background: Reflectance spectroscopy, which is one of spectroscopic techniques, is an optical technique and has the potential to differentiate cancerous tissues from normal tissues. There are several studies which evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of this method in the literature. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the fiber optic reflectance spectroscopy system in diagnosis of cancerous tissue via meta-analysis. Materials and methods: In this meta-analysis paper, the literature search was conducted using the ""PubMed"" database as of 16-August-2018 last date. A total of 30 articles which the pathological evaluation was accepted as the gold standard were included in the meta-analysis, excluding the articles that were out of context and did not contain the required statistics. Results: Overall sensitivity was 0.82; overall specificity was 0.84 and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89 in differentiating cancerous from normal tissue by using fiber optic reflectance spectroscopy system. Overall diagnostic odds ratio was obtained as 29.42.

39,"Background: Mycobacteria tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, is a slow-growing bacterium. Expression in Escherichia coli is a widely used method for large-scale production of diagnostic antigenic recombinant proteins. Expression of Mtb antigen in E. coli offers a rapid and, inexpensive alternative to conventional protein synthesis from Mtb. The addition of stabilizing additives during cell lysis or storage of Mtb antigenic protein plays a vital role in enhancing antigen stability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of additives on the stability of Mtb antigens expressed in E. coli. Methods: Immunodominant Mtb antigens, i.e., CFP-10, Rv3872, TB7.7, and TB9.7, were cloned, and recombinant proteins overexpressed in E. coli were gradually degraded in a time-dependent manner by incubation at 37 degrees C. Various stabilizing additives during storage or cell lysis before protein purification were investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. Results: CFP-10 and Rv3872 were mainly expressed in soluble form. The degraded form of the expressed protein after incubation at 37 degrees C was easily observed after 1 week. Increased stability was observed in a solution containing glycine for recombinant CFP-10 and Rv3872. TB9.7 was stable in a solution containing trehalose or mannitol. TB7.7 was stable in a solution containing sucrose, glycine, or polyethylene glycol. Conclusion: Recombinant Mtb antigen stabilization using chemical additives inhibited protein degradation, leading to increased antigen stability and purification efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"Mangafodipir was approved for use as an MRI contrast agent in the late 1990s for liver and pancreas imaging but it was removed from the European market for commercial reasons in 2012. Previously, preliminary work in mice and in diabetic patients showed that Mn2 + ions could be used as a contrast agent to monitor the function of insulin-producing /3-cells by acting as a calcium analogue. Clinical translation of this work was hampered by a lack of available Mn contrast agents, but both mangafodipir and Mn gluconate are currently being used in clinical trials. As a first step towards using Mn in diabetic patients to monitor treatment or disease progression, we imaged the pancreas of healthy rats using mangafodipir, Mn gluconate and Mn chloride (as a control). The hypothesis was that Mn gluconate produces pancreatic enhancement similar to that seen previously with mangafodipir and Mn chloride, with greater enhancement following glucose challenge vs saline challenge. 18 Wistar rats were imaged at 7 T and normalised plateau pancreatic enhancement over baseline was compared for saline vs glucose challenge, calculated from a sigmoid fit to the enhancement curve. For saline vs glucose challenge, mean increases in plateau height +/- sd were: 22 +/- 18% for Mn chloride, 31 +/- 29% for mangafodipir and 41 +/- 17% for Mn gluconate. A paired t-test indicated that enhancement was greater for glucose vs saline (p = 0.01) and that there was no significant difference in the percentage enhancement between any of the compounds (p > 0.2). In conclusion, all three contrast agents produced similar enhancement, with greater plateau height under glucose challenge vs saline challenge. Mangafodipir and Mn gluconate show potential for translation into a clinical study investigating beta cell imaging of the pancreas in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"Site-directed mutagenesis is one of the most important tools in molecular biology. The majority of the mutagenesis methods have been developed to mutate one region of target DNA in each cycle of mutagenesis, while in some cases there is a need to mutate several distal points. We used a new method to simultaneously mutate two distal points in the target DNA. Different regions of the target DNA were amplified in three separate PCR reactions. The PCR products were back-to-back and together they made the complete length of the template DNA. Mutations were introduced to PCR products by middle mutagenic primers. PCR products were mixed and ligated with random blunt ligation, and then the desired mutated DNA fragments were selected in two steps by flanking restriction enzyme digestion and size selection. Selected fragments were amplified in another PCR reaction using flanking primers and finally cloned into the plasmid vector. This mutagenesis process is simple, there is no need to use modified primers and long or difficult PCR reactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"The Xanthomonas genus, comprises more than 30 species of gram-negative bacteria, most of which are pathogens of plants with high economic value, such as rice, common bean, and maize. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), which act by regulating the host gene expression, are some of the major virulence factors of these bacteria. We present a novel tool to identify TALE genes in the genome of Xanthomonas strains and their respective targets. The analysis of the results obtained by TargeTALE in a proof-of-concept validation demonstrate that, at optimum setting, approximately 93% of the predicted target genes with available expression data were confirmed as upregulated during the infection, indicating that the tool might be useful for researchers in the field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"Objective: Aerial parts and roots of three Digitalis species (Digitalis davisiana Heywood, Digitalis viridiflora Lindley and Digitalis grandiflora Miller; Plantaginaceae) were investigated from the viewpoint of cytotoxicity to identify the biologically active parts. Playing a role in cell proliferation and tumor growth, LXR alpha agonist activity also has become of interest to researchers investigating its relationship with the cytotoxicity. Materials and methods: Cytotoxicity of aqueous extracts was determined through I lEp-2, HepG2 and 3Y1 cells using MIT method. LXR alpha agonist activity was determined through luciferase reporter gene assay on HEK293 cells. Results: Tested extracts showed strong cytotoxicity on HEp-2 cells with IC50 values between 19.7 and 79.6 mu g/mL. Cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells was found to be lower (IC50; 211.4-2152.9 mu g/mL). On 3Y1 cells, extracts showed concentration dependent cytostatic activity (IC50; 87.9-772.3 mu g/mL). Extracts showed cytotoxicity on HEK293 cells at a concentration of 100 mu g/mL; therefore, dilutions were made. However, due to dilutions, LXR alpha agonist activity was found to be low. Conclusion: The extracts exhibited selective cytotoxicity on cancer and non-cancerous cells. Moreover, the selectivity was seen between different cancer cells. Any relationship could not be found between cytotoxicity and LXR alpha agonist activity, due to the low agonist effects. Further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanism of activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"It is demonstrated that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs can directly inhibit the proliferation of reproductive tissue cancer cells, but the poor pharmacokinetic properties still restrict their application in treating hormone-dependent diseases. Modifications in position 6 and 10 of natural GnRH can improve the metabolic stability. In order to study the effect of incorporation Cys(6) substitution with C-terminal Pro(9)-NHEt modification and dimerization of linear peptides on metabolic stability and antiproliferative activity of GnRH analogs, two new GnRH analogs [l-Cys(6), desGly(10), Pro(9)-NHEt]-GnRH (1) and [d-Cys(6), desGly(10), Pro(9)-NHEt]-GnRH (2), and their corresponding dimer derivatives ([l-Cys(6), desGly(10), Pro(9)-NHEt]-GnRH)(2) (3) and ([d-Cys(6), desGly(10), Pro(9)-NHEt]-GnRH)(2) (4) were synthesized. Incubation of these analogs with human serum was carried out to evaluate their metabolic stability, and direct growth inhibitory effect of the two dimer derivatives 3 and 4 on MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line was examined by MTT assay. The metabolic stability of dimer derivatives 3 and 4 was remarkably improved in comparison with natural GnRH. The d-Cys(6) substituted dimer derivative 4 exhibited higher inhibitory effect (29.6-39.7% growth reduction) on cell growth than its corresponding counterpart 3 (21.8-26.2% growth reduction) at concentration range of 50, 100 and 200 mu M. The cell growth inhibition of leuprolide was 16.4-27.2% at the tested concentrations. The dimer derivative 4 was the most stable and active GnRH analog in this study and has the potential for future preclinical investigations as promising antitumor drug candidate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), the main feature of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with hypertension. The increased of carotid body (CB) sensitivity due to enhanced sympathetic efferent may be mainly responsible for the elevation of blood pressure. Accordingly, we studied this effect of Endothelin-1 (ET-1)-induced CB chemosensory response to CIH, as a vasoactive peptide expressed in CB. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) responses in CIH group by injecting ET-1 to directly stimulate CB chemoreceptor. Furthermore, whether ET receptor-mediated PKC and p(38)MAPK signaling pathway was involved in CIH-induced CB activation was also studied. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CIH (8 h/day for 3 weeks) and the MAP and RSNA were recorded in CIH rats and Sham rats. Our results demonstrated that ET-1-induced MAP and RSNA increase were mainly mediated by ETA receptor activation in CB chemosensory after CIH exposure. Moreover, P(38)MAPK and PKC signaling pathway might be involved in ET-1-induced increase of MAP and RSNA in CIH group, which provided a potential therapeutic target of OSA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"DNA methylation and gene expression are interdependent and both implicated in cancer development and progression, with many individual biomarkers discovered. A joint analysis of the two data types can potentially lead to biological insights that are not discoverable with separate analyses. To optimally leverage the joint data for identifying perturbed genes and classifying clinical cancer samples, it is important to accurately model the interactions between the two data types. Here, we present EBADIMEX for jointly identifying differential expression and methylation and classifying samples. The moderated t-test widely used with empirical Bayes priors in current differential expression methods is generalised to a multivariate setting by developing: (1) a moderated Welch t-test for equality of means with unequal variances; (2) a moderated F-test for equality of variances; and (3) a multivariate test for equality of means with equal variances. This leads to parametric models with prior distributions for the parameters, which allow fast evaluation and robust analysis of small data sets. EBADIMEX is demonstrated on simulated data as well as a large breast cancer (BRCA) cohort from TCGA. We show that the use of empirical Bayes priors and moderated tests works particularly well on small data sets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is essential for maintaining retinal homeostasis by removing and recycling photoreceptor outer segment (POS) in membranes. It also produces and secretes growth factors involved in retinal homeostasis. Arrestin 1 (ARR1) is specifically expressed in photoreceptors (PRs) and a vital molecule for keeping visual cycle between PRs and RPE. In the present study, we showed the expression of ARR1 was decreased by form-deprivation (FD) in retina of rat. The ARR1 was detected in the RPE of the controls but not in the RPE of FD, which indicates RPE phagocytes POS containing ARR1. Furthermore, we overexpressed ARR1 in cultured human RPE and revealed the ARR1 upregulates bFGF expression and downregulates TGF-beta 1, -beta 2 and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). The upregulation of bFGF by ARR1 directly works for PR survival and the downregulation of TGF-beta s by ARR1 inhibits epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of RPE, which is the underlying mechanism of keeping retinal homeostasis. Our results also indicate the regulation of ARR1 expression in RPE might become a novel therapeutic option for various ocular diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"Studies have shown that retrieval of long-term memory can cause memory reconsolidation, and impaired reconsolidation leads to amnesia development. However, the mechanisms of amnesia induction due to impaired memory reconsolidation remains poorly described. Using experiments involving grape snails trained to conditioned food aversion, we studied the role of translation and transcription processes and the role of serotonin receptors in the mechanisms of amnesia induction. We found that administration of a serotonin receptor antagonist or a protein synthesis inhibitor before the administration of a reminder using a conditioned food stimulus induced amnesia development, whereas injections of mRNA synthesis inhibitor did not affect memory safety. Moreover, combined injections of an antagonist of serotonin receptor and inhibitors of protein or mRNA synthesis before reminder administration completely prevented amnesia development. In addition, inhibitors of protein or mRNA synthesis prevented amnesia development 3 h but not 9 h after the administration of a serotonin receptor antagonist/reminder. We hypothesize that the mechanisms of amnesia induction caused by impaired memory reconsolidation depend on protein and mRNA syntheses within a certain time window, similar to the mechanisms of induction of other long-term plastic brain rearrangements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"This study aimed to investigate for the first time, the profile of Physarum microplasmodial phosphatase (PPH) activity toward the phosphorylated light chain of Physarum myosin II (PLCM) at pH 7.6, the velocity of cytoplasmic streaming, and PPH expression in spherule formation during dark starvation (DS). In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of PPH using polymerase chain reaction, based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. The cDNA contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1245 bp, corresponding to 415 amino acids. We confirmed that a rapid increase in PPH activity toward PLCM and a rapid decrease in cytoplasmic streaming velocity precede spherule formation by Physarum microplasmodia. The profiles of increase in PPH activity toward PLCM, PPH expression, and PPH accumulation during DS were correlated with spherule formation in the Physarum microplasmodia. Moreover, application of the wheat germ cell-free expression system resulted in the successful production of recombinant PPH and in the expression of phosphatase activity toward PLCM. These results suggest that PPH is involved in the cessation of cytoplasmic streaming in Physarum microplasmodia during DS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,"Salmonella OmpC sequence analysis by Clustal revealed a unique amino acid residue (TSNGSNPST) in positions from 268 to 276.

51,"Dextransuccrase (E.C 2.4.1.5) is a key enzyme in S. mutans for the metabolism of sucrose which helps in the adherence and accumulation of bacteria on tooth surface leading to the formation of dental caries. Dextransuccrase resembles in its catalytic properties with the brush boarder sucrase and exhibits pH dependent inhibitory and stimulatory effects in response to Nat In this communication we studied the effect of monovalent cations on the activity of dextransuccrase from S. mutans. The percentage inhibition of dextransuccrase was 65% at 0.5 mM NaCl which enhanced to 90% at 20 mM sodium concentration. However there was no effect on dextransucrase activity in presence of other monovalent cations (Rb+ , Cs+, and K+) tested. Enzyme activity was enhanced 20-24% in acidic pH but was strongly inhibited (59-89%) around neutral and alkaline pH by 0.5-2.0 mM sodium chloride. Upon dialysis, 86% of enzyme activity was restored to control values. There was no effect of 2 mM NaCl on glucosyltransferase activity of the enzyme. Kinetic studies revealed that enzyme showed biphasic effects in response to Na+ ions. At acidic pH the enzyme exhibited mixed type of activation affecting both Vmax and Km, while in alkaline pH, the enzyme showed V- type effect reducing Vmax by 74% without affecting Km. The effects of sodium ions on dextransuccrase activity were specific, thus it can be useful to block its catalytic activity, and reducing the cariogenic potential of S. mutans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

53,"Background Accurate re-positioning of the coil is challenging in magnetic stimulation at the cervical spinal level. The applicability of coil location control for this type of stimulation is unexplored. New method: Utilizing a figure-of-eight coil and anatomy-specific models of the magnetic stimulation system, we developed a novel technique that enables probing corticospinal excitability at the cervical spinal level. Magnetic stimulation was performed in 9 healthy subjects at C2-C6 spinal levels using a figure-of-eight coil and a coil tracking system. MEPs were recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle. The functioning of the coil tracking system was tested with an estimated electric field maximum (eEFM) above the Cl cervical level (group 1) and below (group 2). Motor-evoked potential (MEP) reproducibility was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The use of coil location control in cervical level focal magnetic stimulation enabled the recording of highly reproducible MEPs. Within one co-registration, the ICC 95% confidence interval (CI) in group 1 was 0.89-0.99 and in group 2 was 0.24-0.85. Comparison with existing methods and conclusions: This method can be used for accurate maintenance and retrieval of the focal coil position at the cervical level with low spatial variability during stimulation. Existing methodologies employ determination of the coil location based on external landmarks, which makes the procedure cumbersome. This technique can optimize existing stimulation protocols and facilitate development of navigated spinal stimulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"In 2017, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme formed the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint. All alliance member countries have pledged to develop control regulations that include lead threshold limits. To improve regulations and demonstrate compliance of paint industry products, it is necessary to have adequate, locally applicable methodologies. In this sense, the main objective of this research was to validate the methodology of alkaline extraction for the quantification of lead in ten different types of Ecuadorian commercial paints using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Two hundred and fifty samples from different paint industry products were analyzed, and the results were used to evaluate the method's performance and robustness. It was determined that the method could be applied for lead concentrations above 100 mg.kg(-1), and results showed relative standard deviation values lower than 14.8% and fortification recoveries between 80.3 and 119.4%, fulfilling the acceptance criteria established in the Environmental Protection Agency's lead-based Paint Laboratory Operations Guidelines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

56,"Humanized and fully human sequence-derived therapeutic antibodies retain the capacity to induce anti-drug antibodies. Daclizumab (humanized version of the murine anti-Tac antibody; E.HAT) was selected for a proof of concept application of engineering approaches to reduce potential immunogenicity due to its demonstrated immunogenicity in the clinic. Reduced immunogenicity variants of E.HAT were created by identifying and modifying a CD4(+) T cell epitope region in the VH region. Variant epitope region peptides were selected for their reduced capacity to induce CD4(+) T cell proliferative responses in vitro. Variant antibody molecules were created, and CD25 affinity and potency were similar to the unmodified parent antibody. Fab fragments from the variant antibodies induced a lower frequency and magnitude of responses in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation tests. By the empirical selection of two amino acid mutations, fully functional humanized E.HAT antibodies with reduced potential to induce immune responses in vitro were created.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,"CDKN2A is an evolutionarily conserved gene encoding proteins implicated in tumor suppression, ocular development, aging, and metabolic diseases. Like the human form, mouse Cdkn2a encodes two distinct proteins-p16(Ink4a), which blocks cyclin-dependent kinase activity, and p19(Arf), which is best known as a positive regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor-and their functions have been well-studied in genetically engineered mouse models. Relatively little is known about how expression of the two transcripts is controlled in normal development and in certain disease states. To better understand their coordinate and transcript-specific expression in situ, we used a transposase-aided approach to generate a new BAC transgenic mouse model in which the first exons encoding Arf and Ink4a are replaced by fluorescent reporters. We show that mouse embryo fibroblasts generated from the transgenic lines faithfully display induction of each transgenic reporter in cell culture models, and we demonstrate the expected expression of the Arf reporter in the normal testis, one of the few places where that promoter is normally expressed. Interestingly, the TGF beta-2-dependent induction of the Arf reporter in the eye-a process essential for normal eye development-does not occur. Our findings illustrate the value of BAC transgenesis in mapping key regulatory elements in the mouse by revealing the genomic DNA required for Cdkn2a induction in cultured cells and the developing testis, and the apparent lack of elements driving expression in the developing eye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,"Bleeding complications following percutaneous coronary intervention associate with increased mortality. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are insufficiently understood. Platelet recruitment and activation at sites of vascular injury depends on the function of integrin adhesion receptors. Besides GPIIbIIIa as the most abundant integrin receptor, platelets relevantly express ss 1 integrins. Experimental evidence from in vivo studies suggests a significant role of ss 1 integrins in primary haemostasis. However, little is known about the clinical impact of genetic alterations of the beta 1 subunit, which might contribute to bleeding complications in patients. In this study, we performed DNA sequencing of patients suffering from bleeding complications after coronary artery stenting according to TIMI or BARC classification. We isolated DNA samples from 741 patients out of a cohort from 14,160 patients recruited in seven randomized clinical trials between June 2000 and May 2011. Subsequently, Sanger sequencing was performed covering the beta 1 integrin cytoplasmic activation domain (exon16) and its non-coding upstream region. Out of 764 patients suffering from bleeding complications, 741 DNA samples were successfully sequenced. Genotype variation was detected for SNP rs2153875 located within the non-coding upstream region with following allele frequency in study population: CC (7.3%), CA (35%) and AA (57.8%), which is similar to a general population cohort. Further, genotype variation in SNP rs2153875 do not associate with the frequency of TIMI or BARC classified access or non-access site bleedings. Genotype variations of the beta 1 integrin activation domain do not associate with bleeding risk after PCI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all, 226 clones of SSH library were sequenced and analyzed. A total of 179 high-quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated and based on the CAP3 assembly of these ESTs, 126 genes (97 singletons and 29 contigs) were computationally annotated. The mapping of 88.26% ESTs by gene ontology (GO) annotation distributed them into 751 GO terms of three categories, cellular location, molecular function, and biological process. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed 45 ESTs are involved in 49 different biological pathways. Also, 67 ESTs encodes four different classes of enzymes such as oxidoreductases (29), transferase (20), hydrolases (16) and isomerase (2). Six genes were selected and subjected to qPCR analysis, of these, two genes (FHG Floral homeotic AGAMOUS-like isoform X2, MADS1 MADS-box transcription factor) showed significant up-regulation in the pod wall compared to leaves. Surprisingly, one of the MADS1 box gene, FHG (CaAGLX2), responsible for flower development expressed in the pod wall. Therefore, understanding its specific role in the pod wall could be interesting. Thus, the transcript dynamics of the chickpea pod wall revealed differentially expressed genes in the pod wall, which may be participating in the metabolic build-up of both pod wall and seeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,"A number of properties of the smallest (less than 0.2 mu m) germinal proto-mitochondria (PRMC) from rat liver have been studied. These PRMC were obtained by filtering the light fraction of hepatic mitochondria (MC) through calibrated millipore membranes. Germinal PRMC contain in general the same proteins as MC. However, they have the reduced content of flavoproteins and zero cytochrome oxidase. Germinal PRMC, in contrast to MC, almost does not contain the ""aging pigment"" - lipofuscin. They have DNA; the DNA/protein ratio in them is much higher than in MC, i.e. they are poor in protein. The obtained results support the earlier assumption that MC in specialized animal cells can arise from germinal PRMC - particles smaller than 0.2 mu m containing DNA. It is assumed that the DNA molecules enter to cytoplasm during degradation of old MC serves as a seed for the formation of PRMC (with the connection of nuclear DNA).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study focused to work on the dengue virus detection in a simplest method using gold nanoparticles probe (AuNPs) with thiol tagged single strand DNA (ss-DNA). A sensitive, fluorescence-based detection strategy was designed to examine and quantified the hybridisation process and also elucidated the behaviour of AuNPs before and after interaction of biomolecule. The detection process was focused on aggregation of gold nanoprobe in the presence of complementary strand (target region). Hence the percentage of aggregation was measured and as a result, the limit of detection was found to be 10(-6) dilutions. Current detection method was highly sensitive, easy to perform and the reaction timing is rapid between 5 and 10 min, and it can be observed through naked eye.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,"The modern way of life contributes to the higher frequency of a complex state medically called metabolic syndrome (MetS), which is an inevitable consequence of several most common diseases of modern civilization. Patients with MetS have three times higher risk of experiencing a heart attack or a stroke and twice higher possibility to die from them. Serbia holds the infamous third place in Europe in mortality from heart disease, just behind Russia and Ukraine. The study explores the correlation of every combination of genotypes of apoE (apolipoprotein E) and LRP1 (low density receptor- related protein 1) genes with presence of MetS, and the connection with each anthropometric and biochemical parameter in both tested groups. Study demonstrates the impact of genotype combinations on the emergence and development of the MetS in Serbia. 63 patients and 30 controls were included in the study, aged from 19 to 65. Each person genotype was determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) profile. Odds ratio (OR) values showed that the presence of apoE e3e4/LRP1 CC genotype combination of genotypes in patients multiplies the chance (7.6 times) for the occurrence of the MetS in comparison to the presence of other genotype combinations. Determining the genetic basis of MetS is one of the necessary steps in the prevention of disease, saving the cost of treatment, and in the design of targeted therapies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,"Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a nucleic acid quantitative technique and is also considered as a validation tool. The Cry1Ia36 protein isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strain YC-10 has high nematicidal activity against nematodes. Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the major model organisms and a readily accessible source of biological material for gene expression studies. To evaluate the expression stability of 12 candidate reference genes of C. elegans for exposing to different concentrations of Cry1Ia36 protein and different treat time, five statistical approaches (the comparative delta-Ct method, BestKeeper, NormFinder, Genorm and RefFinder) were used to evaluate each individual candidate reference gene. The results indicated that cdc-42 and F35G12.2 were the best reference genes for performing reliable gene expression normalization in the impact of Cry1Ia36 protein. In addition, when C. elegans was exposed to Cry1Ia36 protein and other nematicides, avermectin and 5-aminolevulinic acid, cdc-42 was recommended as the most reliable reference genes. Y45F10D.4 was the least stable reference genes in our experimental settings. Therefore, cdc-42 was reliable reference gene for gene expression studies in C. elegans exposed to Cry1Ia36 protein and other nematicides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"The body weight-selected lines of chickens are a model for understanding factors that predispose an individual to anorexia or obesity. The high body weight-selected (HWS) individuals are compulsive eaters that become obese whereas the low body weight-selected (LWS) are relatively lean and hypophagic. The objective of this study was to measure gene expression of various preadipocyte, proliferation, metabolic, and apoptotic markers in the stromal-vascular fraction and adipocytes from LWS and HWS adipose tissue. Although preadipocyte and proliferation markers were more highly expressed in the stromal-vascular fraction of LWS than HWS chicks, greater expression of granzyme-A and the presence of more annexin V-positive cells suggests that apoptosis may limit the adipogenic potential of adipocyte precursor cells and represent a novel mechanism that regulates the expansion of adipose tissue. Results provide insights on cellular mechanisms associated with adipose tissue development in the lean and obese state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

66,"Objective: The collagen type I alpha 1 (Col1 alpha 1) not only acts as a scaffold for the cell matrix, but also is involved in myocardial fibrosis. The purpose of this study is to screen an efficient shRNA specific to rat Col1 alpha 1 gene. Methods: The shRNA expression plasmids targeting Col1 alpha 1 were constructed and their knockdown efficiency was examined by qPCR and Western blot. Results: Three shRNA expression plasmids targeting Col1 alpha 1 were successfully constructed, as suggested by analysis of restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The Col1 alpha 1 shRNA-expressing plasmids were then transfected into rat cardiac fibroblasts with high efficiency. The qPCR and Western blotting results demonstrated that Col1 alpha 1expression at both mRNA and protein level was significantly inhibited (p <0.05) in shRNA-transfected cells compared to scrambled shRNA-transfected cells. Conclusion: A Col1 alpha 1-specific shRNA with high efficiency of gene silencing is successfully obtained. The construction of Col1 alpha 1 shRNA-expressing plasmid lays the foundation for the further studies on the role of Collal gene in myocardial fibrosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,"Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is a prominent human and animal pathogen causing chronic inflammatory diseases. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is involved in the response to such pathogenic infections. However, the mechanism by which IL-1 beta is secreted during C. pseudotuberculosis infection remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying IL-1 beta secretion by macrophages infected with C. pseudotuberculosis. Herein, we firstly revealed that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and caspase-1 (Casp1) play critical roles in IL-1 beta secretion rather than IL-1 beta precursor (pro-IL-1 beta) expression in C. pseudotuberculosis-infected macrophages. Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) is partially involved in IL-1 beta secretion, while absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) is not involved in IL-1 beta secretion by C. pseudotuberculosis-infected macrophages. In addition, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPK) inhibitors almost attenuated IL-1 beta secretion, implying that NF-kappa B and p38MAPK pathway are involved in IL-1 beta secretion in C. pseudotuberculosis-infected macrophages. Furthermore, C. pseudotuberculosis were significantly more numerous in Nlrp3(-/-), Asc(-/-), and Casp-1(-/-) macrophages than in WT macrophages at 24 h after infection (P < 0.05), indicating that NLRP3 inflammasome components limit C. pseudotuberculosis replication in macrophages. Together, these data provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying IL-1 beta secretion in C. pseudotuberculosis-infected macrophages and further the current understanding of the host pro-inflammatory immune response against this pathogen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"The MET3 promoter (MET3pr) inserted into the silenced chromosome in budding yeast can overcome Sir2-dependent silencing upon induction and activate transcription in every single cell among a population. Despite the fact that MET3pr is turned on in all the cells, its activity still shows very high cell-to-cell variability. To understand the nature of such ""gene expression noise,"" we followed the dynamics of the MET3pr-GFP expression inserted into ribosomal DNA (rDNA) using time-lapse microscopy. We found that the noisy ""on"" state is comprised of multiple substable states with discrete expression levels. These intermediate states stochastically transition between each other, with ""up"" transitions among different activated states occurring exclusively near the mitotic exit and ""down"" transitions occurring throughout the rest of the cell cycle. Such cell cycle dependence likely reflects the dynamic activity of the rDNA-specific RENT complex, as MET3pr-GFP expression in a telomeric locus does not have the same cell cycle dependence. The MET3pr-GFP expression in rDNA is highly correlated in mother and daughter cells after cell division, indicating that the silenced state in the mother cell is inherited in daughter cells. These states are disrupted by a brief repression and reset upon a second activation. Potential mechanisms behind these observations are further discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"Podocyte gene mutations and their role in the development of nephrotic syndrome (NS) have been reported in some ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of possible variants in TRCP6 and NPHS2 (podocin) genes and their association with clinical manifestations in a group of adult patients with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). All participants including 36 patients with SRNS and 71 healthy volunteers were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Whole exons of NPHS2 gene and -254 C>G, -218 C>T, and -361 A>T polymorphisms in the promoter of TRPC6 gene were studied. There were no significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies of aforementioned TRCP6 polymorphisms between cases and controls (P>0.05). However, four novel polymorphisms including -257 T>C, -266 G>A, -293 G>C, and -21 G>A found in the promoter region of TRPC6 gene that may be involved in SRNS in our cohort. In NPHS2 gene, three different polymorphisms in the NPHS2 gene were found in 7 patients with FSGS and none of the previously reported risk polymorphisms was detected in our patients. Podocin related mutations are not too much associated with SRNS in adults, but we should consider the possibility of TRPC6 gene mutation in this population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"From the NIST website and the literature, we have collected the Ionisation Energies (IE) of 3,052 and the Proton Affinities (PA) of 1,670 compounds. For 614 of these, both the IE and PA are known; this enables a study of the relationships between these quantities for a wide variety of molecules. From the IE and PA values, the hydrogen atom affinities (HA) of molecular ions M center dot+ may also be assessed. The PA may be equated to the heterolytic bond energy of [MH](+) and HA to the homolytic bond energy. Plots of PA versus IE for these substances show (in agreement with earlier studies) that, for many families of molecules, the slope of the ensuing line is less negative than -1, i.e. changes in the PA are significantly less than the concomitant opposite changes in IE. At one extreme (high PA, low IE) are the metals, their oxides and hydroxides, which show a slope of close to -1, at the other extreme (low PA, high IE) are the hydrogen halides, methyl halides and noble gases, which show a slope of ca. -0.3; other molecular categories show intermediate behaviour. One consequence of a slope less negative than -1 is that the changes in ionic enthalpies of the protonated species more closely follow the changes in the enthalpies of the neutral molecules compared with changes in the ion enthalpies of the corresponding radical cations. This is consistent with findings from ab initio calculations from the literature that the incoming proton, once attached to the molecule, may retain a significant amount of its charge. These collected data allow a comparison of the thermodynamic stability of protonated molecules in terms of their homolytic or heterolytic bond cleavages. Protonated nitriles are particularly stable by virtue of the very large hydrogen atom affinities of their radical cations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"Safety assessment of genetically modified plants includes protein characterization to confirm the intended trait protein expression. In addition, to conduct safety tests, the large amount of purified protein needed is usually met through the use of a surrogate, microbially produced protein source. Characterization of the eCry3.1Ab and mCry3A proteins as derived from Event MZIR098 maize was challenging because of the difficulty in purifying/isolating these proteins that are of similar molecular weight and have considerable shared sequence and immunogenicity. This also applies to establishing the biochemical equivalence to the microbially produced surrogate proteins, as highly-purified plant protein is required. While use of crude plant extracts facilitated functional equivalence testing with the surrogate proteins, a separate technical challenge had to be met. The eCry3.1Ab and mCry3A proteins display differentiated modes of action toward CRW pests, however, with the same overall target pest spectrum, no differential test organism existed to allow equivalence testing for one insecticidal protein in the presence of the other. To establish that the microbially produced proteins are suitable surrogates for the plant-produced proteins, the challenges in the protein purification and bioactivity testing had to be addressed. This article describes technical solutions to assess and characterize the insecticidal proteins in this new event and thereby confirm equivalence/suitability of the microbially produced protein surrogates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"A sensitive, simple and fast LC-MS/MS method was established and validated for the determination of loratadine in rat plasma. The preparation of plasma sample was completed through a one-step liquid-liquid extraction method. An UHPLC column Phenomenex Kinetex C18 (50 mm x 2.1 mm, 2.6 mu m) was utilized to achieve the chromatography separation. Mobile phases A and B were acetonitrile and water with a ratio of 45:55 (v/v) under an isocratic gradient, both comprising 0.2% formic acid. Multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) was carried out on the triple quadrupole detection in position ionization mode with an electrospray ionization source, the transitions of m/z 383.1 -> 337.2 and m/z 284.9 -> 193.3 were used to determine loratadine and diazepam (internal standard), respectively. The total analysis run time was 3.5 min and the elution time of loratadine and diazepam occurred at 1.1 and 2.1 min, respectively. This method has the advantages of higher sensitivity (0.04 ng mL(-1)), wider linear range (0.04-400 ng mL(-1), r(2) > 0.995), shorter analysis time (3.5 min), needing only a smaller plasma volume (50 mu L) and simple preparation process. The accuracy and precision of loratadine in all QC samples met the requirements. This novel method was successfully applied to a bioavailability research of loratadine nanosuspensions in rats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"Short half-life proteins regulate many essential processes, including cell cycle, transcription, and apoptosis. However, few well-characterized protein-turnover pathways have been identified because traditional methods to measure protein half-life are time and labor intensive. To overcome this barrier, we developed a protein stability probe and high-content screening pipeline for novel regulators of short half-life proteins using automated image analysis. Our pilot probe consists of the short half-life protein c-MYC (MYC) fused to Venus fluorescent protein (MYC-Venus). This probe enables protein half-life to be scored as a function of fluorescence intensity and distribution. Rapid turnover prevents maximal fluorescence of the probe due to the relatively longer maturation time of the fluorescent protein. Cells expressing the MYC-Venus probe were analyzed using a pipeline in which automated confocal microscopy and image analyses were used to score MYC-Venus stability by two strategies: assaying the percentage of cells with Venus fluorescence above background, and phenotypic comparative analysis. To evaluate this high-content screening pipeline and our probe, a kinase inhibitor library was screened by confocal microscopy to identify known and novel kinases that regulate MYC stability. Compounds identified were shown to increase the half-life of both MYC-Venus and endogenous MYC, validating the probe and pipeline. Fusion of another short half-life protein, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), with Venus also demonstrated an increase in percent Venus-positive cells after treatment with inhibitors known to stabilize MCL1. Together, the results validate the use of our automated microscopy and image analysis pipeline of stability probe-expressing cells to rapidly and quantitatively identify regulators of short half-life proteins.

The inherent problem with this is that acquiring all of them at commercial rates can be prohibitively expensive. With this in mind, we have created a low-cost alternative to the most commonly used peptide calibrants. We were able to achieve an overall 78 ppm mass accuracy across a mass range of 900 to 2500 Da which was comparable to the mass accuracy achievable with commercial peptide mixes and hence has become a viable alternative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"The accurate modelling and scoring of protein-peptide (Pr-Pe) complexes are determining factors in the drug discovery studies by molecular docking. However, there are three main problems with Pr-Pe docking methods: high flexibility of protein and peptide molecules, scoring of generated models, and integrative modelling. In this study, we introduced a new analytical method for ranking epitopes to reduce scoring and integrative modelling problems. At first, we docked 120 potential epitopes from E5, E6 and E7 oncoproteins from human papillomavirus (HPV) 16, 18, 31 and 45 against ten HLA-I and six HLA-II molecules using two servers, CABS-dock (a template-free method (TFM)) and GalaxyPepDock (a template-based method (TBM)). Then, we weighted the early (original) docking scores by involving the population coverage (PC) of the HLA molecules and integrated all the weighted scores earned by each peptide to calculate a single weighted-integrated (W-I) docking score per each peptide to rank them. Our findings showed that there are positive bivariate correlations between the results of applied servers, with Pearson correlation coefficient averages (r) 0.385 and 0.525, as well as, R square averages (r(2)) 0.148 and 0.275 for the original and W-I scores, respectively (p < 0.01). These statistics indicated that the W-I scores, analyzed by the new method, have more correlation and predictability power than original scores. Generally, this new analytical method can be considered as an effective solution to improve the ranking of epitopes in similar studies to avoid obtaining more false results or even true results but without appropriate PCs. Additionally, our high-score epitopes are valuable candidates for further experimental validating studies, targeting the treatment of HPV-mediated cancers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,"Epigenetic and transcriptome alterations are essential for lineage specification, represented by imprinted X-chromosome inactivation (iXCI) in female mouse preimplantation embryos. However, how various factors affect transcriptome states and lineage commitment remains unclear. We found that in vitro culture duration strongly influences transcriptional variation compared to iXCI loss. Single-cell analysis of the inner cell mass (ICM) for major transcription and epigenomic factors revealed that sex-specific differences in expression are diminished by loss of iXCI in the primitive endoderm (PrE) but not in the epiblast. Females had a higher proportion of ICM compared to that in males, and PrE development was affected by iXCI states in female embryos. Our findings provide insight into sex differences and iXCI function in lineage specification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"Lipopolysaccharide and beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein (LGBP) is a pattern recognition protein (PRP) purified from the Penaeus monodon by Blue-Sepharose, Phenyl-Sepharose followed by Sephadex G-100 chromatography. P. monodon LGBP consist of 36 and 48 kDa subunits on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions respectively. Purified P. monodon LGBP agglutinates the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata, due to the presence of beta-glucan (beta G) on its surface. This agglutination was cross checked with the in silico docking analysis of LGBP-beta G and LGBP-laminarin (isomeric form beta G) interaction. As part of a strategy, to determine the precise role of P. monodon LGBP (Pm-LGBP) in pattern recognition mechanism mutations were introduced by in silico approach. In crustacean LGBP, RGD motif (Arg, Gly, Asp) plays the vital role in the cell adhesion and pattern recognition mechanism. Role of Asp in RGD motif was determined through amino acid substitution, introduction of a specific mutation D134K into a central area of the sugar-binding (beta G) site resulted in complete loss of pathogen recognition and binding of Pm-LGBP to beta G. These results demonstrate that, the RGD motif of Asp134 is essential for sugar binding in P. monodon. To our knowledge, P. monodon D134K is the first mutant shrimp LGBP which is unable to bind with the sugar residues.

78,"An engineered variant of T4 lysozyme serves as a model for studying induced remote conformational changes in a full protein context. The design involves a duplicated surface helix, flanked by two loops, that switches between two different conformations spanning about 20 angstrom. Molecular dynamics simulations of the engineered protein, up to 1 mu s, rule out alpha-helix to beta-sheet transitions within the duplicated helix as suggested by others. These simulations highlight how the use of different force fields can lead to radical differences in the structure of the protein. In addition, Markov state modeling and transition path theory were employed to map a 6.6 mu s simulation for possible early intermediate states and to provide insights into the onset of the switching motion. The putative intermediates involve the folding of one helical turn in the C-terminal loop through energy driven, sequential rearrangement of nearby salt bridges around the key residue Arg63. These results provide a first step towards understanding the energetics and dynamics of a rather complicated intra-protein motion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,"A protein superfamily with a ""Domain of Unknown Function,"", DUF3349 (PF11829), is present predominately in Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus bacterial species suggesting that these proteins may have a biological function unique to these bacteria. We previously reported the inaugural structure of a DUF3349 superfamily member, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv0543c. Here, we report the structures determined for three additional DUF3349 proteins: Mycobacterium smegmatis MSMEG_1063 and MSMEG_1066 and Mycobacterium abscessus MAB_3403c. Like Rv0543c, the NMR solution structure of MSMEG_1063 revealed a monomeric five alpha-helix bundle with a similar overall topology. Conversely, the crystal structure of MSMEG_1066 revealed a five alpha-helix protein with a strikingly different topology and a tetrameric quaternary structure that was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography. The NMR solution structure of a fourth member of the DUF3349 superfamily, MAB_3403c, with 18 residues missing at the N-terminus, revealed a monomeric alpha-helical protein with a folding topology similar to the three C-terminal helices in the protomer of the MSMEG_1066 tetramer. These structures, together with a GREMLIN-based bioinformatics analysis of the DUF3349 primary amino acid sequences, suggest two subfamilies within the DUF3349 family. The division of the DUF3349 into two distinct subfamilies would have been lost if structure solution had stopped with the first structure in the DUF3349 family, highlighting the insights generated by solving multiple structures within a protein superfamily. Future studies will determine if the structural diversity at the tertiary and quaternary levels in the DUF3349 protein superfamily have functional roles in Mycobacteria and Rhodococcus species with potential implications for structure-based drug discovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,"YspD is an annotated hydrophilic translocator of Ysa-Ysp type III secretion system of Yersinia enterocolitica. YspD has sequence, secondary structure and three-dimensional structure similar to other hydrophilic translocators. All hydrophilic translocators lack transmembrane region and possess intramolecular coiled-coil region. Disordered regions are mostly clustered at the N-terminal. Large loops provide flexibility, allowing conformational changes during oligomerization and protein-protein interaction. LcrV and PcrV have globular N-terminal and C-terminal domains, connected by intramolecular coiled-coil region. YspD, IpaD, SipD and BipD lack globular N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Their N-terminal and C-terminal domain have a bundle like structure connected by the intramolecular coiled-coil. The intramolecular coiled-coil regions (helix-5&9) of YspD showed maximum conservation, followed by helices at N-terminal. Polar interactions are mainly involved during dimerization of YspD, involving polar residues from helix-9 of both the YspD molecules. A methionine forms the boundary of interaction between the two YspD molecules. The two YspD molecules are arranged in antiparallel fashion to form the dimer. N-terminal of YspB interacted with C-terminal of YspD molecule to form a pentameric complex, consisting four YspD molecules and one YspB molecule. Sequence, structural similarity and presence of specific motifs in YspD (like chaperone protein) indicate the ability of N-terminal domain to show self-chaperoning activity and regulate folding and conformational state of YspD during its journey from the bacterial cytoplasm to the needle tip. Structural analysis of YspD and its mechanism of interaction with other proteins would enable us to design drugs against this hydrophilic protein to combat Yersinia infection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,"Amide-sulfonamides provide a potent anti-inflammatory scaffold targeting the CXCR4 receptor. A series of novel amide-sulfonamide derivatives were investigated for their gas-phase fragmentation behaviors using electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in negative ion mode. Upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), deprotonated amide-sulfonamides mainly underwent either an elimination of the amine to form the sulfonyl anion and amide anion or a benzoylamide derivative to provide sulfonamide anion bearing respective substituent groups. Based on the characteristic fragment ions and the deuterium-hydrogen exchange experiments, three possible fragmentation mechanisms corresponding to ion-neutral complexes including [sulfonyl anion/amine] complex (INC-1), [sulfonamide anion/benzoylamide derivative] complex (INC-2) and [amide anion/sulfonamide] complex (INC-3), respectively, were proposed. These three ion-neutral complexes might be produced by the cleavages of S-N and C-N bond from the amide-sulfonamides, which generated the sulfonyl anion (Route 1), sulfonamide anion (Route 2) and the amide anion (Route 3). DFT calculations suggested that Route 1, which generated the sulfonyl anion (ion c) is more favorable. In addition, the elimination of SO2 through a three-membered-ring transition state followed by the formation of C-N was observed for all the amide-sulfonamides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"Background Polypterus senegalus can fully regenerate its pectoral lobed fins, including a complex endoskeleton, with remarkable precision. However, despite the enormous potential of this species for use in medical research, its regeneration mechanisms remain largely unknown. Methods To identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during the early stages of lobed fin regeneration in P. senegalus, we performed a differential proteomic analysis using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach based quantitative proteome from the pectoral lobed fins at 3 time points. Furthermore, we validated the changes in protein expression with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis. Results The experiment yielded a total of 3177 proteins and 15,091 unique peptides including 1006 non-redundant (nr) DEPs. Of these, 592 were upregulated while 349 were downregulated after lobed fin amputation when compared to the original tissue. Bioinformatics analyses showed that the DEPs were mainly associated with Ribosome and RNA transport, metabolic, ECM-receptor interaction, Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, DNA replication, and Regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first proteomic research to investigate alterations in protein levels and affected pathways in bichirs' lobe-fin/limb regeneration. In addition, our study demonstrated a highly dynamic regulation during lobed fin regeneration in P. senegalus. These results not only provide a comprehensive dataset on differentially expressed proteins during the early stages of lobe-fin/limb regeneration but also advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lobe-fin/limb regeneration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"Recycled paper mill effluent (RPME) consists of various organic and inorganic compounds. In this study, modified anaerobic hybrid baffled (MAHB) bioreactor has been successfully used to anaerobically digest RPME. The anaerobic digestion was investigated in relation to methane production rate, lignin removal, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, with respect to organic loading rate (OLR) and hydraulic retention time (HRT). The analysis using kinetic study was carried out under mesophilic conditions (37 +/- 2 degrees C) and influent COD concentrations (1000-4000 mg L-1), to prove its practicability towards RPME treatment. First-order kinetic model was used to clarify the behavior of RPME anaerobic digestion under different OLRs (0.14-4.00 g COD L-1 d(-1)) and HRT (1-7 d). The result shows that the highest COD removal efficiency and methane production rate were recorded to be 98.07% and 2.2223 L CH4 d(-1), respectively. This result was further validated by evaluating the biokinetic coefficients (reaction rate constant (k) and maximum biogas production (y(m))), which gave values of k = 0.57 d(-1) and y(m) = 0.331 L d(-1). This kinetic data concludes that MAHB presented satisfactory performance towards COD removal with relatively high methane production, which can be further utilized as on-site energy supply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"Background : As the number of sequenced genomes grows, researchers have access to an increasingly rich source for discovering detailed evolutionary information. However, the computational technologies for inferring biologically important evolutionary events are not sufficiently developed. Results : We present algorithms to estimate the evolutionary time (tMRS) to the most recent substitution event from a multiple alignment column by using a probabilistic model of sequence evolution. As the confidence in estimated tMRS values varies depending on gap fractions and nucleotide patterns of alignment columns, we also compute the standard deviation of tMRS by using a dynamic programming algorithm. We identified a number of human genomic sites at which the last substitutions occurred between two speciation events in the human lineage with confidence. A large fraction of such sites have substitutions that occurred between the concestor nodes of Hominoidea and Euarchontoglires. We investigated the correlation between tissue-specific transcribed enhancers and the distribution of the sites with specific substitution time intervals, and found that brain-specific transcribed enhancers are threefold enriched in the density of substitutions in the human lineage relative to expectations. Conclusions : We have presented algorithms to estimate the evolutionary time (tMRS) to the most recent substitution event from a multiple alignment column by using a probabilistic model of sequence evolution. Our algorithms will be useful for Evo-Devo studies, as they facilitate screening potential genomic sites that have played an important role in the acquisition of unique biological features by target species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"Studies of the effect of plant density have been conducted in numerous crops. However, most of them focused on yield to evaluate the impact of plant competition. In this study, we determined the best functional trait to detect early competition responses affecting plant growth. To do so, we designed experiments with increasing sowing density using two different durum wheat genotypes. Height from crown to the last liguled leaf and dry weight decreased with increasing sowing density showing that these traits are suitable to measure early competition responses. However, specific leaf area, a common-measured trait to study competition was not affected by sowing density at early stages. We conclude that plant density is a modifier of plant growth at the early stages of plant growth and that dry weight as well as height from crown to the last liguled leaf are the best functional traits to be measured.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

87,"Motivation: To understand the regulatory pathways underlying diseases, studies often investigate the differential gene expression between genetically or chemically differing cell populations. Differential expression analysis identifies global changes in transcription and enables the inference of functional roles of applied perturbations. This approach has transformed the discovery of genetic drivers of disease and possible therapies. However, differential expression analysis does not provide quantitative predictions of gene expression in untested conditions. We present a hybrid approach, termed Differential Expression in Python (DiffExPy), that uniquely combines discrete, differential expression analysis with in silico differential equation simulations to yield accurate, quantitative predictions of gene expression from time-series data. Results: To demonstrate the distinct insight provided by DiffExpy, we applied it to published, in vitro, time-series RNA-seq data from several genetic PI3K/PTEN variants of MCF10a cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor. DiffExPy proposed ensembles of several minimal differential equation systems for each differentially expressed gene. These systems provide quantitative models of expression for several previously uncharacterized genes and uncover new regulation by the PI3K/PTEN pathways. We validated model predictions on expression data from conditions that were not used for model training. Our discrete, differential expression analysis also identified SUZ12 and FOXA1 as possible regulators of specific groups of genes that exhibit late changes in expression. Our work reveals how DiffExPy generates quantitatively predictive models with testable, biological hypotheses from time-series expression data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various synthetic routes have been described in the literature, starting from different precursors or modification of other N-15-labelled pyridines. In this work, we have explored the synthesis of N-15 N-15-labelled pyridines using a two-step process via the synthesis of alkoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran as precursor exhibiting already the desired pyridine substitution pattern. As an example, we have synthesized 3,5-dimethylpyridine-N-15 (lutidine-N-15) as demonstrated by N-15-NMR spectroscopy. That synthesis starts from methacrolein, propenyl ether, and N-15-labelled NH4Cl as nitrogen source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"Seven ascidiacyclamide [cyclo(-Ile-oxazoline-d-Val-thiazole-)(2)] (ASC) analogues incorporating the beta-amino acids beta Ile, beta oxazoline, and/or d-beta Val were synthesized. We then investigated the effects of the position and number of incorporated beta-amino acids on the structure, cytotoxicity, and copper binding by these seven analogues. The structural analyses revealed that both beta Ile and d-beta Val favor a gauche-type theta torsion angles, while beta oxazoline favors a trans-type theta torsion angle. Expansion of the macrocycle by incorporation of beta Ile or d-beta Val readily induced molecular folding. On the other hand, the incorporation of two beta oxazoline residues strongly extended the peptide conformation, and the incorporation of one was sufficient for the moderate restriction important for conformational equilibrium and cytotoxicity. Despite expansion of the macrocycles, the structure-cytotoxicity relationships were largely maintained. In studies of complexation of the analogues with Cu (II) ion, the position and number of incorporated beta-amino acids had a large impact on the structure of the metal complex and may contribute to its stabilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,"Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are building blocks for the biosynthesis of DNA. Various modified dNTPs' analogs have synthesized by structural changes of nucleoside's susgar and nucleobases and employed for synthesis of modified DNA. A very few modified dNTPs have prepared from non-sugar nucleoside analogs. This report describes the synthesis of acyclic nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) analog from amino acid L-Serine as aminopropanolyl-thymine triphosphate (ap-TTP) and demonstrate its biochemical evaluation as enzymatic incorporation of ap-TTP into DNA with DNA polymerases with primer extension methods. Alanyl peptide nucleicacids (Ala-PNA) are the analogs of DNA which contains alanyl backbone. Aminopropanolyl - analogs are derivatives of alanyl back bone. Ap-TTP analog is nucleoside triphosphate analog derived from Ala-PNA. Importantly, this report also sheds light on the crystal packing arrangement of alaninyl thymine ester derivative in solid-state and reveals the formation of self-duplex assembly in anti-parallel fashion via reverse Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions. Hence, ap-TTP is a useful analog which also generates the free amine functional group at the terminal of DNA oligonucleotide after incorporation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"A nonlinear general rate model (GRM) of liquid chromatography is formulated to analyze the influence of temperature variations on the dynamics of multi-component mixtures in a thermally insulated liquid chromatographic reactor. The mathematical model is formed by a system of nonlinear convection-diffusion reaction partial differential equations (PDEs) coupled with nonlinear algebraic equations for reactions and isotherms. The model equations are solved numerically by applying a semi-discrete high-resolution finite volume scheme (HR-FVS). Several numerical case studies are conducted for two different types of reactions to demonstrate the influence of heat transfer on the retention time, separation, and reaction. It was found that the enthalpies of adsorption and reaction significantly influence the reactor performance. The ratio of density time heat capacity of solid and liquid phases significantly influences the magnitude and velocity of concentration and thermal waves. The results obtained could be very helpful for further developments in non-isothermal reactive chromatography and provide a deeper insight into the sensitivity of chromatographic reactor operating under non-isothermal conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"Libyan Desert Glasses (LDGs) and Darwin Glasses (DGs) are impact glasses produced by the impact of an extraterrestrial body into the Earth million years ago. LDGs were formed in the Libyan Desert (Africa) and DGs in Tasmania (Australia). From their formation, they have suffered terrestrial weathering processes due to their interaction with the environment. This is the first work that has evaluated their weathering processes according to their composition, the surrounding environment, and the climate. An innovative methodology based on the leaching of organic and inorganic ions and chemical modeling simulations was employed. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), ionic chromatography (IC), and solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and head space (HS) injections coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detection were used. As a result, soluble organic compounds such as oxalates, n-hexadecanoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzalacetone were detected. The inorganic ions suffered a similar process, going inside the body of glasses and precipitating the corresponding salts when water evaporated. As these compounds are polar, they were probably transported by infiltration waters from outside the glasses, remaining inside in the pores, cavities, or cracks of the glasses during thousands of years. In the case of the DGs, it could be observed that under the oxidizing conditions of the terrestrial atmosphere, sulfides present in some samples transformed into sulfates. Finally, this methodology could be applied in other extraterrestrial materials discovered in deserts, ice fields, or in locations with great living activity like those of Tasmania.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"Safety assessment of drug impurities is a routine part of the drug development process. For oligonucleotide-based drugs, impurities can arise from impurities in starting materials, as by-products of the manufacturing process or from degradation, and are generally structurally similar to the parent oligonucleotide. To study the potential impact of impurities, a representative batch of a 2 '-O-methoxyethyl (MOE) antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was compared to batches of drug that were enriched with nine of the common impurities encountered with the chemical class. Mice were treated for 3 months with weekly subcutaneous injection of 10 or 30 mg/kg. The impurity content of the parent batch was 0.25%-2.5% of total drug substance. The enriched impurity mixtures contained from 3% to 10% of the various impurities. The expected common class effects were observed at the 30 mg/kg/week dose level in hematology, serum chemistry, and histopathology. However, there were no differences between the representative batch of material and those enriched with impurities. Based on these data, common oligonucleotide impurity studies do not appear to contribute to the overall toxicology profile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"The essential splicing factor Cwc24 contains a zinc-finger (ZF) domain required for its function in splicing. Cwc24 binds over the 5' splice site after the spliceosome is activated, and its binding prior to Prp2-mediated spliceosome remodeling is important for proper interactions of U5 and U6 with the 5' splice site sequence and selection of the 5' splice site. Here, we show that Cwc24 transiently interacts with the 5' splice site in formation of the functional RNA catalytic core during spliceosome remodeling, and the ZF-motif is required for specific interaction of Cwc24 with the 5' splice site. Deletion of the ZF domain or mutation of the conserved ZF residues greatly weakened the association of Cwc24 with the spliceosome, and lowered the affinity and specificity of its interaction with the 5' splice site, resulting in atypical interactions of U5, U6 and Prp8 with the 5' splice site, and aberrant cleavage at the 5' splice site. Our results reveal a crucial role of the Cwc24 ZF-motif for defining 5' splice site selection in the first splicing step.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"Methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH) plays an important role in degrading a range of organophosphorus compounds. In order to display MPH on the cell surface of Escherichia coli strain RosettaBlue (TM), the Flavin-based fluorescent protein EcFbFP was severed as an auto-anchoring matrix. With net negative charges of EcFbFP supplying the driving forces, fusion protein MPH-EcFbFP through a two-step auto-surface display process was finally verified by (a) inner membrane translocation and (b) anchoring at outer membrane. Cells with surface-displayed MPH obtained activity of 0.12 U/OD600 against substrate methyl parathion. MPH when fused with engineered EcFbFP containing 20 net negative charges exhibited fivefold higher anchoring efficiency and tenfold higher enzymatic catalytic activity of 1.10 U/OD600. The above result showed that MPH was successfully displayed on cell surface and can be used for biodegradation of methyl parathion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"Early diagnosis of cancer can increase the survival rate of patients. Minimally invasive liquid biopsy can avoid the problems of invasion and heterogeneity of traditional tumor biopsy methods, also is becoming a new approach for cancer diagnosis. In addition, DNA methylation as a marker to predict the occurrence and development of cancer has aroused more and more researchers' interest. But the traditional DNA methylation detection methods usually possess poor sensitivity and false positive. In recent years, digital PCR technology has been used for quantitative detection of DNA methylation because of its super sensitivity, better accuracy and the advantage of absolute quantification of nucleic acids without standard curve. Firstly, this review introduced the relationship between DNA methylation and carcinogenesis, then summarized the traditional detection methods of DNA methylation and their applications in clinical cancer early diagnosis. Secondly, the digital PCR based on different methods of nucleic acid sample dispersion and its advantages in the detection of DNA methylation are elaborated. Also, this review summarized the specific steps of using digital PCR to detect DNA methylation in body fluids for cancer diagnosis. Finally, we reviewed the research results and application progress of digital PCR in cancer DNA methylation detection. The possible challenges in the future of digital PCR in cancer DNA methylation detection are put forward and the opportunity of digital PCR in cancer liquid biopsy are prospected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

98,"Genome rearrangements are events where large blocks of DNA exchange pieces during evolution. The analysis of such events is a tool for understanding evolutionary genomics, in whose context many rearrangement distances have been proposed, based on finding the minimum number of rearrangements to transform one genome into another, using some predefined operation. However, when more than two genomes are considered, we have new challenging problems. Studying such problems from a combinatorial point of view has been shown to be a useful tool to approach such problems, for example, the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. We focus on genome rearrangement problems related to graph convexity. Such an approach is in connection with some other well-known studies on multigenomic models, for example, those based on the median and on the closest string. We propose an association between graph convexities and genome rearrangements in such a way that graph convexity problems deal with input sets of vertices and try to answer questions concerning the closure of such inputs. The concept of closure is useful for studies on genome rearrangement by suggesting mechanisms to reduce the genomic search space. Regarding the computational complexity, and considering the Hamming distance on strings, we solve the following problems: decide if a given set is convex; compute the interval and the convex hull of a given set; and determine the convexity number, interval number, and hull number of a Hamming graph. All such problems are solved for three types of convexities: geodetic, monophonic, and P-3. Considering the Cayley distance on permutations, we solve the convexity number and interval determination problems for the geodetic convexity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"Bioinformatics-based prediction of protease substrates can help to elucidate regulatory proteolytic pathways that control a broad range of biological processes such as apoptosis and blood coagulation. The majority of published predictive models are position weight matrices (PWM) reflecting specificity of proteases toward target sequence. These models are typically derived from experimental data on positions of hydrolyzed peptide bonds and show a reasonable predictive power. New emerging techniques that not only register the cleavage position but also measure catalytic efficiency of proteolysis are expected to improve the quality of predictions or at least substantially reduce the number of tested substrates required for confident predictions. The main goal of this study was to develop new prediction models based on such data and to estimate the performance of the constructed models. We used data on catalytic efficiency of proteolysis measured for eight major human matrix metalloproteinases to construct predictive models of protease specificity using a variety of regression analysis techniques. The obtained results suggest that efficiency-based (quantitative) models show a comparable performance with conventional PWM-based algorithms, while less training data are required. The derived list of candidate cleavage sites in human secreted proteins may serve as a starting point for experimental analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
