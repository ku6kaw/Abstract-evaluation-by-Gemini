0,"Modular allosteric aptamers with discrete recognition and signaling regions provide a facile method of carrying out label-free detection by forgoing complex target labeling requirements. Herein, we describe the design and function of an aptamer scaffold capable of forming a hairpin loop in the presence of FAD (the signaling trigger). The aptamer includes a recognition region for the microRNA (miR) Let-7i. Upon selective miR hybridization, the aptamer undergoes a conformational shift to release FAD and thus produce a measurable response. As a result, the described method can sensitively and selectively detect miR Let-7i with a wide linear range of 0.1 pM to 1 mu M and a detection limit of 150 fM. Additionally, this strategy was able to selectively discriminate between sequences with 1- and 2-nucleotide (nt) differences.",no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,
1,"Hordeum vulgare and Hordeum bulbosum are two closely related barley species, which share a common H genome. H. vulgare has two nucleolar organizer regions (NORs), while the NOR of IL bulbosum is only one. We sequenced the 2.5 kb 25S-18S region in the rDNA of H. bulbosum and compared it to the same region in H. vulgare as well as to the other Triticeae. The region includes an intergenic spacer (IGS) with a number of subrepeats, a promoter, and an external transcribed spacer (5'ETS). The IGS of H. bulbosum downstream of 25S rRNA contains two 143-bp repeats and six 128-bp repeats. In contrast, the IGS in H. vulgare contains an array of seven 79-bp repeats and a varying number of 135-bp repeats. The 135-bp repeats in H. vulgare and the 128-bp repeats in H. bulbosum show similarity. Compared to H. vulgare, the 5'ETS of H. bulbosum is shorter. Additionally, the 5'ETS regions in H. bulbosum and H. vulgare diverged faster than in other Triticeae genera. Alignment of the Triticeae promoter sequences suggests that in Hordeum, as in diploid Triticum, transcription starts with guanine and not with adenine as it is in many other plants.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,,
2,"In this paper, we suggest a new computational technique for the minimization of Hylleraas' functional with additional orthogonality restrictions imposed on the desired vectors. It is shown how Hylleraas' constrained problem can be reduced to an unconstrained one by minimal computational efforts. The asymptotic projection (AP) method proposed earlier to minimize Rayleigh's quotient subject to some orthogonality restrictions is applied to construct a modified Hylleraas' functional whose solution fulfills the required constraints automatically. Specifically, equivalence between the original problem and the one for the modified Hamilton operator is derived. It is shown that the AP methodology allows additional restrictions to be treated in a unified approach for both Rayleigh's quotient and Hylleraas' functional. Specific features of the method are demonstrated on the electronic parallel polarizability of H-2(+). Some emphasis is put on the choice of specific distributed basis set adapted for polarizability computation.

3,"A new framework for B-1 insensitive adiabatic pulse design is proposed, denoted Spin Lock Adiabatic Correction (SLAC), which counteracts deviations from ideal behaviour through inclusion of an additional correction component during pulse design. SLAC pulses are theoretically derived, then applied to the design of enhanced BIR-4 and hyperbolic secant pulses to demonstrate practical utility of the new pulses. At 7T, SLAC pulses are shown to improve the flip angle homogeneity compared to a standard adiabatic pulse with validation in both simulations and phantom experiments, under SAR equivalent experimental conditions. The SLAC framework can be applied to any arbitrary adiabatic pulse to deliver excitation with increased B-1 insensitivity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Sensitive and accurate detection of FAs is of great importance. In the present study, a pre-column derivatization and online mass spectrometry-based qualitative and quantitative analysis of FAs was developed. Nineteen main FAs were derivatized by 2-(7-methyl-1H-pyrazolo-[3,4-b]quinoline-1-yl)ethyl-4-methyl benzenesulfonate (NMP) and separated on reversed-phase Hypersil BDS C8 column with gradient elution. All FAs showed excellent linear responses with correlation coefficients more than 0.9996. The method obtained LOQs between 0.93 ng/mL and 5.64 ng/mL. FA derivatives were identified by both retention time and protonated molecular ion corresponding to m/z [M + H](+). A comparative study based on FA contents in peel and pulp, seeds and leaves of Nitraria tangutourum Bobr (NTB) from different geographical origins was performed with the established method.

5,"Moraea pallida Bak. (yellow tulp) poisoning is the most important plant cardiac glycoside toxicosis in South Africa. The toxic principle, a bufadienolide, is 1 alpha, 2 alpha-epoxyscillirosidine. The aim was to investigate the potential to develop a vaccine against epoxyscillirosidine. Epoxyscillirosidine, proscillaridin and bufalin, were successfully conjugated to hen ovalbumin (OVA), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). There was a low immune response following vaccination of adult male New Zealand White rabbits with epoxyscillirosidine-OVA (n = 3) and OVA (n = 3) using Freund's adjuvant in Trial (T) 1. The immune response improved significantly in T2 following doubling of the dose to 0.8 mg/rabbit and changing the adjuvant to Montanide. In T3, the rabbits (n = 15), allocated into 5 equal groups, vaccinated with proscillaridin-BSA, bufalin-BSA, epoxyscillirosidine-KLH, epoxyscillirosidine-BSA and BSA respectively, using Montanide adjuvant, developed antibodies against the administered immunogens, with epoxyscillirosidine-KLH inducing the highest immune response. Proscillaridin and bufalin antibodies cross-reacted with epoxyscillirosidine in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The conjugation methodology will be adjusted in the future to target optimal conjugation efficiency.

6,"Presented here is the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Mass Calculator, a software tool that provides both a relative molecular mass (M-r) value and an associated uncertainty value for a given protein sequence. The calculation of a protein M-r based on its amino acid residue sequence is performed by many software applications. Unfortunately, many of the results do not agree with each other. Reasons for this lack of consensus may include the use of rounded values, calculation errors, or alternative calculation methods, and it is often not possible to distinguish the source of the differences. Additionally, the result is provided without an estimate of precision. This would imply that the M-r is perfectly known when in fact it is not because the basis for the calculation, either the relative atomic masses or the standard atomic weights, are themselves provided as estimates. Until the release of the NIST Mass Calculator, there were no applications available to provide both an M-r value and an associated uncertainty value.

7,"A putative copper ion-sensing transcriptional regulator CopR (TON_0836) from Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 was characterized. The CopR protein consists of a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain in the amino-terminal region and a TRASH domain that is assumed to be involved in metal ion-sensing in the carboxyl-terminal region. The CopR protein was most strongly bound to a region between its own gene promoter and a counter directional promoter region for copper efflux system CopA. When the divalent metals such as nickel, cobalt, copper, and iron were present, the CopR protein was dissociated from the target promoters on electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The highest sensible ion is copper which affected protein releasing under 10 mu M concentrations. CopR recognizes a significant upstream region of TATA box on CopR own promoter and acts as a transcriptional repressor in an in vitro transcription assay. Through site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA-binding domain, R34M mutant protein completely lost the DNA-binding activity on target promoter. When the conserved cysteine residues in C144XXC147 motif 1 of the TRASH domain were mutated into glycine, the double cysteine residue mutant protein alone lost the copper-binding activity. Therefore, CopR is a copper-sensing transcriptional regulator and acts as a repressor for autoregulation and for a putative copper efflux system CopA of T. onnurineus NA1.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,

We aim to compare fat-soluble nutrient status of newly diagnosed non-screened infants with CF to that of healthy infants, and explore the association with neurodevelopment evaluated by electroencephalography (EEG). Our results show that CF infants had lower levels of all fat-soluble vitamins and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared to controls. The auditory evoked potential responses were higher in CF compared to controls whereas the visual components did not differ between groups.

Our method is to record the series of absorption images by using different exposure time of the camera, transform each image into the frequency domain to remove the low frequency, and then superimpose each filtered spatial frequency signal and inverse Fourier transform back into the air domain, and the transformed image is normalized to obtain a high dynamic image. The high dynamic absorption projection image is obtained at each projection angle, and then reconstructed by a filtered back projection algorithm to obtain highly dynamic three-dimensional structure information.

10,"Isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) is the most common pituitary hormone deficiency and can result from congenital or acquired causes. Among the known factors, genetic mutations in human growth hormone (hGH) remain the most frequent cause of IGHD, which influence the binding of hGH to its cognate receptor (hGHbp). Although previous studies have systematically investigated the residue importance at hGH-hGHbp complex interface, the molecular role of IGHD-associated residue mutations in the complex function still remains largely unexplored. Here, a total of 21 known hGH naturally-occurring missence mutations that have been clinically observed to be involved in IGHD disorder are collected and confirmed by original literature; they effects on the conformation, energetics and dynamics of hGH-hGHbp recognition and interaction are dissected at molecular level by using atomistic dynamics simulations, binding energy calculations and fluorescence spectroscopy assays. A systematic profile of hGH-hGHbp binding response to these clinical missence mutations is created, based on which it is revealed that (i) most mutations have appreciably unfavorable effect on the binding, which potentially destabilize the complex interaction, while only very few are predicted as moderate stabilizers for the complex system, and (ii) these disease-related mutations can locate either at complex interface or in hGH protein interior far away from the interface; both can influence the complex binding through either direct interaction or indirect allostericity. Two mutations, ElOOK (non-interface) and G146R (interface), are identified to address potent destabilization effect on hGH-hGHbp complex system; they can reduce the complex binding affinity by 8-fold (K-d changes from 0.76 to 5.9 nM) and 46-fold (K-d changes from 0.76 to 34.7 nM), respectively.

We documented this knowledge to prevent its loss under the Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol. We conducted bibliographic research and identified quercetrin as a significant bioactive molecule. We studied its in silico biological activity. The selected methodology was virtual docking experiments with the proteins responsible for the venomous action of snakes. The molecular structures of quercetrin and 21 selected toxins underwent corresponding tests with SwissDock and Chimera software. The results point to support its antiophidic use. They show reasonable geometries and a binding free energy of -7 to -10.03 kcal/mol. The most favorable values were obtained for the venom of the Asian snake Naja atra (5Z2G, -10.03 kcal/mol).

12,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized biological research by generating genomic data that were once unaffordable by traditional first-generation sequencing technologies. These sequencing methodologies provide an opportunity for in-depth analyses of host and pathogen genomes as they are able to sequence millions of templates at a time. However, these large datasets can only be efficiently explored using bioinformatics analyses requiring huge data storage and computational resources adapted for high-performance processing. High-performance computing allows for efficient handling of large data and tasks that may require multi-threading and prolonged computational times, which is not feasible with ordinary computers. However, high-performance computing resources are costly and therefore not always readily available in low-income settings. We describe the establishment of an affordable high-performance computing bioinformatics cluster consisting of 3 nodes, constructed using ordinary desktop computers and open-source software including Linux Fedora, SLURM Workload Manager, and the Conda package manager. For the analysis of large antibody sequence datasets and for complex viral phylodynamic analyses, the cluster out-performed desktop computers.

13,"The protein sequence-structure gap results from the contrast between rapid, low-cost deep sequencing, and slow, expensive experimental structure determination techniques. Comparative homology modelling may have the potential to close this gap by predicting protein structure in target sequences using existing experimentally solved structures as templates. This paper presents the first use of force-directed graphs for the visualization of sequence space in two dimensions, and applies them to the choice of suitable RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) target-template pairs within human-infective RNA virus genera. Measures of centrality in protein sequence space for each genus were also derived and used to identify centroid nearest-neighbour sequences (CNNs) potentially useful for production of homology models most representative of their genera. Homology modelling was then carried out for target template pairs in different species, different genera and different families, and model quality assessed using several metrics. Reconstructed ancestral RdRP sequences for individual genera were also used as templates for the production of ancestral RdRP homology models. High quality ancestral RdRP models were consistently produced, as were good quality models for target-template pairs in the same genus. Homology modelling between genera in the same family produced mixed results and inter-family modelling was unreliable. We present a protocol for the production of optimal RdRP homology models for use in further experiments, e.g. docking to discover novel anti-viral compounds. (219 words) (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

14,"Understanding the physical arrangement of subunits within protein complexes potentially provides valuable clues about how the subunits work together and how the complexes function. The majority of recent research focuses on identifying protein complexes as a whole and seldom studies the inner structures within complexes. In this study, we propose a computational framework to predict direct contacts and substructures within protein complexes. In this framework, we first train a supervised learning model of l(2)-regularized logistic regression to learn the patterns of direct and indirect interactions within complexes, from where physical subunit interaction networks are predicted. Then, to infer substructures within complexes, we apply a graph clustering method (i.e., maximum modularity clustering (MMC)) and a gene ontology (GO) semantic similarity based functional clustering on partially- and fully-connected networks, respectively.

15,"If the A-form helix is the major structural motif found in RNA, the loops that cap them constitute the second most important family of motifs. Among those, two are overrepresented, GNRA and UNCG tetraloops. Recent surveys of RNA structures deposited in the PDB show that GNRA and UNCG tetraloops can adopt tertiary folds that are very different from their canonical conformations, characterized by the presence of a U-turn of a Z-turn, respectively. Crystallographic data from both a lariat-capping (LC) ribozyme and a group II intron ribozyme reveal that a given UUCG tetraloop can adopt a distinct fold depending on its structural environment. Specifically, when the crystal packing applies relaxed constraints on the loop, the canonical Z-turn conformation is observed. In contrast, a highly packed environment induces ""squashing"" of the tetraloop by distorting its sugar-phosphate backbone in a specific way that expels the first and fourth nucleobases out of the loop, and falls in van der Waals distance of the last base pair of the helix, taking the place of the pair formed between the first and fourth residues in Z-turn loops. The biological relevance of our observations is supported by the presence of similarly deformed loops in the highly packed environment of the ribosome and in a complex between a dsRNA and a RNase III. The finding that Z-turn loops change conformation under higher molecular packing suggests that, in addition to their demonstrated role in stabilizing RNA folding, they may contribute to the three-dimensional structure of RNA by mediating tertiary interactions with distal residues.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

This gives rise to social epistemic risks; risks that involve the collective and social aspects of the formation of epistemic attitudes. Steering these epistemic attitudes as a way of handling these risks can take the form of creating what we call 'epistemic architecture'.

18,"Standard secondary structure elements such as alpha-helices or beta-sheets, are characterized by repeating backbone torsion angles (phi,psi) at the single residue level. Two-residue motifs of the type (phi,psi)(2) are also observed in nonlinear conformations, mainly turns. Taking these observations a step further, it can be argued that there is no a priori reason why the presence of higher order periodicities can not be envisioned in protein structures, such as, for example, periodic transitions between successive residues of the type ( horizontal ellipsis -alpha-beta-alpha-beta-alpha- horizontal ellipsis ), or ( horizontal ellipsis -beta-alpha(L)-beta-alpha(L)-beta- horizontal ellipsis ), or ( horizontal ellipsis -alpha-beta-alpha(L)-alpha-beta-alpha(L)- horizontal ellipsis ), and so forth, where the symbols (alpha,beta,alpha(L)) refer to the established Ramachandran-based residue conformations. From all such possible higher order periodicities, here we examine the deposited (with the PDB) protein structures for the presence of short-range periodical conformations comprising five consecutive residues alternating between two (and only two) distinct Ramachandran regions, for example, conformations of the type (alpha-beta-alpha-beta-alpha) or (beta-alpha(L)-beta-alpha(L)-beta), and so forth.

20,"This work presents a compact statistical model of the retinal image quality in a large population of human eyes following two objectives. The first was to develop a general modal representation of the optical transfer function (OTF) in terms of orthogonal functions and construct a basis composed of cross-correlations between pairs of complex Zernike polynomials. That basis was not orthogonal and highly redundant, requiring the application of singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain an orthogonal basis with a significantly lower dimensionality. The first mode is the OTF of the perfect system, and hence the modal representation, is highly compact for well-corrected optical systems, and vice-versa. The second objective is to apply this modal representation to the OTFs of a large population of human eyes for a pupil diameter of 5 mm. This permits an initial strong data compression. Next, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to obtain further data compression, leading to a compact statistical model of the initial population. In this model each OTF is approximated by the sum of the population mean plus a linear combination of orthogonal eigenfunctions (eigen-OTF) accounting for a selected percentage (90%) of the population variance.

21,"When incipient species meet in secondary contact, natural selection can rapidly reduce costly reproductive interactions by directly targeting reproductive traits. This process, called reproductive character displacement (RCD), leaves a characteristic pattern of geographic variation where divergence of traits between species is greater in sympatry than allopatry. However, because other forces can also cause similar patterns, care must be given in separating pattern from process. Here we show how the phylo-comparative method together with genomic data can be used to evaluate evolutionary processes at the population level in closely related species. Using this framework, we WA the role of RCD in speciation of two cricket species endemic to Anatolian mountains by quantifying patterns of character displacement, rates of evolution and adaptive divergence. Our results show differing patterns of character displacement between species for reproductive vs. non-reproductive characters and strong patterns of asymmetric divergence. We demonstrate diversification results from rapid divergence of reproductive traits towards multiple optima under the dual influence of strong drift and selection.

22,"The reaction of silica with various cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by water electrolysis was investigated as a means of preventing the formation of silica scales in geothermal binary power generation. Through batch and continuous experiments, it was found that all silica in the cathode phase of a reaction device could be removed if the necessary amounts of magnesium and calcium were present. This occurs because a silica-magnesium-calcium compound is produced via a polymerization reaction with cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by electrolysis. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows that this material has the formula 2CaO-5MgO-8SiO(2)-H2O, and thus is likely generated by the reaction proposed by Sheikholeslami et al. (2019). Increasing the current sent through the reaction solution subsequently produces calcium carbonate. This technique for the separation of silica and calcium from aqueous solutions can be operated continuously without channel clogging, which indicates the possibility of practical applications. However, overly high currents promote the migration of protons from the anode to cathode phases, which inhibits the formation of precipitates due to a neutralization reaction.

23,"A simple, accessible, and inexpensive assay to quantify the strength of DNA-protein interactions was developed. The assay relies on capturing DNA-protein complexes using an affinity resin that binds tagged, recombinant proteins. Sequential washes with filtration spin cups and centrifugation remove non-specific interactions in a gentle, uniform manner and a final elution isolates specific DNA-protein complexes. SYBR Gold nucleic acid stain is added to the eluted product and the fluorescence intensity accurately quantifies the amount of captured DNA, ultimately illustrating the relative strength of the DNA-protein interaction. The major utility of the assay resides in the versatility and quantitative nature of the SYBR Gold:nucleic acid interaction, eliminating the need for customized or labeled oligos and permitting relatively inexpensive quantification of binding capacity. The assay also employs DNA-protein complex capture by the very common purification tag, 6xHis, but other tags could likely be utilized. Further, SYBR Gold fluorescence is compatible with a wide variety of instruments, including UV transilluminators, a staple to any molecular biology laboratory. This assay was used to compare the binding capacities of different auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors to various dsDNA targets, including the classical AuxRE motif and several divergent sequences. Results from dose-response assays suggest that different ARF proteins might show distinct comparative affinities for AuxRE variants, emphasizing that specific ARF-AuxRE binding strengths likely contribute to the complex and fine-tuned cellular auxin response.

To generate mutants with a desired composition of amino acids (AAs), a codon consisting of a mixture of nucleotides is widely applied. Several computational methods have been proposed to calculate a codon nucleotide composition for generating a given amino acid profile based on mathematical optimization. However, these previous methods need to manually tune weights of amino acids in objective functions, which are time-consuming and, more importantly, lack publicly available software implementations. Here, we develop CodonAdjust, a software to adjust a codon nucleotide composition for mimicking a given amino acid profile. We propose different options of CodonAdjust, which provide various customizations in practical scenarios such as setting a guaranteeing threshold for the frequencies of amino acids without any manual tasks. We demonstrate the capability of CodonAdjust in the experiments on the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies and T-cell receptors (TCRs) as well as millions of amino acid profiles from Pfam.

27,"A pulsed element is proposed allowing the selective inversion of a single H-1 nucleus, without regard to the presence of other degenerate H-1 nuclei, provided that it is coupled to a heteronuclear spin with adequate chemical shift resolution in a 2D heteronuclear correlation spectrum. The approach is based on selective cross polarization, in which matched weak RF fields of specific amplitude are applied on resonance to the targeted H-1-X spin pair. It is shown theoretically that when the RF field amplitudes are set to specific values (ie. at a magic field), transfer of coherence can be fruitfully achieved transverse to the applied RF fields in addition to the normal longitudinal transfers. This enables the construction of a pulsed element which has the characteristics of a BIRDr,X element (Uhrin et al., 1993), yet with 2D frequency selectivity.

However, in order to achieve pMMO-based continuous methane-to-methanol bioconversion, the problems of reducing power in vitro regeneration and pMMO stability need to be overcome. Methanobactin (Mb) is a small copper-chelating molecule that functions not only as electron carrier for pMMO catalysis and pMMO protector against oxygen radicals, but also as an agent for copper acquisition and uptake. In order to improve the activity and stability of pMMO, methanobactin-Cu (Mb-Cu)-modified gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-pMMO nanobiohybrids were straightforwardly synthesized via in situ reduction of HAuCl4 to AuNPs in a membrane fraction before further association with Mb-Cu. Mb-Cu modification can greatly improve the activity and stability of pMMO in the AuNP-pMMO nanobiohybrids. It is shown that the Mb-Cu-modified AuNP-pMMO nanobiohybrids can persistently catalyze the conversion of methane to methanol with hydroquinone as electron donor. The artificial heterogeneous nanobiohybrids exhibited excellent reusability and reproducibility in three cycles of catalysis, and they provide a model for achieving hydroquinone-driven conversion of methane to methanol.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Therefore, it is important to understand which metabolic processes are affected by which cellular impairment. Because genome-wide screening of mutant collections (haploid/diploid deletion library) provides important clues for the understanding of conserved biological processes and for finding potential target genes, we screened the haploid mutant collection of Schizosaccharomyces pombe with wortmannin that inhibits phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling. Using genome-wide screening, we determined that 52 mutants were resistant to this chemical. When 52 genes that are deleted in these mutants were grouped in 41 different biological processes, we found that 37 of them have human orthologues and 4 genes were associated with human metabolic disorders.

T33, T38 and T43 groups showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity compared to the other groups, whereas lowest activity was recorded in the group fed with highest inclusion level (58%).

Identifying avenues for overcoming the challenges associated with using virions as screening reagents is paramount given the difficulties associated with obtaining high-purity virus-associated proteins that retain the conformation exhibited on the virion surface. Results Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of 1.5 x 10(7) clones taken from a naive yeast surface-displayed human fibronectin domain (Fn3) against whole virions yielded two unique binders to Zika virions. Construction and FACS of site-directed binding loop mutant libraries based on one of these binders yielded multiple progeny clones with enhanced Zika-binding affinities. These affinity-matured clones bound Zika virions with low double- or single-digit nanomolar affinity in ELISA assays, and expressed well as soluble proteins in E. coli shake flask culture, with post-purification yields exceeding 10 mg/L. Conclusions FACS of a yeast-displayed binding domain library is an efficient method for de novo isolation of virion-binding domains. Affinities of isolated virion-binding clones are readily enhanced via FACS screening of mutant progeny libraries.

The field as a whole highlights both the conserved aspects of meiosis, as well as the marked diversity of the means taken to ensure that, ultimately, gametes will contain a balanced number of chromosomes and genetic diversity will have been produced. Studying meiosis is also critically important for the improvement of our human condition as errors of meiosis are a leading cause of infertility, miscarriage, and developmental disabilities. Finally, the complex chromosome behavior of meiosis is a genetically tractable paradigm, the study of which improves our understanding of many fundamental cellular processes including DNA repair, genome stability, cancer etiology, chromatin structure, and chromosome dynamics. This special issue on meiosis contains twenty-two papers, of which five are in-depth reviews that complement and put in context the experimental data presented in the seventeen original research articles. The content of this issue illustrates the diversity of topics covered by researchers in the field, ranging from the effects of environment and external factors on the success of meiosis, the cell cycle actors that control the meiotic divisions, the mechanism of chromosome segregation, and the mechanisms that ensure proper homologous chromosome pairing, recombination, and synapsis. Multiple organisms are covered. Also evident is the fact that more and more studies use multicellular organisms as a model system, in large part due to the increased availability of tools that were previously restricted to studies in budding and fission yeasts.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,
50,"Linear dichroism (LD), UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to investigate the interaction of the ?- and ?-enantiomers of the two complexes of [Ru(phen)(2) 2-phenylimidazophenanthroline](+2) (referred to as B-complex) and [Ru(phen)(2) 2-(1-pyrenyl)limidazophenanthroline](+2) (named as P-complex), with ct-DNA. Absorption titration experiments of the enantiomers showed significant hypochromism with red shift indicating a strong perturbation of the DNA on the intra-ligand (IL) and the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions of the complexes, and fluorescence titration curves indicate strong binding. LD spectra for the B-enantiomers bound to DNA were qualitatively similar to spectra for the well-studied intercalator [Ru(phen)(2)dppz](+2), indicating intercalation of the phenyl-imidazophenanthroline part of the complex. However, for ?-P, the LD-spectrum resembled ?-B, and ?-P resembled ?-B, indicating a mirror image relationship of the transition moment directions relative to the helix axis when going from B to P. For interpretation of the data, and clarifying the nature of the binding mode of the P-complexes, a model was proposed based on the crystal structure previously presented by the Cardin group. The reversed LD is suggested to be due to partial intercalation of the pyrene moiety, pushing the Ru(phen)(2)-moiety out from the opposite groove and allowing it to rotate anticlockwise around the pyrene-imidazole bond.

Results indicated that income increased with both increasing sunshine hours and apparent temperature, but with an interaction effect (negative coefficient) between sunlight and apparent temperature such that the effect of sunlight on income is positive at lower apparent temperatures and negative at higher apparent temperatures.

52,"The potential of the frequently encountered (beta alpha)(8)-barrel fold to acquire new functions was tested by an approach combining random mutagenesis and selection in vivo. For this purpose, the genes encoding 52 different phosphate-binding (beta alpha)(8)-barrel proteins were subjected to error-prone PCR and cloned into an expression plasmid. The resulting mixed repertoire was used to transform different auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains, each lacking an enzyme with a phosphate-containing substrate. After plating of the different transformants on minimal medium, growth was observed only for two strains, lacking either the gene for the serine phosphatase SerB or the phosphoserine aminotransferase SerC. The same mutants of the E. coli genes nanE (encoding a putative N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase) and pdxJ (encoding the pyridoxine 5'-phosphate synthase) were responsible for rescuing both Delta serB and Delta serC. Unexpectedly, the complementing NanE and PdxJ variants did not catalyze the SerB or SerC reactions in vitro. Instead, RT-qPCR, RNAseq, and transcriptome analysis showed that they rescue the deletions by enlisting the help of endogenous E. coli enzymes HisB and HisC through exclusive up-regulation of histidine operon transcription. While the promiscuous SerB activity of HisB is well-established, our data indicate that HisC is promiscuous for the SerC reaction, as well. The successful rescue of Delta serB and Delta serC through point mutations and recruitment of additional amino acids in NanE and PdxJ provides another example for the adaptability of the (beta alpha)(8)-barrel fold.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,
53,"Oxyfluorfen (2-chloro-1-(3-ethoxy-4-nitrophenoxy)-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene) is a nitrophenyl ether herbicide. Phytocystatins are crucial plant proteins which regulate various physiological processes and are also responsible for maintaining protease-antiprotease balance within plants. Thus, the present article deciphers the interaction of oxyfluorfen with garlic phytocystatin (GPC) through various spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques. The cysteine proteinase inhibitory assay was done to assess the inhibitory action of GPC in the presence of oxyfluorfen. The GPC loses its inhibitory activity in the presence of oxyfluorfen. The complex formation of GPC-oxyfluorfen was shown by UV absorption spectroscopy. The intrinsic fluorescence experiment affirmed the quenching of GPC in the presence of oxyfluorfen. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant and binding constant was obtained as 6.89 x 10(3) M-1 and 9.72 x 10(3) M-1, respectively. Synchronous fluorescence showed the alteration in the microenvironment around tyrosine residues. 3D fluorescence suggested the perturbation in the polarity around aromatic residues. The isothermal titration experiment suggests that the interaction of oxyfluorfen with GPC is a thermodynamically favorable reaction. Secondary structure alteration of GPC in the presence of oxyfluorfen was studied by circular dichroism (CD). The CD result showed a reduction in the alpha-helical content of GPC on interaction with oxyfluorfen. Consequently, all these outcomes affirmed the formation of GPC-oxyfluorfen complex along with the structural and conformational alteration. This study identifies and signifies that the exposure of oxyfluorfen induces stress within the plant system. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

54,"As transthyretin (TTR) can prevent A? aggregation, a key protein in Alzheimer disease (AD), we developed a novel nanovector based on single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) functionalized by TTR. The retention factors (k) of the binding of grafted TTR on SWCNT (abbreviated gTTR) to HSPG were determined using an immobilized HSPG stationary phase. The negative values of the thermodynamic data demonstrated that van der Waals and hydrogen bonds played a major role in the binding at all pHs value. This binding was maximal at acidic conditions due to ionic interactions between the protonated His of gTTR with the negatively charged sulfate groups of HSPG. The weaker binding to HSPG for gTTR (k?=?3.70 at pH = 4.00 and 37??C) than free TTR (abbreviated fTTR) (k?=?11.80 at pH = 4.00 and 37??C) observed at acidic pHs was explained by the least facility of the His residue to be protonated when TTR was grafted on carbon nanotube. The nanovectorization of TTR with SWCNT thus stabilized the TTR tetramer structure and decreased the amyloid formation of TTR. Fibril formation of fTTR and gTTR studied by turbidity confirmed the fact that immobilization of TTR on SWCNTs decreased the extent and rate of amyloid fibril formation relative to free TTR.",yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,,

Real-time specimen temperature detection has not yet been integrated into total laboratory automation (TLA) solutions. An infrared (IR) pyrometer was paired with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) laser sensor and connected to an embedded networked personal computer (PC) to create a modular temperature detection unit for closed, moving clinical laboratory specimens. Accuracy of the detector was assessed by comparing temperature measurements to those obtained from thermocouples connected to battery-operated data loggers. The temperature detector was then installed on a pre-analytic laboratory automation system to assess specimen temperature before and after processing on an integrated thawing and mixing (T/M) robotic workcell. The IR temperature detector was able to accurately record temperature of closed, moving specimens on a pre-analytic automation system. The effectiveness of the T/M workcell was independently verified using the temperature detector. Specimen reroute on the pre-analytic automation track was identified as a potential risk for frozen specimens being inadvertently delivered to future, connected instrumentation.

A LC-MS workflow was therefore applied to investigate the integrity of this large HA-SS-np vaccine molecule (approximate to 1 MDa). Application of LC-MS was critical to rationalize the conflicting results from the rCGE and SEC assays and led to the discovery that (1) an unexpected sequence clipping in the HA-SS-np subunits occurred, explaining the atypical reducing gel profile, and (2) an undisrupted disulfide bond held the two fragments together, explaining the unchanged SEC profile.

As the follow-on step, this study was designed to probe into the downstream signaling pathway of CNP/PLC beta. The results showed that level of alpha-type protein kinase C (PKC alpha),cell membrane to cytoplasm ratio of PKC alpha, cell membrane to cytoplasmic ratio of beta I-type protein kinase C (PKC beta I) and level of Phosphor-PKC alpha (P-PKC alpha) were significantly reduced in diabetes rat antral smooth muscle samples. The content of tetraphosphate inositol (IP4) in gastric antral smooth muscle of diabetic rats reduced, and the content of diacyl-glycerol (DG) was unchanged. CNP significantly decreased the content of IP4 and DG, this effect was more obvious in diabetic rats.

With the addition of the combination of H-89 and KT5823 before CNP treatment, the inhibition by CNP could be offset.

60,"A highly sensitive and simple high-performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS-MS) assay was developed and validated for the quantification of N-acetyl tryptophan (NAT) in formulations and to identify impurities under different stress conditions. N-acetyl tryptophan was analyzed using a reversed-phase gradient elution after treatment under acidic, basic, oxidative, hydrolytic and thermal stress conditions. Linearity in the calibration curve was obtained at a concentration range of 10-100 mu gmL(-1) (R-2 = 0.9916). The lower limits of detection and quantification were 3.53 and 10.69 mu gmL(-1). The degradation of NAT was observed maximum under oxidation stress (52.84%) and minimum under thermal stress (10.22%). Three major degradation products were formed under acidic and basic stress conditions, of which tryptophan was the major one. Thermal stress yielded a single major impurity at m/z 230. Water hydrolysis could form dihydroxy-N acetyl tryptophan at m/z 279. Oxidation stress led to the formation of seven major degradation products. The most effective stress condition was found to be oxidative which leads to 52.84% degradation of the drug followed by acidic stress (34.64%) and basic stress (15.66%).

Therefore, the present investigation was led on 267 Egyptian participants, involving 177 patients with HCV of which 90 patients had HCC (HCC group), 87 patients without HCC (non-HCC group), and 90 unrelated healthy controls. The association between rs2221903A/G and rs2055979G/T of the IL-21 gene and the risk of HCC and metastasis, as well as the clinico-pathological features, were analyzed.

65,"It becomes increasingly clear that ubiquitination of cellular proteins is not an indispensable prerequisite of their degradation in proteasomes. There are a number of proteins to be eliminated which are not pre-ubiquitinated for their recognition by the regulatory subcomplex of the 26S proteasome, but which directly interact with the 20S proteasome core particle (20S proteasome). The obligatory precondition for such interaction consists in existence of disordered (hydrophobic) fragments in the target protein. In this study we have investigated the interaction of a number of multifunctional (moonlighting) proteins (glyceral-dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), aldolase, pyruvate kinase) and neurodegeneration-related proteins (alpha-synuclein, myelin basic protein) with 20S proteasome immobilized on the SPR-biosensor chip and stabilized by means of a bifunctional agent dimethyl pimelimidate (in order to prevent possible dissociation of this subcomplex). Only two of the investigated proteins (aldolase and pyruvate kinase) interacted with the immobilized 20S proteasome (K-d of 8.17 x 10(-7) M and 5.56 x 10(-7) M, respectively). In addition to earlier detected GAPDH ubiquitination, mass spectrometric analysis of the studied proteins revealed the presence of the ubiquitin signature (Lys-epsilon-Gly-Gly) only in aldolase. Oxidation of aldolase and pyruvate kinase, which promotes elimination of proteins via their direct interaction with 20S proteasome, caused a 2-3-fold decrease in their K-d values as compared with this parameter obtained for the intact proteins. The results of this study provide further evidence for direct interaction of both ubiquitinated proteins (aldolase), and non-ubiquitinated proteins (pyruvate kinase) with the 20S proteasome core particle (20S proteasome).

69,"The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu mediates the downregulation of several host cell proteins, an activity that is critical for viral replication in vivo. As the first step in directing cell-surface proteins to internal cellular compartments, and in many cases degradation, Vpu binds a subset of its target proteins through their transmembrane domains. Each of the known targets of Vpu are synthesized in the ER, and must traverse the different membrane environments found along the secretory pathway, thus it is important to consider how membrane composition might influence the interactions between Vpu and its targets. We have used Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the oligomerization of Vpu with the transmembrane domains of target proteins in model membranes of varying lipid composition. Our data show that both lipid bilayer thickness and acyl chain order can significantly influence monomer-oligomer equilibria within the Vpu-target system. Changes in oligomerization levels were found to be non-specific with no single Vpu-target interaction being favored under any condition.

Here we describe the design and construction of a rotating operant chamber with microdialysis capability. We modified a rotating cage by adding operant behavior testing components to the side of the bowl-shaped cage. A modular on-board controller facilitates operant component/computer communication. A battery provides power to the controller and the operant components. The battery and controller rotate with the cage, and the controller communicates with the computer wirelessly. Results: The rotating operant chamber can be used to train a rat to retrieve a sucrose pellet following a cue. Microdialysis and online liquid chromatography can be used to measure dopamine at one minute intervals while the rat moves freely and interacts with operant behavior testing components. Comparison with existing method(s): We are not aware of one-minute dopamine measurements in awake animals in an operant chamber. Conclusions: Rotating cage modifications are straightforward. One-minute observations of striatal dopamine can be accomplished while an animal is awake, moving, and interacting with its surroundings.",yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,,
72,"Adrenodoxin reductase, a widely conserved mitochondrial P450 protein, catalyses essential steps in steroid hormone biosynthesis and is highly expressed in the adrenal cortex. The yeast adrenodoxin reductase homolog, Arh1p, is involved in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial iron homeostasis and is required for activity of enzymes containing an Fe-S cluster. In this paper, we investigated the response of yeast to the loss of a single copy of ARH1, an oxidoreductase of the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is among the few mitochondrial proteins that is essential for viability in yeast. The phenotypic, transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolic landscape indicated that Saccharomyces cerevisiae successfully adapted to this loss, displaying an apparently dosage-insensitive cellular response. However, a considered investigation of transcriptional regulation in ARH1-impaired yeast highlighted that a significant hierarchical reorganisation occurred, involving the iron assimilation and tyrosine biosynthetic processes. The interconnected roles of the iron and tyrosine pathways, coupled with oxidative processes, are of interest beyond yeast since they are involved in dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease.

73,"Withdrawal of the growth factor interleukin-3 (IL-3) from IL-3-dependent myeloid cells causes them to undergo Bax/Bak1-dependent apoptosis, whereas factor-deprived Bax(-/-) Bak1(-/-) cells remain viable, but arrest and shrink. It was reported that withdrawal of IL-3 from Bax(-/- )Bak1(-/-) cells caused decreased expression of the glucose transporter Glut1, leading to reduced glucose uptake, so that arrested cells required Atg5-dependent autophagy for long-term survival. In other cell types, a decrease in Glutl is mediated by the thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), which is induced in IL-3-dependent myeloid cells when growth factor is removed. We mutated Atg5 and Txnip by CRISPR/Cas9 and found that Atg5-dependent autophagy was not necessary for the long-term viability of cycling or arrested Bax(-/-) Bak1(-/-) cells, and that Txnip was not required for the decrease in Glutl expression in response to IL-3 withdrawal. Surprisingly, Atg5-deficient Bax/Bak1 double mutant cells survived for several weeks in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), without high concentrations of added glucose or glutamine. When serum was withdrawn, the provision of an equivalent amount of glucose present in 10% FBS (similar to 0.5 mM) was sufficient to support cell survival for more than a week, in the presence or absence of IL-3. Thus, Bax(-/-) Bak1(-/-) myeloid cells deprived of growth factor consume extracellular glucose to maintain long-term viability, without a requirement for Atg5-dependent autophagy.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

77,"We present a new method to directly quantify the dynamics of differentiation of multiple cellular subsets in unperturbed mice. We combine a pulse-chase protocol of 5-iodo-2 '-deoxyuridine (IdU) injections with subsequent analysis by mass cytometry (CyTOF) and mathematical modeling of the IdU dynamics. Measurements by CyTOF allow for a wide range of cells to be analyzed at once, due to the availability of a large staining panel without the complication of fluorescence spillover. These are also compatible with direct detection of integrated iodine signal, with minimal impact on immunophenotyping based on the surface markers. Mathematical modeling beyond a binary classification of surface marker abundance allows for a continuum of cellular states as the cells transition from one state to another. Thus, we present a complete and robust method for directly quantifying differentiation at the systemic level, allowing for system-wide comparisons between different mouse strains and/or experimental conditions.

It is shown that a biological role of proofreading is played by a process that is exactly opposite to the step of factor-free binding of Aa-tRNA to the ribosome-exposed mRNA: a factor-free removal of that Aa-tRNA whose anticodon is not complementary to the ribosome-exhibited mRNA codon.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,
80,"3-Ketoacy ACP reducatase (FabG), the key enzyme for bacteria growth, catalyzes the first reduction step in fatty acid synthesis. Pseudomonas putida has important application values in environmental pollution bioremediation and industrial polyhydroxy fatty acid (PHA) production. Bioinformatics analysis showed Pseudomonas putida genome encodes six FabG homologues with E. coli FabG, of which PpFabG5 shows the highest sequence similarity (76.5%) and other five PpFabGs also have high similarity (about 50%). Except PpFabG4, the other homologs have the conserved catalytic activity sites and N-terminal cofactor binding sites. So the paper used different methods, including the genetic complementary, catalytic activity analysis in vitro, gene deletion in vivo, and mutant characteristic analysis, to study the biological functions of the six homologs. The results showed that only PpfabG1, PpfabG3 and PpfabG5 could restore the growth of E. coli fabG temperature-sensitive mutant CL104 at 42 degrees C, and the complementary strain of PpfabG1 grew weakly. While in vitro analysis, PpFabG1, PpFabG3 and PpFabG5 also showed the catalytic activities in the initial and extension reactions of fatty acid synthesis, although the activity of PpFabG1 was really weak. PpFabG6 only had catalytic activity in the initial reaction. PpfabG5 is an essential gene for growth, which can't be deleted in the genome. While the deletion of the other PpfabG individually does not affect bacteria growth or the compositions of fatty acids comparing with wild type strain. However, the motility of PpfabG1 or PpfabG3 deletion mutant decreased, PpfabG3 or PpfabG6 deletion affected the biofilm formation, and PpfabG3 or PpfabG6 deletion mutant showed higher tolerance to H2O2.

81,"A rapid and low-cost method of diagnosis is becoming important for detecting fetal inherited diseases, including single-gene disorders and chromosomal abnormalities. Here, we demonstrated an innovation that use paper-dried cord blood (PCB) as the starting material for PCR and whole genome amplification without any DNA extraction step at a very low cost. A novel PCR buffer named ""DDB buffer"" containing ammonium sulfate and glycerol were used instead of the conventional 10x PCR buffer. The amplicons were directly analyzed through microchip electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing. Inhibitory substances in filter paper were effectively inactivated using DDB buffer. Direct PCR amplification of DNA fragments ranging from 100 to 900 bp using filter paper spotted with 0.5 to 5 mu L of cord blood and various anticoagulants was successful. We were able to determine fetal single-gene disorders and chromosomal diseases in all 46 chromosomes using PCB samples successfully. Compared with prenatal diagnosis using purified DNA, the proposed method is simple, fast, less prone to cross-contamination at minimal cost. Researchers and clinical and healthcare workers may employ this method for genetic diagnosis using cord blood samples with minimum laboratory resources.

LPS increased malondialdehyde (MDA) level and decreased antioxidant enzymes' activities in rat erythrocytes and leukocytes. DNA damage of leukocytes with comet assay and RAPD-PCR was detected in LPS treatment group. The levels of micronucleus and apoptosis percentage were increased significantly at the end of 6 hr.

As a result, the co-administration of VE and/or SS against LPS-induced damage provides protection.

85,"Our previous work with fragment-assembly methods has demonstrated specific deficiencies in conformational sampling behaviour that, when addressed through improved sampling algorithms, can lead to more reliable prediction of tertiary protein structure when good fragments are available, and when score values can be relied upon to guide the search to the native basin. In this paper, we present preliminary investigations into two important questions arising from more difficult prediction problems. First, we investigated the extent to which native-like conformational states are generated during multiple runs of our search protocols. We determined that, in cases of difficult prediction, native-like decoys are rarely or never generated. Second, we developed a scheme for decoy retention that balances the objectives of retaining low-scoring structures and retaining conformationally diverse structures sampled during the course of the search. Our method succeeds at retaining more diverse sets of structures, and, for a few targets, more native-like solutions are retained as compared to our original, energy-based retention scheme. However, in general, we found that the rate at which native-like structural states are generated has a much stronger effect on eventual distributions of predictive accuracy in the decoy sets, as compared to the specific decoy retention strategy used. We found that our protocols show differences in their ability to access native-like states for some targets, and this may explain some of the differences in predictive performance seen between these methods. There appears to be an interaction between fragment sets and move operators, which influences the accessibility of native-like structures for given targets.

94,"In this study, we aimed to explore the time-course relating to the pathological progression of Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and to identify the early changes in gene expression. The raw microarray data of CTCL was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and a weighted gene coexpression network analysis was performed. A total of 2183 genes that positively correlated with the time course of CTCL development were identified in as part of the turquoise module as well as 1096 genes negatively correlated with the time course of CTCL development, which was identified in the blue module. To better understand the effects of these genes on prognosis, we further performed the Spearman correlation analysis, univariate Cox regression analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. We identified 10 differentially expressed genes whose expression was significantly associated with prognosis in patients with CTCL. Our findings can help our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of CTCL as well as the development of novel drugs.",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,,
95,"Asymmetric tubular ceramic-ceramic (cercer) membranes based on La27W3.5Mo1.5O55.5-delta-La0.87Sr0.13CrO3-delta were fabricated by a two-step firing method making use of water-based extrusion and dip-coating. The performance of the membranes was characterized by measuring the hydrogen permeation flux and water splitting with dry and wet sweep gases, respectively. To explore the limiting factors for hydrogen and oxygen transport in the asymmetric membrane architecture, the effect of different gas flows and switching the feed and sweep sides of the membrane on the apparent hydrogen permeability was investigated. A dusty gas model was used to simulate the gas gradient inside the porous support, which was combined with Wagner diffusion calculations of the dense membrane layer to assess the overall transport across the asymmetric membrane. In addition, the stability of the membrane was investigated by means of flux measurements over a period of 400 h.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,
96,"Background: Severe headaches, projectile vomiting, focal neurological deficits and early onset seizure are regarded as early warning symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Earlier diagnosis based on such warning symptoms theoretically would improve the clinical prognosis. However, it is still not clear whether the prognosis is correlated with early warning symptoms. Here, we reviewed warning symptoms and other predictive factors in the emergency room (ER) setting and examined their correlations with mortality. Methods: Ninety saccular aneurysmal SAH cases were reviewed in a single medical center between January 2011 and December 2013. We examined differences in mortality rate related to warning symptoms, SAH scales, onset-to-ER time, hydrocephalus, and aneurysm size, location, and complexity. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the correlations of warning symptoms and other predictive factors with mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate the area the under curve (AUC) of SAH mortality prediction tools. Results: Warning headache, projectile vomiting, the Hunt and Hess scale, Fisher scale, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grading scale, and modified WFNS (m-WFNS) scale, body mass index, aneurysm complexity and hydrocephalus were significantly different between the survivors and the decedents. The warning headache and WFNS grade were strongly correlated with mortality. The rate of prognostic prediction improved from 90.4% to 94.6% when warning headache was additionally evaluated. Conclusions: With growing healthcare costs and recognition of the value of palliative care, early identification via warning headache and a detailed clinical history review is necessary for cases of aSAH.",yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,
97,"The special structural unit on the brain's capillaries supplies oxygen and nutrients to the brain, while at the same time forming a restrictive barrier called blood-brain barrier (BBB). The structural unit is mainly composed of a single layer of brain microvascular endothelial cells, surrounding by endothelial cells, as well as the neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, are involved in the formation of the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier is a selective permeation barrier, most of the central nervous system drug candidates have poor permeability in the blood-brain barrier. The disadvantages of drug screening experiments in laboratory animals are high cost, long cycle, and low accuracy. Besides, directly test in the human body is unethical. But establishing a reliable model of extracorporeal blood-brain barrier can simplify the experimental process, shorten the test period, and make the experimental results easier to determine. Therefore, the establishment of an in vitro BBB model can greatly accelerate the development of central nervous system drugs. The models that have been studied can be divided into three categories: single culture, co-culture, and triple culture. These models range from simple to complex, and more similar to blood-brain barrier in vivo. This article reviews the current blood-brain barrier model, and we expect it can provide new ideas for the design of in vitro BBB models in the future.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,,
98,"Olfactomedin-like (OLFML) proteins are members of the olfactomedin domain-containing secreted glycoprotein (OLF) family. OLFML2A and OLFML2B are representative molecules of these glycoproteins. Olfactomedins are critical for the development and functional organization of the nervous system and retina, which is a highly conserved structure in vertebrates, having almost identical anatomical and physiological characteristics in multiple taxa. Spotted gar, a member of the Lepisosteidae family, is a freshwater fish that inhabits rivers, bayous, swamps, and brackish waters. Recently, the complete genome has been sequenced, providing a unique bridge between fish medical models to human biology, making it an excellent animal model. This study was aimed to understanding the evolution OLFML2A and OLFML2B in the retina of spotted gar through looking for the expression of these genes. Spotted gar retina was analyzed with hematoxylin-eosin staining assays to provide an overall view of the retina structure and an immunofluorescence assay to identify OLFML2A and OLFML2B protein expression. A phylogenetic tree was created using the neighbor-joining method. Forces that direct the evolution of the fish genes were tested. Spotted gar retina, as in other vertebrates, is made of several layers. OLFML2A and OLFML2B proteins were detected in the rod and cone photoreceptor layer (PRL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), and inner nuclear layer (INL). Phylogenetic tree analysis confirms the orthology within the OLFML2A gene. Purifying selection is the evolutionary force that directs the OLFML2A genes.

99,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a typical persistent arrhythmia, and revealing its pathogenesis and pathophysiological process is the key to AF diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. It also assists AF drug development and clinical equipment design. Experimental and clinical results can only show the local characteristics of cells or sub-cells and the macroscopic results of atrial fibrillation. However, with the development of bioinformatics acquisition technology and statistical analysis technology, using multi-scale virtual heart model to achieve the unity of macro-and micro-mechanism has attracted the attention of the research community. In this paper, we systematically reviewed the advances in virtual heart modeling at various levels, such as ion channels, cardiac cells, heart tissues and organs, and discussed the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation based on virtual heart models and the treatment of atrial fibrillation.
