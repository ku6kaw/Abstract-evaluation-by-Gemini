0,"Gene expression studies using microarrays have provided important insights into understanding the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in a variety of biological and disease phenomena. In a previous study, we developed Photo-DEAN, a universal-microarray-based RNA quantification method that enabled reverse transcription-free multiplex measurement of the absolute amount of RNA. Photo-DEAN promotes high-throughput and bias-less transcriptome analysis without the need for common controls or additional complicated normalization steps. In this study, we empirically identified two conditions (individual specificity and uniform duplex stability) necessary for in silico design of probe sequences, allowing the Photo-DEAN method to accurately measure the absolute amount of target RNA in total RNA. We then demonstrated that using the modified probe design conditions, the Photo-DEAN method successfully measured the absolute amount of pgi mRNA spiked into E. coli total RNA. The measurement was performed at five different sites in the coding region of pgi mRNA, exhibiting no significant site dependence. Theoretical considerations suggested that probe sequences longer than the previously used 30-bases better satisfy the necessary design conditions.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

2,"Telomeres protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, and telomere shortening causes irreversible cell cycle arrest through activation of the DNA-damage checkpoint. In this study, we found that deletion of PPH3, encoding a 2A-like protein phosphatase, accelerated telomere-shortening-mediated senescence without affecting normal telomere length or the telomere erosion rate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the loss of PPH3 increased sensitivity to telomere dysfunction. The detection of telomere abnormalities by DNA-damage sensors was not an all-or-none response, implying that Pph3 helps determine the border between normal and dysfunctional telomeres by suppressing premature activation of the DNA-damage checkpoint.

3,"Worm biologists from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom gathered at the Colorado State University Todos Santos Center in Baja California Sur, Mexico, April 3-5, 2019 for the Todos Santos Small RNA Symposium. Meeting participants, many of whom were still recovering from the bomb cyclone that struck a large swath of North America just days earlier, were greeted by the warmth and sunshine that is nearly ubiquitous in the sleepy seaside town of Todos Santos. With only 24 speakers, the meeting had the sort of laid-back vibe you might expect amongst the palm trees and ocean breeze of the Pacific coast of Mexico. The meeting started with tracing the laboratory lineages of participants. Not surprisingly, the most common parental lineages represented at the meeting were Dr. Craig Mello, Dr. Gary Ruvkun, and Dr. Victor Ambros, whom, together with Dr. Andy Fire and Dr. David Baulcombe, pioneered the small RNA field.

4,"Bromelain is a type of protease found in both fruits and stems of pineapples. Stem bromelain has been extensively studied and is commercially available for applications in various industries. In contrast, studies of fruit bromelain are quite limited since most of pineapples have been consumed freshly, canned or juiced. Nowadays, the consumption of canned fruits, including canned pineapples has decreased greatly. Fruit bromelain could be a new growth point for pineapple industry. In this study, fruit bromelain was extracted from the pineapple juice of Phuket variety and some of its properties were studied. The enzyme was purified by precipitation using ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Consequently, the protease purification level was increased by 95.2 fold. The final specific activity was getting to 448,590 U/mg on average, dominated by cysteine proteases, with optimal activity at 45 degrees C and pH ranging from 6 to 8. The study facilitates the molecular and application research of fruit bromelain. Practical applications The research has been carried out at Funong Food Technology Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China, which produces primarily pineapple chunks and juice. As plenty of by-products, like peels and cores of pineapples, are produced, the techniques are employed to extract bromelain from the by-products. The techniques reported in this work are not new or advanced, however, they are applicable during the manufacturing process and the related equipment is easy to set up and operate. What's more, the practical application of the techniques is cost-effective for the manufactories. Take Funong Food Technology Co., Ltd. as an example, they was using 80% saturation ammonium sulfate to precipitate protein from pineapple juice and obtained a bromelain with activity of approximately 8,000 U/mg and yield of 1.7 kg per ton of juice. With the application of the techniques reported in this work, bromelain was first extracted by ammonium sulfate gradient precipitation, and then purified through ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Each step of precipitation and purification generates a different level of activity and recovery of bromelain, ranging from around 2,506 to 448,590 U/mg, which allows for the production of bromelain according to the requirement of the market and brings more profits.",yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,
5,"Objective: Type I diabetes is a disease characterised by an extreme reduction in serum insulin levels. Diet and exercise have gained considerable attention in the treatment of diabetes. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the effect of diet with carbohydrate but without daily energy restriction on various metabolites (glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, lactate), some electrolytes (Ca, Mg, Na, K, P, Cl) and essential metals (Mn, Co, Cu, Se, Zn, Fe) in the blood of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Materials and methods: Thirty-three male rats were divided into four groups of standard rat diet (SR)-fed control, SR-diet fed diabetics, low carbohydrate-standard protein-high fat (LCSPHF) diet-fed diabetics, and very low carbohydrate-high protein-high fat (VLCHPHF) diet-fed diabetics. Diabetes was induced by an i.p. injection of 50 mg/kg streptozotocin. The rats were fed with the specially prepared diets for 28 days. Results: The decreased-serum Cl and the increased-serum glucose levels were only the difference between the controls and SR diet-fed diabetic rats regarding to measured parameters. Lowering carbohydrate and increasing fat ratio in diet caused an increase in serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels leading to an increased-serum Fe and Ca, and decreased-serum Na and Cu levels in diabetic rats. Conclusion: The serum mineral changes should be taken into consideration together with the changes in serum glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels for the secondary complications of diabetes mellitus.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,,,
6,"Drosophila melanogaster produces fatty acid amides, and thus, provides a model to unravel the pathways for their biosynthesis. We previously demonstrated that arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase-like 2 (AANATL2) from D. melanogaster will catalyze the formation of long-chain N-acylserotonins and N-acyldopamines in vitro. Generating silencing RNA via the UAS/GAL4 bipartite approach for targeted gene expression effectively decreased the endogenous levels of the AANATL2 transcripts in D. melanogaster, as shown by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Consistent with these data, western blot analysis of the offspring of the AANATL2 knockdown flies using an anti-AANATL2 antibody revealed a significant reduction in the expression of the AANATL2 protein. Reduced expression of AANATL2 decreased the cellular levels of N-palmitoyldopamine (PALDA), providing strong evidence that AANATL2 is responsible for the biosynthesis of PALDA in vivo. This is the first time that the expression of an AANAT has been reduced in D. melanogaster to link one of these enzymes to the in vivo production of an N-acylarylalkylamide.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,
7,"In this work, we present the results of an undergrad student from the perspective of its first approach as a principal researcher in a project. In order to gain practical experience, one of the options for students that have interest in pursuing a postgraduate program corresponds to a research stay in a laboratory of their selected field conducting a project for a period of 6 months. In this particular project, a fungal sample was isolated from Parmesan cheese spoilage and its enzymatic activity evaluated. Using simple and standardized protocols, the student was capable of identifying a possible biotechnological application for the isolate by detecting and categorizing the lipolytic activity. Through microculture characterization in potato dextrose agar (PDA) the genus of the sample was determined as Penicillium and confirmed by molecular analysis of the ITS1 and ITS4 regions. In order to examine comprehensively the potential of the new isolate, the extracellular and intracellular enzymatic activities were analyzed as well as four methods of cell rupture. From these results, sonication was determined as the best technique with 211 U/L as a maximum lipolytic value. To finalize the evaluation of the sample, the student determined the optimal pH and temperature as well as the thermotolerance of the crude extract obtaining a residual activity of 13% after 60 minutes of incubation at 45 degrees C. Upon conclusion of the research we could recognize that through a direct characterization of a fungal isolate using techniques that are widely known, the student was capable of determining and value one of the most interesting capabilities fungi has to offer; enzymatic activity, and that the knowledge obtained from established protocols enables and encourages the students to correlate the source from where they were obtained with potential biotechnological applications.

8,"Some 60 years ago chemicals that intercalate between base pairs of duplex DNA were found to amplify frameshift mutagenesis. Surprisingly, the robust induction of frameshifts by intercalators still lacks a mechanistic model, leaving this classic phenomenon annoyingly intractable. A promising idea of asymmetric half-intercalation-stabilizing frameshift intermediates during DNA synthesis has never been developed into a model. Instead, researchers of frameshift mutagenesis embraced the powerful slipped-mispairing concept that unexpectedly struggled with the role of intercalators in frameshifting. It is proposed that the slipped mispairing and the half-intercalation ideas are two sides of the same coin. Further, existing findings are reviewed to test predictions of the combined ""half-intercalation into the slipped-mispairing intermediate"" model against accumulated knowledge. The existence of potential endogenous intercalators and the phenomenon of ""DNA bookmarks"" reveal ample possibilities for natural frameshift mutagenisis in the cell.

In this study, we evaluated the sake fermentation characteristics when using HDAC gene-disrupted yeast strain Kyokai No. 701. Flavor components of the sake product were significantly changed. RPD3 or HDA1 disruption increased twofold the amount of isoamyl acetate, and isoamyl alcohol levels also increased in the rpd3 Delta strain. To determine the contribution of Rpd3L and Rpd3S complexes to sake characteristics, a gene responsible for Rpd3L and/or Rpd3S formation was also disrupted. Disruption of DEP1 or SDS3 that is an essential component of Rpd3L led to increased isoamyl alcohol production similar to that of the rpd3 Delta strain, but the efficiency of isoamyl alcohol esterification was not affected. In addition, Rpd3 and Hda1 may regulate the responsiveness to oxygen in isoamyl acetate production.

11,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a critical event after ischemic stroke, which results in edema formation and hemorrhagic transformation of infarcted tissue. BBB dysfunction following stroke is partly mediated by proinflammatory agents. We recently have shown that high frequency stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR-HFS) exerts an antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effect in the border zone of cerebral photothrombotic stroke in rats. Whether MLR-HFS also has an impact on BBB dysfunction in the early stage of stroke is unknown. In this study, rats were subjected to photothrombotic stroke of the sensorimotor cortex and implantation of a stimulating microelectrode into the ipsilesional MLR. Thereafter, either HFS or sham stimulation of the MLR was applied for 24 h. After scarifying the rats, BBB disruption was assessed by determining albumin extravasation and tight junction integrity (claudin 3, claudin 5, and occludin) using Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. In addition, by applying zymography, expression of pro-metalloproteinase-9 (pro-MMP-9) was analyzed. No differences were found regarding infarct size and BBB dysfunction between stimulated and unstimulated animals 24 h after induction of stroke. Our results indicate that MLR-HFS neither improves nor worsens the damaged BBB after stroke. Attenuating cytokines/chemokines in the perilesional area, as mediated by MLR-HFS, tend to play a less significant role in preventing the BBB integrity.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
12,"It is now widely accepted that allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) commonly occurs at non-imprinted loci. Most of the non-imprinted ASM regions observed both within and outside of the CpG island show a strong correlation with DNA polymorphisms. However, what polymorphic cis-acting elements mediate non-imprinted ASM of the CpG island remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of polymorphic GT microsatellites within the gene promoter on non-imprinted ASM of the local CpG island in goldfish. We generated various goldfish heterozygotes, in which the length of GT microsatellites or some non-repetitive sequences in the promoter of no tail alleles was different. By examining the methylation status of the downstream CpG island in these heterozygotes, we found that polymorphisms of a long GT microsatellite can lead to the ASM of the downstream CpG island during oogenesis and embryogenesis, polymorphisms of short GT microsatellites and non-repetitive sequences in the promoter exhibited no significant effect on the methylation of the CpG island. We also observed that the ASM of the CpG island was associated with allele-specific expression in heterozygous embryos.

14,"Objective: DEK is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a nuclear protein, which is also released from some cells. Overexpression of DEK suppresses proliferation of some blood cell progenitors whereas it increases proliferation of epithelial tumors.

Here, we aimed to test if DEK overexpression effects the proliferation and viability of BM stromal cells or MM cells co-cultured with DEK-overexpressing stromal cells, mimicking the BM microenvironment. Methods: DEK is stably overexpressed in the BM stromal cell line HS27A. Periodic growth curve and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed to determine the effect of DEK overexpression on HS27A cells and MM cell lines (RPMI-8226 and U266) that are co-cultured with these HS27A cells. Results: We showed that, on the contrary to blood progenitors or ephitelial cells, DEK overexpression doesn't alter the viability or proliferation of the HS27A cells, or the MM cell lines which are co-cultured with DEK-overexpressing HS27A cells.

Methods: The study consisted of 30 hypercholesterolemic patients diagnosed with routine laboratory tests and 30 healthy participants. The lipid parameters, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in controls and patients with hypercholesterolemia before and after 12-week treatment with rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day), were analyzed by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: It was found that a 12-week cure with rosuvastatin resulted in substantial reductions in IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha and MDA levels as in rising activities of PON1 in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Before treatment, the PON1 levels were significantly negatively correlated with TNF-alpha and IL-6 in control group, while it was positively correlated with TNF-alpha in patients.

Understanding the immunosuppressive mechanisms between ectoparasites and their hosts will provide new strategies to develop potential immunosuppressive drugs against immune disorder diseases.

However, the targeting cells and detailed mechanisms of immunoregulin HA in immunosuppressive reactions are not well defined. Here, we show that immunoregulin HA reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Interestingly, we discover that the major cytokines repressed by immunoregulin HA are secreted by macrophages, rather than by T cells. Furthermore, immunoregulin HA inhibits macrophage maturation and phagocytosis. Mechanically, the activations of c-JUN N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase upon LPS stimulation are decreased by immunoregulin HA.

The enzyme is important in some forms of chemotherapy, and it has been implicated in resistance to antifolate antibiotics. A co-crystal structure of the enzyme (1U3G) and primary sequence analysis were used to select highly conserved amino acids in close proximity to bound 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. The amino acids were then investigated using site directed mutagenesis and kinetics. Y123, E55, and F118 were concluded to be important for binding 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in the active site and/or for substrate turnover of the enzyme. Replacement of E55 or Y123 with alanine resulted in no detectable activity. The more subtle replacement of E55 with glutamine was also inactive suggesting an ionic interaction with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Mutations to F118 resulted in substantial increases in apparent K-m for both 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and ATP, but did not substantially affect catalytic turnover. Outside the active site, the replacement of Q144 with alanine yielded an enzyme that bound the substrates of ATP and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate with higher apparent K-m values than the wild-type enzyme, but demonstrated a 3.1 fold increase in k(cat).",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes

23,"Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson diseases by utilizing high-frequency stimulations (HFS) of electrical pulses with constant inter-pulse-intervals (IPI). To develop new stimulation paradigms for treating more brain diseases, HFS with varying IPI (i.e., varying-frequency) has been investigated. Previous studies have shown that the efficacy obtained by varying-frequency is different from that obtained by constant-frequency even with a same mean frequency. We hypothesized that small changes in IPI during HFS could substantially change the effect of HFS on neurons. To test this hypothesis, HFS sequences with constant IPI (IPI = 10 or 7.5 ms for a frequency of 100 or 133 Hz) and varying IPI (IPI = 5-10 ms with a mean frequency of 133 Hz) were alternately applied at afferent axon fibers of pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal CA1 region. The evoked potentials of downstream neurons were recorded and analyzed to quantitatively evaluate the neuronal responses to stimulations with constant IPI and varying IPI. The results showed that during persistent stimulation with constant IPI, the responses of downstream neurons changed from initial synchronized firing of population spikes (PS) into non-synchronized firing (i. e., unit spikes). However, once the stimulation switched to the sequence with varying IPI, synchronized firing reappeared with large PS events. Additionally, the amplitude of PS and the synchronization degree of firing induced by varying IPI were similar to those induced by single pulses at baseline. However, the incidence of PS was only similar to 7% of the pulse frequency, indicating a cumulative action of multiple pulses for generating such synchronized firing of neurons by stimulations with varying IPI. In addition, the appearance of PS was related to the length of proceeding IPI. Presumably, nonlinear responses of neuronal axons and synapses to high-frequency stimulation might cause the synchronized activity induced by varying-frequency. These results indicate that tiny differences in intervals of varying-frequency stimulation may generate a modulation effect on neurons very different from that of constant frequency stimulation. The present study shows important results for revealing the mechanisms of brain stimulation and for advancing the development of new stimulation paradigms to treat various brain diseases.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
24,"Current software tools for the automated building of models for macromolecular X-ray crystal structures are capable of assembling high-quality models for ordered macromolecule and small-molecule scattering components with minimal or no user supervision. Many of these tools also incorporate robust functionality for modelling the ordered water molecules that are found in nearly all macromolecular crystal structures. However, no current tools focus on differentiating these ubiquitous water molecules from other frequently occurring multi-atom solvent species, such as sulfate, or the automated building of models for such species. PeakProbe has been developed specifically to address the need for such a tool. PeakProbe predicts likely solvent models for a given point (termed a 'peak') in a structure based on analysis ('probing') of its local electron density and chemical environment. PeakProbe maps a total of 19 resolution-dependent features associated with electron density and two associated with the local chemical environment to a two-dimensional score space that is independent of resolution. Peaks are classified based on the relative frequencies with which four different classes of solvent (including water) are observed within a given region of this score space as determined by large-scale sampling of solvent models in the Protein Data Bank. Designed to classify peaks generated from difference density maxima, PeakProbe also incorporates functionality for identifying peaks associated with model errors or clusters of peaks likely to correspond to multi-atom solvent, and for the validation of existing solvent models using solvent-omit electron-density maps. When tasked with classifying peaks into one of four distinct solvent classes, PeakProbe achieves greater than 99% accuracy for both peaks derived directly from the atomic coordinates of existing solvent models and those based on difference density maxima. While the program is still under development, a fully functional version is publicly available. PeakProbe makes extensive use of cctbx libraries, and requires a PHENIX licence and an up-to-date phenix. python environment for execution.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The sequence motifs recognized by a TF can be described in terms of position frequency matrices. Searching for motif matches with a given position frequency matrix is achieved by employing a predefined score cutoff and subsequently counting the number of matches above this cutoff. In this article, we approximate the distribution of the number of motif matches based on a novel dynamic programming approach, which accounts for higher order sequence background (e.g., as is characteristic for CpG islands) and overlapping motif matches on both DNA strands.

27,"Recent findings from biological experiments demonstrate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are actively involved in critical cellular processes and are associated with innumerable diseases. Computational prediction of lncRNA-disease association draws tremendous research attention nowadays. This paper proposes a machine learning model that predicts lncRNA-disease associations using Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) of lncRNAs and diseases. A Support Vector Machine classifier is developed using the feature set extracted from a meta-path-based parameter, Association Index derived from the HIN. Performance of the model is validated using standard statistical metrics and it generated an AUC value of 0.87, which is better than the existing methods in the literature. Results are further validated using the recent literature and many of the predicted lncRNA-disease associations are identified as actually existing. This paper also proposes an HIN-based methodology to associate lncRNAs with pathways in which they may have biological influence. A case study on the pathway associations of four well-known lncRNAs (HOTAIR, TUG1, NEAT1, and MALAT1) has been conducted. It has been observed that many times the same lncRNA is associated with more than one biologically related pathways.

MPV VLP has a unique nanostructure that can self-assemble in vivo or in vitro and many sites that can be modified. The special architecture make it an ideal nanoscale model in scientific fields such as biochemistry. With the modification of the protein capsid and the transformation of the core cavity, researchers have developed a series of vaccines, multifunctional diagnostic agents and versatile nanocage systems. Recent studies of MPV VLP modification have focused on the interface modification between subunits to facilitate the assemble process, and the interior or exterior modification to develop diverse applications. This paper reviews the structural characteristics of MPV VLP, and briefly introduces the expression systems and assembly mechanism. The modification of MPV VLP was summarized, with emphasis on chemical modification and modification using genetic engineering. In addition, the applications of MPV VLP in the fields of vaccine development, delivery of drug and other molecules were described with examples.

In this paper, we propose a new measure of similarity between a pair of MS experiments, called truncated rank correlation (TRC). To provide a robust metric of similarity in noisy high-dimensional data, TRC uses truncated top ranks (or top m-ranks) for calculating correlation. A comprehensive numerical study suggests that TRC outperforms traditional sample correlation and Kendall's tau.

Adenylate kinase (AK), that catalyzes inter-conversion of ADP, ATP and AMP, plays a major role in maintaining AEC and is regulated by cellular AMP levels. Hence, the enzymes AMP deaminase (AMPD) and nucleotidases, which catabolize AMP, indirectly regulate AK activity and in-turn affect AEC.

However, when episomal expression was attempted, viable parasites were not obtained, suggesting that perturbing AMP homeostasis by over-expressing AMPD might be lethal.

SFTI-1 and its adjacent albumin are both processed into separate, mature forms by asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP).

Twelve multiparous Holstein cows (132 +/- 21days in milk and 51 +/- 3kg/day milk) were blocked according to milk yield and enrolled in a replicated 3x3 Latin square experiment. Experimental periods were 21days, with 17days allowed for diet adaptation and 4days for sampling. Treatment sequences were randomly assigned to animals and treatments were as follows: (1) 0.97g Zn/day provided as ZnSO4 (34.5mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 30-ZS), (2) 1.64g Zn/day provided as ZnSO4 (56.5mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZS), and (3) 0.55g Zn/day provided as ZnSO4 plus 1.13g Zn/day provided as a zinc-methionine complex (58.2mg supplemental Zn/kg diet DM; 60-ZM).

Hence, the relative rates of all genes associated with the same PM remain nearly constant, whereas the absolute rates can change arbitrarily according to the PM ticks. A consequent question to that mentioned is finding the gene-PM association only from the gene sequence data. This, however, turns to be a nontrivial task and is affected by the number of variables, their random noise, and the amount of available information. To this end, a clustering heuristic was devised by exploiting the correlation between corresponding edge lengths across thousands of gene trees.

Hence, 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) has been shown to be an indicator for oxidative DNA damage. This study aimed to determine the relative telomere length (RTL) and 8-OHdG levels in neoplastic tissues, adjacent non-neoplastic tissues, and blood leukocytes of musculoskeletal (MS) tumor patients. Neoplastic tissues were compared to adjacent non-neoplastic tissues in MS tumor patients (n=46).

RTL was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and 8-OHdGlevels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The RTL in neoplastic tissues was significantly shorter than that in non-neoplastic tissues [1.12 (0.86-1.46) vs 1.45 (1.25-1.65), P=0.001]. PBLs had lower RTL than non-neoplastic tissues in MS tumor patients [1.04 (0.85-1.13) vs 1.45 (1.25-1.65), P<0.001]. However, there was no significant difference between RTL in PBLs and in neoplastic tissues.

De novo synthesis and design techniques have high degree of freedom and simple precursors in the synthesis and structural design of biomacromolecules, enabling new design and efficient synthesis of biomacromolecules for specific research purposes. Recently, de novo synthesis and design techniques have begun to receive attention in the fields of artificial gene combination, novel protein drug design, glycoconjugate synthesis, etc. Based on the de novo synthesis and design of biomacromolecules, the newly designed DNA or novel gene expression products, as well as glycosylation or glycoconjugates with recognition functions, can be targeted prepared. Simultaneously, the techniques will greatly advance biologically active substances such as cytokine mimics, gene therapy delivery vehicles, providing a new solution for the construction of artificial biological systems and the treatment of rare diseases.

The present work describes a streamlined approach for determining the minimum detectable concentration (MDC) of a contrast agent given experimental conditions and imaging system parameters. The developed Synthetic Data Framework (SDF) allows estimation of MDCs of various contrast agents under different tissue conditions without extensive animal experiments. The SDF combines simulated optoacoustic signals from exogenously administered contrast agents with in vivo experimental signals from background tissue to generate realistic synthetic multispectral optoacoustic images.

47,"mHA11, a 2-amino-4-phenyl-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate analog, is a microtubule-targeting agent discovered by our group through the modification of the Bcl-2 inhibitor HA14-1. mHA11 exhibits cytotoxicities against tumor cells with nM IC50 values, whereas it has only a minimal effect on normal cells. We explored the plasma pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and excretion of mHA11 in rats using a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Next, we identified the metabolites of mHA11 and assessed the influence of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes on mHA11 metabolism. We also examined the in vitro stability in rat plasma and rat liver microsomes (RLMs), the blood-to plasma (B/P) ratio, and the inhibitory effect on CYP isozyme activities. After oral administration at 5, 15, and 45 mg/kg, mHA11 was absorbed and eliminated rapidly. There was a linear correlation between the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) and the dose (R-2 = 0.983). The bioavailability of mHA11 was 4.1% at the oral dose of 15 mg/kg mHA11 was extensively distributed in various tissues and exhibited a high penetration into the brain. No significant parent drug was detected in urine or bile, and only 0.74% was recovered in feces, whereas two demethylated metabolites, M1 and M2, were found in the urine and feces, and further studies showed that CYP2C19 primarily contributed to metabolites formation. mHA11 was stable in rat plasma but degraded significantly in RLMs; its B/P ratio was 1.05 in rat blood. In addition, mHA11 dose-dependently inhibited the activities of rat CYP isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C6, CYP2C11, CYP2D2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A2.

48,"The disorders of hemostasis and coagulation were believed to be the main contributors to the pathogenesis of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), and platelets are the basic factors regulating hemostasis and coagulation and play important roles in the process of thrombosis. This study investigated the proteome of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with platelet endothelial aggregation receptor-1 (PEAR1) knockdown using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) method and analyzed the role of differential abundance proteins (DAPs) in the regulation of platelets aggregation. Our results showed that the conditioned media-culturing HUVECs with PEAR1 knockdown partially suppressed the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. The proteomics analysis was performed by using the iTRAQ technique, and a total of 215 DAPs (124 protein was upregulated and 91 protein were downregulated) were identified. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that proteins related to platelet alpha granule, adenosine triphosphate metabolic process, and endocytosis were significantly enriched. Further, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis also identified the significant enrichment of endocytosis-related pathways. The real-time polymerase chain reaction assay confirmed that the expression of P2Y(12), mitochondrial carrier 2, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-sulfur protein 3, and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein are significantly downregulated in the HUVECs with PEAR1 knockdown. In conclusion, our in vitro results implicated that DAPs induced by PEAR1 knockdown might contribute to the platelet aggregation. Proteomic studies by employing GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis suggested that the potential effects of DAPs on platelet aggregation may be linked to the balance of ADP synthesis or degradation in mitochondria.",yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

TrkA interacted with multiple proteins in vivo, but due to the complexity of the NGF signaling pathway, it is still necessary to explore more proteins that interact with TrkA to gain a more accurate understanding of the NGF pathway. Here we report eIF4A1 is a new partner of TrkA. We found eIF4A1 interacted with TrkA via the yeast two hybrid assay. And then the association between TrkA and eIF4A1 was identified by GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Additionally, NGF stimulated this interaction and the associated binding domain is the N-terminus domain (NTD) in eIF4A1 and the TK domain in TrkA. And eIF4A1 could colocalize with TrkA at cell membrane. Furthermore, eIF4A1 also inhibits TrkA polyubiquitination through lysine (Lys)-63-linked polyubiquitin chains which causes its internalization.

Lipase CALA from Canadian antarctica and hexyl 2-phenylbutyrate (2-PBAHE) were identified upon screening as the best enzyme and substrate, respectively. Adding hydroxyethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HE-beta-CD) to improve the solubility of the substrate resulted in a 1.5 times increase in substrate conversion while retaining a high enantioselectivity compared with that when HE-beta-CD was not added. The effects of lipase concentration, substrate concentration and HE-beta-CD concentration, temperature, pH, and reaction time on enantiomeric excess and conversion rate were investigated, and the optimal conditions were identified using response surface methodology (RSM). Under the optimal conditions, namely 50 mg/mL lipase CALA, 30 mmol/L substrate, 60 mmol/L HE-beta-CD, pH of 6.5, temperature of 83 degrees C and reaction time of 18 h, the enantiomeric excess and overall conversion rate were 96.05% and 27.28%, respectively.

51,"Fabry disease(FD) is a rare X-linked recessive hereditary lysosomal storage disease. One of the most commonly used biomarkers for detecting FD is Lyso-GB3, a globotriaosylsphingosine, which is usually analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS), because of its high specificity and sensitivity. Due to the complexity of LC-MS/MS technology, efficient and reliable diagnosis of FD by LC-MS/MS was unavailable in most hospitals in China. Therefore, patients' samples need to be prepared at local hospitals and then sent to central laboratories for LC-MS/MS analysis. As a result, samples undergo a lengthy shipment and storage process, potentially compromising sample quality and thus precision of diagnosis. We first established and validated a novel LC-MS/MS-based method and to guarantee FD sample quality, we studied the effects of pre-analytical variables on the analysis of Lyso-GB3. These pre-analytical variables include storage temperature and time of plasma, freeze-thaw cycles of plasma, degree of hemolysis of plasma, storage temperature and time of whole blood, and centrifugation temperature. Finally, we analyzed 86 FD samples and 100 normal human samples and made correlation studies on the relationship between Lyso-GB3 level and FD classification. Results showed Lyso-GB3 level started decreasing post 4 days when plasma was stored at 20 degrees C. In addition, hemolysis significantly influenced the FD sample quality and severe hemolysis caused the Lyso-GB3 level decreased by 57.8%. Other pre-analytical variables have little impact on FD sample quality. Under the conditions of the standard operational procedures before analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for screening FD is 100%, which ensures the accuracy of the method. Furthermore, we used plasma Lyso-GB3 level to distinguish classical FD patients from non-classical FD patients. When we set the cut-off value as 55.15 mu g/L, the sensitivity and the specificity were 71% and 100%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83.

52,"It is well known the dimerization state of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), in conjunction with binding partners such as the growth factor receptor bound protein 7 (Grb7) protein, plays an important role in cell signaling regulation. Previously, we proposed, downstream of RTKs, that the phosphorylation state of Grb7SH2 domain tyrosine residues could control Grb7 dimerization, and dimerization may be an important regulatory step in Grb7 binding to RTKs. In this manner, additional dimerization-dependent regulation could occur downstream of the membrane-bound kinase in RTK-mediated signaling pathways. Extrapolation to the full-length (FL) Grb7 protein, and the ability to test this hypothesis further, has been hampered by the availability of large quantities of pure and stable FL protein. Here, we report the biophysical characterization of the FL Grb7 protein and also a mutant representing a tyrosine-phosphorylated Grb7 protein form. Through size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation, we show the phosphorylated-tyrosine-mimic Y492E-FL-Grb7 protein (Y492E-FL-Grb7) is essentially monomeric at expected physiological concentrations. It has been shown previously the wild-type FL Grb7(WT-FLGrb7) protein is dimeric with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 11 mu M. Our studies here measure a FL protein dimerization K-d of WT-FL-Grb7 within one order of magnitude at approximately 1 mu M. The approximate size and shape of the WT-FL-Grb7 in comparison the tyrosine-phosphorylation mimic Y492E-FL-Grb7 protein was determined by dynamic light scattering methods. In vitro phosphorylation of the Grb7SH2 domain indicates only one of the available tyrosine residues is phosphorylated, suggesting the same phosphorylation pattern could be relevant in the FL protein.

53,"Two-liquid-phase reaction media have long been used in bioconversions to supply or remove hydrophobic organic reaction substrates and products to reduce inhibitory and toxic effects on biocatalysts. In case of the terminal oxyfunctionalization of linear alkanes by the AlkBGT monooxygenase the excess alkane substrate is often used as a second phase to extract the alcohol, aldehyde, and acid products. However, the selection of other carrier phases or surfactants is complex due to a large number of parameters that are involved, such as biocompatibility, substrate bioavailability, and product extraction selectivity. This study combines systematic high-throughput screening with chemometrics to correlate physicochemical parameters of a range of cosolvents to product specificity and yield using a multivariate regression model. Partial least-squares regression shows that the defining factor for product specificity is the solubility properties of the reaction substrate and product in the cosolvent, as measured by Hansen solubility parameters. Thus the polarity of cosolvents determines the accumulation of either alcohol or acid products. Whereas usually the acid product accumulates during the reaction, by choosing a more polar cosolvent the 1-alcohol product can be accumulated. Especially with Tergitol as a cosolvent, a 3.2-fold improvement in the 1-octanol yield to 18.3 mmol L-1 is achieved relative to the control reaction without cosolvents.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

The study aimed to describe a novel de novo mutation of the beta-globin gene and its clinical implication. Out of 100 Bangladeshi beta-thal carrier families, one patient with hematological and clinical features associated with beta-thal and her parents were included. Molecular characterizations of beta-globin gene mutations were performed by direct sequencing. A novel nucleotide deletion mutation at codon 8 in the first exon of the beta-globin gene (HBB: c.27delG) was found in a 1-year-old child of the studied family in a heterozygous state along with common Hb E (HBB: c.79G>A). The mutation caused a frameshift to a new stop codon at codon 18 resulting in a beta(0)-thal phenotype. The proband exhibited a beta-thal intermedia (beta-TI)-like genotype, however, showed beta-thal major (beta-TM)-like complications and was transfusion-dependent. Her mother had a profile consistent with the Hb E trait, while the father had normal hematological indices.

However, sigma(4) of sigma(70) appears to be poorly folded on its own. Here, by fusing sigma(4) with the RNA polymerase beta-flap-tip-helix, we constructed two sigma(4) chimera proteins, one from sigma(70) sigma 470c and another from sigma(S) >sigma 4Sc of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The two chimera proteins well folded into a monomeric form with strong binding affinities for -35 element DNA. Determining the crystal structure of sigma 4Sc in complex with -35 element DNA revealed that sigma 4Sc adopts a similar structure as sigma(4) in the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase sigma(S) holoenzyme and recognizes -35 element DNA specifically by several conserved residues from the helix-turn-helix motif. By using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), sigma 470c was demonstrated to recognize -35 element DNA similar to sigma 4Sc. Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill relaxation dispersion analyses showed that the N-terminal helix and the beta-flap-tip-helix of sigma 470c have a concurrent transient alpha-helical structure and DNA binding reduced the slow dynamics on sigma 470c. Finally, only sigma 470c was shown to interact with the response regulator PmrA and its promoter DNA.

56,"BackgroundToday a variety of phylogenetic file formats exists, some of which are well-established but limited in their data model, while other more recently introduced ones offer advanced features for metadata representation. Although most currently available software only supports the classical formats with a limited metadata model, it would be desirable to have support for the more advanced formats. This is necessary for users to produce richly annotated data that can be efficiently reused and make underlying workflows easily reproducible. A programming library that abstracts over the data and metadata models of the different formats and allows supporting all of them in one step would significantly simplify the development of new and the extension of existing software to address the need for better metadata annotation.ResultsWe developed the Java library JPhyloIO, which allows event-based reading and writing of the most common alignment and tree/network formats. It allows full access to all features of the nine currently supported formats. By implementing a single JPhyloIO-based reader and writer, application developers can support all of these formats. Due to the event-based architecture, JPhyloIO can be combined with any application data structure, and is memory efficient for large datasets. JPhyloIO is distributed under LGPL. Detailed documentation and example applications (available on http://bioinfweb.info/JPhyloIO/) significantly lower the entry barrier for bioinformaticians who wish to benefit from JPhyloIO's features in their own software.ConclusionJPhyloIO enables simplified development of new and extension of existing applications that support various standard formats simultaneously.

Thirty Zucker fatty rats were divided into three groups and supplemented with placebo or Sp or Sp+Si croquettes for 12 weeks. Food consumption, glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and mitochondrial and oxidative stress were determined. Zucker fatty rats exhibited several hepatic metabolic alterations as well as mitochondrial and oxidative stress perturbations. The intake of Sp increased plasma TG levels and decreased the hepatic NADPH oxidase activity and ameliorated transitorily the glucose intolerance.

68,"Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is an important regulatory factor in cells. NF-kappa B has a wide range of biological activities. After activation, it participates in the transcription and regulation of many genes and plays a role in infection, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, cell multiplication, and apoptosis. The activation of the NF-kappa B signal pathway is dependent on the degradation of the I kappa B kinase beta (IKK beta) complex. IKK beta is the key kinase in the NF-kappa B activation pathway. After inhibition, it can block the activation of NF-kappa B. IKK beta is a key regulator of NF-kappa B activation, also an early regulator of inflammation in all stages of the immune response. This study aimed to investigate the effect of IKK beta-siRNA lentivirus vector treatment for hepatic fibrosis of rats. An IKK beta-siRNA expression plasmid was constructed and injected in the tail vein of rats. Then, IKK beta-siRNA distribution in the liver was observed by immunofluorescence, and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect inflammation-related and fibrosis-related factors. IKK beta-siRNA lentiviruses could be delivered to the liver and significantly decrease carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, serum transaminase levels significantly decreased, and inflammation-related and fibrosis-related factors decreased.

In this study, electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar and CNKI, were systemically queried to identify relevant studies. Subsequently, odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were analysed. Our data indicated that the IL-18 -137C/G polymorphism was not related to tuberculosis susceptibility (GG vs. AA odds ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.43-1.17; GA vs. AA: odds ratio =0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.57-1.13; dominant model: odds ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.56-1.08; recessive model: odds ratio = 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.46-1.25).

70,"B-cell immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP) is an essential endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone normally found in the ER lumen. However, BiP also has other extracellular and intracellular functions. As it is unclear whether peripheral BiP has a signal and/or ER retention sequence, here we produced and biochemically characterised four variants of BiP. The variants differed depending on the presence or the absence of signal and ER retention peptides. Proteins were purified using nickel affinity chromatography, and variant size and quality were confirmed using SDS/PAGE gels. The thermal denaturing temperature of these proteins was found to be 46-47 degrees C. In addition, we characterised nucleotide binding properties in the absence and the presence of divalent cations. Interestingly, in the absence of cations, ADP has a higher binding affinity to BiP than ATP. The presence of divalent cations results in a decrease of the K-d values of both ADP and ATP, indicating higher affinities of both nucleotides for BiP. ATPase assays were carried out to study the enzyme activity of these variants and to characterise the kinetic parameters of BiP variants. Variants with the signal sequence had higher specific activities than those without. Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ efficiently stimulated the ATPase activity of these variants at low micromolar concentrations, whereas calcium failed to stimulate BiP ATPase. Our novel findings indicate the potential functionality of BiP variants that retain a signal sequence, and also reveal the effect of physiological concentrations of cations on the nucleotide binding properties and enzyme activities of all variants.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,

73,"Protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 synthesizes the symmetric dimethylarginine in nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins such as histone H2A, H4 and several non-histone proteins that are required for a variety of biological processes. Currently, two splice variants (v1 and v2) of murine PRMT5 have been deposited in the NCBI sequence database, in which PRMT5-v1 and -v2 contain different 33 and 16 amino acids at the N-terminal sequences, respectively. Here we showed that murine PRMT5-v1 is stable, but PRMT5-v2 is constantly degraded through both the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagic-lysosomal pathway (ALP) in an N-terminal sequence-dependent manner. Furthermore, inhibition of UPS and ALP elevated the stability of PRMT5-v2 that made it localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In addition, PRMT5-v2 exhibited the enzyme activity to catalyze histone H2A and H4 methylation. Notably, we found that the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 specially recognizes the N-terminal sequence of PRMT5-v2 and the carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) is required for poly-ubiquitination and the degradation of PRMT5-v2. These results suggest that Hsp70/CHIP chaperone-mediated protein degradation system is crucial in the regulation of PRMT5-v2 turnover, which has the potential to balance the symmetrical arginine dimethylation in cells.

74,"Investigating the behaviour of bio-molecules through computational mutagenesis is gaining interest to facilitate the development of new therapeutic solutions for infectious diseases. The antigenetically variant genotypes of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) and their subsequent infections are challenging to tackle with traditional vaccination. In such scenario, neutralizing antibodies might provide an alternate solution to manage the FMDV infection. Thus, we have analysed the interaction of the mAb 4C4 with a synthetic G-H loop of FMDV-VP1 through in silico mutagenesis and molecular modelling. Initially, a set of 25,434 mutants were designed and the mutants having better energetic stability than 4C4 were clustered based on sequence identity. The best mutant representing each cluster was selected and evaluated for its binding affinity with the antigen in terms of docking scores, interaction energy and binding energy. Six mutants have confirmed better binding affinities towards the antigen than 4C4. Further, interaction of these mutants with the natural G-H loop that is bound to mAb SD6 was also evaluated. One 4C4 variant having mutations at the positions 2034(N -> L), 2096(N -> C), 2098(D -> Y), 2532(T -> K) and 2599(A -> G) has revealed better binding affinities towards both the synthetic and natural G-H loops than 4C4 and SD6, respectively. A molecular dynamic simulation for 50 ns was conducted for mutant and wild-type antibody structures which supported the pre-simulation results. Therefore, these mutations on mAb 4C4 are believed to provide a better antibody-based therapeutic option for FMD. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Measurements were carried out after irradiation of nanolayers in the U-150 cyclotron with 28-MeV protons. Nanolayers of molybdenum with thickness of 30 to 220 nm were produced by magnetron sputtering on sapphire plates. The yield of the mass of Mo-99 recoil atoms was found to be the highest with the molybdenum layer thickness of 80 +/- 5 nm. The enrichment factor (EF) has been defined as a ratio of the Mo-99 collector specific activity (SA) to the entire target SA before separation as EF = 1200 +/- 150.

As a capstone course, one goal of this course is to integrate knowledge from previous coursework in physiology, cell and molecular biology, genetics, and chemistry, so that students acquire a state-of-the-art understanding of cancer and cancer treatment. A related goal is for students to learn, from the primary literature, how science is performed and how new scientific knowledge is used to improve cancer treatment. We report on the development of this course and the methods used to accomplish the course goals. We present the results of a 5-year survey that provides a detailed picture of the demographics of the class and demonstrates that the course results in improved understanding of both cancer biology and how science is performed.

In the present paper, we use the quenching by a heavy atom (Br or I), situated at a known location along a phospholipid chain, as a probe of the location of a fluorescent moiety.

The latter halolipids were intercalated in turn with various fluorophores into DMPC liposomes, biomembranes and erythrocyte ghosts. The most effective fluorescence quenching occurs when the heavy atom location corresponds to that of the fluorophore. The results show that generally speaking the fluorophore intercalates the same depth independent of which lipid bilayer is used. KBr (or KI) is the most effective quencher when the fluorophore resides in or at the aqueous phase.

In the principal thalamorecipient sensory area of the Wulst, n. interstitialis hyperpallium apicale/hyperpallium intercalatum (IHA/HI), three discrete zones are identified: the two, containing punctate PV-ir neuropil and a densely packed population of mainly small PV-ir stellate and granular cells, and a single zone formed by punctate CB-ir neuropil and mainly CB-ir cells. The IHA/HI area is distinguished by a high CO activity. In the hyperpallium apicale (HA) and hyperpallium densocellulare (HD), PV-ir and CB-ir neurons of varied morphotypes are scattered diffusely throughout neuropil which is moderately immunoreactive to both calcium-binding proteins. These areas are characterized by the presence of large pyramidal-like and multipolar PV-ir and CB-ir neurons with long branched dendrites forming a cellular/fibrous layer in the superficial HA area. It is concluded that the thalamofugal visual pathway in the pigeon has two, PV- and CB-specific, channels.

84,"Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) has been proposed as a feature of pathogenesis of eosinophilic upper airway inflammation such as allergic rhinitis (AR). The measurement system for upper AHR ((U)AHR) in rodents is poorly developed, although measurements of nasal resistance have been reported. Here we assessed UAHR by direct measurement of swelling of the nasal mucosa induced by intranasal methacholine (MCh) using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Micro-CT analysis was performed in both naive and ovalbumin-induced AR mice following intranasal administration of MCh. The nasal cavity was segmented into two-dimensional horizontal and axial planes, and the data for nasal mucosa were acquired for the region of interest threshold. Then, a ratio between the nasal mucosa area and nasal cavity area was calculated as nasal mucosa index. Using our novel method, nasal cavity structure was clearly identified on micro-CT, and dose-dependent increased swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed upon MCh treatment. Moreover, the nasal mucosa index was significantly increased in AR mice compared to controls following MCh treatment, while ovalbumin administration did not affect swelling of the nasal mucosa in either group. This UAHR following MCh treatment was completely reversed by pretreatment with glucocorticoids.

89,"In the reaction between tryptophan indole-lyase (TIL) and a substrate containing a bad leaving group (L-serine), general acid catalysis is required for the group's elimination. During this stage, the proton originally bound to the C-alpha atom of the substrate is transferred to the leaving group, which is eliminated as a water molecule. As a result, the basic group that had accepted the C-alpha proton at the previous stage has to be involved in the catalytic stage following the elimination in its basic form. On the other hand, when the substrate contains a good leaving group (beta-chloro-L-alanine), general acid catalysis is not needed at the elimination stage and cannot be implemented, because there are no functional groups in enzymes whose acidity is strong enough to protonate the elimination of a base as weak as Cl- anion. Consequently, the group that had accepted the C-alpha proton does not lose its additional proton during the elimination stage and should take part in the subsequent stage in its acidic (not basic) form. To shed light on the mechanistic consequences of the changes in the ionic state of this group, we have considered the pH dependencies of the main kinetic parameters for the reactions of TIL with L-serine and beta-chloro-L-alanine and the kinetic isotope effects brought about by replacement of the ordinary water used as a solvent with (H2O)-H-2. We have found that in the reaction between TIL and beta-chloro-L-alanine, the aminoacrylate hydrolysis stage is sensitive to the solvent isotope effect, while in the reaction with L-serine it is not.

Uniformly sized Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) with an average diameter of 16 nm were decorated on the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass through the connection of hydrolyzed 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS) serving as a sensor substrate. Then, the surface was covered with a poly-l-lysine thin film, where mouse macrophage cells were successfully cultured. The morphology of the electrodes obtained was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, and their electrochemical properties were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A linear response was observed from the AuNPs/APTMS/ITO substrate with a sensitivity of 0.465 units per mg/l of H2O2, and a higher sensitivity of 207 units per mg/l of zymosan. Thereafter, a factor of 84 molecules of H2O2 produced by a single glycogen was estimated. The results demonstrated that the ECL response of this cell-based sensor quantitatively correlated with yielded ROSs during cell oxygen metabolism under the stimulation of zymosan. This work suggests that the prepared sensing matrix is efficient for monitoring the oxygen metabolism of living cells and can be applied in biological and clinical fields to provide significant information on the regular or abnormal function of cells.

92,"A number of proteins on the plasma membrane are modified by the glycolipid, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). These proteins are called GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) and approximately 150 proteins exist as GPI-anchored forms in mammals. Characteristics of GPI-APs include: 1) forming membrane domains with specific lipids such as sphingolipids and cholesterol on the cell membrane and 2) cleavage at the GPI moiety to release the protein from the cell surface. Since complete structures of GPI anchors were determined in 1988, genes involved in biosynthetic pathways and structural remodeling of GPI anchors have been identified. In recent years, structural remodeling of GPI has been shown to regulate quality control, transport and localization of GPI-APs. In addition, particular GPI-cleaving enzymes cause shedding of GPI-APs from the cell surface. Here, I introduce recent progress about the structural chemistry and cleaving mechanisms of GPI-anchors.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes
93,"To control a diesel engine in the process of testing, the principles of fuzzy output, which are widely used in fuzzy-logic controller development, could be applied. Controller's main task is to monitor an external object, in which case the behavior of the monitored object is described by the fuzzy rules. The most important application area of fuzzy sets theory is the fuzzy logic controllers. Their operation slightly differs from the operation of common controllers. In order to describe the system, the expert knowledge is used instead of differential equations. Control of the automation systems for engine testing (ATS), using fuzzy-logic controller, should be based on a knowledge database with fuzzy rules. Such database could be created with expert knowledge, neural network, or direct measuring method. Development of an adaptive control system for diesel engine testing process based on fuzzy logic allows to simplify system's structural components and to provide discrete control procedure with some uninterruptible properties, which could improve the control and reduce the scope of the knowledge database. Fuzzy logic makes it fairly simple to input a priory information about an object in the form of fuzzy control rules into the adaptive control system. Similarity of form and natural language relatively easy allows to obtain necessary expert knowledge. A prior information provides one of the key initial conditions of the system developed according to adaptive control method - the condition of supreme initial adaptation.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
94,"Archaerhodopsins (ARs) is one of the members of microbial rhodopsins. Threonine 164 (T164) and serine 165 (S165) residues of the AR from Halorubrum sp. ejinoor (HeAR) are fully conserved in ARs, although they are far from the proton transfer channel and the retinal Schiff base, and are likely involved in a hydrogen-bonding network at the end of the Helix E where most microbial rhodopsins assume a ""bent structure"". In the present work, T164 and/or S165 were replaced with an alanine (A), and the photocycles of the mutants were analyzed with flash photolysis. The amino acid replacements caused profound changes to the photocycle of HeAR including prolonged photocycle, accelerated decay of M intermediate and appearance of additional two intermediates which were evident in T164A- and T164A/S165A-HeAR photocyles. These results suggest that although T164 and S165 are located at the far end of the photoactive center, these two amino acid residues are important for maintaining the fast turnover of the HeAR photocycle. The underlying molecular mechanisms are discussed in relation to hydrogen-bonding networks involving these two amino acids.

95,"The most preferred antenatal screening test is first trimester dual test which has a detection rate of 95% for foetal chromosomal anomaly. Maternal serum free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (free beta hCG) and pregnancy associated plasma protein A are used in first trimester dual test along with maternal demographic and foetal sonographic indices to calculate risk for foetal aneuploidy. Human placental lactogen is a placental hormone that is present in maternal serum only during pregnancy and its level rises in relation to the growth of the foetus and placenta. The objectives of this study was to measure and correlate maternal serum hPL with free beta hCG, maternal age, maternal age related risk ratio and calculated risk ratio of first trimester screening. After obtaining permission from the Institutional Ethics Committee, hPL and free beta hCG were measured from the serum of 84 pregnant women aged 20-40years in 11-13th weeks+6days of gestation who underwent dual test during their antenatal check-up. Independent t test, Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation, Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA were used wherever appropriate. A significant positive correlation between maternal serum hPL, maternal age related aneuploidy risk ratio (p value<0.001) and aneuploidy risk ratio at the time of delivery (p value<0.001) was observed. Also maternal age was negatively correlated with maternal serum hPL (p value<0.001) and positively correlated with maternal serum free beta hCG (p value 0.023). A significant negative correlation between maternal serum hPL and free beta hCG (p value<0.001) was found. To conclude low level of maternal serum hPL in advanced maternal age may reflect decreased functional syncytiotrophoblast mass which may predispose to adverse pregnancy outcome. As chance of baby born with chromosomal anomaly is known to increase with advancing maternal age, hPL may have role in first trimester screening.",yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no
96,"Using genetic engineering methods we have developed expression vectors for synthesis of recombinant proteins TnaCheY and TnaCheY-mut, the homologues of the chemotaxis protein CheY from the hyperthermophilic organism Thermotoga naphthophila in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells.

The influence of episomal expression of the heterologous chemotaxis protein CheY on growth kinetics parameters of the culture of mesophilic bacteria E. coli was investigated. The optimal purification flowchart of the obtained proteins using thermolysis has been proposed. Based on the data obtained, we discuss potential areas of application of recombinant variants of the CheY thermostable chemotactic protein.

97,"Shared resource laboratories (SRLs) offer instrumentation, training, and support to investigators and play an important role in the progress and development of science. To facilitate daily tasks and to provide an effective service, we have made use of computer scripts; a list of computer commands that are processed sequentially, to automate tasks in our flow cytometry facility. Using Python and an application programming interface (API), we automate user communication and produce a daily schedule display screen. We exploit the accessible nature of open standards to use R and Python to analyze and backup data from the BD Influx cell sorter. Finally, we show that through simple scripting, we can add value to an existing service by producing sort statistics from the Beckman Coulter XDP cell sorter. With these five examples, we demonstrate and wish to inspire other SRLs that the use of scripts helps to improve work efficiency, can solve problems, and can enhance the service provided by the SRL.

98,"Mefunidone (MFD) is a promising anti-fibrotic candidate molecule with greater anti-fibrotic activity than pirfenidone (PFD). However, there has been no report on the methodology used for the quantification of MFD or on any investigation of its pharmacokinetics. In this study, an efficient and reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to assay MFD in monkey plasma. This assay method was validated and applied to a pharmacokinetics study in monkeys. The lower limit of quantification of this assay was 0.1 mu g center dot mL(-1), and the linear calibration curve was acquired with R-2 > 0.99 between 0.1 and 60 mu g center dot mL(-1). The intra-day and inter-day precision were evaluated with coefficient of variations of 1.5%-5.8%, whereas the mean accuracy ranged from 91.7% to 106.9%. A negligible matrix effect and good recovery were obtained using this assay, with average extraction recoveries of MFD and the internal standard (IS) in the range of 85.5%-124.8% and 84.1%-94.0%, respectively. The precision of the absolute matrix effect of MFD and the IS was 1.2-3.0% and 1.2-7.3%, respectively. The samples were stable under all experimental conditions. Linear pharmacokinetics were observed for MFD in monkeys, where the exposures of MFD increased proportionally with increasing MFD doses at the range of 10-90 mg center dot kg(-1). Moderate elimination of MFD from the body was observed, with t(1/2) of 5-7 h, and the elimination rate of MFD was stable during multiple dosing. In conclusion, this method provides an reliable analytical approach for quantification of MFD in plasma and was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetics study in monkeys.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no
99,"Recent advances in synthesizing methodologies and purification techniques significantly increase the accessibility of the major glycan structures, which are heterogeneously present on the glycoproteins and glycolipids. In contrast, it is often difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of minor structures consisting of a number of sugar units with reasonable purity sufficient for biological studies. In terms of the accessibility of the desired glycan sequences, it is useful in certain instances to deal with not the full sequence but with the required oligosaccharides, called glycan epitopes. Glycan epitopes have been used for the structural and functional analysis of the proteins that recognize particular glycans. For instance, lectins usually recognize the glycan epitope of a few sugar units, not in a ""key-and-keyhole"" manner but in a ""pattern recognition receptor"" mode. Such oligosaccharide epitopes can be prepared through regular chemical synthesis.
