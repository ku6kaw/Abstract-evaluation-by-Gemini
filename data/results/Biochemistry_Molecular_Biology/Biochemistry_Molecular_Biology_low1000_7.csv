0,"The lipophilization of beta -d-riboguanosine (1) with various symmetric as well as asymmetric ketones is described (-> 3a-3f). The formation of the corresponding O-2 ' ,3 ' -ketals is accompanied by the appearance of various fluorescent by-products which were isolated chromatographically as mixtures and tentatively analyzed by ESI-MS spectrometry. The mainly formed guanosine nucleolipids were isolated and characterized by elemental analyses, H-1-, C-13-NMR and UV spectroscopy. For a drug profiling, static topological polar surface areas as well as (10)logP(OW) values were calculated by an increment-based method as well as experimentally for the systems 1-octanol-H2O and cyclohexane-H2O. The guanosine-O-2 ' ,3 ' -ketal derivatives 3b and 3a could be crystallized in (D-6)DMSO - the latter after one year of standing at ambient temperature. X-ray analysis revealed the formation of self-assembled ribbons consisting of two structurally similar 3b nucleolipid conformers as well as integrated (D-6)DMSO molecules. In the case of 3a.DMSO, the ribbon is formed by a single type of guanosine nucleolipid molecules. The crystalline material 3b.DMSO was further analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-dependent polarization microscopy. Crystallization was also performed on interdigitated electrodes (Au, distance, 5 mu m) and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Resistance and amperage measurements clearly demonstrate that the electrode-bridging 3b crystals are electrically conducting. All O-2 ' ,3 ' -guanosine ketals were tested on their cytostatic/cytotoxic activity towards phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated human THP-1 macrophages as well as against human astrocytoma/oligodendroglioma GOS-3 cells and against rat malignant neuroectodermal BT4Ca cells.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,
1,"The publication of unfounded health claims on small molecules in peer-reviewed scientific literature is a problem that requires attention. It undermines the evidence-based decision making processes of modern-day society, weakens the credibility of the scientific enterprise, and diverts resources to futile research efforts. In the present essay we discuss some human and scientific causes behind the issue. We propose a number of actions to be taken up by scientists, referees and publishers. One particularly important factor is the issue of enigmatic compound behavior in biological assays. We therefore also introduce the idea of biological filters, a pattern recognition method to triage enigmatic compounds into valuable hits and false positives, based on the entirety of their biological effects in cell-based systems.",yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,,
2,"University lectures are mainly passive in nature, and there are few subjects in which students need to learn and function independently. Tutorial education and related activities at universities that specialize in medical and pharmaceutical training have been actively carried out, and lectures in conjunction with practical skills are gradually being developed, although progress has been slow in this area. In past years, our biochemistry practice classes have been evaluated in reports dealing with experiments and written examinations, as is done in other universities. However, using this methodology, we are not able to evaluate the extent to which students master biochemical experimental skills. To address this, we introduced a basic skill test to our biochemical curriculum for the first time. Our exams contributed to a deeper understanding of student skills and could be good tools for evaluating the degree of understanding of the students. The students understood the contents of the training well and felt interested in research in the field of basic medicine. Thus, we conclude that introducing practical testing to biochemical practice was effective for medical students in the field of biochemistry.

3,"Antithrombin III (AT3) belongs to the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) and is a major anticoagulant in physiological conditions. Based on SERPINC1 gene, a minigene coding for human AT3, which is valuable for medicine and biotechnology, was constructed by minimizing the size of lengthy introns and preserving the splicing site-flanking sequences. An analysis of the minigene splicing pattern identified one correct AT3 transcript and two alternatively spliced transcripts, which formed either due to minigene exons 2 and 3 skipping or an aberrant exon insertion via splicing at cryptic splicing sites in intron 1 of the minigene. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cryptic splicing sites successfully optimized the splicing pattern of the AT3 minigene to completely prevent the generation of the alternative transcripts. The presence of the cryptic splicing sites in intron 1 of the minigene was confirmed with Human Splicing Finder v. 3.1 software, thus demonstrating that putative alternative splicing sites are possible to identify in minimized or hybrid introns of minigenes and to eliminate via mutagenesis before experimentally testing the minigene splicing patterns.

6,"Background and aims Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most prevalent clinical manifestation of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several candidate genes have been suggested to be involved in the genetic susceptibility or resistance in the development of UC. Among them, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15) have been reported in association with IBD in several studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of TNFSF15 gene polymorphisms located in the promoter region, including rs6478108 (G/A -9706) and rs3810936 (G/A -15524) in Iranian patients with UC. Methods In this way, the two single nucleotide polymorphisms were studied in 115 patients with UC and 115 healthy controls with the same ethnic group from south-west of Iran. The genomic DNA of samples was genotyped using TaqMan Real-time PCR assay. This case-control study was conducted at the Department of Immunology, Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. Results and conclusion Our results did not confirm the formerly reported association of the studied polymorphisms with UC disease in comparison with healthy controls, neither with the type of the clinical forms of Colitis in the studied Iranian population. Comparing the genotype frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6478108, wild-type homozygous and heterozygote and mutant homozygote were 33%, 55.7%, and 11.3% in cases vs. 34.8%, 50.4%, and 14.8% in the controls (P = 0.6). The genotype frequency of SNP rs3810936 were 20.9%, 40.9%, and 38.2% in the cases compared to 18.3%, 44.3%, and 37.4% in controls, which was not significant (P = 0.8).

7,"A framework to simulate physiologically structured population (PSP) models on high performance compute (HPC) infrastructure is built. Based on the model of a single cell, billions of cells can be simulated in an efficient way, allowing fast simulation of the interaction of an entire organ with other body parts. Through combination of three state-of-the-art algorithms, the simulation time is decreased with multiple orders of magnitude. First: PSP modelling exploits the fact that a lot of the cells behave identically at the same time which results in multiple orders of magnitude speed-up. The second speed-up is achieved by using an unconditionally stable, partial differential equation solver which allows big time-stepping by trading off speed with precision. The third speed-up is due to the fact that the framework is designed with HPC cluster use in mind. The PSP simulator is mathematically derived to have maximal stability.

The regulation of nAChRs has been mainly studied in vertebrates, especially in mammals. Here, two types of nAChRs were found present in the locust Locusta migratoria manilensis dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons, -bungarotoxin (-Bgt)-sensitive nAChRs and -Bgt-resistant nAChRs, responding to acetylcholine (ACh) at different concentrations. The homologs to three mammalian nAChR regulators, ubiquilin-1, CRELD2 (cysteine-rich with EFG-like domain 2), and PICK1 (protein interacting with PRKCA 1), were characterized in L.migratoria, and their functions on regulating native nAChRs were investigated via RNAi followed by membrane potential measurement with DiBAC(4)(3) and agonist-evoked macroscopic current recording in cultured L.migratoria DUM neurons. Ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 negatively regulated nAChRs because silencing of ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 both resulted in increased membrane potential and increased inward currents in DUM neurons, while CRELD2 positively regulated nAChRs as decreased membrane potential and inward currents were observed in DUM neurons. In addition, ubiquilin-1 regulated both -Bgt-sensitive and -Bgt-resistant types of nAChRs whereas PICK1 and CRELD2 regulated only the -Bgt-resistant nAChRs.

16,"Adenylate cyclase III (AC3) is an important component of odorant perception signaling in the olfactory system. The thinness of main olfactory epithelium (MOE) become thin with ageing, and the gene expression profile alters after AC3 deletion. DNA methylation plays a key role in animal development and regulation of gene expression. In the present study, whether the DNA methylation level of gene promoter, as well as their associations with the expression of the genes in MOE will be altered after AC3 deletion, was investigated by using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation chip (MeDIP-chip), methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and realtime fluorescence quantification PCR. The data showed that the DNA methylation levels of promoters of 1 978 genes were altered in AC3-deficient mice, accounting for 9% of the total number of genes. Of which 727 genes with their promoter's DNA methylation levels were elevated, 1 251 genes with their promoter's methylation levels were lowered. The functions of these genes are mainly involved with olfactory receptor, neurodevelopmental, cAMP signaling pathway, ATP-binding, calcium regulation, acetylation modification, and transcription factors. It was further confirmed by MSP that methylation levels of promoter of the olfactory receptor genes Olfr1153, Olfr231, Olfr378, Olfr651 and Olfr691 were increased, whereas methylation level of the promoters of Cngb1, Pde4a and Olfr1394 were decreased.

In this study, the effect of glycosphingolipid GM1 on the contact inhibition of human mammary epithelial cell lines MCF-10A, human breast cancer cell lines BT-549 and SK-BR-3 were investigated. Changes of cell proliferation of MCF-10A, BT-549 and SK-BR-3 cells at low and high cell density was explored. Expression of GM1 in different cell density was detected by flow cytometry. Exogenous GM1 at different cell density was added to explore the effect on cell proliferation.

Then, proliferating ability were tested by cell counting and related pathways was assayed by Western blot, in stable-transfected cell lines. Results showed cell proliferation was inhibited and GM1 expression increased at low and high cell density compared with normal density. Exogenous addition of GM1 at low and high density cells inhibited cell growth, but it had no influence on cell growth at normal density. Down regulation of GM1 promoted cell proliferation at low and high cell density, and overexpression of GM1 had the opposite effect.

Manual curation is used to establish whether the literature and the records are indeed consistent. We explore in this paper an automated method for assessing the consistency of biological assertions, to assist biocurators, which we call BARC, Biocuration tool for Assessment of Relation Consistency. In this method a biological assertion is represented as a relation between two objects (for example, a gene and a disease); we then use our novel set-based relevance algorithm SaBRA to retrieve pertinent literature, and apply a classifier to estimate the likelihood that this relation (assertion) is correct.ResultsOur experiments on assessing gene-disease relations and protein-protein interactions using the PubMed Central collection show that BARC can be effective at assisting curators to perform data cleansing. Specifically, the results obtained showed that BARC substantially outperforms the best baselines, with an improvement of F-measure of 3.5% and 13%, respectively, on gene-disease relations and protein-protein interactions. We have additionally carried out a feature analysis that showed that all feature types are informative, as are all fields of the documents.ConclusionsBARC provides a clear benefit for the biocuration community, as there are no prior automated tools for identifying inconsistent assertions in large-scale biological databases.",yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,

In conjunction with the 2018 International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO-2018), the 2nd International Workshop on Cells in ExperimentaL Life Science (CELLS-2018) focused on two themes of knowledge representation, for newly-discovered cell types and for cells in disease states. This workshop included five oral presentations and a general discussion session. Two new ontologies, including the Cancer Cell Ontology (CCL) and the Ontology for Stem Cell Investigations (OSCI), were reported in the workshop. In another representation, the Cell Line Ontology (CLO) framework was applied and extended to represent cell line cells used in China and their Chinese representation. Other presentations included a report on the application of ontologies to cross-compare cell types and marker patterns used in flow cytometry studies, and a presentation on new experimental findings about novel cell types based on single cell RNA sequencing assay and their corresponding ontological representation.

26,"Background/Aims: The expression of transcription factor Zbtb1 is essential for the maintenance and development of various blood cells in the hematopoietic system. In the current study, we found that the total number of thymocytes in PLZF deficient mice was reduced compared with thymocytes in wild-type mice, and the number of early T-cell progenitors decreased. However, the decrease of thymocytes in PLZF deficient mice was not cell intrinsic. This study adds new information regarding the regulation of the PLZF gene in the development and self-renewal of T cells. Methods: The thymus was isolated from newborn mice, and the two lobes of each thymus were physically separated. Each host received a thymus, two lobes, each placed at one end of the kidney, as described in the literature. Tail vein blood was periodically collected from some of the recipients and analyzed for the presence of peripheral blood T cells. Results: In PLZF-EGFP reporter mice and neonatal thymus transplantation to the kidney, we found that PLZF was highly expressed in DN1 (Lineage(-)CD44(+)CD2(-)) cells of thymic grafts of Rag2/gamma c(-/)(-) recipient mice. We found that the proportion of PLZF wild-type and mutant-derived cells in the thymocytes of recipient mice after bone marrow transplantation is approximately equal to the competitive bone marrow chimeric mouse model, and all mice contain a normal thymus. Conclusion: The development of T cells suggests that the effect of the PLZF gene on T cell differentiation and development is not cell intrinsic. However, in the neonatal mouse thymic transplant model in the Rag2/gamma c-/- recipient mouse, deletion of the PLZF gene results in a significant decrease in the proportion of DN1 cells from the donor in the thymic graft.

28,"Motivation: Protein function is regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that may act individually or interact with others in a phenomenon termed PTM cross-talk. Multiple databases have been dedicated to PTMs, including recent initiatives oriented towards the in silico prediction of PTM interactions. The study of PTM cross-talk ultimately requires experimental evidence about whether certain PTMs coexist in a single protein molecule. However, available resources do not assist researchers in the experimental detection of co-modified peptides. Results: Herein, we present TCellXTalk, a comprehensive database of phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation sites in human T cells that supports the experimental detection of co-modified peptides using targeted or directed mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of TCellXTalk and the strategy presented here in a proof of concept experiment that enabled the identification and quantification of 15 co-modified (phosphorylated and ubiquitinated) peptides from CD3 proteins of the T-cell receptor complex. To our knowledge, these are the first co-modified peptide sequences described in this widely studied cell type. Furthermore, quantitative data showed distinct dynamics for co-modified peptides upon T cell activation, demonstrating differential regulation of co-occurring PTMs in this biological context. Overall, TCellXTalk facilitates the experimental detection of co-modified peptides in human T cells and puts forward a novel and generic strategy for the study of PTM cross-talk.

Here, we show that reconstituted in vitro RNPs containing linear RmInt1 Delta ORF RNA can mediate the cleavage of single-stranded DNA substrates in a very precise manner with the attachment of the intron RNA to the 3 ' exon as the first step of a reverse splicing reaction. Notably, we also observe molecules in which the 5 ' exon is linked to the RmInt1 RNA, suggesting the completion of the reverse splicing reaction, albeit rather low and inefficiently.

In this article, we focus on the comparison of asynchrony of division, that is, difference of lifetime, between sister cells (ADS) among wild-type and mutant individuals of Caenorhabditis elegans. On the one hand, due to extreme imbalance between wild-type individuals and mutant-type samples, direct comparison of two distributions of ADS between wild type and mutant type is not feasible.

Hence, a semiparametric Bayesian quantile regression method where lifetime of the mother cell is taken as covariate is developed to estimate the 95% confidence curve of ADS in wild type and then ADS of mutant type is classified as abnormal if outside the corresponding confidence interval.

34,"Foliar uptake of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is governed by its reactive absorption mechanism, by which NO2 molecules diffuse through cell wall layers and simultaneously react with apoplastic ascorbate to form nitrous acid, which freely diffuses across plasmalemma. However, whether free diffusion of nitrous acid is the sole mechanism of foliar uptake of NO2 remains unknown. The involvement of ammonia-inhibitable nitrite transporters in the foliar uptake of NO2, as reported in nitrite transport in Arabidopsis roots, is also unknown. In this study, we treated Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with methionine sulfoximine (MSX) to inhibit incorporation of ammonia into glutamate and exposed them to 4 ppm N-15-labeled NO2 for 4 h in light followed by quantification of total nitrogen, reduced nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen derived from NO2 using mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis. The total nitrogen derived from NO2 in leaves without MSX treatment was 587.0 nmol NO2/g fresh weight, of which more than 65% was recovered as reduced nitrogen. In comparison, MSX treatment decreased the total nitrogen and reduced nitrogen derived from NO2 by half. Thus, half of the foliar uptake of NO2 is not attributable to passive diffusion of nitrous acid but to ammonia-inhibitable nitrite transport.

38,"Background: Cases of sensory loss provide an excellent model to study the plastic nature of cortical sensory systems. Models of reversible sensory loss are particularly useful for establishing the timeline of various critical periods for cortical plasticity. However, there currently is an absence of adequate methods to produce reversible hearing loss in neonatal and developing rodents. New method: We propose a novel and reversible adaptation of an existing surgical technique-external auditory canal ligation (EACL)-that produces a reliable and moderate hearing loss. Results: Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were used to measure both the magnitude of the hearing loss induced by EACL and the auditory thresholds following hearing restoration. The EACL and reopening procedures, as assessed by visual inspection, had success rates of 81% and 78%, respectively. The average hearing thresholds, as assessed with ABRs, increased by nearly 40 decibels across all tested frequencies. Hearing thresholds returned to normal levels following the reopening procedure. Comparison with existing methods: Our procedure yields similar benefits to other methods, such as producing a reliable and moderate hearing loss that is entirely reversible. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first that can be performed in neonatal rodents, thus allowing researchers the opportunity to assess the effects of sensory loss on behavior and cortical neurophysiology during developmental critical periods.

40,"Tuning curves characterizing the response selectivities of biological neurons can exhibit large degrees of irregularity and diversity across neurons. Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or partially random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. Empirical tuning curve distributions can thus be utilized to make model-based inferences about the statistics of single-cell parameters and network connectivity. However, a general framework for such an inference or fitting procedure is lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network models as implicit generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly available or is highly intractable. Recent advances in machine learning provide ways for fitting implicit generative models without the need to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic circuit models in theoretical neuroscience to datasets of tuning curves. This fitting procedure avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, such as the biophysical parameters of, or synaptic connections between, particular recorded cells. Instead, it directly learns generalizable model parameters characterizing the network's statistical structure such as the statistics of strength and spatial range of connections between different cell types. Another strength of this approach is that it fits the joint high-dimensional distribution of tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary statistics picked a priori by the user, resulting in a more accurate inference of circuit properties. More generally, this framework opens the door to direct model-based inference of circuit structure from data beyond single-cell tuning curves, such as simultaneous population recordings. Author summary Neurons in the brain respond selectively to some stimuli or for some motor outputs, but not others. Even within a local brain network, neurons exhibit great diversity in their selectivity patterns. Recently, theorists have highlighted the computational importance of diverse neural selectivity. While many mechanistic circuit models are highly stylized and do not capture such diversity, models that feature biologically realistic heterogeneity in their structure do generate responses with diverse selectivities. However, traditionally only the average pattern of selectivity is matched between model and experimental data, and the distribution around the mean is ignored. Here, we provide a hitherto lacking methodology that exploits the full empirical and model distributions of response selectivites, in order to infer various structural circuit properties, such as the statistics of strength and spatial range of connections between different cell types. By applying this method to fit two circuit models from theoretical neuroscience to experimental or simulated data, we show that the proposed method can accurately and robustly infer circuit structure, and optimize a model to match the full range of observed response selectivities.

49,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are the most common form of cytotoxic DNA damage. Since AP sites inhibit DNA replication and transcription, repairing them is critical for cell growth. However, the significance of repairing AP sites during early embryonic development has not yet been clearly determined. Here, we focused on APEX1 from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis (CiApex1), a homolog of human AP endonuclease 1 (APEX1), and examined its role in early embryonic development. Recombinant CiApex1 protein complemented the drug sensitivities of an AP endonuclease-deficient Escherichia coli mutant, and exhibited Me dependent AP endonuclease activity, like human APEX1, in vitro. Next, the effects of abnormal AP site repair on embryonic development were investigated. Treatment with methyl methanesulfonate, which alkylates DNA bases and generates AP sites, induced abnormal embryonic development. This abnormal phenotype was also caused by treatment with methoxyamine, which inhibits AP endonuclease activity. Furthermore, we constructed dominant-negative CiApex1, which inhibits CiApex1 action, and found that its expression impaired embryonic growth. These results suggested that AP site repair is essential for embryonic development and CiApex1 plays an important role in AP site repair during early embryonic development in C. intestinalis.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,,

The aim of the present in vitro study was to test the effect of the mucoadhesive agent hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) added to a liquid phase herbal extract formulation on the mucoadhesive retention of the active ingredients and their effect against malodour production. Experimental oral biofilms were grown on mucin coated glass slides treated with liquid phase solutions of herbal extract with or without HEC as well as saline and 0.2% chlorhexidine as controls. Biofilms were quantified for volatile sulfide compounds (VSC) producing bacteria using CLSM and sampled for a salivary incubation assay to test for malodour production (odour judge), VSC production (Halimeter) and salivary protein degradation (SDS-PAGE). Results showed that the addition of HEC to the herbal extracts solution has significantly increased its mucin retained activity against malodour producing bacteria and their resulting malodour and VSC production and proteolytic activities.

In this regard, the aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory and apoptotic effects of a mannan-mitomycin-C conjugate on transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and normal mouse L929 fibroblast cells. Methods: The conjugate was synthesized according to previous studies. Both cell lines were cultured and the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of the compounds in different concentrations were assessed using MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. The mannan-mitomycin C conjugate inhibited proliferation of both cell lines in time and concentration -dependent manners. Results: The conjugate inhibited TCC cell proliferation more than that of L929 cells. Mitomycin C alone inhibited proliferation of both cell lines in both time and concentration -dependent manners, and the effect was greater on L929 than on TCC cells. Mannan had a relatively low inhibitory effect on TCC and no significant effect on L929 cells. The percentage of apoptosis was greater in TCCs than in L929 cells at the highest concentration of conjugate. Mitomycin C induced apoptosis more extensively in L929 cells than in TCC cells at 25 and 400 mu m/ml. The effect of mannan was similar on both cell lines.

The levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites, dioxyphenylacetic (DOPAC), homovanillic (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic (5-HIAA) acids, were determined by HPLC in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of the right and left sides of the brain. Control mice kept both in the group and under conditions of social isolation had a higher DA content in the left cerebral cortex. In the other brain structures the monoamine content was symmetric. In the cerebral cortex of mice kept in the group, acute hypoxia with hypercapnia resulted in a right-sided increase in the DA and 5-HT levels. At the same time, the DOPAC content decreased in the left cortex. In mice kept in the group hypoxia with hypercapnia conditions increased the DA level in the left hippocampus. In the striatum, the content of monoamines and their metabolites remained insignificantly changed. In animals kept for a long time under the conditions of social isolation, hypoxia with hypercapnia did not cause any statistically significant changes in the monoamines and their metabolites levels.

The LXR cDNA consisted of 1495bp encoding a putative LXR protein of 494 amino acids. The Asian seabass LXR retained many important structural features found in LXRs of other fishes and mammals, such as putative signal peptide, activation function-1 (AF-1) domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD), ligand-binding domain (LBD), activation function-2 (AF-2) domain, and eight conserved cysteine residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of LXR shared significant identity with those of other species ranging from 65.7 to 95.8%. The homology modeling and in silico molecular docking demonstrated that Asian seabass LXR could interact with cholesterol derivatives at amino acid residues Phe274 and Ile312. Real-time PCR further revealed that LXR transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest levels detected in the gonad followed by the liver.

60,"In the multistage process of carcinogenesis, invasion of malignant cells into normal tissue and their distribution as well as the degree of tissue destruction are the key links in tumor growth and progression. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator system (uPA system) plays the most important role in the development of these processes. The uPA system consists of several components: serine proteinaseuPA, its receptor uPAR and its two endogenous inhibitors - PAI-1 and PAI-2. The role of uPA, a highly specific protease, consists in triggering the processes performed by the uPA system, which result in destruction of connective tissue matrix (CTM) and basal membranes as well as activation of numerous extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways. uPA converts plasminogen into plasmin and in addition to the regulation of fibrinolysis, it can hydrolyze a number of CTM components and activate zymogens of secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MM?s)pro-MM?s. MM?s can hydrolyze all the main CTM components and thus play a key role in the development of invasive processes, as well as to perform regulatory functions by activating and releasing from CTM a number of biologically active molecules involved in the regulation of the main processes of carcinogenesis. uPA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 not only regulate uPA/uPAR activity; they are also involved in proliferation, apoptosis, chemotaxis, adhesion, migration, and activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways. All the above mentioned processes are aimed at regulating invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. The components of the uPA system are used as prognostic and diagnostic markers of many cancers, as well as serve as targets for anticancer therapy.

Materials and methods: Biosamples from stock solution were reconstituted to a concentration 10(8) cfu/mL followed by the spectrophotometric measurement of the yield and purity of acquired DNA. Twelve wet and 12 dry PCR studies of four various DNA dilution samples were performed for each three target gene (cap, pag, sap) of B. anthracis. Results: Significant differences for both DNA yields and purity were found between liquid-agar and liquid-spore samples. No significant difference was observed between wet and dry PCR in concentration of 2.5 ng/mu L DNA for all gene regions. PCR results of sap gene region with DNA concentrations of 1.5 ng/mu L and 0.9 ng/mu L was found statistically significant in favor of conventional wet PCR method (p = 0.047 and p <= 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: It is concluded that B. anthracis cultivated in liquid medium is more usable than vegetative or spore form obtained on plate agar for proper DNA extraction.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,,,,
74,"A way to enhance our understanding of the development and progression of complex diseases is to investigate the influence of cellular environments on gene co-expression (i.e. gene-pair correlations). Often, changes in gene co-expression are investigated across two or more biological conditions defined by categorizing a continuous covariate. However, the selection of arbitrary cut-off points may have an influence on the results of an analysis. To address this issue, we use a general linear model (GLM) for correlated data to study the relationship between gene-module co-expression and a covariate like metabolite concentration. The GLM specifies the gene-pair correlations as a function of the continuous covariate. The use of the GLM allows for investigating different (linear and non-linear) patterns of co-expression. Furthermore, the modeling approach offers a formal framework for testing hypotheses about possible patterns of co-expression. In our paper, a simulation study is used to assess the performance of the GLM. The performance is compared with that of a previously proposed GLM that utilizes categorized covariates. The versatility of the model is illustrated by using a real-life example.

76,"BackgroundShort hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) expressed from vectors have been used as an effective means of exploiting the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in mammalian cells. Of several methods to express shRNA, a method of transcribing shRNAs embedded in microRNA precursors has been more widely used than the one that directly expresses shRNA from RNA polymerase III promoters because the microRNA precursor form of shRNA is known to cause lower levels of cytotoxicity and off-target effects than the overexpressed shRNAs from the RNA polymerase III promoters.ObjectiveWe study the primary sequence features of microRNA precursors, which enhance their processing into mature form, helps design more potent shRNA precursors embedded in microRNA precursors.MethodsWe measure the enhancement of gene knockdown efficiency by adding CNNC motifs in the 3 flanking region of shRNA precursor embedded in the human miR-30a microRNA precursor.ResultsBy systemically adding three CNNC motifs in the 3 flanking region of shRNA precursor, we found that addition of two CNNC motifs saturates their enhanced knockdown ability of shRNA and that the CNNC motif in the +17 to +20 from the drosha cleavage site is most important for the shRNA-mediated target gene knock down. We also did see little knockdown of target gene expression by the shRNA precursor lacking CNNC motif.ConclusionSince genetic studies generally require techniques that could reduce gene expression at different degrees, the findings in this study will allow us to use RNAi for genetic studies of reducing gene expression at different degrees.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,,

The biological function of a protein depends on its tertiary structure which is determined by its amino acid sequence via the process of protein folding. We propose a novel fold recognition method for protein tertiary structure prediction based on a hidden Markov model and 3D coordinates of amino acid residues. The method introduces states based on the basis vectors in Bravais cubic lattices to learn the path of amino acids of the proteins of each fold. Three hidden Markov models are considered based on simple cubic, body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) lattices. A 10-fold cross validation was performed on a set of 42 fold SCOP dataset. The proposed composite methodology is compared to fold recognition methods which have HMM as base of their algorithms having approaches on only amino acid sequence or secondary structure. The accuracy of proposed model based on face-centered cubic lattices is quite better in comparison with SAM, 3-HMM optimized and Markov chain optimized in overall experiment.

We previously demonstrated the effect of peptoid residue modification on these DOTA side arms, thereby conferring diverse physiochemical properties to the imaging mechanism. We generated two on-bead Eu(III)-DOTA libraries with three side arm modifications, where the remaining arm was used to attach DOTA onto the resin.

Till date, globins have been characterized predominantly from bacteria involved in pathogenicity, nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, where they are implicated in bacterial virulence within the host, protection of nitrogenase from oxygen inactivation and prevention of oxidative damage to the photosynthetic machinery respectively. Myxococcus xanthus, the model myxobacterium, is an obligate aerobe with a multicellular stage in its life cycle where cells encounter oxygen limitation. This work was undertaken to investigate the potential role of the truncated globin in M. xanthus. To examine the role of globins in this unique group of bacteria, the gene coding for a putative truncated globin (HbO) was identified in the genome of M. xanthus DK 1622. The sequence analysis by bioinformatics approaches revealed that HbO from M. xanthus (Mx-HbO) likely adopts a 2-on-2 alpha helical fold of the truncated globins. The gene coding for Mx-HbO was cloned and its expression in E. coli imparted reddish tinge to the cells. The spectral analysis confirmed it to be a functional globin. The expression of Mx-HbO in the heterologous host improved its growth, resulting in the attainment of higher cell density in culture. The transcript of Mx-hbO was induced threefold in the host cells when grown under low aeration condition as compared to the cells grown under high aeration condition. In M. xanthus, an obligate aerobe, where cell growth accompanies swarming, there is a higher density of cells in the middle of the swarm.

Using the method of automated solid-phase peptide synthesis, we obtained a synthetic agonist of galanin receptors GalR1-3 [Ala14, His15]-galanin (2-15) (G), exhibiting cardioprotective properties. It was purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The homogeneity and structure of the peptide were confirmed by HPLC, H-1-NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of G on metabolism and cardiac function of rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) caused by Dox. Experiments were performed using male Wistar rats weighing 280-300 g. The control group of animals (C) was intraperitoneally treated with saline for 8 weeks; the doxorubicin group (D) of rats was intraperitoneally treated with Do?; the group Do? + peptide G (D + G) of rats received intraperitoneal injections of Do? and subcutaneously injections of peptide G; the peptide G group (G) was subcutaneously treated with G. At the beginning and at the end of the study, the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and the activity of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) were determined in blood plasma; the animals were weighed, and cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography. At the end of the experiments, the hearts were used for determination of metabolites and assessment of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. After the 8-week treatment, animals of group D were characterized by severe heart failure, the lack of weight gain and an increase in plasma TBARS concentration and CK-MB activity. These impairments were accompanied by a decrease in the content of myocardial high-energy phosphates, a reduction in mitochondrial respiratory acid parameters, accumulation of lactate and glucose in the heart, and altered metabolism of alanine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Coadministration of G and Dox prevented the increase in plasma CK-MB activity and significantly reduced the plasma TBARS concentration.

Based on the perception-behavior link, the Motor Match Hypothesis proposed that Mirror Neuron System (MNS) is the core mechanism of emotional mimicry. However, more and more researchers argued that emotional mimicry is not a simple kind of behavioral imitation, proposing the Emotion Mimicry in Context View, emphasizing on the importance of social context, such as the relationship between actor and observer. What important is the activation of the MNS alone is not sufficient to explain the social dimension of facial mimicry. In addition to neural activation in brain regions attributed to the MNS, the multiple neuroimaging studies provided evidence for the activation of limbic system, motor system and brain regions involved in social evaluation and cognitive control processes. Meanwhile, emotional mimicry accepts the modulation by endocrine such as testosterone and oxytocin. Build upon previous studies, present research summarized the neural network involving in emotional mimicry and endocrine factors modulating the neural activity, introducing recent neuroendocrine models to show the neural pathway of emotional mimicry. Finally, studies in the future should provide support for neuroendocrine models and expand to the field of hyperscanning.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,,
97,"In human tissues, the replicative potential of stem cells is limited by the shortening of telomere, limitless replicative potential is a hallmark of cancer. Telomere length changes stochastically during cell division mainly due to the competition between the end replication problem and telomerase, short telomere can lead to replicative senescence and cell apoptosis. Here, we investigate how stochastic changes of telomere length in individual cells may affect the population dynamics of clonal growth. We established a computational model that couples telomerase-regulated stochastic telomere length changes with the replicative potential of clones. Model simulations reveal qualitative dependence of clone proliferation potential with activities of telomerase; mutations in cells to alter the activities of telomerase and its inhibitors can induce abnormal tissue growth and lead to limitless replicative potential.",yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,
98,"Saffron is one of the world's most precious medicinal herbs and often found to be adulterated with other cheaper materials. The chemical compounds in Crocus sativus L. such as crocin, picrocrocin also exist in other plants, which makes the chemotype-driven analysis not ideal for the quality control of saffron. Herein, we developed a rapid authentication method for saffron in crude drugs by the site-specific PCR. In order to realize fast high-throughput analysis, a one-tube identification approach was further established by using a universal fluorescent dye to detect the PCR products. In addition, this method was also applied to the authentication of saffron in a processed herbal medicine ""Er shi wu wei shan hu wan"" which consists of twenty-five kinds of medicinal materials including plants, minerals and animals. Additionally, this method was also proved to be with high specificity and repeatability. The flexibility of choosing different primers also made this method versatile for other medicinal materials.",yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,
99,"The interactions of complement receptor 2 (CR2) and the degradation fragment C3d of complement component C3 mediate the innate and adaptive immune systems. Due to the importance of C3d-CR2 interaction in the design of vaccines, many studies have indicated the interactions are pH-dependent. Moreover, C3d-CR2 interactions at pH 5.0 are unknown. To investigate the molecular mechanism of pH-regulating C3d-CR2 interaction, molecular dynamics simulations for C3d-CR2 complex in different pH are performed. Our results revealed that the protonation of His9 in C3d at pH 6.0 slightly weakens C3d-CR2 association as reducing pH from 7.4 to 6.0, initiated from a key hydrogen bond formed between Gly270 and His9 in C3d at pH 6.0. When reducing pH from 6.0 to 5.0, the protonation of His33 in C3d weakens C3d-SCR1 association by changing the hydrogen-bond network of Asp36, Glu37, and Glu39 in C3d with Arg13 in CR2. In addition, the protonation of His90 significantly enhances C3d-SCR2 association. This is because the enhanced hydrogen-bond interactions of His90 with Glu63 and Ser69 of the linker change the conformations of the linker, Cys112-Asn116 and Pro87-Gly91 regions. This study uncovers the molecular mechanism of the mediation of pH on C3d-CR2 interaction, which is valuable for vaccine design.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,
