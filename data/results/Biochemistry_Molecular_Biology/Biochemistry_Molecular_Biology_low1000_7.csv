The formation of the corresponding O-2 ' ,3 ' -ketals is accompanied by the appearance of various fluorescent by-products which were isolated chromatographically as mixtures and tentatively analyzed by ESI-MS spectrometry. The mainly formed guanosine nucleolipids were isolated and characterized by elemental analyses, H-1-, C-13-NMR and UV spectroscopy. For a drug profiling, static topological polar surface areas as well as (10)logP(OW) values were calculated by an increment-based method as well as experimentally for the systems 1-octanol-H2O and cyclohexane-H2O. The guanosine-O-2 ' ,3 ' -ketal derivatives 3b and 3a could be crystallized in (D-6)DMSO - the latter after one year of standing at ambient temperature. X-ray analysis revealed the formation of self-assembled ribbons consisting of two structurally similar 3b nucleolipid conformers as well as integrated (D-6)DMSO molecules. In the case of 3a.DMSO, the ribbon is formed by a single type of guanosine nucleolipid molecules. The crystalline material 3b.DMSO was further analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-dependent polarization microscopy. Crystallization was also performed on interdigitated electrodes (Au, distance, 5 mu m) and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Resistance and amperage measurements clearly demonstrate that the electrode-bridging 3b crystals are electrically conducting. All O-2 ' ,3 ' -guanosine ketals were tested on their cytostatic/cytotoxic activity towards phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated human THP-1 macrophages as well as against human astrocytoma/oligodendroglioma GOS-3 cells and against rat malignant neuroectodermal BT4Ca cells.",10.1002/cbdv.201900024,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Roman, BI",Essay: Avoiding unfounded health claims on small molecules in scientific literature,"The publication of unfounded health claims on small molecules in peer-reviewed scientific literature is a problem that requires attention. It undermines the evidence-based decision making processes of modern-day society, weakens the credibility of the scientific enterprise, and diverts resources to futile research efforts. In the present essay we discuss some human and scientific causes behind the issue. We propose a number of actions to be taken up by scientists, referees and publishers. One particularly important factor is the issue of enigmatic compound behavior in biological assays. We therefore also introduce the idea of biological filters, a pattern recognition method to triage enigmatic compounds into valuable hits and false positives, based on the entirety of their biological effects in cell-based systems.",10.1016/j.bioorg.2019.02.002,1,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,

Tutorial education and related activities at universities that specialize in medical and pharmaceutical training have been actively carried out, and lectures in conjunction with practical skills are gradually being developed, although progress has been slow in this area. In past years, our biochemistry practice classes have been evaluated in reports dealing with experiments and written examinations, as is done in other universities. However, using this methodology, we are not able to evaluate the extent to which students master biochemical experimental skills. To address this, we introduced a basic skill test to our biochemical curriculum for the first time. Our exams contributed to a deeper understanding of student skills and could be good tools for evaluating the degree of understanding of the students. The students understood the contents of the training well and felt interested in research in the field of basic medicine. Thus, we conclude that introducing practical testing to biochemical practice was effective for medical students in the field of biochemistry.

J,"Shepelev, MV; Saakian, EK; Kalinichenko, SV; Korobko, IV",Human Antithrombin III Minigene with an Optimized Splicing Pattern,"Antithrombin III (AT3) belongs to the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) and is a major anticoagulant in physiological conditions. Based on SERPINC1 gene, a minigene coding for human AT3, which is valuable for medicine and biotechnology, was constructed by minimizing the size of lengthy introns and preserving the splicing site-flanking sequences. An analysis of the minigene splicing pattern identified one correct AT3 transcript and two alternatively spliced transcripts, which formed either due to minigene exons 2 and 3 skipping or an aberrant exon insertion via splicing at cryptic splicing sites in intron 1 of the minigene. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cryptic splicing sites successfully optimized the splicing pattern of the AT3 minigene to completely prevent the generation of the alternative transcripts. The presence of the cryptic splicing sites in intron 1 of the minigene was confirmed with Human Splicing Finder v. 3.1 software, thus demonstrating that putative alternative splicing sites are possible to identify in minimized or hybrid introns of minigenes and to eliminate via mutagenesis before experimentally testing the minigene splicing patterns. The approach to the design of minigenes together with the bioinformatical analysis of the nucleotide sequences of minigene introns can be used to construct minigenes in order to generate transgenic animals producing economically valuable proteins in the milk.",10.1134/S0026893319030178,3,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,

Several candidate genes have been suggested to be involved in the genetic susceptibility or resistance in the development of UC. Among them, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15) have been reported in association with IBD in several studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of TNFSF15 gene polymorphisms located in the promoter region, including rs6478108 (G/A -9706) and rs3810936 (G/A -15524) in Iranian patients with UC. Methods In this way, the two single nucleotide polymorphisms were studied in 115 patients with UC and 115 healthy controls with the same ethnic group from south-west of Iran. The genomic DNA of samples was genotyped using TaqMan Real-time PCR assay. This case-control study was conducted at the Department of Immunology, Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. Results and conclusion Our results did not confirm the formerly reported association of the studied polymorphisms with UC disease in comparison with healthy controls, neither with the type of the clinical forms of Colitis in the studied Iranian population. Comparing the genotype frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6478108, wild-type homozygous and heterozygote and mutant homozygote were 33%, 55.7%, and 11.3% in cases vs. 34.8%, 50.4%, and 14.8% in the controls (P = 0.6). The genotype frequency of SNP rs3810936 were 20.9%, 40.9%, and 38.2% in the cases compared to 18.3%, 44.3%, and 37.4% in controls, which was not significant (P = 0.8). As multiple ethnic groups reside in all around the country, further studies using different ethnicities and/or larger sample size are required to clarify the role of these polymorphisms in the genetic susceptibility of UC in Iranian populations.",10.1002/jcb.28165,6,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,

Based on the model of a single cell, billions of cells can be simulated in an efficient way, allowing fast simulation of the interaction of an entire organ with other body parts. Through combination of three state-of-the-art algorithms, the simulation time is decreased with multiple orders of magnitude. First: PSP modelling exploits the fact that a lot of the cells behave identically at the same time which results in multiple orders of magnitude speed-up. The second speed-up is achieved by using an unconditionally stable, partial differential equation solver which allows big time-stepping by trading off speed with precision. The third speed-up is due to the fact that the framework is designed with HPC cluster use in mind. The PSP simulator is mathematically derived to have maximal stability.

Compliance in the fluidic system originating in the deformable chamber and the fluidic tubing produced a strong frequency dependence in the relationship between the system's input and the output flow rate. The effects of this frequency dependence were overcome by precise system calibration, enabling on-demand generation of sinusoidal oscillations in the fluid flow rate with a controlled amplitude in the range from 0.1 to over 1ml/min across a frequency range from 0.1Hz to 10Hz.

The homologs to three mammalian nAChR regulators, ubiquilin-1, CRELD2 (cysteine-rich with EFG-like domain 2), and PICK1 (protein interacting with PRKCA 1), were characterized in L.migratoria, and their functions on regulating native nAChRs were investigated via RNAi followed by membrane potential measurement with DiBAC(4)(3) and agonist-evoked macroscopic current recording in cultured L.migratoria DUM neurons. Ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 negatively regulated nAChRs because silencing of ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 both resulted in increased membrane potential and increased inward currents in DUM neurons, while CRELD2 positively regulated nAChRs as decreased membrane potential and inward currents were observed in DUM neurons. In addition, ubiquilin-1 regulated both -Bgt-sensitive and -Bgt-resistant types of nAChRs whereas PICK1 and CRELD2 regulated only the -Bgt-resistant nAChRs.

The thinness of main olfactory epithelium (MOE) become thin with ageing, and the gene expression profile alters after AC3 deletion. DNA methylation plays a key role in animal development and regulation of gene expression. In the present study, whether the DNA methylation level of gene promoter, as well as their associations with the expression of the genes in MOE will be altered after AC3 deletion, was investigated by using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation chip (MeDIP-chip), methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and realtime fluorescence quantification PCR. The data showed that the DNA methylation levels of promoters of 1 978 genes were altered in AC3-deficient mice, accounting for 9% of the total number of genes. Of which 727 genes with their promoter's DNA methylation levels were elevated, 1 251 genes with their promoter's methylation levels were lowered. The functions of these genes are mainly involved with olfactory receptor, neurodevelopmental, cAMP signaling pathway, ATP-binding, calcium regulation, acetylation modification, and transcription factors. It was further confirmed by MSP that methylation levels of promoter of the olfactory receptor genes Olfr1153, Olfr231, Olfr378, Olfr651 and Olfr691 were increased, whereas methylation level of the promoters of Cngb1, Pde4a and Olfr1394 were decreased. In line with MSP results, qRT-PCR data showed that the expression levels of Cngb1, Hcn4, Olfm1, Olfr1394, Olfr1153, Olfr231, Olfr378 and Olfr691 were significantly decreased, whereas the expression levels of Pde4a and Olfr651 were significantly increased. In conclusion, the methylation levels of promoters of olfactory receptor genes, neurodevelopmental related genes and cAMP signaling pathways in MOE are modified significantly after AC3 deletion, which affected the transduction of signal pathways such as nucleotide excision and repair, DNA replication and mismatch repair, thus comprehensively regulating the number and level of gene expression in MOE of mice.",10.16476/j.pibb.2018.0261,16,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,

Then, proliferating ability were tested by cell counting and related pathways was assayed by Western blot, in stable-transfected cell lines. Results showed cell proliferation was inhibited and GM1 expression increased at low and high cell density compared with normal density. Exogenous addition of GM1 at low and high density cells inhibited cell growth, but it had no influence on cell growth at normal density. Down regulation of GM1 promoted cell proliferation at low and high cell density, and overexpression of GM1 had the opposite effect.

In the present study, we aimed to analyze circulating MSCs, marked by the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR alpha), during fetal development. Using PDGFR alpha GFP knock-in mice, we quantified the number of circulating PDGFR alpha positive MSCs during development. We further performed whole transcriptome analysis of circulating MSCs at single cell levels. We found that abundant PDGFR alpha positive cells circulate in embryo and diminish immediately after birth. In addition, single cell RNA-sequencing revealed transcriptional heterogeneity of MSCs in fetal circulation. These data lay a foundation to analyze the function of circulating MSCs during development.

One such theory suggests the primary involvement of muscles due to myopathy, mainly affecting the erector and paravertebral rotator muscles. Studies indicate that there may be an association of AIS with genetic polymorphisms previously associated with physical performance and muscle power through their effects on muscle tissue. One of these is the gene coding for the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). We compared the expression of ACE gene polymorphisms in the concave and convex sides of the scoliotic curve in patients with AIS. We evaluated ACE gene expression in the multifidus muscles of the spine of 21 patients operated for AIS correction who had signs of asymmetric myopathy (worse in the concavity).

In this study, different concentrations of mitomycin C (MMC) and ciprofloxacin (CF), two common antibiotic/chemotherapy agents capable of stimulating Stx production, were first tested and compared on three reference strains and eight clinical isolates to observe the toxin induction and subsequent identification. Notably, no differences were observed between the two agents other than the concentrations applied. Seventeen more clinical isolates were then tested using fixed MMC and CF concentrations and sample amount. This study confirms that the majority of stx2-positive E. coli strains can be stimulated to produce sufficient toxin for confident identification. This does not occur with stx1-positive E. coli isolates, however, despite the fact that both Stxs can be identified for several isolates without MMC or CF stimulation. Biological significance: Stxs, especially Stx2, are very important causes of severe food-borne disease, even death. This study confirms that receptor analogue-based affinity enrichment of Stxs, after MMC or CF treatment of E. colt, is useful for fast and accurate Stx2 identification through LC-MS/MS.",10.1016/j.jprot.2019.01.020,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Manual curation is used to establish whether the literature and the records are indeed consistent. We explore in this paper an automated method for assessing the consistency of biological assertions, to assist biocurators, which we call BARC, Biocuration tool for Assessment of Relation Consistency. In this method a biological assertion is represented as a relation between two objects (for example, a gene and a disease); we then use our novel set-based relevance algorithm SaBRA to retrieve pertinent literature, and apply a classifier to estimate the likelihood that this relation (assertion) is correct.ResultsOur experiments on assessing gene-disease relations and protein-protein interactions using the PubMed Central collection show that BARC can be effective at assisting curators to perform data cleansing. Specifically, the results obtained showed that BARC substantially outperforms the best baselines, with an improvement of F-measure of 3.5% and 13%, respectively, on gene-disease relations and protein-protein interactions. We have additionally carried out a feature analysis that showed that all feature types are informative, as are all fields of the documents.ConclusionsBARC provides a clear benefit for the biocuration community, as there are no prior automated tools for identifying inconsistent assertions in large-scale biological databases.",10.1186/s12859-019-2801-x,24,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

In the current study, we found that the total number of thymocytes in PLZF deficient mice was reduced compared with thymocytes in wild-type mice, and the number of early T-cell progenitors decreased. However, the decrease of thymocytes in PLZF deficient mice was not cell intrinsic. This study adds new information regarding the regulation of the PLZF gene in the development and self-renewal of T cells. Methods: The thymus was isolated from newborn mice, and the two lobes of each thymus were physically separated. Each host received a thymus, two lobes, each placed at one end of the kidney, as described in the literature. Tail vein blood was periodically collected from some of the recipients and analyzed for the presence of peripheral blood T cells. Results: In PLZF-EGFP reporter mice and neonatal thymus transplantation to the kidney, we found that PLZF was highly expressed in DN1 (Lineage(-)CD44(+)CD2(-)) cells of thymic grafts of Rag2/gamma c(-/)(-) recipient mice. We found that the proportion of PLZF wild-type and mutant-derived cells in the thymocytes of recipient mice after bone marrow transplantation is approximately equal to the competitive bone marrow chimeric mouse model, and all mice contain a normal thymus. Conclusion: The development of T cells suggests that the effect of the PLZF gene on T cell differentiation and development is not cell intrinsic. However, in the neonatal mouse thymic transplant model in the Rag2/gamma c-/- recipient mouse, deletion of the PLZF gene results in a significant decrease in the proportion of DN1 cells from the donor in the thymic graft.

J,"Casanovas, A; Gallardo, O; Carrascal, M; Abian, J",TCellXTalk facilitates the detection of co-modified peptides for the study of protein post-translational modification cross-talk in T cells,"Motivation: Protein function is regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that may act individually or interact with others in a phenomenon termed PTM cross-talk. Multiple databases have been dedicated to PTMs, including recent initiatives oriented towards the in silico prediction of PTM interactions. The study of PTM cross-talk ultimately requires experimental evidence about whether certain PTMs coexist in a single protein molecule. However, available resources do not assist researchers in the experimental detection of co-modified peptides. Results: Herein, we present TCellXTalk, a comprehensive database of phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation sites in human T cells that supports the experimental detection of co-modified peptides using targeted or directed mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of TCellXTalk and the strategy presented here in a proof of concept experiment that enabled the identification and quantification of 15 co-modified (phosphorylated and ubiquitinated) peptides from CD3 proteins of the T-cell receptor complex. To our knowledge, these are the first co-modified peptide sequences described in this widely studied cell type. Furthermore, quantitative data showed distinct dynamics for co-modified peptides upon T cell activation, demonstrating differential regulation of co-occurring PTMs in this biological context. Overall, TCellXTalk facilitates the experimental detection of co-modified peptides in human T cells and puts forward a novel and generic strategy for the study of PTM cross-talk.

RNPs containing linear group II intron RNA are generally thought to be unable to complete the reverse splicing reaction. Here, we show that reconstituted in vitro RNPs containing linear RmInt1 Delta ORF RNA can mediate the cleavage of single-stranded DNA substrates in a very precise manner with the attachment of the intron RNA to the 3 ' exon as the first step of a reverse splicing reaction. Notably, we also observe molecules in which the 5 ' exon is linked to the RmInt1 RNA, suggesting the completion of the reverse splicing reaction, albeit rather low and inefficiently.

In this article, we focus on the comparison of asynchrony of division, that is, difference of lifetime, between sister cells (ADS) among wild-type and mutant individuals of Caenorhabditis elegans. On the one hand, due to extreme imbalance between wild-type individuals and mutant-type samples, direct comparison of two distributions of ADS between wild type and mutant type is not feasible. On the other hand, we originally found that the ADS is correlated with the lifespan of the corresponding mother cell in wild type. Hence, a semiparametric Bayesian quantile regression method where lifetime of the mother cell is taken as covariate is developed to estimate the 95% confidence curve of ADS in wild type and then ADS of mutant type is classified as abnormal if outside the corresponding confidence interval. A high accuracy of our method is demonstrated by a large-scale simulation study.

J,"Takahashi, M; Arimura, GI; Morikawa, H",Dual nitrogen species involved in foliar uptake of nitrogen dioxide in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>,"Foliar uptake of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is governed by its reactive absorption mechanism, by which NO2 molecules diffuse through cell wall layers and simultaneously react with apoplastic ascorbate to form nitrous acid, which freely diffuses across plasmalemma. However, whether free diffusion of nitrous acid is the sole mechanism of foliar uptake of NO2 remains unknown. The involvement of ammonia-inhibitable nitrite transporters in the foliar uptake of NO2, as reported in nitrite transport in Arabidopsis roots, is also unknown. In this study, we treated Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with methionine sulfoximine (MSX) to inhibit incorporation of ammonia into glutamate and exposed them to 4 ppm N-15-labeled NO2 for 4 h in light followed by quantification of total nitrogen, reduced nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen derived from NO2 using mass spectrometry and capillary electrophoresis. The total nitrogen derived from NO2 in leaves without MSX treatment was 587.0 nmol NO2/g fresh weight, of which more than 65% was recovered as reduced nitrogen. In comparison, MSX treatment decreased the total nitrogen and reduced nitrogen derived from NO2 by half. Thus, half of the foliar uptake of NO2 is not attributable to passive diffusion of nitrous acid but to ammonia-inhibitable nitrite transport.

J,"Alkhateeb, A; Voss, P; Zeitouni, A; de-Villers-Sidani, E",Reversible external auditory canal ligation (REACL): A novel surgical technique to induce transient and reversible hearing loss in developing rats,"Background: Cases of sensory loss provide an excellent model to study the plastic nature of cortical sensory systems. Models of reversible sensory loss are particularly useful for establishing the timeline of various critical periods for cortical plasticity. However, there currently is an absence of adequate methods to produce reversible hearing loss in neonatal and developing rodents. New method: We propose a novel and reversible adaptation of an existing surgical technique-external auditory canal ligation (EACL)-that produces a reliable and moderate hearing loss. Results: Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were used to measure both the magnitude of the hearing loss induced by EACL and the auditory thresholds following hearing restoration. The EACL and reopening procedures, as assessed by visual inspection, had success rates of 81% and 78%, respectively. The average hearing thresholds, as assessed with ABRs, increased by nearly 40 decibels across all tested frequencies. Hearing thresholds returned to normal levels following the reopening procedure. Comparison with existing methods: Our procedure yields similar benefits to other methods, such as producing a reliable and moderate hearing loss that is entirely reversible. Furthermore, to our knowledge, it is the first that can be performed in neonatal rodents, thus allowing researchers the opportunity to assess the effects of sensory loss on behavior and cortical neurophysiology during developmental critical periods. Conclusion: Our modified technique of reversible external auditory canal ligation offers an easy, and reliable method to induce a transient state of hearing loss that mimics naturally occurring congenital conductive hearing loss.",10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.02.011,38,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,

J,"Arakaki, T; Barello, G; Ahmadian, Y",Inferring neural circuit structure from datasets of heterogeneous tuning curves,"Tuning curves characterizing the response selectivities of biological neurons can exhibit large degrees of irregularity and diversity across neurons. Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or partially random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. Empirical tuning curve distributions can thus be utilized to make model-based inferences about the statistics of single-cell parameters and network connectivity. However, a general framework for such an inference or fitting procedure is lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network models as implicit generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly available or is highly intractable. Recent advances in machine learning provide ways for fitting implicit generative models without the need to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic circuit models in theoretical neuroscience to datasets of tuning curves. This fitting procedure avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, such as the biophysical parameters of, or synaptic connections between, particular recorded cells. Instead, it directly learns generalizable model parameters characterizing the network's statistical structure such as the statistics of strength and spatial range of connections between different cell types. Another strength of this approach is that it fits the joint high-dimensional distribution of tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary statistics picked a priori by the user, resulting in a more accurate inference of circuit properties. More generally, this framework opens the door to direct model-based inference of circuit structure from data beyond single-cell tuning curves, such as simultaneous population recordings. Author summary Neurons in the brain respond selectively to some stimuli or for some motor outputs, but not others. Even within a local brain network, neurons exhibit great diversity in their selectivity patterns. Recently, theorists have highlighted the computational importance of diverse neural selectivity. While many mechanistic circuit models are highly stylized and do not capture such diversity, models that feature biologically realistic heterogeneity in their structure do generate responses with diverse selectivities. However, traditionally only the average pattern of selectivity is matched between model and experimental data, and the distribution around the mean is ignored. Here, we provide a hitherto lacking methodology that exploits the full empirical and model distributions of response selectivites, in order to infer various structural circuit properties, such as the statistics of strength and spatial range of connections between different cell types. By applying this method to fit two circuit models from theoretical neuroscience to experimental or simulated data, we show that the proposed method can accurately and robustly infer circuit structure, and optimize a model to match the full range of observed response selectivities. Beyond neuroscience applications, the proposed framework can potentially serve to infer the structure of other biological networks from empirical functional data.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006816,40,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

This semistochastic, identification -first paradigm generates a wealth of peptide-level data without regard to relative abundance. We introduce a data acquisition concept called sequential windowed acquisition of reporter masses (SWARM). This approach performs quantitation first, thereby allowing subsequent acquisition decisions to be predicated on user-defined patterns of reporter ion intensities. The efficacy of this approach is validated through experiments with both synthetic mixtures of Escherichia coli ribosomes spiked into human cell lysates at known ratios and the quantitative evaluation of the human proteome's response to the inhibition of cullin-based protein ubiquitination via the small molecule MLN4924. We find that SWARM-informed parallel reaction monitoring acquisitions display effective acquisition biasing toward analytes displaying quantitative characteristics of interest, resulting in an improvement in the detection of differentially abundant analytes.

Polarons are understood as attractive interactions between charge and lattice deformations that result in a single structure composed by a charged particle surrounded by a cloud of phonons. These composite quasi-particles are vital structures when it comes to charge transport mechanism in a wide range of semiconducting materials. In the present work, we investigated the drift of an electron and the subsequent polaron formation in impurity-endowed lattices in the framework of a one-dimensional tight-binding model. Primarily, we scrutinized electronic dynamics in lattices containing two sources of disorders: a barrier and a well. The dispersion of the gamma distribution gives an idea of the extension of the disorder region in the lattice. We studied the dynamics of an injected electron interacting with the lattice vibrations where we consider, for a given degree of disorder, different velocities of the incoming particle. Our results show that there are different kinds of propagation/localization for the electron according to the assumed initial velocity.

In this study, transgenic pigs specifically expressing -glucanase gene in the intestine were successfully produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer technology in order to improve digestibility of dietary -glucan and absorption of nutrients. The -glucanase activity in the intestinal juice of 4 transgenic pigs was found to be 8.59 +/- 2.49U/mL. The feeding trial results showed that the crude protein digestion of 4 transgenic pigs was significantly increased compared with that of the non-transgenic pigs.

Since AP sites inhibit DNA replication and transcription, repairing them is critical for cell growth. However, the significance of repairing AP sites during early embryonic development has not yet been clearly determined. Here, we focused on APEX1 from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis (CiApex1), a homolog of human AP endonuclease 1 (APEX1), and examined its role in early embryonic development. Recombinant CiApex1 protein complemented the drug sensitivities of an AP endonuclease-deficient Escherichia coli mutant, and exhibited Me dependent AP endonuclease activity, like human APEX1, in vitro. Next, the effects of abnormal AP site repair on embryonic development were investigated. Treatment with methyl methanesulfonate, which alkylates DNA bases and generates AP sites, induced abnormal embryonic development. This abnormal phenotype was also caused by treatment with methoxyamine, which inhibits AP endonuclease activity. Furthermore, we constructed dominant-negative CiApex1, which inhibits CiApex1 action, and found that its expression impaired embryonic growth. These results suggested that AP site repair is essential for embryonic development and CiApex1 plays an important role in AP site repair during early embryonic development in C. intestinalis.",10.1266/ggs.18-00043,49,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,,

The mannan-mitomycin C conjugate inhibited proliferation of both cell lines in time and concentration -dependent manners. Results: The conjugate inhibited TCC cell proliferation more than that of L929 cells. Mitomycin C alone inhibited proliferation of both cell lines in both time and concentration -dependent manners, and the effect was greater on L929 than on TCC cells. Mannan had a relatively low inhibitory effect on TCC and no significant effect on L929 cells.

The levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites, dioxyphenylacetic (DOPAC), homovanillic (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic (5-HIAA) acids, were determined by HPLC in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of the right and left sides of the brain. Control mice kept both in the group and under conditions of social isolation had a higher DA content in the left cerebral cortex. In the other brain structures the monoamine content was symmetric. In the cerebral cortex of mice kept in the group, acute hypoxia with hypercapnia resulted in a right-sided increase in the DA and 5-HT levels.

J,"Kugaevskaya, EV; Gureeva, TA; Timoshenko, OS; Solovyeva, NI",The Role of the Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator System In Tumor Progression,"In the multistage process of carcinogenesis, invasion of malignant cells into normal tissue and their distribution as well as the degree of tissue destruction are the key links in tumor growth and progression. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator system (uPA system) plays the most important role in the development of these processes. The uPA system consists of several components: serine proteinaseuPA, its receptor uPAR and its two endogenous inhibitors - PAI-1 and PAI-2. The role of uPA, a highly specific protease, consists in triggering the processes performed by the uPA system, which result in destruction of connective tissue matrix (CTM) and basal membranes as well as activation of numerous extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways. uPA converts plasminogen into plasmin and in addition to the regulation of fibrinolysis, it can hydrolyze a number of CTM components and activate zymogens of secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MM?s)pro-MM?s. MM?s can hydrolyze all the main CTM components and thus play a key role in the development of invasive processes, as well as to perform regulatory functions by activating and releasing from CTM a number of biologically active molecules involved in the regulation of the main processes of carcinogenesis. uPA, PAI-1 and PAI-2 not only regulate uPA/uPAR activity; they are also involved in proliferation, apoptosis, chemotaxis, adhesion, migration, and activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways.

Such studies have reported that the microgravity environment has a negative effect on the human body, including the musculoskeletal system, nervous system, and endocrine system. Bone loss and muscular atrophy are issues that need to be resolved before long-term exposure of the human body to a space environment. To address this problem, Y. K.

In this study, we developed an automated bioreactor engineering model (EM) based on the previous literature, and conducted media exchange performance testing using the Bradford assay. We used a novel method that allowed quantitative assessment of the media exchange rate versus the conventional assessment method using visual observation with a camera.

Glucosylation of phenolics is one of the molecular mechanisms controlling phenolics homeostasis. However, the relevant glucosyltransferases are largely unknown. In this study, a putative family 1 glucosyltransferase gene OsSGT1 was cloned from rice due to its close homology with the previously reported phenolics-related glucosyltransferases UGT84A1-A4, and the phylogenetic relationship of OsSGT1 with homologs from other species was investigated. Recombinant OsSGT1 protein showed strong activity towards phenolics to form their glucose conjugates. This is the first identified natural phenolics-related glucosyltransferase in rice. In addition, the expression patterns of OsSGT1 in different tissues of rice indicated that OsSGT1 was predominantly expressed in the old leaves and dough grains, suggesting that OsSGT1 might be involved in the maturation process of rice by regulating phenolic metabolism, and thus deepened our understanding on the roles of phenolics in rice growth and environmental adaptation.",10.1007/s11105-019-1134-2,64,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Often, changes in gene co-expression are investigated across two or more biological conditions defined by categorizing a continuous covariate. However, the selection of arbitrary cut-off points may have an influence on the results of an analysis. To address this issue, we use a general linear model (GLM) for correlated data to study the relationship between gene-module co-expression and a covariate like metabolite concentration. The GLM specifies the gene-pair correlations as a function of the continuous covariate. The use of the GLM allows for investigating different (linear and non-linear) patterns of co-expression. Furthermore, the modeling approach offers a formal framework for testing hypotheses about possible patterns of co-expression. In our paper, a simulation study is used to assess the performance of the GLM. The performance is compared with that of a previously proposed GLM that utilizes categorized covariates. The versatility of the model is illustrated by using a real-life example.

Myxococcus xanthus, the model myxobacterium, is an obligate aerobe with a multicellular stage in its life cycle where cells encounter oxygen limitation. This work was undertaken to investigate the potential role of the truncated globin in M. xanthus. To examine the role of globins in this unique group of bacteria, the gene coding for a putative truncated globin (HbO) was identified in the genome of M. xanthus DK 1622. The sequence analysis by bioinformatics approaches revealed that HbO from M. xanthus (Mx-HbO) likely adopts a 2-on-2 alpha helical fold of the truncated globins. The gene coding for Mx-HbO was cloned and its expression in E. coli imparted reddish tinge to the cells. The spectral analysis confirmed it to be a functional globin. The expression of Mx-HbO in the heterologous host improved its growth, resulting in the attainment of higher cell density in culture. The transcript of Mx-hbO was induced threefold in the host cells when grown under low aeration condition as compared to the cells grown under high aeration condition. In M. xanthus, an obligate aerobe, where cell growth accompanies swarming, there is a higher density of cells in the middle of the swarm.

Using the method of automated solid-phase peptide synthesis, we obtained a synthetic agonist of galanin receptors GalR1-3 [Ala14, His15]-galanin (2-15) (G), exhibiting cardioprotective properties. It was purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The homogeneity and structure of the peptide were confirmed by HPLC, H-1-NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of G on metabolism and cardiac function of rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) caused by Dox. Experiments were performed using male Wistar rats weighing 280-300 g. The control group of animals (C) was intraperitoneally treated with saline for 8 weeks; the doxorubicin group (D) of rats was intraperitoneally treated with Do?; the group Do? + peptide G (D + G) of rats received intraperitoneal injections of Do? and subcutaneously injections of peptide G; the peptide G group (G) was subcutaneously treated with G. At the beginning and at the end of the study, the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and the activity of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) were determined in blood plasma; the animals were weighed, and cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography. At the end of the experiments, the hearts were used for determination of metabolites and assessment of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. After the 8-week treatment, animals of group D were characterized by severe heart failure, the lack of weight gain and an increase in plasma TBARS concentration and CK-MB activity. These impairments were accompanied by a decrease in the content of myocardial high-energy phosphates, a reduction in mitochondrial respiratory acid parameters, accumulation of lactate and glucose in the heart, and altered metabolism of alanine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Coadministration of G and Dox prevented the increase in plasma CK-MB activity and significantly reduced the plasma TBARS concentration. At the end of the experiments, animals of group D + G had higher myocardial energy state and the respiratory control index of mitochondria than animals of group D; there was a decrease in anaerobic glycolysis and lack of changes in the amino acid content compared to the control. The peptide G significantly improved the cardiac function parameters and caused weight gain in animals of group D + G in comparison with these parameters in group D. The obtained results demonstrate the ability of a novel agonist of galanin receptors GalR1-3 to attenuate Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.",10.1134/S1990750819020100,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was performed on AS patients, on patients with aortic dilatation, and also on AS patients with aortic dilatation. Increased level of RANKL was found in AS patients and it was higher in valve than in aortic tissue. In patients with aortic dilatation the RANKL level negatively correlated with aortic dilatation. The results of this study confirm importance of the OPG/RANKL/RANK system for calcification in AS patients.

All insulin superfamily members contain three absolutely conserved disulfide linkages and a nonchiral Gly residue immediately following the first B-chain cysteine. The functionality of this conserved Gly residue in the insulin family has been studied by replacing it with natural l-amino acids or the corresponding unnatural d-amino acids. However, such analysis has not been conducted on relaxin family members. In the present study, we conducted chiral mutagenesis on the conserved B11Gly of the chimeric relaxin family peptide R3/I5, which is an efficient agonist for receptor RXFP3 and RXFP4. Similar to the effects on insulin family foldability, l-Ala or l-Ser substitution completely abolished the in vitro refolding of a recombinant R3/I5 precursor; whereas, d-Ala or d-Ser substitution had no detrimental effect on refolding of a semi-synthetic R3/I5 precursor, suggesting that the conserved Gly residue controls the foldability of relaxin family members. In contrast to the effect on insulin family activity, d-Ala or d-Ser replacement had no detrimental effect on the binding and activation potencies of the mature R3/I5 towards both RXFP3 and RXFP4, suggesting that the conserved Gly residue is irrelevant to the relaxin family's activity. The present study revealed functionality of the conserved B-chain Gly residue for a relaxin family peptide for the first time, providing an overview of its contribution to foldability and activity of the insulin superfamily.",10.1007/s00726-018-02694-y,88,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,,

Determination of the targets was achieved within 3.5 min by using Shim-pack GIST C18 column connected to an electrospray ionization source (ESI- mode). The method showed excellent linearity (R-2 > 0.9984), and the limits of quantitation were 1 mu g/kg for all compounds. Average recoveries were in the range of 74.6%-108.1%, with an intra-day relative standard deviation between 0.9% and 18.3%. The inter-day relative standard deviation was less than 13.8%.

There was no significant difference in eNOS mRNA level in tested tissues between two species. However, the total NOS activity in skeletal muscle of P. erythrurus was slightly lower than that of P. przewalskii (p < .05) while no difference in other tissues. Similarly, lower iNOS activity (p < .01) was found in cardiac and skeletal muscle in P. erythrurus compared to P. przewalskii.

Due to the importance of C3d-CR2 interaction in the design of vaccines, many studies have indicated the interactions are pH-dependent. Moreover, C3d-CR2 interactions at pH 5.0 are unknown. To investigate the molecular mechanism of pH-regulating C3d-CR2 interaction, molecular dynamics simulations for C3d-CR2 complex in different pH are performed. Our results revealed that the protonation of His9 in C3d at pH 6.0 slightly weakens C3d-CR2 association as reducing pH from 7.4 to 6.0, initiated from a key hydrogen bond formed between Gly270 and His9 in C3d at pH 6.0. When reducing pH from 6.0 to 5.0, the protonation of His33 in C3d weakens C3d-SCR1 association by changing the hydrogen-bond network of Asp36, Glu37, and Glu39 in C3d with Arg13 in CR2. In addition, the protonation of His90 significantly enhances C3d-SCR2 association. This is because the enhanced hydrogen-bond interactions of His90 with Glu63 and Ser69 of the linker change the conformations of the linker, Cys112-Asn116 and Pro87-Gly91 regions.
