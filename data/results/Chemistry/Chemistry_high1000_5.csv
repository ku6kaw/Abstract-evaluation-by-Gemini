1,"Organometal halide perovskites are inexpensive materials with desirable characteristics of color-tunable and narrow-band emissions for lighting and display technology, but they suffer from low photoluminescence quantum yields at low excitation fluencies. Here we developed a ligand-assisted reprecipitation strategy to luminescent and color-tunable colloidal CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I, Cl) quantum dots with absolute quantum yield up to 70% at room temperature and low excitation fluencies. To illustrate the photoluminescence enhancements in these quantum dots, we conducted comprehensive composition and surface characterizations and determined the time- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra. Comparisons between small-sized CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots (average diameter 3.3 nm) and corresponding micrometer-sized bulk particles (2-8 mu m) suggest that the intense increased photoluminescence quantum yield originates from the increase of exciton binding energy due to size reduction as well as proper chemical passivations of the Br-rich surface. We further demonstrated wide-color gamut white-light-emitting diodes using green emissive CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots and red emissive K2SiF6:Mn4+ as color converters, providing enhanced color quality for display technology. Moreover, colloidal CH3NH3PbBX3 quantum dots are expected to exhibit interesting nanoscale excitonic properties and also have other potential applications in lasers, electroluminescence devices, and optical sensors.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes
2,"Proteomics is critically dependent on optimal sample preparation. Particularly, the interface between protein digestion and mass spectrometric analysis has a large influence on the overall quality and sensitivity of the analysis. We here describe a novel procedure in which a very small disk of beads embedded in a Teflon meshwork is placed as a microcolumn into pipet tips. Termed Stage, for Slop And Go Extraction, the procedure has been implemented with commercially available material (C18 Empore Disks (3M, Minneapolis, MN)) as frit and separation material. The disk is introduced in a simple and fast process yielding a convenient and completely reliable procedure for the production of self-packed microcolumns in pipet tips. It is held in place free of obstacles solely by the narrowing tip, ensuring optimized loading and elution of analytes. Five disks are conveniently placed in 1 min, adding <0.1 cent in material costs to the price of each tip. The system allows fast loading with low backpressure (> 300 muL/min for the packed column using manual force) while eliminating the possibility of blocking. The loading capacity of C(18)-StageTips (column bed: 0.4 mm diameter, 0.5 mm length) is 2-4 mug of protein digest, which can be increased by using larger diameter or stacked disks. Five femtomole of tryptic BSA digest could be recovered quantitatively. We have found that the Stage system is well-suited as a universal sample preparation system for proteomics.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
3,"Three of the most frequent antitubercular agents employed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis are: Rifampicin, Isoniazid and Pyrazinamide. It has been proven that the use of these antitubercular agents together, shortens the treatment period from 12-18 months to 6 months [1]. In this work we use a new Density Functional Theory chemistry model called CHIH-DFT (Chihuahua-Heterocycles-Density Functional Theory) that reflects the mixture of Hartree Fock exchange and DFT exchange, according to a mixing parameter based on empirical rules suited for heterocyclic systems. This new chemistry model was used to calculate the molecular structure of these antitubercular compounds, as well as their infrared, UV spectra, chemical reactivity and electronic properties. The UV and infrared spectra were obtained by experimental techniques. The calculated molecular structure, UV and IR spectra values from CHIH-DFT were compared with experimentally obtained values and theoretical studies. These results are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical studies. We also predicted using the relative electrophilicity and relative nucleophilicity concepts as defined by Roy et al.

4,"Many biologically interesting phenomena occur on a time scale that is too long to be studied by atomistic simulations. These phenomena include the dynamics of large proteins and self-assembly of biological materials. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling allows computer simulations to be run on length and time scales that are 2-3 orders of magnitude larger compared to atomistic simulations, providing a bridge between the atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed a new CG model for proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force field. Here, we validate the model for its use in peptide-bilayer systems. In order to validate the model, we calculated the potential of mean force for each amino acid as a function of its distance from the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer. We then compared amino acid association constants, the partitioning of a series of model pentapeptides, the partitioning and orientation,of WALP23 in DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. A comparison with results obtained from atomistic models shows good agreement in all of the tests performed. We also performed a systematic investigation of the partitioning of five series of polyalanine-leucine peptides (with different lengths and compositions) in DPPC bilayers. As expected, the fraction of peptides partitioned at the interface increased with decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine content, demonstrating that the CG model is capable of discriminating partitioning behavior arising from subtle differences in the amino acid composition. Finally, we simulated the concentration-dependent formation of transmembrane pores by magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with atomistic simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In conclusion, the model is computationally efficient and effectively reproduces peptide-lipid interactions and the partitioning of amino acids and peptides in lipid bilayers.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,
5,"Never-dried and once-dried hardwood celluloses were oxidized by a 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-l-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-mediated system, and highly crystalline and individualized cellulose nanofibers, dispersed in water, were prepared by mechanical treatment of the oxidized cellulose/water slurries. When carboxylate contents formed from the primary hydroxyl groups of the celluloses reached approximately 1.5 mmol/g, the oxidized cellulose/water slurries were mostly converted to transparent and highly viscous dispersions by mechanical treatment. Transmission electron microscopic observation showed that the dispersions consisted of individualized cellulose nanofibers 3-4 nm in width and a few microns in length. No intrinsic differences between never-dried and once-dried celluloses were found for preparing the dispersion, as long as carboxylate contents in the TEMPO-oxidized celluloses reached approximately 1.5 mmol/g. Changes in viscosity of the dispersions during the mechanical treatment corresponded with those in the dispersed states of the cellulose nanofibers in water.",no,happy,happy,no,no,happy,happy,happy,happy,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,happy,happy,no,no,yes,yes,happy
6,"Method validation is one of the measures universally recognized as a necessary part of a comprehensive system of quality assurance in analytical chemistry. In the past, ISO, IUPAC, and AOAC International have cooperated to produce a-reed protocols or guidelines on the ""Design, conduct and interpretation of method performance studies"" [1], on the ""Proficiency testing of (chemical) analytical laboratories"" [2], on ""Internal quality control in analytical chemistry laboratories"" [3], and on ""The use of recovery information in analytical measurement"" [4]. The Working Group that produced these protocols/guidelines has now been mandated by IUPAC to prepare guidelines on the single-laboratory validation of methods of analysis. These guidelines provide minimum recommendations on procedures that should be employed to ensure adequate validation of analytical methods. A draft of the guidelines has been discussed at an International Symposium on the Harmonization of Quality Assurance Systems in Chemical Laboratory, the proceedings from which have been published by the UK Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"A key tenet of bone tissue engineering is the development of scaffold materials that can stimulate stem cell differentiation in the absence of chemical treatment to become osteoblasts without compromising material properties. At present, conventional implant materials fail owing to encapsulation by soft tissue, rather than direct bone bonding. Here, we demonstrate the use of nanoscale disorder to stimulate human mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) to produce bone mineral in vitro, in the absence of osteogenic supplements. This approach has similar efficiency to that of cells cultured with osteogenic media. In addition, the current studies show that topographically treated MSCs have a distinct differentiation profile compared with those treated with osteogenic media, which has implications for cell therapies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Graphene has been used to explore the fascinating electronic properties of ideal two-dimensional carbon, and shows great promise for quantum device architectures. The primary method for isolating graphene, micromechanical cleavage of graphite, is difficult to scale up for applications. Epitaxial growth is an attractive alternative, but achieving large graphene domains with uniform thickness remains a challenge, and substrate bonding may strongly affect the electronic properties of epitaxial graphene layers. Here, we show that epitaxy on Ru(0001) produces arrays of macroscopic single-crystalline graphene domains in a controlled, layer-by-layer fashion. Whereas the first graphene layer indeed interacts strongly with the metal substrate, the second layer is almost completely detached, shows weak electronic coupling to the metal, and hence retains the inherent electronic structure of graphene. Our findings demonstrate a route towards rational graphene synthesis on transition-metal templates for applications in electronics, sensing or catalysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Medium basis sets based upon contractions of Gaussian primitives are developed for the third-row elements Ga through Kr. The basis functions generalize the 6-31G and 6-31G* sets commonly used for atoms up to Ar. A reexamination of the 6-31G* basis set for K and Ca developed earlier leads to the inclusion of 3d orbitals into the valence space for these atoms. Now the 6-31G basis for the whole third-row K through Kr has six primitive Gaussians for 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals, and a split-valence pair of three and one primitives for valence orbitals, which are 4s, 4p, and 3d. The nature of the polarization functions for third-row atoms is reexamined as well. The polarization functions for K, Ca, and Ga through Kr are single set of Cartesian d-type primitives. The polarization functions for transition metals are defined to be a single 7f set of uncontracted primitives. Comparison with experimental data shows good agreement with bond lengths and angles for representative vapor-phase metal complexes. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"The generation of metal-organic framework (MOF) coordination polymers enables the tailoring of novel solids with regular porosity from the micro to nanopore scale. Since the discovery of this new family of nanoporous materials and the concept of so called 'reticular design', nowadays several hundred different types of MOF are known. The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centres, linked together with a variety of polyatomic organic bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mechanical stability. Describing examples of different zinc-containing structures, e.g. MOF-2, MOF-5 and IRMOF8 verified synthesis methods will be given, as well as a totally novel electrochemical approach for transition metal based MOFs will be presented for the first time. With sufficient amounts of sample now being available, the testing of metal-organic frameworks in fields of catalysis and gas processing is exemplified. Report is given on the catalytic activation of alkynes (formation of methoxypropene from propyne, vinylester synthesis from acetylene). Removal of impurities in natural gas (traces of tetrahydrothiophene in methane), pressure swing separation of rare gases (krypton and xenon) and storage of hydrogen (3.3 wt% at 2.0 MPa/77 K on Cu-BTC-MOF) will underline the prospective future industrial use of metal-organic frameworks in gas processing. Whenever possible, comparison is made to state-of-art applications in order to outline possibilities which might be superior by using MOFs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,"Postsynthetic chemical transformations of colloidal nanocrystals, such as ion-exchange reactions, provide an avenue to compositional fine-tuning or to otherwise inaccessible materials and morphologies. While cation-exchange is facile and commonplace, anion-exchange reactions have not received substantial deployment. Here we report fast, low-temperature, deliberately partial, or complete anionexchange in highly luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals of cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I). By adjusting the halide ratios in the colloidal nanocrystal solution, the bright photoluminescence can be tuned over the entire visible spectral region (410-700 nm) while maintaining high quantum yields of 20 80% and narrow emission line widths of 10-40 nm (from blue to red). Furthermore, fast internanocrystal anion-exchange is demonstrated, leading to uniform CsPb(Cl/Br)(3) or CsPb(Br/I)(3) compositions simply by mixing CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 nano crystals in appropriate ratios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Recent thermodynamic and electrical conductivity data are evaluated to select the most appropriate electrolyte composition for IT-SOFC operation at 500 degrees C. Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has an ionic lattice conductivity of 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C, and the Gd3+ ion is the preferred dopant, compared to Sm3+ and Y3+, at this temperature. Thermodynamic investigations indicate that for CeO2-Re2O3 solid solutions at intermediate temperatures it becomes easier to reduce Ce4+ as the concentration of Re2O3 is increased. As the associated electron mobilities do not appear to be a strong function of composition it follows that Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has a wider ionic domain than Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 at intermediate temperatures. particular attention is drawn to the deleterious effects of impurities (principally SiO2) which are responsible for large dopant concentration dependent grain boundary resistivities. These grain boundary resistivities can obscure the intrinsic lattice ionic conductivities and cause investigators to select non-optimal dopant compositions. It follows that the use of clean (SiO2 < 50 ppm) powders is strongly recommended, particularly as these are now commercially available. At present there is also no compelling evidence to confirm that the intrinsic lattice electronic conductivity is significantly changed by co-doping with Pr6O11. Finally the I-V characteristics of single cells incorporating 25-mu m thick Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolytes are modelled, and the requirements for composite electrodes briefly discussed so that power densities of 0.4 W cm(-2) at 500 degrees C can be attained.

14,"Digital PCR enables the absolute quantitation of nucleic acids in a sample. The lack of scalable and practical technologies for digital PCR implementation has hampered the widespread adoption of this inherently powerful technique. Here we describe a high-throughput droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) system that enables processing of similar to 2 million PCR reactions using conventional TaqMan assays with a 96-well plate workflow. Three applications demonstrate that the massive partitioning afforded by our ddPCR system provides orders of magnitude more p:recision and sensitivity than real-time PCR. First, we show the accurate measurement of germline copy number variation. Second, for rare alleles, we show sensitive detection of mutant DNA in a 100000-fold excess of wildtype background. Third, we demonstrate absolute quantitation of circulating fetal and maternal DNA from cell-free plasma. We anticipate this ddPCR system will allow researchers to explore complex genetic landscapes, discover and validate new disease associations, and define a new era of molecular diagnostics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven collaborators representing commercial laboratories, academic institutions, and government laboratories participated. Seven Youden pair materials representing fruit juices, beverages, natural colorants, and wines were tested. The repeatability relative standard deviation (RSDr) varied from 1.06 to 4.16%. The reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSDR) ranged from 2.69 to 10.12%. The HorRat values were:<= 1.33 for all materials.

16,"The oxidation power of the TiO2-xNx powders with low nitrogen concentrations (<0.02) was evaluated by the decomposition of gaseous 2-propanol (IPA) under the same absorbed photon number, 1.4 x 10(14) quanta.cm(-2).s(-1), of visible (Vis) or ultraviolet (UV) light. Regardless of the x value, the quantum yield values from irradiating with Vis light was lower than with UV light, which suggests that the isolated narrow band formed above the valence band is responsible for the Vis light response in the present nitrogen doped TiO2. In addition, increasing the nitrogen concentration when irradiating with UV light lowered the quantum yields, indicating that the doping sites could also serve as recombination sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous solids with well-defined two- or three-dimensional molecular structures. Although the structural regularity provides this new type of porous material with high potentials in catalysis, no example has been presented so far. Herein, we report the first application of a new COF material, COF-LZU1, for highly efficient catalysis. The easily prepared imine-linked COF-LZU1 possesses a two-dimensional eclipsed layered-sheet structure, making its incorporation with metal ions feasible. Via a simple post-treatment, a Pd(II)-containing COF, Pd/COF-LZU1, was accordingly synthesized, which showed excellent catalytic activity in catalyzing the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction. The superior utility of Pd/COF-LZU1 in catalysis was elucidated by the broad scope of the reactants and the excellent yields (96-98%) of the reaction products, together with the high stability and easy recyclability of the catalyst. We expect that our approach will further boost research on designing and employing functional COF materials for catalysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"The physical and chemical properties of nanophase materials rely on their crystal and surface structures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful and unique technique for structure characterization. The most important application of TEM is the atomic-resolution real-space imaging of nanoparticles. This article introduces the fundamentals of TEM and its applications in structural determination of shape-controlled nanocrystals and their assemblies. By forming a nanometer size electron probe, TEM is unique in identifying and quantifying the chemical and electronic structure of individual nanocrystals. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy analysis of the solid-state effects and mapping the valence states art: even more attractive. In situ TEM is demonstrated for characterizing and measuring the thermodynamic, electric, and mechanical properties of individual nanostructures, from which the structure-property relationship can be registered with a specific nanoparticle/structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"Chemically modified graphene and polyaniline (PANI) nanofiber composites were prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline monomer in the presence of graphene oxide under acid conditions. The obtained graphene oxide/PANI composites with different mass ratios were reduced to graphene using hydrazine followed by reoxidation and reprotonation of the reduced PANI to give the graphene/PANI nanocomposites. The morphology, composition, and electronic structure of the composites together with pure polyaniline fibers (PANI-F), graphene oxide (GO), and graphene (GR) were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid-state C-13 NMR, FT-IR, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the chemically modified graphene and the PANI nanofibers formed a uniform nanocomposite with the PANI Fibers absorbed on the graphene surface and/or Filled between the graphene sheets. Such uniform structure together with the observed high conductivities afforded high specific capacitance and good cycling stability during the charge-discharge process when used as supercapacitor electrodes. A specific capacitance of as high as 480 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g was achieved over a PANI-doped graphene composite. The research data revealed that high specific capacitance and good cycling stability can be achieved either by doping chemically modified graphenes with PANI or by doping the bulky PAN Is with graphene/graphene oxide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"The total structure determination of thiol-protected Au clusters has long been a major issue in cluster research. Herein, we report an unusual single crystal structure of a 25-gold-atom cluster (1.27 nm diameter, surface-to-surface distance) protected by eighteen phenylethanethiol ligands. The Au-25 cluster features a centered icosahedral Au-13 core capped by twelve gold atoms that are situated in six pairs around the three mutually perpendicular 2-fold axes of the icosahedron. The thiolate ligands bind to the Au-25 core in an exclusive bridging mode. This highly symmetric structure is distinctly different from recent predictions of density functional theory, and it also violates the empirical golden rule-cluster of clusters"", which would predict a biicosahedral structure via vertex sharing of two icosahedral M-13 building blocks as previously established in various 25-atom metal clusters protected by phosphine ligands. These results point to the importance of the ligand-gold core interactions. The Au-25(SR)(18) clusters exhibit multiple molecular-like absorption bands, and we find the results are in good correspondence with time-dependent density functional theory calculations for the observed structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"To investigate the initial chemical events associated with high-temperature gas-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons, we have expanded the ReaxFF reactive force field training set to include additional transition states and chemical reactivity of systems relevant to these reactions and optimized the force field parameters against a quantum mechanics (QM)-based training set. To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, we performed a range of NVT-MD simulations on various hydrocarbon/O-2 systems. From simulations on methane/O-2, o-xylene/O-2, propene/O-2, and benzene/O-2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene > o-xylene > methane > benzene), following the trend in the C-H bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO/CO2/H2O mixture and found that the pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition-and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and hydrocarbon radical species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system. Since ReaxFF is capable of simulating complicated reaction pathways without any preconditioning, we believe that atomistic modeling with ReaxFF provides a useful method for determining the initial events of oxidation of hydrocarbons under extreme, conditions and can enhance existing combustion models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"The demand for flexible and wearable electronic devices is increasing due to their facile interaction with human body. Flexible, stretchable and wearable sensors can be easily mounted on clothing or directly attached onto the body. Especially, highly stretchable and sensitive strain sensors are needed for the human motion detection. Here, we report highly flexible, stretchable and sensitive strain sensors based on the nanocomposite of silver nanowire (AgNW) network and PDMS elastomer in the form of the sandwich structure (i.e., AgNW thin film embedded between two layers of PDMS). The AgNW network-elastomer nanocomposite based strain sensors show strong piezoresistivity with tunable gauge factors in the ranges of 2 to 14 and a high stretchability up to 70%.

23,"A new strategy for achieving stable Co single atoms (SAs) on nitrogen-doped porous carbon with high metal loading over 4wt% is reported. The strategy is based on a pyrolysis process of predesigned bimetallic Zn/Co metal-organic frameworks, during which Co can be reduced by carbonization of the organic linker and Zn is selectively evaporated away at high temperatures above 800 degrees C. The spherical aberration correction electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements both confirm the atomic dispersion of Co atoms stabilized by as-generated N-doped porous carbon. Surprisingly, the obtained Co-N-x single sites exhibit superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential (0.881V) that is more positive than commercial Pt/C (0.811V) and most reported non-precious metal catalysts. Durability tests revealed that the Co single atoms exhibit outstanding chemical stability during electrocatalysis and thermal stability that resists sintering at 900 degrees C. Our findings open up a new routine for general and practical synthesis of a variety of materials bearing single atoms, which could facilitate new discoveries at the atomic scale in condensed materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"The beginning of the twenty-first century has witnessed significant advances in the field of C-H bond activation, and this transformation is now an established piece in the synthetic chemists' toolbox. This methodology has the potential to be used in many different areas of chemistry, for example it provides a perfect opportunity for the late-stage diversification of various kinds of organic scaffolds, ranging from relatively small molecules like drug candidates, to complex polydisperse organic compounds such as polymers. In this way, C-H activation approaches enable relatively straightforward access to a plethora of analogues or can help to streamline the lead-optimization phase. Furthermore, synthetic pathways for the construction of complex organic materials can now be designed that are more atom-and step-economical than previous methods and, in some cases, can be based on synthetic disconnections that are just not possible without C-H activation. This Perspective highlights the potential of metal-catalysed C-H bond activation reactions, which now extend beyond the field of traditional synthetic organic chemistry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"Carbon dots (CDs) with tunable photoluminescence (PL) and a quantum yield of up to 35% in water were hydrothermally synthesized in one pot and separated via silica column chromatography. These separated CDs emitted bright and stable luminescence in gradient colors from blue to red under a single-wavelength UV light. They exhibited high optical uniformity; that is, every sample showed only one peak in the PL excitation spectrum, only one peak in the excitation-independent PL emission spectrum, and similar monoexponential fluorescence lifetimes. Although these samples had similar distributions of particle size and graphite structure in their carbon cores, the surface state gradually varied among the samples, especially the degree of oxidation. Therefore, the observed red shift in their emission peaks from 440 to 625 nm was ascribed to a gradual reduction in their band gaps with the increasing incorporation of oxygen species into their surface structures. These energy bands were found to depend on the surface groups and structures but not on the particle size, not as in traditional semiconductor quantum dots. In addition, because of their excellent PL properties and low cytotoxicity, these CDs could be used to image cells in different colors under a single-wavelength light source, and the red-emitting CDs could be used to image live mice because of the strong penetration capability of their fluorescence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

27,"Organic semiconductors that can be fabricated by simple processing techniques and possess excellent electrical performance, are key requirements in the progress of organic electronics.

Relatively large crystalline domain sizes on the length scale of lithographically accessible channel lengths (similar to 200 nm) were exhibited in thin films, thus offering the potential for fabrication of single-crystal polymer transistors.

28,"Introduction: PaDEL-Descriptor is a software for calculating molecular descriptors and fingerprints. The software currently calculates 797 descriptors (663 1D, 2D descriptors, and 134 3D descriptors) and 10 types of fingerprints. These descriptors and fingerprints are calculated mainly using The Chemistry Development Kit. Some additional descriptors and fingerprints were added, which include atom type electrotopological state descriptors, McGowan volume, molecular linear free energy relation descriptors, ring counts, count of chemical substructures identified by Laggner, and binary fingerprints and count of chemical substructures identified by Klekota and Roth. Methods: PaDEL-Descriptor was developed using the Java language and consists of a library component and an interface component. The library component allows it to be easily integrated into quantitative structure activity relationship software to provide the descriptor calculation feature while the interface component allows it to be used as a standalone software. The software uses a Master/Worker pattern to take advantage of the multiple CPU cores that are present in most modern computers to speed up calculations of molecular descriptors. Results: The software has several advantages over existing standalone molecular descriptor calculation software. It is free and open source, has both graphical user interface and command line interfaces, can work on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS), supports more than 90 different molecular file formats, and is multithreaded. Conclusion: PaDEL-Descriptor is a useful addition to the currently available molecular descriptor calculation software.

30,"Silicon nanowires can be prepared with single-crystal structures, diameters as small as several nanometers and controllable hole and electron doping, and thus represent powerful building blocks for nanoelectronics devices such as field effect transistors. To explore the potential limits of silicon nanowire transistors, we have examined the influence of source-drain contact thermal annealing and surface passivation on key transistor properties. Thermal annealing and passivation of oxide defects using chemical modification were found to increase the average transconductance from 45 to 800 nS and average mobility from 30 to 560 cm(2)/V(.)s with peak values of 2000 nS and 1350 cm(2)/V(.)s, respectively.

In studying the effects of the carbon support on the Fe3O4 NPs for the ORR, we found that Fe3O4/N-GAs show a more positive onset potential, higher cathodic density, lower H2O2 yield, and higher electron transfer number for the ORR in alkaline media than Fe3O4 NPs supported on N-doped carbon black or N-doped graphene sheets, highlighting the importance of the 3D macropores and high specific surface area of the GA support for improving the ORR performance. Furthermore, Fe3O4/N-GAs show better durability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"The ability of simple potential functions to reproduce accurately the density of liquid water from -37 to 100 degrees C at 1 to 10 000 atm has been further explored. The result is the five-site TIP5P model, which yields significantly improved results; the average error in the density over the 100 degrees temperature range from -37.5 to 62.5 degrees C at 1 atm is only 0.006 g cm(-3). Classical Monte Carlo statistical mechanics calculations have been performed to optimize the parameters, especially the position of the negative charges along the lone-pair directions. Initial calculations with 216 molecules in the NPT ensemble at 1 atm focused on finding a model that reproduced the shape of the liquid density curve as a function of temperature. Calculations performed for 512 molecules with the final TIP5P model demonstrate that the density maximum near 4 degrees C at 1 atm is reproduced, while high-quality structural and thermodynamic results are maintained. Attainment of high precision for the low-temperature runs required sampling for more than 1 billion Monte Carlo configurations. In addition, the dielectric constant was computed from the response to an applied electric field; the result is 81.5 +/- 1.5 at 25 degrees C and the experimental curve is mirrored from 0-100 degrees C at 1 atm. The TIP5P model is also found to perform well as a function of pressure; the density of liquid water at 25 degrees C is reproduced with an average error of similar to 2% over the range from 1 to 10 000 atm, and the shift of the temperature of maximum density to lower temperature with increasing pressure is also obtained.

33,"ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were prepared by a sol-gel combustion method from a zinc acetate precursor and acetic acid. The ZnO-NPs were synthesized at calcination temperatures of 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C for 1 h. The synthesized ZnO-NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and TEM. The XRD results revealed that the sample product was crystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite phase. High-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed single-crystal ZnO-NPs with nearly spherical shapes. The crystalline development in the ZnO-NPs was investigated by X-ray peak broadening. The Williamson-Hall (W-H) analysis and size-strain plot method were used to study the individual contributions of crystallite sizes and lattice strain on the peak broadening of the ZnO-NPs. The physical parameters such as strain, stress and energy density values were calculated more precisely for all the reflection peaks of XRD corresponding to the wurtzite hexagonal phase of ZnO lying in the range of 20 degrees-100 degrees from the modified form of the W-H plot assuming a uniform deformation model (UDM), uniform stress deformation model (USDM), uniform deformation energy density model (UDEDM) and by the size-strain plot method (SSP). The results obtained showed that the mean particle size of the ZnO-NPs estimated from the TEM, W-H analysis and the SSP method were highly intercorrelated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

34,"We have demonstrated a method to disperse and exfoliate graphite to give graphene suspended in water-surfactant solutions. Optical characterization of these suspensions allowed the partial optimization of the dispersion process. Transmission electron microscopy showed the dispersed phase to consist of small graphitic flakes. More than 40% of these flakes had <5 layers with similar to 3% of flakes consisting of monolayers. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy shows the monolayers to be generally free of defects. The dispersed graphitic flakes are stabilized against reaggregation by Coulomb repulsion due to the adsorbed surfactant. We use DLVO and Hamaker theory to describe this stabilization. However, the larger flakes tend to sediment out over similar to 6 weeks, leaving only small flakes dispersed. It is possible to form thin films by vacuum filtration of these dispersions. Raman and IR spectroscopic analysis of these films suggests the flakes to be largely free of defects and oxides, although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows evidence of a small oxide population. Individual graphene flakes can be deposited onto mica by spray coating, allowing statistical analysis of flake size and thickness. Vacuum filtered films are reasonably conductive and are semitransparent. Further improvements may result in the development of cheap transparent conductors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"A procedure based on the polarizable continuum model (PCM) has been applied to reproduce solvent effects on electronic spectra in connection with the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). To account for solute-solvent interactions, a suitable operator has been defined, which depends on the solute electronic density and can be used to modify the TD-DFT equations for the calculation of molecular polarizabilities and of electronic transition energies. The solute-solvent operator has been derived from a PCM approach depending on solute electrostatic potential: Recently, it has been shown that such an approach also provides an excellent treatment of the solute electronic charge lying far from the nuclei, being particularly reliable for this kind of applications. The method has been tested for formaldehyde in water and in diethyl-ether, and then applied to the calculation of solvent effects on the n --> pi* transition of diazabenzenes in different solvents. The computed transition energies are in fairly good agreement with experimental values. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implicit solvation model follows the framework of joint density functional theory. We describe the framework, our algorithm and implementation, and benchmarks for small molecular systems. We apply the solvation model to study the surface energies of different facets of semiconducting and metallic nanocrystals and the S(N)2 reaction pathway. We find that solvation reduces the surface energies of the nanocrystals, especially for the semiconducting ones and increases the energy barrier of the S(N)2 reaction.

38,"The most widely used oxide for photocatalytic applications owing to its low cost and high activity is TiO2. The discovery of the photolysis of water on the surface of TiO2 in 1972(1) launched four decades of intensive research into the underlying chemical and physical processes involved(2-5). Despite much collected evidence, a thoroughly convincing explanation of why mixed-phase samples of anatase and rutile outperform the individual polymorphs has remained elusive(6). One long-standing controversy is the energetic alignment of the band edges of the rutile and anatase polymorphs of TiO2 (ref. 7). We demonstrate, through a combination of state-of-the-art materials simulation techniques and X-ray photoemission experiments, that a type-II, staggered, band alignment of similar to 0.4 eV exists between anatase and rutile with anatase possessing the higher electron affinity, or work function. Our results help to explain the robust separation of photoexcited charge carriers between the two phases and highlight a route to improved photocatalysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"A composite of graphene oxide supported by needle-like MnO2 nanocrystals (GO-MnO2 nanocomposites) has been fabricated through a simple soft chemical route in a water-isopropyl alcohol system. The formation mechanism of these intriguing nanocomposites investigated by transmission electron microscopy and Raman and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy is proposed as intercalation and adsorption of manganese ions onto the GO sheets, followed by the nucleation and growth of the crystal species in a double solvent system via dissolution-crystallization and oriented attachment mechanisms, which in turn results in the exfoliation of GO sheets. Interestingly, it was found that the electrochemical performance of as-prepared nanocomposites could be enhanced by the chemical interaction between GO and MnO2. This method provides a facile and straightforward approach to deposit MnO2 nanoparticles onto the graphene oxide sheets (single layer of graphite oxide) and may be readily extended to the preparation of other classes of hybrids based on GO sheets for technological applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"We report chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets with a very high concentration of metallic 1T phase using a solvent free intercalation method. After removing the excess of negative charges from the surface of the nanosheets, highly conducting IT phase MoS2 nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward the evolution of hydrogen with a notably low Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec. By partially oxidizing MoS2, we found that the activity of 2H MoS2 is significantly reduced after oxidation, consistent with edge oxidation. On the other hand, IT MoS2 remains unaffected after oxidation, suggesting that edges of the nanosheets are not the main active sites. The importance of electrical conductivity of the two phases on the hydrogen evolution reaction activity has been further confirmed by using carbon nanotubes to increase the conductivity of 2H MoS2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"Though extensively studied, hardness, defined as the resistance of a material to deformation, still remains a challenging issue for a formal theoretical description due to its inherent mechanical complexity. The widely applied Teter's empirical correlation between hardness and shear modulus has been considered to be not always valid for a large variety of materials. The main reason is that shear modulus only responses to elastic deformation whereas the hardness links both elastic and permanent plastic properties. We found that the intrinsic correlation between hardness and elasticity of materials correctly predicts Vickers hardness for a wide variety of crystalline materials as well as bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Our results suggest that, if a material is intrinsically brittle (such as BMGs that fail in the elastic regime), its Vickers hardness linearly correlates with the shear modulus (H-v = 0.151G). This correlation also provides a robust theoretical evidence on the famous empirical correlation observed by Teter in 1998. On the other hand, our results demonstrate that the hardness of polycrystalline materials can be correlated with the product of the squared Pugh's modulus ratio and the shear modulus (H-v = 2(k(2)G)(0.585) - 3 where k =G/B is Pugh's modulus ratio). Our work combines those aspects that were previously argued strongly, and, most importantly, is capable to correctly predict the hardness of all hard compounds known included in several pervious models.

In this paper, we report a facile strategy to prepare N-doped graphene by using nitrogen plasma treatment of graphene synthesized via a chemical method. Meanwhile, a possible schematic diagram has been proposed to detail the structure of N-doped graphene. By controlling the exposure time, the N percentage in host graphene can be regulated, ranging from 0.11 to 1.35%.

45,"Two-dimensional nanosheets have attracted tremendous attention because of their promising practical application and theoretical values. The atomic-thick nanosheets are able to not only enhance the intrinsic properties of their bulk counterparts but also give birth to new promising properties.

The as-obtained ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet solution is very stable in both the acidic and alkaline environment and shows pH-dependent photohuninenscence (PL). Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets show enhanced intrinsic photoabsorption and photoresponse, which induce their extremely high PL quantum yield up to 19.6%. Thus, benefiting from the inherent blue light PL with high quantum yields and high stability, good biocompatibility, and nontoxicity, the water-soluble ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet is a brand-new but promising candidate for bioimaging application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"This paper describes the parametrization of a new coarse grained (CG) model for lipid and surfactant systems. Reduction of the number of degrees of freedom together with the use of short range potentials makes it computationally very efficient. Compared to atomistic models a gain of 3-4 orders of magnitude can be achieved. Micrometer length scales or millisecond time scales are therefore within reach. To encourage applications, the model is kept very simple. Only a small number of coarse grained atom types are defined, which interact using a few discrete levels of interaction. Despite the computational speed and the simplistic nature of the model, it proves to be both versatile in its applications and accurate in its predictions. We show that densities of liquid alkanes from decane up to eicosane can be reproduced to within 5%, and the mutual solubilities of alkanes in water and water in alkanes can be reproduced within 0.5 kT of the experimental values. The CG model for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is shown to aggregate spontaneously into a bilayer. Structural properties such as the area per headgroup and the phosphate-phosphate distance match the experimentally measured quantities closely. The same is true for elastic properties such as the bending modulus and the area compressibility, and dynamic properties such as the lipid lateral diffusion coefficient and the water permeation rate. The distribution of the individual lipid components along the bilayer normal is very similar to distributions obtained from atomistic simulations. Phospholipids with different headgroup (ethanolamine) or different tail lengths (lauroyl, stearoyl) or unsaturated tails (oleoyl) can also be modeled with the CG force field. The experimental area per headgroup can be reproduced for most lipids within 0.02 nm(2). Finally, the CG model is applied to nonbilayer phases. Dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) aggregates into small micelles that are structurally very similar to ones modeled atomistically, and DOPE forms an inverted hexagonal phase with structural parameters in agreement with experimental data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"Layer-by-layer stacking or lateral interfacing of atomic monolayers has opened up unprecedented opportunities to engineer two-dimensional heteromaterials. Fabrication of such artificial heterostructures with atomically clean and sharp interfaces, however, is challenging.

Vertically stacked bilayers with WS2 epitaxially grown on top of the MoS2 monolayer are formed with preferred stacking order at high temperature. A strong interlayer excitonic transition is observed due to the type II band alignment and to the clean interface of these bilayers. Vapour growth at low temperature, on the other hand, leads to lateral epitaxy of WS2 on MoS2 edges, creating seamless and atomically sharp in-plane heterostructures that generate strong localized photoluminescence enhancement and intrinsic p-n junctions. The fabrication of heterostructures from monolayers, using simple and scalable growth, paves the way for the creation of unprecedented two-dimensional materials with exciting properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,Photoexcited semiconductor nanoparticles undergo charge equilibration when they are in contact with metal nanoparticles. Such a charge distribution has direct influence in dictating the energetics of the composite by shifting the Fermi level to more negative potentials. The transfer of electrons to Au nanoparticles has now been probed by exciting TiO2 nanoparticles under steady-state and laser pulse excitation. Equilibration with the C-60/C-60(-) redox couple provides a means to determine the apparent Fermi level of the TiO2-Au composite system. The size-dependent shift in the apparent Fermi level of the TiO2-Au composite (20 mV for 8-nm diameter and 40 mV for 5-nm and 60 mV for 3-nm gold nanoparticles) shows the ability of Au nanoparticles to influence the energetics by improving the photoinduced charge separation. Isolation of individual charge-transfer steps from UV-excited TiO2 --> Au --> C-60 has provided mechanistic and kinetic information on the role of metal in semiconductor-assisted photocatalysis and size-dependent catalytic activity of metal-semiconductor nanocomposites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

52,"Thin-film structures can reduce the cost of solar power by using inexpensive substrates and a lower quantity and quality of semiconductor material. However, the resulting short optical path length and minority carrier diffusion length necessitates either a high absorption coefficient or excellent light trapping. Semiconducting nanowire arrays have already been shown to have low reflective losses compared to planar semiconductors, but their light-trapping properties have not been measured. Using optical transmission and photocurrent measurements on thin silicon films, we demonstrate that ordered arrays of silicon nanowires increase the path length of incident solar radiation by up to a Factor of 73. This extraordinary light-trapping path length enhancement factor is above the randomized scattering (Lambertian) limit (2n(2)similar to 25 without a back reflector) and is superior to other light-trapping methods. By changing the silicon film thickness and nanowire length, we show that there is a competition between improved absorption and increased surface recombination; for nanowire arrays fabricated from 8 mu m thick silicon films, the enhanced absorption can dominate over surface recombination, even without any surface passivation. These nanowire devices give efficiencies above 5%, with short-circuit photocurrents higher than planar control samples,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

55,"The chemical diversity of antioxidants makes it difficult to separate and quantify antioxidants from the vegetable matrix. Therefore, it is desirable to establish a method that can measure the total antioxidant activity level directly from vegetable extracts. The current literature clearly states that there is no ""total antioxidant"" as a nutritional index available for food labeling because of the lack of standard quantitation methods. Thus, this work reports the development of a simple, widely applicable antioxidant capacity index for dietary polyphenols and vitamins C and E, utilizing the copper(II)-neocuproine [Cu(II)-Nc] reagent as the chromogenic oxidizing agent. Because the copper(II) (or cupric) ion reducing ability of polyphenols is measured, the method is named by our research group ""cupric reducing antioxidant capacity"" abbreviated as the CUPRAC method. This method should be advantageous over the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method because the redox chemistry of copper(II)-as opposed to that of ferric ion-involves faster kinetics. The method comprises mixing of the antioxidant solution (directly or after acid hydrolysis) with a copper(II) chloride solution, a neocuproine alcoholic solution, and an ammonium acetate aqueous buffer at pH 7 and subsequent measurement of the developed absorbance at 450 nm after 30 min. Because the color development is fast for compounds such as ascorbic acid, gallic acid, and quercetin but slow for naringin and naringenin, the latter compounds were assayed after incubation at 50degreesC on a water bath for 20 min [after Cu(II)-Nc reagent addition] so as to force the oxidation reaction to reach completion. The flavonoid glycosides were hydrolyzed to their corresponding aglycons by refluxing in 1.2 M HCl-containing 50% MeOH so as to exert maximal reducing power toward Cu(II)-Nc. Certain compounds also needed incubation after acid hydrolysis to fully exhibit their reducing capability. The CUPRAC antioxidant capacities of synthetic mixtures of antioxidants were experimentally measured as Trolox equivalents and compared to those theoretically found by making use of the principle of additivity of absorbances assuming no chemical interaction between the mixture constituents. Because ascorbic acid is not resistant to elevated temperature incubation, it should be assayed initially by measuring the absorbance (at 450 nm) difference of original and ascorbate oxidase-added mixture solutions at the end of 1 min of Cu(II)-Nc reagent addition. Thus, the total CUPRAC antioxidant capacity of a mixture containing various antioxidants should be that finally measured after a suitable combination of hydrolysis and incubation procedures, added to the initially measured capacity due to ascorbate. The antioxidant polyphenolic compounds tested demonstrate that the highest capacities in the CUPRAC method were observed for epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, fisetin, epigallocatechin, catechin, and caffeic acid in this order, in accordance with theoretical expectations, because the number and position of the hydroxyl groups as well as the degree of conjugation of the whole molecule are important. The antioxidant potency of flavonoids is nearly proportional to the total number of -OH groups and is positively affected by the presence of an o-dihydroxy moiety in the B-ring. P-Carotene, which did not react with the CUPRAC reagent in alcoholic aqueous medium, could be assayed in dichloromethane solvent. Linear calibration curves for ascorbic acid and flavonoids were redrawn in synthetic solutions containing a mixture of antioxidants, and also in real matrices such as grape and orange juices, green tea, and blackberry tea, showing an initial nonzero absorbance with the CUPRAC reagent. The parallellism of the linear calibration curves of pure compounds in a given complex matrix effectively demonstrated that there were no interferent chemical interactions among the solution constituents and that the antioxidant capacities of the tested antioxidants were additive. The CUPRAC reagent is reasonably selective, stable, easily accessible, and sensitive toward thiol-type oxidants, unlike the FRAP method. The reaction is carried out at nearly physiological pH as opposed to the unrealistic acidic pH of FRAP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,"A generic preprocessing method for multivariate data, called orthogonal projections to latent structures (O-PLS), is described. O-PLS removes variation from X (descriptor variables) that is not correlated to Y (property variables, e.g. yield, cost or toxicity). In mathematical terms this is equivalent to removing systematic variation in X that is orthogonal to Y. In an earlier paper, Wold et al. (Chemometrics Intell, Lab. Syst. 1998; 44:175-185) described orthogonal signal correction (OSC). In this paper a method with the same objective but with different means is described. The proposed O-PLS method analyzes the variation explained in each PLS component. The non-correlated systematic variation in X is removed, making interpretation of the resulting PLS model easier and with the additional benefit that the non-correlated variation itself can be analyzed further. As an example, near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra of wood chips were analyzed. Applying O-PLS resulted in reduced model complexity with preserved prediction ability, effective removal of noncorrelated variation in X and, not least, improved interpretational ability of both correlated and noncorrelated variation in the NIR spectra.

57,"Electrospinning is a fabrication process that uses an electric field to control the deposition of polymer fibers onto a target substrate. This electrostatic processing strategy can be used to fabricate fibrous polymer mats composed of fiber diameters ranging from several microns down to 100 nm or less. In this study, we describe how electrospinning can be adapted to produce tissue-engineering scaffolds composed of collagen nanofibers. Optimizing conditions for calfskin type I collagen produced a matrix composed of 100 nm fibers that exhibited the 67 nm banding pattern that is characteristic of native collagen. The structural properties of electrospun collagen varied with the tissue of origin (type I from skin vs type I from placenta), the isotype (type I vs type 111), and the concentration of the collagen solution used to spin the fibers. Electrospinning is a rapid and efficient process that can be used to selectively deposit polymers in a random fashion or along a predetermined and defined axis. Toward that end, our experiments demonstrate that it is possible to tailor subtle mechanical properties into a matrix by controlling fiber orientation. The inherent properties of the electrospinning process make it possible to fabricate complex, and seamless, three-dimensional shapes. Electrospun collagen promotes cell growth and the penetration of cells into the engineered matrix.

58,"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been performed to investigate electronic and ionic processes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC). A theoretical model has been elaborated, to interpret the frequency response of the device. The high-frequency feature is attributed to the charge transfer at the counter electrode while the response in the intermediate-frequency region is associated with the electron transport in the mesoscopic TiO2 film and the back reaction at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The low-frequency region reflects the diffusion in the electrolyte. Using an appropriate equivalent circuit, the electron transport rate and electron lifetime in the mesoscopic film have been derived, which agree with the values derived from transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements. The EIS measurements show that DSC performance variations under prolonged thermal aging result mainly from the decrease in the lifetime of the conduction band electron in the TiO2 film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

61,"Molecular dynamics (MD) allows the study of biological and chemical systems at the atomistic level on timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds. It complements experiment while also offering a way to follow processes difficult to discern with experimental techniques. Numerous software packages exist for conducting MD simulations of which one of the widest used is termed Amber. Here, we outline the most recent developments, since version 9 was released in April 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package. The latest release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work beginning with the first version in 1979. The latest release of the Amber package, version 12 released in April 2012, includes a substantial number of important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas. We present here a condensed vision of what Amber currently supports and where things are likely to head over the coming years. Figure 1 shows the performance in ns/day of the Amber package version 12 on a single-core AMD FX-8120 8-Core 3.6GHz CPU, the Cray XT5 system, and a single GPU GTX680.

63,"Lithiation of individual silicon nanopartides was studied in real time with in situ transmission electron microscopy. A strong size dependence of fracture was discovered; that Is, there exists a critical particle diameter of similar to 150 nm, below which the particles neither cracked nor fractured upon first lithiation, and above which the particles initially formed surface cracks and then fractured due to lithiation-induced swelling. The unexpected surface cracking arose owing to the buildup of large tensile hoop stress, which reversed the initial compression, in the surface layer. The stress reversal was attributed to the unique mechanism of lithiation in crystalline Si, taking place by movement of a two-phase boundary between the inner core of pristine Si and the outer shell of amorphous Li-Si alloy. While the resulting hoop tension tended to initiate surface cracks, the small-sized nanoparticles nevertheless averted fracture. This is because the stored strain energy from electrochemical reactions was insufficient to drive crack propagation, as dictated by the interplay between the two length scales, that is, particle diameter and crack size, that control the fracture. These results are diametrically opposite to those obtained previously from single-phase modeling, which predicted only compressive hoop stress In the surface layer and thus crack initiation from the center in lithiated Si particles and wires. Our work provides direct evidence of the mechanical robustness of small Si nanoparticles for applications in lithium ion batteries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"We report on the use of Neem (Azadirachta indica) leaf broth in the extracellular synthesis of pure metallic silver and gold nanoparticles and bimetallic Au/Ag nanoparticles. On treatment of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and chloroauric acid with Neem leaf extract, the rapid formation of stable silver and gold nanoparticles at high concentrations is observed to occur. The silver and gold nanoparticles are polydisperse, with a large percentage of gold particles exhibiting an interesting flat, platelike morphology. Competitive reduction of Au3+ and Ag+ ions present simultaneously in solution during exposure to Neem leaf extract leads to the synthesis of bimetallic Au core-Ag shell nanoparticles in solution. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the silver nanoparticles are adsorbed onto the gold nanoparticles, forming a core-shell structure. The rates of reduction of the metal ions by Neem leaf extract are much faster than those observed by us in our earlier studies using microorganisms such as fungi, highlighting the possibility that nanoparticle biological synthesis methodologies will achieve rates of synthesis comparable to those of chemical methods.

66,"This paper emphasizes the importance of rigorous validation as a crucial, integral component of Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR) model development. We consider some examples of published QSPR models, which in spite of their high fitted accuracy for the training sets and apparent mechanistic appeal, fail rigorous validation tests, and, thus, may lack practical utility as reliable screening tools. We present a set of simple guidelines for developing validated and predictive QSPR models. To this end, we discuss several validation strategies including (1) randomization of the modelled property, also called Y-scrambling, (2) multiple leave-many-out cross-validations, and (3) external validation using rational division of a dataset into training and test sets. We also highlight the need to establish the domain of model applicability in the chemical space to flag molecules for which predictions may be unreliable, and discuss some algorithms that can be used for this purpose. We advocate the broad use of these guidelines in the development of predictive QSPR models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

68,"We investigated the mechanism by which transferrin-coated gold nanoparticles (Au NP) of different sizes and shapes entered mammalian cells. We determined that transferrin-coated Au NP entered the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. The NPs exocytosed out of the cells in a linear relationship to size. This was different than the relationship between uptake and size. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical equation to predict the relationship of size versus exocytosis for different cell lines. These studies will provide guidelines for developing NPs for imaging and drug delivery applications, which will require ""controlling"" NP accumulation rate. These studies will also have implications in determining nanotoxicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"Triangular silver nanoparticles (similar to100 nm wide and 50 nm high) have remarkable optical properties. In particular, the peak extinction wavelength, lambda(max) of their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectrum is unexpectedly sensitive to nanoparticle size, shape, and local (similar to10-30 nm) external dielectric environment. This sensitivity of the LSPR lambda(max) to the nanoenvironment has allowed us to develop a new class of nanoscale affinity biosensors. The essential characteristics and operational principles of these LSPR nanobiosensors will be illustrated using the well-studied biotin-streptavidin system. Exposure of biotin-functionalized Ag nanotriangles to 100 nM streptavidin (SA) caused a 27.0 nm red-shift in the LSPR lambda(max). The LSPR lambda(max) shift, DeltaR/DeltaR(max), versus [SA] response curve was measured over the concentration range 10(-15) M < [SA] < 10(-6) M. Comparison of the data with the theoretical normalized response expected for 1:1 binding of a ligand to a multivalent receptor with different sites but invariant affinities yielded approximate values for the saturation response, DeltaR(max) = 26.5 nm, and the surface-confined thermodynamic binding constant K-a,K-surf = 10(11) M-1. At present, the limit of detection (LOD) for the LSPR nanobiosensor is found to be in the low-picomolar to high-femtomolar region. A strategy to amplify the response of the LSPR nanobiosensor using biotinylated Au colloids and thereby further improve the LOD is demonstrated. Several control experiments were performed to define the LSPR nanobiosensor's response to nonspecific binding as well as to demonstrate its response to the specific binding of another protein. These include the following: (1) electrostatic binding of SA to a nonbiotinylated surface, (2) nonspecific interactions of prebiotinylated SA to a biotinylated surface, (3) nonspecific interactions of bovine serum albumin to a biotinylated surface, and (4) specific binding of anti-biotin to a biotinylated surface. The LSPR nanobiosensor provides a pathway to ultrasensitive biodetection experiments with extremely simple, small, light, robust, low-cost instrumentation that will greatly facilitate field-portable environmental or point-of-service medical diagnostic applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"Hierarchical flowerlike nickel hydroxide decorated on graphene sheets has been prepared by a facile and cost-effective microwave-assisted method. In order to achieve high energy and power densities, a high-voltage asymmetric supercapacitor is successfully fabricated using Ni(OH)2/graphene and porous graphene as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Because of their unique structure, both of these materials exhibit excellent electrochemical performances. The optimized asymmetric supercapacitor could be cycled reversibly in the high-voltage region of 01.6 V and displays intriguing performances with a maximum specific capacitance of 218.4 F g-1 and high energy density of 77.8 Wh kg-1. Furthermore, the Ni(OH)2/graphene//porous graphene supercapacitor device exhibits an excellent long cycle life along with 94.3% specific capacitance retained after 3000 cycles. These fascinating performances can be attributed to the high capacitance and the positive synergistic effects of the two electrodes.

71,"Recent progress in large-area synthesis of monolayer molybdenum disulphide, a new two-dimensional direct-bandgap semiconductor, is paving the way for applications in atomically thin electronics. Little is known, however, about the microstructure of this material. Here we have refined chemical vapour deposition synthesis to grow highly crystalline islands of monolayer molybdenum disulphide up to 120 mu m in size with optical and electrical properties comparable or superior to exfoliated samples. Using transmission electron microscopy, we correlate lattice orientation, edge morphology and crystallinity with island shape to demonstrate that triangular islands are single crystals. The crystals merge to form faceted tilt and mirror twin boundaries that are stitched together by lines of 8- and 4-membered rings. Density functional theory reveals localized mid-gap states arising from these 8- 4 defects. We find that mirror twin boundaries cause strong photoluminescence quenching whereas tilt boundaries cause strong enhancement. Meanwhile, mirror twin boundaries slightly increase the measured in-plane electrical conductivity, whereas tilt boundaries slightly decrease the conductivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the perovskite layer in these efficient solar cells has generally been fabricated by either vapor deposition or a two-step sequential deposition process. We report that flat, uniform thin films of this material can be deposited by a one-step, solvent-induced, fast crystallization method involving spin-coating of a DMF solution of CH3NH3PbI3 followed immediately by exposure to chlorobenzene to induce crystallization. Analysis of the devices and films revealed that the perovskite films consist of large crystalline grains with sizes up to microns. Planar heterojunction solar cells constructed with these solution-processed thin films yielded an average power conversion efficiency of 13.9 +/- 0.7% and a steady state efficiency of 13% under standard AM 1.5 conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"To progress from the laboratory to commercial applications, it will be necessary to develop industrially scalable methods to produce large quantities of defect-free graphene. Here we show that high-shear mixing of graphite in suitable stabilizing liquids results in large-scale exfoliation to give dispersions of graphene nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy show the exfoliated flakes to be unoxidized and free of basal-plane defects. We have developed a simple model that shows exfoliation to occur once the local shear rate exceeds 10(4) s(-1). By fully characterizing the scaling behaviour of the graphene production rate, we show that exfoliation can be achieved in liquid volumes from hundreds of millilitres up to hundreds of litres and beyond. The graphene produced by this method performs well in applications from composites to conductive coatings. This method can be applied to exfoliate BN, MoS2 and a range of other layered crystals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,"We report a comprehensive study of transparent and conductive silver nanowire (Ag NW) electrodes, including a scalable fabrication process, morphologies, and optical, mechanical adhesion, and flexibility properties, and various routes to improve the performance. We utilized a synthesis specifically designed for long and thin wires for improved performance in terms of sheet resistance and optical transmittance. Twenty Omega/sq and similar to 80% specular transmittance, and 8 ohms/sq and 80% diffusive transmittance in the visible range are achieved, which fall in the same range as the best indium tin oxide (ITO) samples on plastic substrates for flexible electronics and solar cells. The Ag NW electrodes show optical transparencies superior to ITO for near-infrared wavelengths (2-fold higher transmission). Owing to light scattering effects, the Ag NW network has the largest difference between diffusive transmittance and specular transmittance when compared with ITO and carbon nanotube electrodes, a property which could greatly enhance solar cell performance. A mechanical study shows that Ag NW electrodes on flexible substrates show excellent robustness when subjected to bending. We also study the electrical conductance of Ag nanowires and their junctions and report a facile electrochemical method for a Au coating to reduce the wire-to-wire junction resistance for better overall film conductance. Simple mechanical pressing was also found to increase the NW film conductance due to the reduction of junction resistance. The overall properties of transparent Ag NW electrodes meet the requirements of transparent electrodes for many applications and could be an immediate ITO replacement for flexible electronics and solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

76,"Owing to their high power density and superior cyclability relative to batteries, electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) have emerged as an important electrical energy storage technology that will play a critical role in the large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources, smart power grids, and electrical vehicles'. Because the capacitance and charge-discharge rates of EDLCs scale with surface area and electrical conductivity, respectively, porous carbons such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes and crosslinked or holey graphenes are used exclusively as the active electrode materials in EDLCs4-9. One class of materials whose surface area far exceeds that of activated carbons, potentially allowing them to challenge the dominance of carbon electrodes in EDLCs, is metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)(10). The high porosity of MOFs, however, is conventionally coupled to very poor electrical conductivity, which has thus far prevented the use of these materials as active electrodes in EDLCs. Here, we show that Ni-3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)(2) (Ni-3(HITP)(2)), a MOF with high electrical conductivity(11), can serve as the sole electrode material in an EDLC. This is the first example of a supercapacitor made entirely from neat MOFs as active materials, without conductive additives or other binders. The MOF-based device shows an areal capacitance that exceeds those of most carbon-based materials and capacity retention greater than 90% over 10,000 cycles, in line with commercial devices. Given the established structural and compositional tunability of MOFs, these results herald the advent of a new generation of supercapacitors whose active electrode materials can be tuned rationally, at the molecular level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"We developed nanosized, reduced graphene oxide (nano-rGO) sheets with high near-infrared (NIR) light absorbance and biocompatibility for potential photothermal therapy. The single-layered nano-rGO sheets were similar to 20 nm in average lateral dimension, functionalized noncovalently by amphiphilic PEGylated polymer chains to render stability in biological solutions and exhibited 6-fold higher NIR absorption than nonreduced, covalently PEGylated nano-GO. Attaching a targeting peptide bearing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif to nano-rGO afforded selective cellular uptake in U87MG cancer cells and highly effective photoablation of cells in vitro. In the absence of any NIR irradiation, nano-rGO exhibited little toxicity in vitro at concentrations well above the doses needed for photothermal heating. This work established nano-rGO as a novel photothermal agent due to its small size, high photothermal efficiency, and low cost as compared to other NIR photothermal agents including gold nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"A one-step simple synthesis of silver colloid nanoparticles with controllable sizes is presented. In this synthesis, reduction of [Ag(NH3)(2)](+) complex cation by four saccharides was performed. Four saccharides were used: two monosaccharides (glucose and galactose) and two disaccharides (maltose and lactose). The syntheses performed at various ammonia concentrations (0.005-0.20 mol L-1) and pH conditions (11.5-13.0) produced a wide range of particle sizes (25-450 nm) with narrow size distributions, especially at the lowest ammonia concentrations. The average size, size distribution, morphology, and structure of particles were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV/Visible absorption spectrophotometry. The influence of the saccharide structure (monosacharides versus disaccharides) on the size of silver particles is briefly discussed. The reduction of [Ag(NH3)(2)](+) by maltose produced silver particles with a narrow size distribution with an average size of 25 nm, which showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including highly multiresistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles was found to be dependent on the size of silver particles. A very low concentration of silver (as low as 1.69 mu g/mL Ag) gave antibacterial performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,"One great challenge in the development of lithium ion batteries is to simultaneously achieve high power and large energy capacity at fast charge and discharge rates for several minutes to seconds. Here we show that nitrogen- or boron-doped graphene can be used as a promising anode for high-power and high-energy lithium ion batteries under high-rate charge and discharge conditions. The doped graphene shows a high reversible capacity of >1040 mAh g(-1) at a low rate of 50 mA g(-1). More importantly, it can be quickly charged and discharged in a very short time of 1 h to several tens of seconds together with high-rate capability and excellent long-term cyclability. For example, a very high capacity of similar to 199 and 235 mAh g(-1) was obtained for the N-doped graphene and B-doped graphene at 25 A g(-1) (about 30 s to full charge). We believe that the unique two-dimensional structure, disordered surface morphology, heteroatomic defects, better electrode/electrolyte wettability, increased intersheet distance, improved electrical conductivity, and thermal stability of the doped graphene are beneficial to rapid surface Li+ absorption and ultrafast Li+ diffusion and electron transport, and thus make the doped materials superior to those of pristine chemically derived graphene and other carbonaceous materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,"Electronic structure intrinsically controls the light absorbance, redox potential, charge-carrier mobility, and consequently, photoreactivity of semiconductor photocatalysts. The conventional approach of modifying the electronic structure of a semiconductor photocatalyst for a wider absorption range by anion doping operates at the cost of reduced redox potentials and/or charge-carrier mobility, so that its photoreactivity is usually limited and some important reactions may not occur at all. Here, we report sulfur-doped graphitic C3N4 (C3N4-xSx) with a unique electronic structure that displays an increased valence bandwidth in combination with an elevated conduction band minimum and a slightly reduced absorbance. The C3N4-xSx shows a photoreactivity of H-2 evolution 7.2 and 8.0 times higher than C3N4 under lambda > 300 and 420 nm, respectively. More strikingly, the complete oxidation process of phenol under lambda > 400 nm can occur for sulfur-doped C3N4, which is impossible for C3N4 even under lambda > 300 nm. The homogeneous substitution of sulfur for lattice nitrogen and a concomitant quantum confinement effect are identified as the cause of this unique electronic structure and, consequently, the excellent photoreactivity of C3N4-xSx. The results acquired may shed light on general doping strategies for designing potentially efficient photocatalysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CN-MBE (1-cyano-trans-1,2-bis-(4'-methylbiphenyl)ethylene) is very weakly fluorescent in solution, but the intensity is increased by almost 700 times in the nanoparticles. Enhanced emission in CN-MBE nanoparticles is attributed to the synergetic effect of intramolecular planarization and J-type aggregate formation (restricted excimer formation) in nanopaticles. On/off fluorescence switching for organic vapor was demonstrated with CN-MBE nanoparticles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"This article provides an overview of current research into the synthesis and properties of gold nanorods. Interest in rod-shaped nanoparticles stems from their unique optical properties, which can be approximated by Mie-Gans theory. We begin by outlining briefly the origin of the shape-dependent optical properties of rods. The different synthetic strategies that have been developed to achieve decent yields and sample monodispersity are then described, and the methods used for physical characterization as well as results of inorganic structure studies follow. Some of the most innovative research dealing with surface modification and chemical reactivity of gold nanorods is highlighted, together with new directions such as the synthesis of core-shell particles and the interactions of gold nanorods with biomolecules. Gold nanorods can be excited by ultrafast laser-induced heating; the resulting relaxation processes are important in determining the material properties of the metal particles. In addition, vibrational modes and shape changes are elucidated, and a theoretical analysis of the expected behavior is also presented. The incorporation of the gold nanorods into thin films and gels provides a new avenue for designing and growing materials with anisotropic optical properties. Initial results on the optical properties of such nanocomposites are reviewed. This review is concluded with a section devoted to the future perspectives for gold rods as novel materials.

83,"The kinetics of sorption from a solution onto an adsorbent has been explored theoretically. The general analytical solution was obtained for two cases. It has been shown that at high initial concentration of solute (sorbate) the general equation converts to a pseudo-first-order model and at lower initial concentration of solute it converts to a pseudo-second-order model. In other words, the sorption process obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics at high initial concentration of solute, while it obeys pseudo-second-order kinetics model at lower initial concentration of solute. The theoretical results (derived equations) show that the observed rate constants of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models are combinations of adsorption and desorption rate constants and also initial concentration of solute. The obtained theoretical equations are used to correlate experimental data for sorption kinetics of some solutes on various sorbents. The predictions of the theory are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A simple physical mixture of pre-synthesized Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates and graphene sheets shows lower specific capacitance, highlighting the importance of direct growth of nanomaterials on graphene to impart intimate interactions and efficient charge transport between the active nanomaterials and the conducting graphene network. Single-crystalline Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates directly grown on graphene sheets also significantly outperform small Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles grown on heavily oxidized, electrically insulating graphite oxide (GO), suggesting that the electrochemical performance of these composites is dependent on the quality of graphene substrates and the morphology and crystallinity of the nanomaterials grown on top.

87,"We report on the fabrication and properties of the semiconducting 2D (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, and 4) perovskite thin films. The band gaps of the series decrease with increasing n values, from 2.24 eV (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)PbI4 (n = 1) to 1.52 eV CH3NH3PbI3 (n = infinity). The compounds exhibit strong light absorption in the visible region, accompanied by strong photoluminescence at room temperature, rendering them promising light absorbers for photovoltaic applications. Moreover, we find that thin films of the semi-2D perovskites display an ultrahigh surface coverage as a result of the unusual film self-assembly that orients the [Pb(n)I3(n+1)]- layers perpendicular to the substrates. We have successfully implemented this 2D perovskite family in solid-state solar cells, and obtained an initial power conversion efficiency of 4.02%, featuring an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 929 mV and a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 9.42 mA/cm(2) from the n = 3 compound.

88,"Numerous candidates attempting to replace Si-based flash memory have failed for a variety of reasons over the years. Oxide-based resistance memory and the related memristor have succeeded in surpassing the specifications for a number of device requirements. However, a material or device structure that satisfies high-density, switching-speed, endurance, retention and most importantly power-consumption criteria has yet to be announced. In this work we demonstrate a TaOx-based asymmetric passive switching device with which we were able to localize resistance switching and satisfy all aforementioned requirements. In particular, the reduction of switching current drastically reduces power consumption and results in extreme cycling endurances of over 10(12). Along with the 10 ns switching times, this allows for possible applications to the working-memory space as well. Furthermore, by combining two such devices each with an intrinsic Schottky barrier we eliminate any need for a discrete transistor or diode in solving issues of stray leakage current paths in high-density crossbar arrays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-temperature (300 degreesC) aging of iron-oleic acid metal complex, which was prepared by the thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl in the presence of oleic acid at 100 degreesC, was found to generate monodisperse iron nanoparticles. The resulting iron nanoparticles were transformed to monodisperse gamma -Fe2O3 nanocrystallites by controlled oxidation by using trimethylamine oxide as a mild oxidant. Particle size can be varied from 4 to 16 nm by controlling the experimental parameters.

92,"Co3O4, which is of mixed valences Co2+ and Co3+, has been extensively investigated as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The proper control of Co2+/Co3+ ratio in Co3O4 could lead to modifications on its electronic and thus catalytic properties. Herein, we designed an efficient Co3O4-based OER electrocatalyst by a plasma-engraving strategy, which not only produced higher surface area, but also generated oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 surface with more Co2+ formed. The increased surface area ensures the Co3O4 has more sites for OER, and generated oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 surface improve the electronic conductivity and create more active defects for OER. Compared to pristine Co3O4, the engraved Co3O4 exhibits a much higher current density and a lower onset potential. The specific activity of the plasma-engraved Co3O4 nanosheets (0.055mAcm(BET)(-2) at 1.6V) is 10 times higher than that of pristine Co3O4, which is contributed by the surface oxygen vacancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While previous proposals consider rutile as a passive electron sink hindering recombination in anatase, this research details the critical and active role of rutile in TiO2 formulations. The inactivity of pure-phase rutile is due in part to rapid rates of recombination. Yet, in mixed-phase TiO2, charges produced on rutile by visible light are stabilized through electron transfer to lower energy anatase lattice trapping sites. These results suggest that within mixed-phase titania (P25) there is a morphology of nanoclusters containing atypically small rutile crystallites interwoven with anatase crystallites. The transition points between these two phases allow for rapid electron transfer from rutile to anatase. Thus, rutile acts as an antenna to extend the photoactivity into visible wavelengths and the structural arrangement of the similarly sized TiO2 crystallites creates catalytic ""hot spots"" at the rutile-anatase interface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"Microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that display permanent porosity show great promise for a myriad of purposes. The potential applications of MOFs can be developed further and extended by encapsulating various functional species (for example, nanoparticles) within the frameworks. However, despite increasing numbers of reports of nanoparticle/MOF composites, simultaneously to control the size, composition, dispersed nature, spatial distribution and confinement of the incorporated nanoparticles within MOF matrices remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a controlled encapsulation strategy that enables surfactant-capped nanostructured objects of various sizes, shapes and compositions to be enshrouded by a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). The incorporated nanoparticles are well dispersed and fully confined within the ZIF-8 crystals. This strategy also allows the controlled incorporation of multiple nanoparticles within each ZIF-8 crystallite. The as-prepared nanoparticle/ZIF-8 composites exhibit active (catalytic, magnetic and optical) properties that derive from the nanoparticles as well as molecular sieving and orientation effects that originate from the framework material.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"This paper presents a review of the research progress in the carbon-metal oxide composites for supercapacitor electrodes. In the past decade, various carbon-metal oxide composite electrodes have been developed by integrating metal oxides into different carbon nanostructures including zero-dimensional carbon nanoparticles, one-dimensional nanostructures (carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers), two-dimensional nanosheets (graphene and reduced graphene oxides) as well as three-dimensional porous carbon nano-architectures. This paper has described the constituent, the structure and the properties of the carbon-metal oxide composites. An emphasis is placed on the synergistic effects of the composite on the performance of supercapacitors in terms of specific capacitance, energy density, power density, rate capability and cyclic stability. This paper has also discussed the physicochemical processes such as charge transport, ion diffusion and redox reactions involved in supercapacitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"We report herein on several phenomenological electrode-solution interactions which determine the performance of lithium and lithium ion batteries. This review is based on extensive studies of the behavior of Li, lithiated carbons and lithiated transition metal oxide electrodes in a wide variety of non-aqueous electrolyte solutions. These studies included spectroscopic measurements (FTIR, XPS, EDAX), morphological and structural analysis (XRD, SEM, AFM) in conjunction with impedance spectroscopy, EQCM and standard electrochemical techniques. It appears that the performance of both Li, Li-C anodes and LixMOy cathodes depends on their surface chemistry in solutions. We address complicated surface film formation on these electrodes, which either contribute to electrode stabilization or to capacity fading due to an increase in the electrodes' impedance. Several common classical phenomena occurring in these systems are reviewed and discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"Halide perovskite solar cells have the potential to exhibit higher energy conversion efficiencies with ultrathin films than conventional thin-film solar cells based on CdTe, CuInSe2, and Cu2ZnSnSe4. The superior solar-cell performance of halide perovskites may originate from its high optical absorption, comparable electron and hole effective mass, and electrically clean defect properties, including point defects and grain boundaries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
