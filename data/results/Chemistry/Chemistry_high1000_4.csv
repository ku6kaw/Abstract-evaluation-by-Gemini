0,"Scale factors for obtaining fundamental vibrational frequencies, low-frequency vibrational frequencies, zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVEs), and thermal contributions to enthalpy and entropy have been derived through a least-squares approach from harmonic frequencies determined at more than 100 levels of theory. Wave function procedures (HF, MP2, QCISD, QCISD(T), CCSD, and CCSD(T)) and a large and representative range of density functional theory (DFT) approaches (B3-LYP, BMK, EDF2, M05-2X, MPWBIK, O3-LYP, PBE, TPSS, etc.) have been examined in conjunction with basis sets such as 6-31G(d), 6-31+G(d,p), 6-31G(2df,p), 6-311 +G(d,p), and 6-311 +G(2df,p). The vibrational frequency scale factors were determined by a comparison of theoretical harmonic frequencies with the corresponding experimental fundamentals utilizing a standard set of 1066 individual vibrations. ZPVE scale factors were generally obtained from a comparison of the computed ZPVEs with experimental ZPVEs for a smaller standard set of 39 molecules, though the effect of expansion to a 48 molecule data set was also examined. In addition to evaluating the scale factors for a wide range of levels of theory, we have also probed the effect on scale factors of varying the percentage of incorporated exact exchange in hybrid DFT calculations using a modified B3-LYP functional. This has revealed a near-linear relationship between the magnitude of the scale factor and the proportion of exact exchange. Finally, we have investigated the effect of basis set size on HF, MP2, B3-LYP, and BMK scale factors by deriving values with basis sets ranging from 6-31G(d) up to 6-311++G(3df,3pd) as well as with basis sets in the cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pVnZ series and with the TZV2P basis.",no,happy,happy,no,no,happy,happy,happy,yes,happy,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,happy,happy,no,no,yes,yes,yes
1,"Efficient evolution of hydrogen through electrocatalysis at low overpotentials holds tremendous promise for clean energy. Hydrogen evolution can be easily achieved by electrolysis at large potentials that can be lowered with expensive platinum-based catalysts. Replacement of Pt with inexpensive, earth-abundant electrocatalysts would be significantly beneficial for clean and efficient hydrogen evolution. To this end, promising results have been reported using 2H (trigonal prismatic) XS2 (where X = Mo or W) nanoparticles with a high concentration of metallic edges. The key challenges for XS2 are increasing the number and catalytic activity of active sites. Here we report monolayered nanosheets of chemically exfoliated WS2 as efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution with very low overpotentials. Analyses indicate that the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of WS2 is associated with the high concentration of the strained metallic 1T (octahedral) phase in the as-exfoliated nanosheets.

2,"Graphene plasmons provide a suitable alternative to noble-metal plasmons because they exhibit much tighter confinement and relatively long propagation distances, with the advantage of being highly tunable via electrostatic gating. Here, we propose to use graphene plasmons as a platform for strongly enhanced light-matter interactions. Specifically, we predict unprecedented high decay rates of quantum emitters in the proximity of a carbon sheet, observable vacuum Rabi splittings, and extinction cross sections exceeding the geometrical area in graphene nanoribbons and nanodisks.

5,"In recent years, photoredox catalysis has come to the forefront in organic chemistry as a powerful strategy for the activation of small molecules. In a general sense, these approaches rely on the ability of metal complexes and organic dyes to convert visible light into chemical energy by engaging in single-electron transfer with organic substrates, thereby generating reactive intermediates. In this Perspective, we highlight the unique ability of photoredox catalysis to expedite the development of completely new reaction mechanisms, with particular emphasis placed on multicatalytic strategies that enable the construction of challenging carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7,"This paper presents an in-depth study of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) enhancement factors (EFs) and cross-sections, including several issues often overlooked. In particular, various possible rigorous definitions of the SERS EFs are introduced and discussed in the context of SERS applications, such as analytical chemistry and single molecule SERS. These definitions highlight the importance of a careful characterization of the non-SERS cross-sections of the probes under consideration. This aspect is illustrated by experimental results for the non-SERS cross-sections of representative SERS probes along with average SERS EFs for the same probes. In addition, the accurate experimental determination of single molecule enhancement factors is tackled with two recently developed techniques, namely: bi-analyte SERS (BiASERS) and temperature-dependent SERS vibrational pumping. We demonstrate that SERS EFs as low as 10(7), as opposed to the figure of 10(14) often claimed in the literature, are sufficient for the observation of single molecule SERS signals, with maximum single molecule EFs typically on the order of similar to 10(14).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"An improved method of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay has been developed and validated using fluorescein (3',6'-dihydroxyspiro[isobenzofuran-1[3H],9'[9H]-xanthen]-3-one) as the fluorescent probe. Our results demonstrate that fluorescein (FL) is superior to B-phycoerythrin. The oxidized FL products induced by peroxyl radical were identified by LC/MS, and the reaction mechanism was determined to follow a classic hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. In addition, methodological and mechanistic comparison of ORAC(FL) with other widely used methods was discussed. It is concluded that, unlike other popular methods, the improved ORAC(FL) assay provides a direct measure of hydrophilic chain-breaking antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"The parametrization and validation of the OPLS3 force field for small molecules and proteins are reported. Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,"The production of clean and renewable hydrogen through water splitting using photocatalysts has received much attention due to the increasing global energy crises. In this study, a high efficiency of the photocatalytic H(2) production was achieved using graphene nanosheets decorated with CdS clusters as visible-light-driven photocatalysts. The materials were prepared by a solvothermal method in which graphene oxide (GO) served as the support and cadmium acetate (Cd(Ac)(2)) as the CdS precursor. These nanosized composites reach a high H(2)-production rate of 1.12 mmol h(-1) (about 4.87 times higher than that of pure CdS nanoparticles) at graphene content of 1.0 wt % and Pt 0.5 wt % under visible-light irradiation and an apparent quantum efficiency (QE) of 22.5% at wavelength of 420 nm. This high photocatalytic H(2)-production activity is attributed predominantly to the presence of graphene, which serves as an electron collector and transporter to efficiently lengthen the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers from CdS nanoparticles. This work highlights the potential application of graphene-based materials in the field of energy conversion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"Metallic zinc (Zn) has been regarded as an ideal anode material for aqueous batteries because of its high theoretical capacity (820 mA h g(-1)), low potential (-0.762 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode), high abundance, low toxicity and intrinsic safety. However, aqueous Zn chemistry persistently suffers from irreversibility issues, as exemplified by its low coulombic efficiency (CE) and dendrite growth during plating/stripping, and sustained water consumption. In this work, we demonstrate that an aqueous electrolyte based on Zn and lithium salts at high concentrations is a very effective way to address these issues. This unique electrolyte not only enables dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping at nearly 100% CE, but also retains water in the open atmosphere, which makes hermetic cell configurations optional. These merits bring unprecedented flexibility and reversibility to Zn batteries using either LiMn2O4 or O-2 cathodes-the former deliver 180 W h kg(-1) while retaining 80% capacity for > 4,000 cycles, and the latter deliver 300 W h kg(-1) (1,000 W h kg(-1) based on the cathode) for > 200 cycles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Water splitting to form hydrogen and oxygen using solar energy in the presence of semiconductor photocatalysts has long been studied as a potential means of clean, large-scale fuel production. In general, overall water splitting can be achieved when a photocatalyst is modified with a suitable cocatalyst. It is therefore important to develop both photocatalysts and cocatalysts. In the past five, years, there has been significant progress in water splitting photocatalysis, especially in the development of cocatalysts and related physical and materials chemistry. This work describes the state of the art and future challenges in photocatalytic water splitting, with a focus on the recent progress of our own research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Electrical energy storage (EES) is one of the most critical areas of technological research around the world. Storing and efficiently using electricity generated by intermittent sources and the transition of our transportation fleet to electric drive depend fundamentally on the development of EES systems with high energy and power densities. Supercapacitors are promising devices for highly efficient energy storage and power management, yet they still suffer from moderate energy densities compared to batteries. To establish a detailed understanding of the science and technology of carbon/carbon supercapacitors, this review discusses the basic principles of the electrical double-layer (EDL), especially regarding the correlation between ion size/ion solvation and the pore size of porous carbon electrodes. We summarize the key aspects of various carbon materials synthesized for use in supercapacitors. With the objective of improving the energy density, the last two sections are dedicated to strategies to increase the capacitance by either introducing pseudocapacitive materials or by using novel electrolytes that allow to increasing the cell voltage. In particular, advances in ionic liquids, but also in the field of organic electrolytes, are discussed and electrode mass balancing is expanded because of its importance to create higher performance asymmetric electrochemical capacitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Light can be considered an ideal reagent for environmentally friendly, 'green' chemical synthesis; unlike many conventional reagents, light is non-toxic, generates no waste, and can be obtained from renewable sources. Nevertheless, the need for high-energy ultraviolet radiation in most organic photochemical processes has limited both the practicality and environmental benefits of photochemical synthesis on industrially relevant scales. This Perspective describes recent approaches to the use of metal polypyridyl photocatalysts in synthetic organic transformations. Given the remarkable photophysical properties of these complexes, these new transformations, which use Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and related photocatalysts, can be conducted using almost any source of visible light, including both store-bought fluorescent light bulbs and ambient sunlight. Transition metal photocatalysis thus represents a promising strategy towards the development of practical, scalable industrial processes with great environmental benefits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"The principal structure possibilities for packing infinite rod-shaped building blocks are described. Some basic nets derived from linking simple rods (helices and ladders) are then enumerated. We demonstrate the usefulness of the concept of rod secondary building units in the design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Accordingly, we present the preparation, characterization, and crystal structures of 14 new MOFs (named MOF-69A-C and MOF-70-80) of 12 different structure types, belonging to rod packing motifs, and show how their structures are related to basic nets. The MOFs reported herein are of polytopic carboxylates and contain one of Zn, Pb, Co, Cd, Mn, or Tb. The inclusion properties of the most open members are presented as evidence that MOF structures with rod building blocks can indeed be designed to have permanent porosity and rigid architectures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) made from oriented, one-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes are receiving attention because direct connection of the point of photogeneration with the collection electrode using such structures may improve the cell performance. Specifically, oriented single-Mstalline TiO2 nanorods or nanowires on a transparent conductive substrate would be most desirable, but achieving these structures has been limited by the availability of synthetic techniques. In this study, a facile, hydrothermal method was developed for the first time to grow oriented, single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorod films on transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. The diameter, length, and density of the nanorods could be varied by changing the growth parameters, such as growth time, growth temperature, initial reactant concentration, acidity, and additives. The epitaxial relation between the FTO substrate and rutile TiO2 with a small lattice mismatch plays a key role in driving the nucleation and growth of the rutile TiO2 nanorods on FTO. With TiCl4-treatment, a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 3% could be achieved by using 4 mu m-long TiO2 nanorod films as the photoanode in a DSSC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"The hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3) PbI3 may find application in next generation solid-state sensitised solar cells. Although this material and related perovskites were discovered many decades ago, questions remain concerning their diverse structural chemistry and unusual properties. The article presents a review of previous work and provides a detailed description of the preparation, structural characterisation and physical characteristics of (CH3NH3) PbI3. The phase changes exhibited by (CH3NH3) PbI3 have been probed using variable temperature powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction, combined with differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and phase contrast transmission electron microscopy. The optical band gap for (CH3NH3) PbI3 determined by UV-Visible spectroscopy was compared to values obtained from density-of-state simulation of the electronic band structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"Low-cost photovoltaic energy conversion using conjugated molecular materials has become increasingly feasible through the development of organic 'bulk heterojunction (BHJ)' structures(1-7), where efficient light-induced charge separation is enabled by a large-area donor - acceptor interface(2,3). The highest efficiencies have been achieved using blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a fullerene derivative(8-12), but performance depends critically on the material properties and processing conditions. This variability is believed to be influenced by the self-organizing properties of P3HT, which means that both optical(13,14) and electronic(15,16) properties are sensitive to the molecular packing. However, the relationship between molecular nanostructure, optoelectronic properties of the blend material and device performance has not yet been demonstrated. Here we focus on the influence of polymer regioregularity (RR) on the molecular nanostructure, and hence on the resulting material properties and device performance. We find a strong influence of RR on solar-cell performance, which can be attributed to enhanced optical absorption and transport resulting from the organization of P3HT chains and domains. Further optimization of devices using the highest RR material resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 4.4%, even without optimization of electrodes(7).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Shape-morphing systems can be found in many areas, including smart textiles(1), autonomous robotics(2), biomedical devices(3), drug delivery(4) and tissue engineering(5). The natural analogues of such systems are exemplified by nastic plant motions, where a variety of organs such as tendrils, bracts, leaves and flowers respond to environmental stimuli (such as humidity, light or touch) by varying internal turgor, which leads to dynamic conformations governed by the tissue composition and microstructural anisotropy of cell walls(6-10). Inspired by these botanical systems, we printed composite hydrogel architectures that are encoded with localized, anisotropic swelling behaviour controlled by the alignment of cellulose fibrils along prescribed four-dimensional printing pathways. When combined with a minimal theoretical framework that allows us to solve the inverse problem of designing the alignment patterns for prescribed target shapes, we can programmably fabricate plant-inspired architectures that change shape on immersion in water, yielding complex three-dimensional morphologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

22,"Graphite oxide is one of the main precursors of graphene-based materials, which are highly promising for various technological applications because of their unusual electronic properties. Although epoxy and hydroxyl groups are widely accepted as its main functionalities, the complete structure of graphite oxide has remained elusive. By interpreting spectroscopic data in the context of the major functional groups believed to be present in graphite oxide, we now show evidence for the presence of five- and six-membered-ring lactols. On the basis of this chemical composition, we devised a complete reduction process through chemical conversion by sodium borohydride and sulfuric acid treatment, followed by thermal annealing. Only small amounts of impurities are present in the final product (less than 0.5 wt% of sulfur and nitrogen, compared with about 3 wt% with other chemical reductions). This method is particularly effective in the restoration of the pi-conjugated structure, and leads to highly soluble and conductive graphene materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"We report a method to convert discrete representations of molecules to and from a multidimensional continuous representation. This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder, and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations of molecules allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of drug-like molecules and also in a set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"A detailed investigation has been carried out of the structure and electrochemical activity of electrodeposited Ni-Fe films for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. Ni-Fe films with a bulk and surface composition of 40% Fe exhibit OER activities that are roughly 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of a freshly deposited Ni film and about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of an Fe film. The freshly deposited Ni film increases in activity by as much as 20-fold during exposure to the electrolyte (KOH); however, all films containing Fe are stable as deposited. The oxidation of Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH in Ni films occurs at potentials below the onset of the OER. Incorporation of Fe into the film increases the potential at which Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox occurs and decreases the average oxidation state of Ni in NiOOH. The Tafel slope (40 mV dec(-1)) and reaction order in OH- (1) for the mixed Ni-Fe films (containing up to 95% Fe) are the same as those for aged Ni films. In situ Raman spectra acquired in 0.1 M KOH at OER potentials show two bands characteristic of NiOOH. The relative intensities of these bands vary with Fe content, indicating a change in the local environment of Ni-O. Similar changes in the relative intensities of the bands and an increase in OER activity are observed when pure Ni films are aged. These observations suggest that the OER is catalyzed by Ni in Ni-Fe films and that the presence of Fe alters the redox properties of Ni, causing a positive shift in the potential at which Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox occurs, a decrease in the average oxidation state of the Ni sites, and a concurrent increase in the activity of Ni cations for the OER.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28,"Two refractory high entropy alloys with compositions near Nb25Mo25Ta25W25 and V20Nb20Mo20Ta20W20, were produced by vacuum arc-melting. Despite containing many constituents, both alloys had a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure that remained not only stable after exposure to 1400 degrees C, but also disordered, as confirmed by the absence of superlattice reflections in neutron diffraction data. Compressive flow properties and microstructure development of these alloys were determined from room temperature up to 1600 degrees C. Limited compressive plasticity and quasi-cleavage fracture at room temperature suggest that the ductile-to-brittle transition for these alloys occurs above room temperature. At 600 degrees C and above, both alloys showed extensive compressive plastic strain. The yield stress of both alloys dropped by 30-40% between room temperature and 600 degrees C, but was relatively insensitive to temperature above 600 degrees C, comparing favorably with conventional superalloys.

29,"Solar cells based on organometallic halide perovskite absorber layers are emerging as a high-performance photovoltaic technology. Using highly sensitive photothermal deflection and photocurrent spectroscopy, we measure the absorption spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films at room temperature. We find a high absorption coefficient with particularly sharp onset. Below the bandgap, the absorption is exponential over more than four decades with an Urbach energy as small as 15 meV, which suggests a well-ordered microstructure. No deep states are found down to the detection limit of similar to 1 cm(-1). These results confirm the excellent electronic properties of perovskite thin films, enabling the very high open-circuit voltages reported for perovskite solar cells. Following intentional moisture ingress, we find that the absorption at photon energies below 2.4 eV is strongly reduced, pointing to a compositional change of the material.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"The production of H-2 by photocatalytic water splitting has attracted a lot attention as a clean and renewable solar H-2 generation system. Despite tremendous efforts, the present great challenge in materials science is to develop highly active photocatalysts for splitting of water at low cost. Here we report a new composite material consisting of TiO2 nanocrystals grown in the presence of a layered MoS2/graphene hybrid as a high-performance photocatalyst for H-2 evolution. This composite material was prepared by a two-step simple hydrothermal process using sodium molybdate, thiourea, and graphene oxide as precursors of the MoS2/graphene hybrid and tetrabutylorthotitanate as the titanium precursor. Even without a noble-metal cocatalyst, the TiO2/MoS2/graphene composite reaches a high H-2 production rate of 165.3 mu mol h(-1) when the content of the MoS2/graphene cocatalyst is 0.5 wt 96 and the content of graphene in this cocatalyst is 5.0 wt 96, and the apparent quantum efficiency reaches 9.796 at 365 nm. This unusual photocatalytic activity arises from the positive synergetic effect between the MoS2 and graphene components in this hybrid cocatalyst, which serve as an electron collector and a source of active adsorption sites, respectively. This study presents an inexpensive photocatalyst for energy conversion to achieve highly efficient H-2 evolution without noble metals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"A novel and simple method for preparing highly photoactive nanocrystalline F--doped TiO2 photocatalyst with anatase and brookite phase was developed by hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide in a mixed NH4F-H2O solution. The prepared F-doped TiO2 powders were characterized by differential thermal analysis-thermogravimetry (DTA-TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra (PL), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and BET surface areas. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the photocatalytic oxidation of acetone in air. The results showed that the crystallinity of anatase was improved upon F- doping. Moreover, fluoride ions not only suppressed the formation of brookite phase but also prevented phase transition of anatase to rutile. The F-doped TiO2 samples exhibited stronger absorption in the UV-visible range with a red shift in the band gap transition. The photocatalytic activity of F-doped TiO2 powders prepared by this method exceeded that of Degussa P25 when the molar ratio of NH4F to H2O was kept in the range of 0.5-3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"Graphene, a single monolayer of graphite, has recentlyattracted considerable interest owing to its novel magneto-transport properties(1-3), high carrier mobility and ballistic transport up to room temperature(4). It has the potential for technological applications as a successor of silicon in the post Moore's law era(5-7), as a single-molecule gas sensor(8), in spintronics(9-11), in quantum computing(12) or as a terahertz oscillator(13). For such applications, uniform ordered growth of graphene on an insulating substrate is necessary. The growth of graphene on insulating silicon carbide (SiC) surfaces by high-temperature annealing in vacuum was previously proposed to open a route for large-scale production of graphene-based devices(5,6). However, vacuum decomposition of SiC yields graphene layers with small grains (30-200 nm; refs 14-16). Here, we show that the ex situ graphitization of Si-terminated SiC(0001) in an argon atmosphere of about 1 bar produces monolayer graphene films with much larger domain sizes than previously attainable. Raman spectroscopy and Hall measurements confirm the improved quality of the films thus obtained. High electronic mobilities were found, which reach mu = 2,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at T = 27 K. The new growth process introduced here establishes a method for the synthesis of graphene films on a technologically viable basis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"Because of their availability, adjustable microstructure, varieties of forms, and large specific surface area, porous carbon materials are of increasing interest for use in hydrogen storage adsorbents and electrode materials in supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur cells from the viewpoint of social sustainability and environmental friendliness. Therefore, much effort has been made to synthesize and tailor the microstructures of porous carbon materials via various activation procedures (physical and chemical activation). In particular, the chemical activation of various carbon sources using KOH as the activating reagent is very promising because of its lower activation temperature and higher yields, and well-defined micropore size distribution and ultrahigh specific surface area up to 3000 m(2) g(-1) of the resulting porous carbons. In this feature article, we will cover recent research progress since 2007 on the synthesis of KOH-activated carbons for hydrogen and electrical energy storage (supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur batteries). The textural properties and surface chemistry of KOH-activated carbons depend on not only the synthesis parameters, but also different carbon sources employed including fossil/biomass-derived materials, synthetic organic polymers, and various nanostructured carbons (e.g. carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon aerogels, carbide-derived carbons, graphene, etc.).

35,"As an important constituent of animal feeds, fiber represents the portion of feeds that is bulky and difficult to digest. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) method, developed over 30 years ago, is the method of choice for measuring total fiber in for- ages and other feeds. Several modifications that were made to improve its general applicability to all feeds and others developed in individual laboratories often resulted in variability among laboratories in measuring NDF. The amylase-treated NDF (aNDF) method, therefore, was developed as an accurate and precise method of measuring total insoluble fiber in feeds. A collaborative study was conducted to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of the aNDF method over the full range of animal feed materials. Twelve laboratories representing research, feed company, regulatory, and commercial feed testing laboratories analyzed 11 materials as blind duplicates. The materials represented feed matrixes, including animal products; high-protein, high-fat, and high-pectin feeds; oil seeds; grains; heated by-product feeds; and legume and grass hays and silages. Materials selected varied in chemical composition and contained 0-90% aNDF, 1-16% ash, 1-20% crude fat, 1-40% crude protein, and 0-50% starch. Correcting results for changes in blanks and reporting results as ash-free aNDF organic matter (aNDFom) improved the repeatability and reproducibility of results when aNDF was <25%. The within-laboratory repeatability standard deviation (Sr) for percentage aNDFom in feeds varied from 0.21 to 1.82 and among-laboratory reproducibility standard deviation (s(R)) varied from 0.37 to 2.24. The HORRAT Was <2 for all materials except feed materials containing >10% fat. However, standard deviations of repeatability and reproducibility for feeds with >10% fat were similar to those of other materials. It is recommended that the aNDF method be accepted for Official First Action status.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"Perovskite solar cells have rapidly risen to the forefront of emerging photovoltaic technologies, exhibiting rapidly rising efficiencies. This is likely to continue to rise, but in the development of these solar cells there are unusual characteristics that have arisen, specifically an anomalous hysteresis in the current voltage curves. We identify this phenomenon and show some examples of factors that make the hysteresis more or less extreme. We also demonstrate stabilized power output under working conditions and suggest that this is a useful parameter to present, alongside the current-voltage scan derived power conversion efficiency. We hypothesize three possible origins of the effect and discuss its implications on device efficiency and future research directions. Understanding and resolving the hysteresis is essential for further progress and is likely to lead to a further step improvement in performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"We describe the use of highly ordered transparent TiO2 nanotube arrays in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Highly ordered nanotube arrays of 46-nm pore diameter, 17-nm wall thickness, and 360-nm length were grown perpendicular to a fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass substrate by anodic oxidation of a titanium thin film. After crystallization by an oxygen anneal, the nanotube arrays are treated with TiCl4 to enhance the photogenerated current and then integrated into the DSC structure using a commercially available ruthenium-based dye. Although the negative electrode is only 360-nm-thick, under AM 1.5 illumination the generated photocurrent is 7.87 mA/cm(2), with a photocurrent efficiency of 2.9%. Voltage-decay measurements indicate that the highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays, in comparison to nanoparticulate systems, have superior electron lifetimes and provide excellent pathways for electron percolation. Our results indicate that remarkable photoconversion efficiencies may be obtained, possibly to the ideal limit of similar to 31% for a single photosystem scheme, with an increase of the nanotube-array length to several micrometers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"Ibis paper describes the compatibility of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) with organic solvents; this compatibility is important in considering the potential of PDMS-based microfluidic devices in a number of applications, including that of microreactors for organic reactions. We considered three aspects of compatibility: the swelling of PDMS in a solvent, the partitioning of solutes between a solvent and PDMS, and the dissolution of PDMS oligomers in a solvent. Of these three parameters that determine the compatibility of PDMS with a solvent, the swelling of PDMS had the greatest influence. Experimental measurements of swelling were correlated with the solubility parameter, 6 (cal(1/2) cm(-3/2)), which is based on the cohesive energy densities, c (cal/cm(3)), of the materials. Solvents that swelled PDMS the least included water, nitromethane, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol, perfluorotributylamine, perfluorodecalin, acetonitrile, and propylene carbonate; solvents that swelled PDMS the most were diisopropylamine, triethylamine, pentane, and xylenes. Highly swelling solvents were useful for extracting contaminants from bulk PDMS and for changing the surface properties of PDMS. The feasibility of performing organic reactions in PDMS was demonstrated by performing a Diels-Alder reaction in a microchannel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"We report on measurements of the stiffness and breaking strength of monolayer MoS2, a new semiconducting analogue of graphene. Single and bilayer MoS2 is exfoliated from bulk and transferred to a substrate containing an array of microfabricated circular holes. The resulting suspended, free-standing membranes are deformed and eventually broken using an atomic force microscope. We find that the In-plane stiffness of monolayer MoS2 is 180 +/- 60 Nm(-1), corresponding to an effective Young's modulus of 270 +/- 100 GPa, which Is comparable to that of steel. Breaking occurs at an effective strain between 6 and 11% with the average breaking strength of 15 +/- 3 Nm(-1) (23 GPa). The strength of strongest monolayer membranes Is 11% of its Young's modulus, corresponding to the upper theoretical limit which indicates that the material can be highly crystalline and almost defect-free. Our results show that monolayer MoS2 could be suitable for a variety of applications such as reinforcing elements in composites and for fabrication of flexible electronic devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"Partial least squares (PLS) was not originally designed as a tool for statistical discrimination. In spite of this, applied scientists routinely use PLS for classification and there is substantial empirical evidence to suggest that it performs well in that role. The interesting question is: why can a procedure that is principally designed for overdetermined regression problems locate and emphasize group structure? Using PLS in this manner has heurestic support owing to the relationship between PLS and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the relationship, in turn, between CCA and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This paper replaces the heuristics with a formal statistical explanation. As a consequence, it will become clear that PLS is to be preferred over PCA when discrimination is the goal and dimension reduction is needed.

41,"Recently, Kovalenko and co-workers and Li and co-workers developed CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) inorganic perovskite quantum dots (IPQDs), which exhibited ultrahigh photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QYs), low-threshold lasing, and multicolor electroluminescence. However, the usual synthesis needs high temperature, inert gas protection, and localized injection operation, which are severely against applications. Moreover, the so unexpectedly high QYs are very confusing. Here, for the first time, the IPQDs' room-temperature (RT) synthesis, superior PL, underlying origins and potentials in lighting and displays are reported. The synthesis is designed according to supersaturated recrystallization (SR), which is operated at RT, within few seconds, free from inert gas and injection operation. Although formed at RT, IPQDs' PLs have QYs of 80%, 95%, 70%, and FWHMs of 35, 20, and 18 nm for red, green, and blue emissions. As to the origins, the observed 40 meV exciton binding energy, halogen self-passivation effect, and CsPbX3@X quantum-well band alignment are proposed to guarantee the excitons generation and high-rate radiative recombination at RT. Moreover, such superior optical merits endow them with promising potentials in lighting and displays, which are primarily demonstrated by the white light-emitting diodes with tunable color temperature and wide color gamut.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

44,"The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) provides a technically and economically credible alternative concept to present day p-n junction photovoltaic devices. In contrast to the conventional silicon systems, where the semiconductor assumes both the task of light absorption and charge carrier transport the two functions are separated here. Light is absorbed by a sensitizer, which is anchored to the surface of a wide band gap oxide semiconductor. Charge separation takes place at the interface via photo-induced electron injection from the dye into the conduction band of the solid. Carriers are transported in the conduction band of the semiconductor to the charge collector. The use of sensitizers having a broad absorption band in conjunction with oxide films of nanocrystalline morphology permits to harvest a large fraction of sunlight. Nearly quantitative conversion of incident photon into electric cur-rent is achieved over a large spectral range extending from the UV to the near IR region. Overall solar (standard AM 1.5) to current conversion efficiencies of 10.6% have been reached. New electrolytes based on ionic liquids have been developed that show excellent stability both under prolonged light soaking and high temperature stress. There are good prospects to produce these cells at lower cost than conventional devices. Here we present the current state of the field, and discuss the importance of mastering the interface of the mesoporous films by assisting the self-assembly of the sensitizer at the surface of the oxide nanocrystals.

45,"In this paper, the possibility is explored to speed up Hartree-Fock and hybrid density functional calculations by forming the Coulomb and exchange parts of the Fock matrix by different approximations. For the Coulomb part the previously introduced Split-RI-J variant (F. Neese, J. Comput. Chem. 24 (2003) 1740) of the well-known 'density fitting' approximation is used. The exchange part is formed by semi-numerical integration techniques that are closely related to Friesner's pioneering pseudo-spectral approach. Our potentially linear scaling realization of this algorithm is called the 'chain-of-spheres exchange' (COSX). A combination of semi-numerical integration and density fitting is also proposed. Both Split-RI-J and COSX scale very well with the highest angular momentum in the basis sets. It is shown that for extended basis sets speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional implementations can be obtained in this way. Total energies are reproduced with an average error of <0.3 kcal/mol as determined from extended test calculations with various basis sets on a set of 26 molecules with 20-200 atoms and up to 2000 basis functions. Reaction energies agree to within 0.2 kcal/mol (Hartree-Fock) or 0.05 kcal/mol (hybrid DFT) with the canonical values. The COSX algorithm parallelizes with a speedup of 8.6 observed for 10 processes. Minimum energy geometries differ by less than 0.3 pm in the bond distances and 0.5 degrees in the bond angels from their canonical values. These developments enable highly efficient and accurate self-consistent field calculations including nonlocal Hartree-Fock exchange for large molecules. In combination with the RI-MP2 method and large basis sets, second-order many body perturbation energies can be obtained for medium sized molecules with unprecedented efficiency. The algorithms are implemented into the ORCA electronic structure system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

48,"Graphene can be viewed as an individual atomic plane extracted from graphite, as unrolled single-walled carbon nanotube or as an extended flat fullerene molecule. In this paper, a facile approach to the synthesis of high quality graphene nanosheets in large scale through electrochemical reduction of exfoliated graphite oxide precursor at cathodic potentials (completely reduced potential: -1.5 V) is reported. This method is green and fast, and will not result in contamination of the reduced material. The electrochemically reduced graphene nanosheets have been carefully characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques in comparison to the chemically reduced graphene-based product. Particularly, FTIR spectra indicate that a variety of the oxygen-containing functional groups have been thoroughly removed from the graphite oxide plane via electrochemical reduction. The chemically converted materials are not expected to exhibit graphene's electronic properties because of residual defects. Indeed, the high quality grapheme accelerates the electron transfer rate in dopamine electrochemistry (Delta E-p is as small as 44 mV which is much smaller than that on a glassy carbon electrode). This approach opens up the possibility for assembling graphene biocomposites for electrocatalysis and the construction of blosensors..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

50,"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has emerged as a promising electrocatalyst for catalyzing protons to hydrogen via the so-called hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In order to enhance the HER activity, tremendous effort has been made to engineer MoS2 catalysts with either more active sites or higher conductivity. However, at present, synergistically structural and electronic modulations for HER still remain challenging. In this work, we demonstrate the successfully synergistic regulations of both structural and electronic benefits by controllable disorder engineering and simultaneous oxygen incorporation in MoS2 catalysts, leading to the dramatically enhanced HER activity. The disordered structure can offer abundant unsaturated sulfur atoms as active sites for HER, while the oxygen incorporation can effectively regulate the electronic structure and further improve the intrinsic conductivity. By means of controllable disorder engineering and oxygen incorporation, an optimized catalyst with a moderate degree of disorder was developed, exhibiting superior activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In general, the optimized catalyst exhibits onset overpotential as low as 120 mV, accompanied by extremely large cathodic current density and excellent stability.

In this work, for the first time we study the in vivo behaviors of nanographene sheets (NGS) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating by a fluorescent labeling method. In vivo fluorescence imaging reveals surprisingly high tumor uptake of NGS in several xenograft tumor mouse models. Distinctive from PEGylated carbon nanotubes, PEGylated NGS shows several interesting in vivo behaviors including highly efficient tumor passive targeting and relatively low retention in reticuloendothelial systems. We then utilize the strong optical absorbance of NGS in the near-infrared (NIR) region for in vivo photothermal therapy, achieving ultraefficient tumor ablation after intravenous administration of NGS and low-power NIR laser irradiation on the tumor. Furthermore, no obvious side effect of PEGylated NGS is noted for the injected mice by histology, blood chemistry, and complete blood panel analysis in our pilot toxicity study. Although a lot more efforts are required to further understand the in vivo behaviors and the long-term toxicology of this new type of nanomaterials, our work is the first success of using carbon nanomaterials for efficient in vivo photothermal therapy by intravenous administration and suggests the great promise of graphene in biomedical applications, such as cancer treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

53,"A comparative investigation was performed to examine the intrinsic catalytic activity and durability of carbon supported Ru, Ir, and Pt nanoparticles and corresponding bulk materials for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrochemical surface characteristics of nanoparticles and bulk materials were studied by surface-sensitive cyclic voltammetry. Although basically similar voltammetric features were observed for nanoparticles and bulk materials of each metal, some differences were uncovered highlighting the changes in oxidation chemistry. On the basis of the electrochemical results, we demonstrated that Ru nanoparticles show lower passivation potentials compared to bulk Ru material. Ir nanoparticles completely lost their voltammetric metallic features during the voltage cycling, in contrast to the corresponding bulk material. Finally, Pt nanoparticles show an increased oxophilic nature compared to bulk Pt. With regard to the OER performance, the most pronounced effects of nanoscaling were identified for Ru and Pt catalysts. In particular, the Ru nanoparticles suffered from strong corrosion at applied OER potentials and were therefore unable to sustain the OER. The Pt nanoparticles exhibited a lower OER activity from the beginning on and were completely deactivated during the applied OER stability protocol, in contrast to the corresponding bulk Pt catalyst. We highlight that the OER activity and durability were comparable for Ir nanoparticles and bulk materials. Thus, Ir nanoparticles provide a high potential as nanoscaled OER catalyst.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

55,"The escalating and unpredictable cost of oil, the concentration of major oil resources in the hands of a few politically sensitive nations, and the long-term impact of CO2 emissions on global climate constitute a major challenge for the 21st century. They also constitute a major incentive to harness alternative sources of energy and means of vehicle propulsion. Today's lithium-ion batteries, although suitable for small-scale devices, do not yet have sufficient energy or life for use in vehicles that would match the performance of internal combustion vehicles. Energy densities 2 and 5 times greater are required to meet the performance goals of a future generation of plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs) with a 40-80 mile all-electric range, and all-electric vehicles (EVs) with a 300-400 mile range, respectively. Major advances have been made in lithium-battery technology over the past two decades by the discovery of new materials and designs through intuitive approaches, experimental and predictive reasoning, and meticulous control of surface structures and chemical reactions. Further improvements in energy density of factors of two to three may yet be achievable for current day lithium-ion systems; factors of five or more may be possible for lithium-oxygen systems, ultimately leading to our ability to confine extremely high potential energy in a small volume without compromising safety, but only if daunting technological barriers can be overcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The calculated results of the long-range correction scheme are found to support a previous argument that the lack of the long-range interactions in conventional exchange functionals may be responsible for the underestimation of 4s-3d interconfigurational energies of the first-row transition metals and for the overestimation of the longitudinal polarizabilities of pi -conjugated polyenes in DFT calculations.

These samples diffracted both synchrotron X-rays and neutrons to better than 1 Angstrom resolution (>300 unique reflections; P2(1)). The X-ray data were used to determine the C and 0 atom positions, The resulting structure consisted of two parallel chains having slightly different conformations and organized in sheets packed in a ""parallel-up"" fashion, with all hydroxymethyl groups adopting the tg conformation. The positions of hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen-bonding were determined from a Fourier-difference analysis using neutron diffraction data collected from hydrogenated and deuterated samples. The hydrogen atoms involved in the intramolecular O3...O5 hydrogen bonds have well-defined positions, whereas those corresponding to 02 and 06 covered a wider volume, indicative of multiple geometry with partial occupation.

61,"Bacterial toxicity of graphene nanosheets in the form of graphene nanowalls deposited on stainless steel substrates was investigated for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative models of bacteria. The graphene oxide nanowalls were obtained by electrophoretic deposition of Mg2+-graphene oxide nanosheets synthesized by a chemical exfoliation method. On the basis of measuring the efflux of cytoplasmic materials of the bacteria, it was found that the cell membrane damage of the bacteria caused by direct contact of the bacteria with the extremely sharp edges of the nanowalls was the effective mechanism in the bacterial inactivation. In this regard, the Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria with an outer membrane were more resistant to the cell membrane damage caused by the nanowalls than the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus lacking the outer membrane. Moreover, the graphene oxide nanowalls reduced by hydrazine were more toxic to the bacteria than the unreduced graphene oxide nanowalls. The better antibacterial activity of the reduced nanowalls was assigned to the better charge transfer between the bacteria and the more sharpened edges of the reduced nanowalls, during the contact interaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) using high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) reveals that Fe3+ in Ni1-xFexOOH occupies octahedral sites with unusually short Fe-O bond distances, induced by edge-sharing with surrounding [NiO6] octahedra. Using computational methods, we establish that this structural motif results in near optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates and low overpotentials at Fe sites.

64,"We present two different ways to fabricate nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) and demonstrate its use as a metal-free catalyst to study the catalytic active center for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). N-graphene was produced by annealing of graphene oxide (G-O) under ammonia or by annealing of a N-containing polymer/reduced graphene oxide (RG-O) composite (polyaniline/RG-O or polypyrrole/RG-O). The effects of the N precursors and annealing temperature on the performance of the catalyst were investigated. The bonding state of the N atom was found to have a significant effect on the selectivity and catalytic activity for ORR. Annealing of G-O with ammonia preferentially formed graphitic N and pyridinic N centers, while annealing of polyaniline/RG-O and polypyrrole/RG-O tended to generate pyridinic and pyrrolic N moieties, respectively. Most importantly, the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst was found to be dependent on the graphitic N content which determined the limiting current density, while the pyridinic N content improved the onset potential for ORR. However, the total N content in the graphene-based non-precious metal catalyst does not play an important role in the ORR process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

68,"The preparation and properties of emulsions, stabilised solely by the adsorption of solid particles at the oil-water interface, are reviewed especially in the light of our own work with particles of well-controlled surface properties. Where appropriate, comparison is made with the behaviour of surfactant-stabilised emulsions. Hydrophilic particles tend to form oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions whereas hydrophobic particles form water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions. Many of the properties can be attributed to the very large free energy of adsorption for particles of intermediate wettability (contact angle at the oil-water interface, say, between 50 and 130degrees). This effectively irreversible adsorption leads to extreme stability for certain emulsions and is in contrast to the behaviour of surfactant molecules which are usually in rapid dynamic equilibrium between the oil-water interface and the bulk phases. There is. evidence that, in some systems, weak flocculation of the particles improves the emulsion stability. Phase inversion from w/o to o/w can be brought about by increasing the volume fraction of water. Emulsions close to this inversion point tend to be the most stable, again in contrast to surfactant systems. The volume fraction needed for inversion depends on the particle wettability and the nature of the oil and these effects have been rationalised in terms of surface energy components. Stable multiple emulsions (w/o/w and o/w/o) can be made using two types of particles with slightly different wettability. Similar multiple emulsions prepared with two types of surfactant tend to be much less stable. The possibility of preparing novel solid materials by evaporating solid-stabilised emulsions is also proposed. Finally we report on some extensions to the work of Levine et al. who obtained expressions for the free energy of formation of emulsion drops covered with close-packed monolayers of monodisperse spherical particles. In particular in the light of the observations that nanoparticles can act as excellent emulsion stabilisers, we have considered potential effects on the free energy of emulsion formation of the action of small (physically realistic) positive and negative line tensions in the 3-phase contact lines skirting particles adsorbed at the droplet interfaces. We also explore the possibility that curvature properties of close-packed particle monolayers can affect emulsion properties in much the same way that surfactant monolayer properties influence emulsion type and stability.

MOF-812 was only made and structurally characterized but not examined for water adsorption because it is a byproduct of MOF-841 synthesis. All the new zirconium MOFs are made from the Zr6O4(OH)(4)(-CO2)(n) secondary building units (n = 6, 8, 10, or 12) and variously shaped carboxyl organic linkers to make extended porous frameworks. The permanent porosity of all 23 materials was confirmed and their water adsorption measured to reveal that MOF-801-P and MOF-841 are the highest performers based on the three criteria stated above; they are water stable, do not lose capacity after five adsorption/desorption cycles, and are easily regenerated at room temperature. An X-ray single-crystal study and a powder neutron diffraction study reveal the position of the water adsorption sites in MOF-801 and highlight the importance of the intermolecular interaction between adsorbed water molecules within the pores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"Hybrid organic/inorganic perovskites (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3) as light absorbers are promising players in the field of third-generation photovoltaics. Here we demonstrate a low-temperature vapor-assisted solution process to construct polycrystalline perovskite thin films with full surface coverage, small surface roughness, and grain size up to microscale. Solar cells based on the as-prepared films achieve high power conversion efficiency of 12.1%, so far the highest efficiency based on CH3NH3PbI3 with the planar heterojunction configuration. This method provides a simple approach to perovskite film preparation and paves the way for high reproducibility of films and devices. The underlying kinetic and thermodynamic parameters regarding the perovskite film growth are discussed as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"The appropriate interfacial contact of heterojunction photocatalysts plays a critical role in transfer/separation of interfacial charge carriers. Design of two-dimensional (2D)/2D surface-to-surface heterojunction is an effective method for improving photocatalytic activity since greater contact area can enhance interfacial charge transfer rate. Herein, ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-like composite heterojunction photocatalysts were fabricated by electrostatic self-assembly of ultrathin tungsten trioxide (WO3) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets. The ultrathin WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets were obtained by electrostatic-assisted ultrasonic exfoliation of bulk WO3 and a two-step thermal-etching of bulk g-C3N4, respectively. The thickness of ultrathin WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets are 2.5-3.5 nm, which is equivalent to 5-8 atomic or molecular layer thickness. This ultrathin layered heterojunction structure can enhance surface photocatalytic rate because photogenerated electrons and holes at heterogeneous interface more easily transfer to surface of photocatalysts. Therefore, the obtained ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited better Hz-production activity than pure g-C3N4 and WO3 with the same loading amount of Pt as cocatalyst. The mechanism and driving force of charge transfer and separation in S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are investigated and discussed. This investigation will provide new insight about designing and constructing novel S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"Continuum solvation models are appealing because of the simplified yet accurate description they provide of the solvent effect on a solute, described either by quantum mechanical or classical methods. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) family of solvation models is among the most widely used, although their application has been hampered by discontinuities and singularities arising from the discretization of the integral equations at the solute-solvent interface. In this contribution we introduce a continuous surface charge (CSC) approach that leads to a smooth and robust formalism for the PCM models. We start from the scheme proposed over ten years ago by York and Karplus and we generalize it in various ways, including the extension to analytic second derivatives with respect to atomic positions. We propose an optimal discrete representation of the integral operators required for the determination of the apparent surface charge. We achieve a clear separation between ""model"" and ""cavity"" which, together with simple generalizations of modern integral codes, is all that is required for an extensible and efficient implementation of the PCM models. Following this approach we are now able to introduce solvent effects on energies, structures, and vibrational frequencies (analytical first and second derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates), magnetic properties (derivatives with respect of magnetic field using GIAOs), and in the calculation more complex properties like frequency-dependent Raman activities, vibrational circular dichroism, and Raman optical activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"Many questions about the biological activity and availability of small molecules remain inaccessible to investigators who could most benefit from their answers. To narrow the gap between chemoinformatics and biology, we have developed a suite of ligand annotation, purchasability, target, and biology association tools, incorporated into ZINC and meant for investigators who are not computer specialists. The new version contains over 120 million purchasable ""drug-like"" compounds - effectively all organic molecules that are for sale - a quarter of which are available for immediate delivery. ZINC connects purchasable compounds to high-value ones such as metabolites, drugs, natural products, and annotated compounds from the literature. Compounds may be accessed by the genes for which they are annotated as well as the major and minor target classes to which those genes belong. It offers new analysis tools that are easy for nonspecialists yet with few limitations for experts. ZINC retains its original 3D roots - all molecules are available in biologically relevant, ready-to-dock formats.

74,"Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) represent a new class of quantum dots with unique properties. Doping GQDs with heteroatoms provides an attractive means of effectively tuning their intrinsic properties and exploiting new phenomena for advanced device applications. Herein we report a simple electrochemical approach to luminescent and electrocatalytically active nitrogen-doped GQDs (N-GQDs) with oxygen-rich functional groups. Unlike their N-free counterparts, the newly produced N-GQDs with a N/C atomic ratio of ca. 4.3% emit blue luminescence and possess an electrocatalytic activity comparable to that of a commercially available Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline medium. In addition to their use as metal-free ORR catalysts in fuel cells, the superior luminescence characteristic of N-GQDs allows them to be used for biomedical imaging and other optoelectronic applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"A new ion source has been developed for rapid, noncontact analysis of materials at ambient pressure and at ground potential. The new source, termed DART (for ""Direct Analysis in Real Time""), is based on the reactions of electronic or vibronic excited-state species with reagent molecules and polar or nonpolar analytes. DART has been installed on a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) that provides improved selectivity and accurate elemental composition assignment through exact mass measurements. Although DART has been applied to the analysis of gases, liquids, and solids, a unique application is the direct detection of chemicals on surfaces without requiring sample preparation, such as wiping or solvent extraction. DART has demonstrated success in sampling hundreds of chemicals, including chemical agents and their signatures, pharmaceutics, metabolites, peptides and oligosaccharides, synthetic organics, organometallics, drugs of abuse, explosives, and toxic industrial chemicals. These species were detected on various surfaces, such as concrete, asphalt, human skin, currency, airline boarding passes, business cards, fruits, vegetables, spices, beverages, body fluids, horticultural leaves, cocktail glasses, and clothing. DART employs no radioactive components and is more versatile than devices using radioisotope-based ionization. Because its response is instantaneous, DART provides real-time information, a critical requirement for screening or high throughput.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,"Composite films of chemically converted graphene (CCG) and polyaniline nanofibers (PANI-NFs) were prepared by vacuum filtration the mixed dispersions of both components. The composite film has a layered structure, and PANI-NFs are sandwiched between CCG layers. Furthermore, it is mechanically stable and has a high flexibility; thus, it can be bent into large angles or be shaped into various desired structures. The conductivity of the composite film containing 44% CCG (5.5 x 10(2) S m(-1)) is about 10 times that of a PANI-NF film. Supercapacitor devices based on this conductive flexible composite film showed large electrochemical capacitance (210 F g(-1)) at a discharge rate of 0.3 A g(-1). They also exhibited greatly improved electrochemical stability and rate performances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"Graphene has shown great application potential as the host material for next-generation electronic devices. However, despite its intriguing properties, one of the biggest hurdles for graphene to be useful as an electronic material is the lack of an energy gap in its electronic spectra. This, for example, prevents the use of graphene in making transistors. Although several proposals have been made to open a gap in graphene's electronic spectra, they all require complex engineering of the graphene layer. Here, we show that when graphene is epitaxially grown on SiC substrate, a gap of approximate to 0.26 eV is produced. This gap decreases as the sample thickness increases and eventually approaches zero when the number of layers exceeds four. We propose that the origin of this gap is the breaking of sublattice symmetry owing to the graphene-substrate interaction. We believe that our results highlight a promising direction for bandgap engineering of graphene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"This work presents theory, implementation, and validation of excited state properties obtained from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Based on a fully variational expression for the excited state energy, a compact derivation of first order properties is given. We report an implementation of analytic excited state gradients and charge moments for local, gradient corrected, and hybrid functionals, as well as for the configuration interaction singles (CIS) and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) methods. By exploiting analogies to ground state energy and gradient calculations, efficient techniques can be transferred to excited state methods. Benchmark results demonstrate that, for low-lying excited states, geometry optimizations are not substantially more expensive than for the ground state, independent of the molecular size. We assess the quality of calculated adiabatic excitation energies, structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies by comparison with accurate experimental data for a variety of excited states and molecules. Similar trends are observed for adiabatic excitation energies as for vertical ones. TDDFT is more robust than CIS and TDHF, in particular, for geometries differing significantly from the ground state minimum. The TDDFT excited state structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies are of a remarkably high quality, which is comparable to that obtained in ground state density functional calculations. Thus, yielding considerably more accurate results at similar computational cost, TDDFT rivals CIS as a standard method for calculating excited state properties in larger molecules.

79,"Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which are edge-bound nanometer-size graphene pieces, have fascinating optical and electronic properties. These have been synthesized either by nanolithography or from starting materials such as graphene oxide (GO) by the chemical breakdown of their extended planar structure, both of which are multistep tedious processes. Here, we report that during the acid treatment and chemical exfoliation of traditional pitch-based carbon fibers, that are both cheap and commercially available, the stacked graphitic submicrometer domains of the fibers are easily broken down, leading to the creation of GQDs with different size distribution in scalable amounts. The as-produced GQDs, in the size range of 1-4 nm, show two-dimensional morphology, most of which present zigzag edge structure, and are 1-3 atomic layers thick. The photoluminescence of the GQDs can be tailored through varying the size of the GQDs by changing process parameters. Due to the luminescence stability, nanosecond lifetime, biocompatibility, low toxicity, and high water solubility, these GQDs are demonstrated to be excellent probes for high contrast bioimaging and biosensing applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,"Proteomic analysis of complex protein mixtures using proteolytic digestion and liquid chromatography in combination with tandem mass spectrometry is a standard approach in biological studies. Data-dependent acquisition is used to automatically acquire tandem mass spectra of peptides eluting into the mass spectrometer. In more complicated mixtures, for example, whole cell lysates, data-dependent acquisition incompletely samples among the peptide ions present rather than acquiring tandem mass spectra for all ions available. We analyzed the sampling process and developed a statistical model to accurately predict the level of sampling expected for mixtures of a specific complexity. The model also predicts how many analyses are required for saturated sampling of a complex protein mixture. For a yeast-soluble cell lysate 10 analyses are required to reach a 95% saturation level on protein identifications based on our model. The statistical model also suggests a relationship between the level of sampling observed for a protein and the relative abundance of the protein in the mixture. We demonstrate a linear dynamic range over 2 orders of magnitude by using the number of spectra (spectral sampling) acquired for each protein.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,"Nanomaterials (NM) exhibit novel physicochemical properties that determine their interaction with biological substrates and processes. Three metal oxide nanoparticles that are currently being produced in high tonnage, TiO2 ZnO, and CeO2 were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis process and compared in a mechanistic study to elucidate the physicochemical characteristics that determine cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and toxic effects based on a test paradigm that was originally developed for oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 and BEAS-2B cell lines. ZnO induced toxicity in both cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidant injury, excitation of inflammation, and cell death. Using ICP-MS and fluorescent-labeled ZnO, it is found that ZnO dissolution could happen in culture medium and endosomes. Nondissolved ZnO nanoparticles enter caveolae in BEAS-2B but enter lysosomes in RAW 264.7 cells in which smaller particle remnants dissolve. In contrast, fluorescent-labeled CeO2 nanoparticles were taken up intact into caveolin-1 and LAMP-1 positive endosomal compartments, respectively, in BEAS-2B and RAW 264.7 cells, without inflammation or cytotoxicity. Instead, CeO2 suppressed ROS production and induced cellular resistance to an exogenous source of oxidative stress. Fluorescent-labeled TiO2 was processed by the same uptake pathways as CeO2 but did not elicit any adverse or protective effects. These results demonstrate that metal oxide nanoparticles induce a range of biological responses that vary from cytotoxic to cytoprotective and can only be properly understood by using a tiered test strategy such as we developed for oxidative stress and adapted to study other aspects of nanoparticle toxicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"High efficiency perovskite solar cells were fabricated reproducibly via Lewis base adduct of lead(II) iodide. PbI2 was dissolved in N,N-dimethyformamide with equimolar N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and CH3NH3I. Stretching vibration of S=O appeared at 1045 cm(-1) for bare DMSO, which was shifted to 1020 and 1015 cm(-1) upon reacting DMSO with PbI2 and PbI2 + CH3NH3I, respectively, indicative of forming the adduct of PbI2.DMSO and CH3NH3I.PbI2.DMSO due to interaction between Lewis base DMSO and/or iodide (I-) and Lewis acid PbI2. Spin-coating of a DMF solution containing PbI2, CH3NH3I, and DMSO (1:1:1 mol %) formed a transparent adduct film, which was converted to a dark brown film upon heating at low temperature of 65 degrees C for 1 min due to removal of the volatile DMSO from the adduct. The adduct-induced CH3NH3PbI3 exhibited high charge extraction characteristics with hole mobility as high as 3.9 x 10(-3) cm(2)/(V s) and slow recombination rate. Average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3% was achieved from 41 cells and the best PCE of 19.7% was attained via adduct approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"Simple, yet predictive bonding models are essential achievements of chemistry. In the solid state, in particular, they often appear in the form of visual bonding indicators. Because the latter require the crystal orbitals to be constructed from local basis sets, the application of the most popular density-functional theory codes (namely, those based on plane waves and pseudopotentials) appears as being ill-fitted to retrieve the chemical bonding information. In this paper, we describe a way to re-extract Hamilton-weighted populations from plane-wave electronic-structure calculations to develop a tool analogous to the familiar crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) method. We derive the new technique, dubbed ""projected COHP"" (pCOHP), and demonstrate its viability using examples of covalent, ionic, and metallic crystals (diamond, GaAs, CsCl, and Na). For the first time, this chemical bonding information is directly extracted from the results of plane-wave calculations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"The current rapid industrial development causes the serious energy and environmental crises. Photocatalyts provide a potential strategy to solve these problems because these materials not only can directly convert solar energy into usable or storable energy resources but also can decompose organic pollutants under solar-light irradiation. However, the aforementioned applications require photocatalysts with a wide absorption range, long-term stability, high charge-separation efficiency and strong redox ability. Unfortunately, it is often difficult for a single-component photocatalyst to simultaneously fulfill all these requirements. The artificial heterogeneous Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, mimicking the natural photosynthesis process, overcome the drawbacks of single-component photocatalysts and satisfy those aforementioned requirements. Such multi-task systems have been extensively investigated in the past decade. Especially, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems without redox pair have been widely used in the water splitting, solar cells, degradation of pollutants and CO2 conversion, which have a huge potential to solve the current energy and environmental crises facing the modern industrial development. Thus, this review gives a concise overview of the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, including their composition, construction, optimization and applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

87,"A number of functionalized graphite oxides were prepared by treatment of graphite oxide (GO) with organic isocyanates. These isocyanate-treated GOs (iGOs) can then be exfoliated into functionalized graphene oxide nanoplatelets that can form a stable dispersion in polar aprotic solvents. Characterization of iGOs by FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis suggested that the isocyanate treatment results in the functionalization of the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in GO via formation of amides and carbamate esters, respectively. The degree of GO functionalization can be controlled via either the reactivity of the isocyanate or the reaction time. When used with functionalized isocyanates, the described methodology allows for the elaboration of graphene oxide nanoplatelets with different surface functional groups. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

88,"One of the greatest challenges for our society is providing powerful electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells are amongst the most promising candidates in terms of energy densities and power densities. Nanostructured materials are currently of interest for such devices because of their high surface area, novel size effects, significantly enhanced kinetics, and so on. This Progress Report describes some recent developments in nanostructured anode and cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, addressing the benefits of nanometer-size effects, the disadvantages of 'nano', and strategies to solve these issues such as nano/micro hierarchical structures and surface coatings, as well as developments in the discovery of nanostructured Pt-based electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).

89,"Halogen bonding refers to the non-covalent interactions of halogen atoms X in some molecules, RX, with negative sites on others. It can be explained by the presence of a region of positive electrostatic potential, the sigma-hole, on the outermost portion of the halogen's surface, centered on the R-X axis. We have carried out a natural bond order B3LYP analysis of the molecules CF3X, with X = F, Cl, Br and I. It shows that the Cl, Br and I atoms in these molecules closely approximate the s(2)p(x)(2)p(y)(2)p(z)(1) configuration, where the z-axis is along the R-X bond. The three unshared pairs of electrons produce a belt of negative electrostatic potential around the central part of X, leaving the outermost region positive, the sigma-hole. This is not found in the case of fluorine, for which the combination of its high electronegativity plus significant sp-hybridization causes an influx of electronic charge that neutralizes the sigma-hole. These factors become progressively less important in proceeding to Cl, Br and I, and their effects are also counteracted by the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents in the remainder of the molecule. Thus a sigma-hole is observed for the Cl in CF3Cl, but not in CH3Cl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,"Layered materials consist of molecular layers stacked together by weak interlayer interactions. They often crystallize to form atomically smooth thin films, nanotubes, and platelet or fullerene-like nanoparticles due to the anisotropic bonding. Structures that predominately expose edges of the layers exhibit high surface energy and are often considered unstable. In this communication, we present a synthesis process to grow MoS2 and MoSe2 thin films with vertically aligned layers, thereby maximally exposing the edges on the film surface. Such edge-terminated films are metastable structures of MoS2 and MoSe2, which may find applications in diverse catalytic reactions. We have confirmed their catalytic activity in a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which the exchange current density correlates directly with the density of the exposed edge sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"As a promising non-precious catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER; refs 1-5), molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) is known to contain active edge sites and an inert basal plane(1,6-8). Activating the MoS2 basal plane could further enhance its HER activity but is not often a strategy for doing so. Herein, we report the first activation and optimization of the basal plane of monolayer 2H-MoS2 for HER by introducing sulphur (S) vacancies and strain. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the S-vacancies are new catalytic sites in the basal plane, where gap states around the Fermi level allow hydrogen to bind directly to exposed Mo atoms. The hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H)) can be further manipulated by straining the surface with S-vacancies, which fine-tunes the catalytic activity. Proper combinations of S-vacancy and strain yield the optimal Delta G(H) = 0 eV, which allows us to achieve the highest intrinsic HER activity among molybdenum-sulphide-based catalysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"We report the influence of uniaxial tensile mechanical strain in the range 0-2.2% on the phonon spectra and bandstructures of monolayer and bilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) two-dimensional crystals. First, we employ Raman spectroscopy to observe phonon softening with increased strain, breaking the degeneracy in the E' Raman mode of MoS2, and extract a Gruneisen parameter of similar to 1.06. Second, using photoluminescence spectroscopy we measure a decrease in the optical band gap of MoS2 that is approximately linear with strain, similar to 45 meV/% strain for monolayer MoS2 and similar to 120 meV/% strain for bilayer MoS2. Third, we observe a pronounced strain-induced decrease in the photoluminescence intensity of monolayer MoS2 that is indicative of the direct-to-indirect transition of the character of the optical band gap of this material at applied strain of similar to 1%. These observations constitute a demonstration of strain engineering the band structure in the emergent class of two-dimensional crystals, transition-metal dichalcogenides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"The research on electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC), also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, is quickly expanding because their power delivery performance fills the gap between dielectric capacitors and traditional batteries. However, many fundamental questions, such as the relations between the pore size of carbon electrodes, ion size of the electrolyte, and the capacitance have not yet been fully answered. We show that the pore size leading to the maximum double-layer capacitance of a TiC-derived carbon electrode in a solvent-free ethyl-methylimmidazolium-bis(trifluoro-methane-suffonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI) ionic liquid is roughly equal to the ion size (-0.7 nm). The capacitance values of TiC-CDC produced at 500 degrees C are more than 160 F/g and 85 F/cm(3) at 60 degrees C, while standard activated carbons with larger pores and a broader pore size distribution present capacitance values lower than 100 F/g and 50 F/cm(3) in ionic liquids. A significant drop in capacitance has been observed in pores that were larger or smaller than the ion size by just an angstrom, suggesting that the pore size must be tuned with sub-angstrom accuracy when selecting a carbon/ion couple. This work suggests a general approach to EDLC design leading to the maximum energy density, which has been now proved for both solvated organic salts and solvent-free liquid electrolytes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"The Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) and the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) methods calculate binding free energies for macromolecules by combining molecular mechanics calculations and continuum solvation models. To systematically evaluate the performance of these methods, we report here an extensive study of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3) Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free energies. Our results showed that MM/PBSA performed better in calculating absolute, but not necessarily relative, binding free energies than MM/GBSA. Considering its computational efficiency, MM/GBSA can serve as a powerful tool in drug design, where correct ranking of inhibitors is often emphasized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"Since the successful demonstration of a blue light-emitting diode (LED)(1), potential materials for making short-wavelength LEDs and diode lasers have been attracting increasing interest as the demands for display, illumination and information storage grow(2-4). Zinc oxide has substantial advantages including large exciton binding energy, as demonstrated by efficient excitonic lasing on optical excitation(5,6). Several groups have postulated the use of p-type ZnO doped with nitrogen, arsenic or phosphorus(7-10), and even p-n junctions(11-13). However, the choice of dopant and growth technique remains controversial and the reliability of p-type ZnO is still under debate(14). If ZnO is ever to produce long-lasting and robust devices, the quality of epitaxial layers has to be improved as has been the protocol in other compound semiconductors(15).

96,"We report on the microstructure and dynamics of electron transport and recombination in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) incorporating oriented TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays. The morphology of the NT arrays, which were prepared from electrochemically anodized Ti foils, were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The arrays were found to consist of closely packed NTs, several micrometers in length, with typical wall thicknesses and intertube spacings of 8-10 nm and pore diameters of about 30 nm. The calcined material was fully crystalline with individual NTs consisting of about 30 nm sized crystallites. The transport and recombination properties of the NT and nanoparticle (NP) films used in DSSCs were studied by frequency-resolved modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopies. While both morphologies display comparable transport times, recombination was much slower in the NT films, indicating that the NT-based DSSCs have significantly higher charge-collection efficiencies than their NP-based counterparts. Dye molecules were shown to cover both the interior and exterior walls of the NTs. Analysis of photocurrent measurements indicates that the light-harvesting efficiencies of NT-based DSSCs were higher than those found for DSSCs incorporating NPs owing to stronger internal light-scattering effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"A promising family of mixed transition-metal oxides (MTMOs) (designated as A(x)B(3-x)O(4); A, B=Co, Ni, Zn, Mn, Fe, etc.) with stoichiometric or even non-stoichiometric compositions, typically in a spinel structure, has recently attracted increasing research interest worldwide. Benefiting from their remarkable electrochemical properties, these MTMOs will play significant roles for low-cost and environmentally friendly energy storage/conversion technologies.

98,"An extended semiempirical tight-binding model is presented, which is primarily designed for the fast calculation of structures and noncovalent interaction energies for molecular systems with roughly 1000 atoms. The essential novelty in this so-called GFN2-xTB method is the inclusion of anisotropic second order density fluctuation effects via short-range damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments. Without noticeable increase in the computational demands, this results in a less empirical and overall more physically sound method, which does not require any classical halogen or hydrogen bonding corrections and which relies solely on global and element-specific parameters (available up to radon, Z = 86). Moreover, the atomic partial charge dependent D4 London dispersion model is incorporated self-consistently, which can be naturally obtained in a tight-binding picture from second order density fluctuations. Fully analytical and numerically precise gradients (nuclear forces) are implemented. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked for a wide variety of systems and compared with other semiempirical methods. Along with excellent performance for the ""target"" properties, we also find lower errors for ""off-target"" properties such as barrier heights and molecular dipole moments. High computational efficiency along with the improved physics compared to its precursor GFN-xTB makes this method well-suited to explore the conformational space of molecular systems. Significant improvements are furthermore observed for various benchmark sets, which are prototypical for biomolecular systems in aqueous solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"The conductivity of graphite oxide films is modulated using reducing agents. It is found that the sheet resistance of graphite oxide film reduced using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is much lower than that of films reduced using hydrazine (N2H4). This is attributed to the formation of C-N groups in the N2H4 case, which may act as donors compensating the hole carriers in reduced graphite oxide. In the case of NaBH4 reduction, the interlayer distance is first slightly expanded by the formation of intermediate boron oxide complexes and then contracted by the gradual removal of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups along with the boron oxide complexes. The fabricated conducting film comprising a NaBH4-reduced graphite oxide reveals a sheet resistance comparable to that of dispersed graphene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
