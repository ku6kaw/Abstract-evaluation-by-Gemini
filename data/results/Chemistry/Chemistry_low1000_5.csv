J,"Firsova, NE; Ktitorov, SA",Complex conductivity of monolayer graphene and Zitterbewegung,"A recently derived formula for complex conductivity of monolayer graphene is analyzed. We show that the real and imaginary parts in this formula obey the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations, which are a good test for validity of the formula for complex conductivity of monolayer graphene. We consider also an additional test for this formula, sensitive to the integral characteristic of the conductance such as the famous f-sum rule. We write it in the two dimensional form and show that it fulfils identically if we admit the cyclotron mass as an effective one and take the principal value of the integral. We find a deep relation between the graphene complex optical conductivity singularities and electrons Zitterbewegung (ZB) in graphene with frequency omega(ZB). Namely, the value of ZB frequency is related with the recently found magnitudes of the inductance L and capacitance C by Thomson's formula, that is, omega(ZB) = 1/root LC.",10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686621,3,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

In this study, a new technique is presented to fine-tune stiffness and biodegradability of collagen scaffolds by treatment with concentrated salt solutions. Collagen scaffolds were prepared by a casting, freezing and lyophilization process. Scaffolds were treated with 90% saturated salt solutions, the salts taken from the Hofmeister series, followed by chemical crosslinking. Treatment with salts consisting of a divalent cation in combination with a monovalent anion, e.g. CaCl2, resulted in fast shrinkage of the scaffolds up to approximately 10% of the original surface area. Effective salts were mostly at the chaotropic end of the Hofmeister series. Shrunken scaffolds were more than 10 times stiffer than non-shrunken control scaffolds, and displayed reduced pore sizes and swollen, less organized collagen fibrils. The effect could be pinpointed to the level of individual collagen molecules and indicates the shrinking effect to be driven by disruption of stabilizing hydrogen bonds within the triple helix. No calcium deposits remained in CaCl2 treated scaffolds. Subcutaneous implantation in rats showed similar biocompatibility compared to H2O and NaCl treated scaffolds, but reduced cellular influx and increased structural integrity without signs of major degradation after 3 months. In conclusion, high concentrations of chaotropic salts can be used to adjust the mechanical characteristics of collagen scaffolds without affecting biocompatibility. This technique may be used in regenerative medicine to stiffen collagen scaffolds to better comply with the surrounding tissues, but may also be applied for e.g. slow release drug delivery systems.",10.1039/c9ra06651a,8,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no

The mathematical model is formed by a system of nonlinear convection-diffusion reaction partial differential equations (PDEs) coupled with nonlinear algebraic equations for reactions and isotherms. The model equations are solved numerically by applying a semi-discrete high-resolution finite volume scheme (HR-FVS). Several numerical case studies are conducted for two different types of reactions to demonstrate the influence of heat transfer on the retention time, separation, and reaction. It was found that the enthalpies of adsorption and reaction significantly influence the reactor performance. The ratio of density time heat capacity of solid and liquid phases significantly influences the magnitude and velocity of concentration and thermal waves.

The inorganic ions suffered a similar process, going inside the body of glasses and precipitating the corresponding salts when water evaporated. As these compounds are polar, they were probably transported by infiltration waters from outside the glasses, remaining inside in the pores, cavities, or cracks of the glasses during thousands of years. In the case of the DGs, it could be observed that under the oxidizing conditions of the terrestrial atmosphere, sulfides present in some samples transformed into sulfates.

J,"Horvath, D; Dale, O; Simpson, M",Electrochemical response of various metals to oxygen gas bubbling in molten LiCl-Li<sub>2</sub>O melt,"The electrochemical response of several alloys (stainless steel 316, Hastelloy C276, Inconel 600, and tantalum) was investigated in molten LiCl-Li2O (1 wt%) at 923 K while bubbling oxygen gas into the molten salt. Tafel and zero resistance ammeter (ZRA) electrochemical methods were used to measure electrochemical effects of oxidation processes at the surface of each alloy. The Tafel method required approximately 15 min and was, thus, applied only in intervals between periods of oxygen bubbling in the salt. ZRA measurements were made in real time, while the O-2 was actively being bubbled into the salt. This method recorded both open circuit potential of the alloy relative to a Ni/NiO reference electrode and current between the alloy and the galvanically coupled platinum plate that served as the counter electrode. Both open circuit potential and galvanic oxidation current started to increase at the initiation of oxygen flow. Based on the observed oxidation current trend, it was inferred that the metals in order of increasing resistance to oxidation in molten LiCl-Li2O are as follows: tantalum < SS-316 < Inconel 600 < Haynes C276.

Microstructure analyses indicated that the PPy was successfully coated onto the NiAlO surface to form a core-shell structure. The NiAlO@PPy exhibited a better electrochemical performance than pure NiAlO, and the moderate thickness of the PPy shell layer was beneficial for expediting the electron transfer in the redox reaction. It was found that the NiAlO@PPy5 prepared at 5.0mLL(-1) addition amount of pyrrole monomer demonstrated the best electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 883.2Fg(-1) at a current density of 1Ag(-1) and excellent capacitance retention of 91.82% of its initial capacitance after 1000cycles at 3Ag(-1). The outstanding electrochemical performance of NiAlO@PPy5 were due to the synergistic effect of NiAlO and PPy, where the uniform network-like PPy shell with the optimal thickness made electrolyte ions more easily accessible for faradic reactions.

However, the production of HAdV vaccine has not met the requirements of industrial production. Recently, we investigated the effects of various regulatory genes of the pyruvate metabolism node on the substance and energy metabolism and adenovirus reproduction in HEK-293 cells. Initially, single regulatory genes, including pkm2, pdh alpha, pyc2, mpc3, aralar1, ldha and pdk1, were studied. We found that metabolic performance and adenovirus reproduction capacity in HEK-293 cells were improved, and maximum adenovirus titre was increased approximately 15-fold. Next, we co-overexpressed the key genes, including pkm2, pyc2 and aralar1. The PYC2-A-P-L cells that had the appropriate co-overexpression levels of three genes had the most pronounced regulatory effect. The maximum cell density and maximum specific growth rate were increased by 21% compared with that in the control. The Delta Lac/Delta Glc and Delta NH3/Delta Gln were decreased by 26% and 27%, respectively. The ATP production rate and the ATP/O-2 ratio were increased by 110% and 20%, respectively. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reduced by 60%. The adenovirus reproductive ability of the PYC2-A-P-L cells was approximately 30-fold higher than that of the control.

Furthermore, actual IR and (CNMR)-C-13 spectra are obtained and compared with the theoretical results at both the levels; linear correlations between the experimental IR and (CNMR)-C-13 data and their corresponding theoretical ones are found with R-2?>?0.90. Other helpful descriptors such as Fukui functions, delocalization stability energies, and molecular electrostatic potentials are used to characterize the reactivity and electronic properties of the title structure.

Our study aimed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the CAD/CAM-based template for maxillary orthognathic surgery using dry skulls. After reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual skull model, a surface-based surgical template for Le Fort I osteotomy was designed and fabricated using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology. To determine accuracy, the deviation of the template between the planned and the actual position and the fitness of the template were evaluated. The mean deviation was 0.41 +/- 0.30 mm in the medio-lateral direction, 0.55 +/- 0.59 mm in the antero-posterior direction, and 0.69 +/- 0.59 mm in the supero-inferior direction. The root mean square deviation between the planned and the actual position of the template was 1.21 +/- 0.54 mm. With respect to the fitness of the template, the mean distance between the inner surface of the template and the underlying bone surface was 0.76 +/- 0.24 mm. CAD/CAM-based templates showed precise positioning and good fitness. These results suggest that surface topography-based CAD-CAM templates can be considered as an alternative solution in replacing the traditional intermediate splints for the transfer of surgical plans.",10.3390/app9224928,51,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

Three-dimensional visualization of information is expected to facilitate visual search for radiologists. However, as the differences in user performance, depending on radiologist experience, have not yet been assessed for real three-dimensional images, it is difficult to estimate the usability of new visualization systems for radiologists with different amounts of professional search experience. In this study, we aimed to determine how three-dimensional visual search is affected by radiologist experience and the physical properties of stimuli. Radiologists, residents, and medical students accomplished visual search tasks with varying set sizes and target-distractor similarities. Search items were presented on multiple display planes and image manipulation was conducted using a computer keyboard. We compared the search outcome and strategy among three groups of participants. All three groups submitted a similar number of correct responses depending on target-distractor similarity. However, in contrast to radiologists and residents, it took a considerably longer time for students to find the targets. The major differences were evident in search strategy when comparing the image manipulations of radiologists with those of residents and students. Our results demonstrated that experienced radiologists' search performance benefited from seeing the entire three-dimensional view of an image, whereas residents and students focused instead on reducing the amount of information and searched in a selective manner.

Conventional word-level error resilience techniques such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC) suffer from high physical overhead and inability to correct increasingly reported multiple bit flip errors. On the other hands, state-of-the-art applications such as image processing and machine learning loosen the requirement on the levels of data protection, which result in dedicated techniques of approximated fault tolerance. In this work, we introduce a novel error protection scheme for memory, based on feature extraction through Principal Component Analysis and the modular-wise technique to segment the data before PCA. The extracted features can be protected by replacing the fault vector with the averaged confinement vectors. This approach confines the errors with either single or multi-bit flips for generic data blocks, whilst achieving significant savings on execution time and memory usage compared to traditional ECC techniques. Experimental results of image processing demonstrate that the proposed technique results in a reconstructed image with PSNR over 30 dB, while robust against both single bit and multiple bit flip errors, with reduced memory storage to just 22.4% compared to the conventional ECC-based technique.",10.3390/app9224733,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that the decay rate of the WTDs of the cavity for short and long time limits can be effectively tuned by the driving external field Rabi frequency, the frequency of the cavity photon, and the detuning between the microwave driving frequency and the energy-splitting of the DQDs. The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction. This also demonstrates that the effect of the DQDs can be replaced a thermal reservoir when the rate difference of a photon absorbed and emitted by DQDs is larger than zero; otherwise, it is irreplaceable.

To achieve the objective of the research study, a congestion control after fast-recovery module for congestion control scheme of Multistream Fast TCP is proposed. The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol.

Despite many investigations of the mechanism of this reaction, the contribution of polarization of the pi-bond of H2F in driving hydride transfer remains unclear. H2F was stereospecifically labeled with deuterium beta to the reacting center, and beta-deuterium kinetic isotope effects were measured. Our experimental results combined with analysis derived from QM/MM simulations reveal that hydride transfer is triggered by polarization at the C6 of H2F. The sigma C-H bonds contribute to the buildup of the cationic character during the chemical transformation, and hyperconjugation influences the formation of the transition state. Our findings provide key insights into the hydride transfer mechanism of the DHFR-catalyzed reaction, which is a target for antiproliferative drugs and a paradigmatic model in mechanistic enzymology.",10.1021/acscatal.9b02839,71,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The finding that the lead concentration in the lake water above the thermocline shows a higher value than that in the lake water below the thermocline means that the input of lead into the surface water occurs during the thermocline-stratification period. The isotopic ratios (Pb-208/Pb-206 and Pb-207/Pb-206) were measured to estimate the origin of the lead. The obtained lead isotopic ratios in the surface water samples are similar to the reported values of the lead emitted in Japan rather than those at the Eurasia continent.

J,"Baek, YJ",On Non-Completeness and G-Equivariance,"With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.",10.3390/app9214692,76,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

Therefore, the main objective of the paper was to evaluate the mass-transfer during laser surface alloying in the reflow mode. To evaluate the effectiveness of surface hardening technology, it was proposed to use two new parameters - reduced wear and reduced integrated micro hardness of the modified surface layer. Based on an analysis of the experimental data on the wear of a cutter made of HVG and U10 steel, processed by a laser with smears in the reflow mode, the existence of a correlation between the entered parameters is demonstrate and the regression equation is obtained.

The reaction produced a heteroleptic high-spin Mn(III)-complex, hs-[Mn-III(L-1)(-)(L-2)(2-)]: 2 in moderate yield. The ligand H2L2 (H2L2 = 2,2'-dihydroxo-3,5,3',5'-tetra-tert-butylazobenzene) produced in situ via simultaneous azo-cleavage of [L-1](-) and recombination of two amido-phenolate fragments. The electronic structures of all three complexes coordinated by the two redox noninnocent ligands [L-1/2](-/2-) have been elucidated by using a host of physical methods: X-ray crystallography, magnetic susceptibility measurements, cyclic voltammetry, absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Their experimental structures are well reproduced by DFT calculations and support the overall electronic structures of the above compounds. The complexes 1, [1](+)[l(3)](-) and 2 have one, two and four unpaired electrons respectively, as evidenced by room temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements. The redox process between [1](+)/1 is ligand centred which does not affect the trivalent oxidation state of the metal ion. The chemical conversion [L-1](-) -> [L-2](2-) occurs only in aerobic condition and a rationale for the reaction is discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Chen, HJ; Gao, Q; Qian, BL; Zhao, LS",Unusual Response of Thin LiTaO<sub>3</sub> Films to Intense Microwave Pulses,"Fundamentally different responses of a LiTaO3 thin film detector are observed when it is subjected to short microwave pulses as the pulse intensity is altered over a wide range. We start from weak microwave pulses which lead to only trivial pyroelectric peak response. However, when the microwave pulses become intense, the normally expected pyroelectric signal seems to be suppressed and the sign of the voltage signal can even be completely changed. Analysis indicates that while the traditional pyroelectric model, which is a linear model and works fine for our data in the small regime, it does not work anymore in the large signal regime. Since the small-signal model is the key foundation of electromagnetic-wave sensors based on pyroelectric effects, such as pyroelectric infrared detecters, the observation in this work suggests that one should be cautious when using these devices in intense fields. In addition, the evolution of detector signal with respect to excitation strength suggests that the main polarisation process is changed in the large signal regime. This is of fundamental importance to the understanding on how crystalline solids interact with intense microwaves. Possible causes of the nonlinear behaviour is discussed.",10.3390/ma12213588,93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater, it included a Cl- concentration of 3000 mg/L, SO42- concentration of 100 mg/L according to conventional leather wastewater conditions. Furthermore, Cl- and SO42- can be used as supporting electrolyte. After pretreatment, the ammonia nitrogen concentration kept about 100 mg/L. The optimal treatment conditions of Electro-Fenton system were obtained throughout single factors experiments. The current density was 150 A/m(2), the reaction time was 30 min, the plate spacing distance was 40 mm, and the reaction temperature was adjusted to 40 degrees C. After flocculation treatment of leather wastewater, the ammonia nitrogen concentration was 142.11 mg/L, and the tanning wastewater was further treated with an Electro-Fenton system. The final ammonia nitrogen concentration was 11.23 mg/L, which meets the first-level wastewater discharge standard. The removal rate was 92.10%, which indicated that the Electro-Fenton system is one kind of clean, feasible and sustainable treatment method for the deep treatment of ammonia nitrogen in tannery wastewater.",,94,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no

The scope of existing mathematical descriptions is ported to R and expanded with the implementation of a database of phase diagram parameters. The package applies nonlinear regression analysis to calculate the fitting parameters of well-known empirical equations-such as the ones described by Merchuk and Murugesan-using data obtained from articles published in high quality journals. The database is based on empirical data obtained from published manuscripts and provides a software package with the potential to reduce experimental effort and save resources throughout the development of an ATPS-based process or product. The package requires only minimal knowledge of R and can be installed directly from its console, and the results are easily exported for subsequent analyses. Detailed examples of usage and descriptions of the package capabilities, including built-in database search functions, are demonstrated by characterizing a poly(ethylene glycol) 2000/ammonium sulfate ATPS, the data of which is provided with the package. Additional online resources for the package are also described, including the procedure to allow users to contribute to LLSR in order to expand its database and capabilities.",10.1021/acs.jced.9b00317,95,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The UV-blue emission bands have the following characteristics: (i) the 290 run waveband could be due to defects-sites by the presence of Na ions; (ii) the 380 nm band, caused by intrinsic defects in the lattice (i.e. Non-Bridging Oxygen Hole Centers (NBOHCs), [AlO4]degrees centres, alkali planar defects and Oxygen Defect Centers (ODCs), among others); (iii) the 420 nm waveband, linked to the recombination on a centre formed from a hole-oxygen atom adjacent to two aluminum atoms (Al-O-Al) and Al-O-Si complexes; (iv) the 460 nm band, associated with the presence of Ti4+ in the plagiclase crystal lattice. The green waveband could be linked to de-excitation of Mn2+ ions. The estimation of the activation energy (E-a) from the 10 Gy-induced TL glow curves analyzed by means of the initial rise method display linear regressions with acceptable r coefficients (r > 0.977) that reveal three groups of components with traps at different depth in the crystal lattice of the albite with Ea values in the range of 0.5-0.64 eV.",10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.108383,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Dai, L; Elich, J; Jacobson, F",Development of a Size-Exclusion Chromatography Method to Characterize a Multimeric PEG-Protein Conjugate,"Conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to therapeutic molecules is a widely used technique to increase in vivo half-life of therapeutics. A multimeric PEG protein conjugate, which contains eight antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) conjugated to an 8-arm PEG core, was developed as a therapeutic candidate for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The increased molecular size of the conjugate, compared to the Fab alone, produces a significant longer half-life, and requires less frequent intravitreal (ITV) injections, which can greatly benefit the patient. Due to the major impact that molecular size has on in vitreous half-life, it is crucial to have an analytical method to monitor the size attribute of the conjugate. Here we report a simple and robust size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) method that was developed for the conjugate. A wide range of size variants of the conjugate, ranging from 50 kDa to >1000 kDa, can be resolved and quantitated. The method was evaluated for precision, accuracy, linearity, and robustness, and was deemed suitable for routine use in product quality control.",,97,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Danilin, AN; Rabinskiy, LN; Zhavoronok, SI",DEFORMATION OF THE HELICAL TYPE WIRE STRUCTURES,"Analysis of overhead power transmission lines (OPL) involves the simulation of statics and oscillation. Solving such problems strictly requires the proper accounting of the internal conductor structure, in particular for power safety and reliability systems of information-telecommunication supply of aerodromes and aircraft systems, as well as for overhead transmission lines subjected to intense wind, especially in icing conditions. Due to the complexity of wire structures, known issues arise in the estimates of their deformations, stiffness, bearing capacity, etc. For instance, the bending stiffness of the conductor can vary considerably. Consequently, the stiffness can vary along the conductor axis as well as in time. This paper proposes a new deformation model of wire structures similar to typical OPL conductors. Such structures include not only conductors and cables, but spiral clamps intended for tension, suspension, joining, protection, and repair of conductors. Based on energy averaging each wire layer is considered as an equivalent elastic anisotropic cylindrical shell. Therefore a conductor or a spiral clamp can be modeled as a system of shells nested into each other and interacting by means of pressure and friction forces. In the process of the study, calculations were made that made it possible to formulate equations for the matrices of flexibility and cruelty of spiral structures. The interaction problem for a tension clamp with an external wire layer of a conductor has been formulated and solved. Finally, the mechanism of the force transfer from the clamp on the conductor has been investigated.",,98,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no
J,"Delgado, GE; Belandria, LM; Guillen, M; Mora, AJ; Seijas, LE",STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF 2-AMINO-2-OXOACETIC ACID BY X-RAY POWDER DIFFRACTION AND QUANTUM CHEMISTRY,"2-amino-2-oxoacetic acid, carbamoyl formic acid, or oxamic acid is an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of great importance mainly because is an inhibitor of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). It acts as an inhibitor to the metabolic pathways of the tumor cells and exhibited significant anticancer activity against nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells in vitro and can be considered as a potential drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Also, this compound could be used as a building block in the design of supramolecular architectures based on hydrogen bonds through the complimentary hydrogen-bond functionalities of the carbonyl and amide functional groups present. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction is the most powerful technique for crystal structure determination of small molecules. However, for several materials, including oxamic acid, it could be complicated to grow single crystals of suitable size and quality that make them appropriated to structure analysis. For this reason, the structural study was conducted with powder X-ray diffraction which is a process significantly more challenging than structure determination from single-crystal data. Oxamic acid has been characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopic techniques, thermal TGA-DSC analysis, semi-empirical PM7 calculations, and X-ray powder diffraction. The title compound crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space group Cc, Z=4, and unit cell parameters a= 9.4994(4) angstrom, b= 5.4380(2) angstrom, c= 6.8636(3) angstrom, beta= 107.149(2)degrees, V= 338.79(2) angstrom(3). The molecule has a trans conformation. The molecular structure and crystal packing are stabilized mainly by intra- and intermolecular O--H center dot center dot center dot O and N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds. The structural characterization of this type of API compound is important to understand its mechanisms of action due to its considerable biological effects.
