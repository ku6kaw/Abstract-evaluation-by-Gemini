0,"Inhibition effects of cysteine(Cys), methionine(Met), and histidine(His) on the corrosion of cobalt were investigated in deaerated 0.5 M HCl and 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. All the inhibition efficiency (IE) in the amino acids for the cobalt corrosion depended on the mixed inhibition. However, IE in the solution of H2SO4 depended more on the anodic and in the solution of HCL on the cathodic inhibition Amino acid adsorption process on cobalt surface in the solution can be explained by modified Langmuir isotherm. The molecules of histidine dissolved in both of the solution were physically adsorbed due to the electrostatic interaction between the surface of {Co-Cl-delta} and the {-NH3+} or {-NH+=} of His. However the other cases of adsorption in this investigation can be explained by chemical adsorption between the empty d-orbital of Co and the lone pair of electron in S-atom in Cys and Met.",no,happy,happy,no,no,happy,happy,happy,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,happy,happy,no,no,yes,yes,yes

3,"It is shown that there are an infinite number of radial distribution functions (RDFs), corresponding to only one direct correlation function (DCF) of the optimised random phase approximation (ORPA). This observation in the thermodynamic perturbation theory is in sharp contrast to that of integral equation theories in which they uniquely correspond. By devising a new method we will be able to introduce various perturbation theories of simple liquids all coming from one DCF. Among all, we will only present analytically seven variants of the ORPA in the thermodynamic perturbation theory of liquids. The DCF of hard-core potential for all variants is assumed to be the same as the ORPA. However, interestingly enough the resulted expressions for the Helmholtz free energies and the RDF are obtained very differently. Furthermore, the resulted thermodynamic properties come out somehow the same, whereas the structural functions of some variants are found to behave much better than the standard ORPA.

The characteristics of GSCNRs/SiO2 were confirmed through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. After the optimization of several parameters, the removal efficiency of phenol and 2,4-DCP using 1 g of adsorbent amount, the initial concentration of pollutants (10 mg/L phenol and 15 mg/L 2,4-DCP), a contact time of 10 min (phenol) and 20 min (2,4-DCP), and pH = 7 were 69 and 89%, respectively. The adsorption isotherm models of Langmuir and Freundlich, as well as pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models, were examined under optimal conditions.

5,"Using statistical model, we study mechanisms of phase separation in a solution consisting of patchy particles, which are capable to form directed and saturated thermoreversible bonds. We focus on the impact of variable reactivity of patchy particles on the form of miscibility gap. We show that the variation of model parameters determining features of interparticle interaction makes it possible to obtain miscibility gaps of different types within the unified formalism. In particular, we uncover two different mechanisms of the formation of phase separation curves with lower critical solution temperature. The first mechanism is realised in the case of positive bonding energy; the second one can takes place when the energy of formation of two-bonded particles is lower than that for all other m-bonded ones. We conclude that the most interesting and non-trivial phase behavior is observed in the case of patchy particles with variable reactivity. Using rigorous statistical model, we uncover new mechanisms of phase separation in a solution consisting of patchy particles, which are capable to form directed and saturated thermoreversible bonds. This topic corresponds to state of the art in modern chemical physics. The results obtained shed light on interplay between features of non-isotropic interactions and phase behavior in both molecular and nanoparticle systems.

6,"Our undergraduate research group has long focused on the preparation and investigation of electron-deficient analogs of the perimidinespirohexadienone (PSHD) family of photochromic molecular switches for potential application as ""photochromic photooxidants"" for gating sensitivity to photoinduced charge transfer. We previously reported the photochemistry of two closely related and more reducible quinazolinespirohexadienones (QSHDs), wherein the naphthalene of the PSHD is replaced with a quinoline. In the present work, we report our investigation of the electrochemistry of these asymmetric QSHDs. In addition to the short wavelength and photochromic long-wavelength isomers, we have found that a second, distinct long-wavelength isomer is produced electrochemically. This different long-wavelength isomer arises from a difference in the regiochemistry of spirocyclic ring-opening. The structures of both long-wavelength isomers were ascertained by cyclic voltammetry and H-1 NMR analyses, in concert with computational modeling. These results are compared to those for the symmetric parent PSHD, which due to symmetry possesses only a single possible regioisomer upon either electrochemical or photochemical ring-opening. Density functional theory calculations of bond lengths, bond orders, and molecular orbitals allow the rationalization of this differential photochromic vs electrochromic behavior of the QSHDs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"The induced circular dichroism (ICD) of phenol complexed with (R)-(-)-2-butanol [PhOH-(-)BOH] in a supersonic jet is investigated using resonant two-photon ionization circular dichroism (R2PICD) spectroscopy. The R2PICD spectrum of PhOH-(-)BOH exhibits nonzero ICD bands near the absorption region of bare PhOH, where (-)BOH is transparent. Two different conformers containing a single hydrogen bond between PhOH and (-)BOH are identified using ultraviolet-ultraviolet hole-burning and infrared ion-dip spectroscopy combined with quantum theoretical calculations. The ICD values of the two conformers are similar to each other. To understand these similar ICD effects of the conformers, the geometrical asymmetry of the PhOH moiety bound to (-)BOH and the coupling strength of the electric transition dipole moments between PhOH and (-)BOH are estimated. Comparing the ICD values of PhOH (-)BOH with those of PhOH-(-)-L-methyl lactate in the previous report [Hong, A.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett.2018, 9, 476-480], we investigate the physical properties that may govern the differences of the ICD values between the two complexes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Low-temperature persistent and transient hole-burning (HB) spectra are presented for the triple hydrogen-bonded L131LH + M160LH + M197FH mutant of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These spectra expose the heterogeneous nature of the P-, B-, and H-bands, consistent with a distribution of electron transfer (ET) times and excitation energy transfer (EET) rates. Transient P(+)Q(A)(-) holes are observed for fast (tens of picoseconds or faster) ET times and reveal strong coupling to phonons and marker mode(s), while the persistent holes are bleached in a fraction of reaction centers with long-lived excited states characterized by much weaker electron-phonon coupling. Exposed differences in electron-phonon coupling strength, as well as a different coupling to the marker mode(s), appear to affect the ET times. Both resonantly and nonresonantly burned persistent HB spectra show weak blue- (similar to 150 cm(-1)) and large, red-shifted (similar to 300 cm(-1)) antiholes of the P band. Slower EET times from the H- and B-bands to the special pair dimer provide new insight on the influence of hydrogen bonds on mutation-induced heterogeneity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"In this work, density functional theory has been employed to design a heterobimetallic catalyst of Ni(ii) and Fe(ii) for the effective CO2 hydrogenation to HCOOH. Based on computational results, our newly designed catalyst is found to be effective for such conversion reactions with free energy as low as 14.13 kcal mol(-1) for the rate determining step. Such a low value of free energy indicates that the NiFe heterobimetallic catalyst can prove to be very efficient for the above said conversion. Moreover, the effects of ligand substitutions at the active metal center and the effects due to various spin states are also explored, and can serve as a great tool for the rational design of NiFe catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,"In this report, novel azobenzene self-assembled complexes (azo-Cn, n = 8, 12, 16) were used as an electrode material for pseudo-capacitors. The as-prepared azo-Cn exhibited a good reversible redox process and possessed a specific capacitance as high as 221.0 F g(-1) at 10 mV s(-1). However, with the value n increased from 8 to 16, the specific capacitances of azo-Cn electrode materials decreased. In order to study the reasons, the effect of surface amphiphilic property of azobenzene self-assembled electrode materials on the properties of supercapacitors was studied and the results showed that the capacitive behaviors of azo-Cn could be greatly improved by better surface hydrophilic properties and azo-C8 with good supercapacitive characteristics could be the potential ideal electrode materials for low-cost and high-efficiency electrochemical supercapacitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Autofluorescence of the bone extracellular matrix (ECM) has not been widely explored although the ECM plays a very important role in bone development. In our research we focused on examining the bone matrix of very young animals due to the intense growth process during the first month of life. Structure images and fluorescence spectra of the bone surface were carried out using confocal fluorescence microscope Eclipse Ti-S inverted CLSM (NIKON, Japan) for compact tibia of healthy 7-, 14- and 28-day-old rat newborns after prenatal zidovudine administration in comparison with control. Spectral features of ECM autofluorescence were analyzed statistically by taking into consideration p < 0.05. The CLSM technique allows for simultaneous examination of the structure and autofluorescence from selected areas of the bone surface. Excessive autofluorescence of ECM after prenatal zidovudine administration influences bone growth incommensurably to the newborns' age. Therefore the possibility of an additional non-enzymatic mechanism of collagen cross-linking in the first two weeks of life of newborn rats prenatally treated with zidovudine has been considered. Our results suggest that ECM autofluorescence can be an indicator of bone development in the normal and pathological state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compounds 3 and 4 consist of a square pyramidal cluster of five ruthenium atoms with an interstitial nitrido ligand in the base of the square pyramid. Compound 4 exhibits a dynamical exchange activity that leads to an averaging of all its three AuPPh3 groups on the NMR time scale. Reaction of 1 with [Cu(PPh3)Br](4) yielded three new hetero-bimetallic ruthenium-copper-nitrido cluster complexes: monocopper -tetraruthenium cluster complex [Ru-4(mu(4)-N)(CO)(12)(mu-CuPPh3)], 5, monocopperpentaruthenium cluster complex [Ru-5(mu(5)-N)(CO)(13)(PPh3)(mu(3)-CuPPh3)], 6, and the tricopperpentaruthenium cluster complex [Ru-5(mu(5)-N)(CO)(13)(mu-CuPPh3){mu(3)-Cu(PPh3)}(2)}], 7.

17,"Circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA), the main item of liquid biopsy, is DNA fragments from tumor genome that carries certain characteristics (including single nucleotide variation, deletion, insertion, rearrangement, copy number variation, and methylation) in the human blood circulation system. It mainly originates from apoptotic or necrotic tumor cells. The detection and analysis of ctDNA can provide genomic information in tumors, such as copy number variation, single nucleotide mutation, and methylation enrichment across the genome. It has a certain correlation with tumor size and development and considered as an emerging and promising tumor biomarker for cancer progression, reoccurrence, and routine monitoring after surgery. Compared with other tumor markers, the isolation method is relatively simple due to the stability of ctDNA. However, the extremely low abundance of ctDNA, the high content of background cell free DNA(cfDNA), the large difference between individuals, and the need of predicted detection sites in advance make it necessary to analyze ctDNA in a comprehensive way. Herein, we summarize the recent progress on ctDNA detection from digital PCR to next generation sequencing, including some commercialized apparatuses and certain methods that have recently been developed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

19,"It is of long-standing interest to probe protein primary structures by their codes alone with minimal assumptions and model parameters. Approaches over decades have looked to the mathematics of digital information, most prominently alignment and database search algorithms. We follow an alternative line of inquiry by directing the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) to archetypal sequences and sets. The motivation overlaps with bioinformatics and pharmaceutical chemistry: to better comprehend protein structure information with applications to drug and antibody targets. The approach, however, does not concentrate on sequences per se, but rather their information-conserved transforms. We demonstrate how such transforms enable obscure primary structure correlations to rise to the surface. The methodology further leverages the assembly information in sequences to provide class databases for comparisons. The databases illuminate additional correlations that are nuanced and characteristic. We illustrate the workings of BWT followed by data for archetypal drug and antibody targets. Our purpose is to establish new metrics and signatures for screening targets that complement ones from bioinformatics and protein structure modeling. The programming and analysis are straightforward and well-accessible to data researchers. Further, the software is freely available from the authors on request.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"In the current work, in order to model a free electron solvated in water, we have implemented a method to represent the molecular charge distribution as a set of Slater-type functions within the framework of a QM/MM method called QMSTAT. Also, it has been introduced in this method a new approach to calculate the intermolecular induction energy in the presence of very strong electric fields. Unlike most previous potentials, our method uses the ab initio energies of the electron-water complex as reference to obtain the few fitted parameters that the model needs, instead of the ab initio potential of the electron. A Metropolis-Monte Carlo simulation of 15 million steps has been carried out in a system that consists of an electron solvated in 200 water molecules explicitly described. The obtained results predict a vertical electron detachment energy of 3.30 eV and a radius of gyration of 2.38 angstrom, which are in very good agreement with the experimental data of 3.27+0.10 eV and 2.45 angstrom, respectively. We have also obtained the absorption spectrum of the hydrated electron from our simulation. The maximum of the spectrum agrees very well with the experimental result and the experimental width at half-maximum is only 0.11 eV wider than the calculated curve. The calculations predict the same blue tail as the experimental result but with a less smooth shape. Also, our results indicate that the transfer of intensity from the transition arriving to the highest of the three p states to transitions arriving to higher-lying states contributes to the intensity enhancement of the blue tail of the spectrum. Regarding the solvated structure of the free electron, we have found that if the basis center is used as the electron site to calculate the correlation functions, the results predict a structure where the electron places itself on top of a central water molecule surrounded by the remaining water molecules in a very organized and stable arrangement. However, if the maximum of the electron density is used as electron site the obtained picture shows an electron located in a very fluctuating cavity that collapses and reforms continuously.

The electrical characterization demonstrates the tunability in the resistivity of Al2O3/Gr devices by applying V-g. Al2O3 deposition introduced n-doping in graphene and is affirmed by shifting of charge neutrality point towards negative V-g.

25,"A new ionic pair salt [Ni(bpy)(3)][Ni(mnt)(2)](2) (mnt = 1,2-dicyanoethane-1,2-dithiolate) has been prepared and its crystal structure was determined by X-ray crystallography at 293, 200 and 100 K. In the mononuclear radical anionic complex, the nickel ion assumes a slightly distorted square-planar geometry. There is a special kind of stacking interactions at each temperature (i.e., Model A at 293 K, Model B at 200 K and Model C at 100 K). The variable-temperature magnetic moments indicate that there is a strong anti-ferromagnetic interaction between the adjacent pi-pi stacking mononuclear mononuclear radical anionic complexes and especially the anti-ferromagnetic coupling strength is close to the diamagnetism at 100 K. The theoretical calculations reveal for the first time that the spin densities between the short contact atoms are beta state and the anti-ferromagnetic coupling property of this crystal may be related to the beta state spin densities between the short contact atoms. The theoretical calculations further confirm that the strong anti-ferromagnetic coupling strength should be relevant to the larger spin densities on the short contact atoms and the larger overlap integrals between the short contact atoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"The surface design of biomedical materials is becoming more and more important in the fields of tissue engineering, biomedical devices, biosensing and detection, and biochips. In-depth understanding of the properties of materials, especially the surface properties, has a certain guiding role in the development of biomedical materials.

27,"The growth of oxide scales on CeO2-coated Ni polycrystals, in the temperature range 800-1200 degrees C, is analyzed taking into account both the transport properties of Ce-doped Ni1-xO single crystals, under non-equilibrium conditions, and a formal analysis of transport properties of cation deficient p-type semi conducting oxides in presence of an external driving force. It was shown that a key feature of the beneficial influence of CeO2-coatings on the layer growth is the kinetic demixing of cations, leading to an enrichment of cerium in the inner oxidation scale. It follows a higher cationic vacancy concentration near the metal/oxide interface, leading to a lower vacancy concentration gradient across the layer and a decrease of the driving force of diffusion controlling the oxidation kinetics. Further, the lower cation mobility in the outer layer due to the depletion of Ce4+, leads to a blocking effect of the outward diffusion of cations. It follows a local excess of Ni2+ and the formation of new oxide units which also contribute to a decrease of the oxidation rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"We have developed a simple method for depositing high quality platinum (Pt) metal contacts without the necessity of placing the substrate in vacuum or heating it above 180 degrees C. This method is particularly beneficial for hydrated oxide ceramics, as it prevents water loss and subsequent conductivity degradation. A mixture of two organic solvents was used: ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EEE) and acetone. By dispersing the precursor PtCl4 in this mixed non-volatile/volatile solvent, homogeneous drying patterns were achieved. EEE was used as the reducing agent, providing a relatively slow rate of Pt deposition, and thereby avoiding formation and subsequent coagulation of Pt clusters. Drop casting of the solution (25 mu L/cm(2)) on mirror-polished surfaces was performed at 25 degrees C followed by 5 min partial solvent evaporation. The substrate was then heated to 180 degrees C for similar to 30 s, resulting in the formation of a metallic Pt layer. The method was successfully tested on 5 mol % Y doped BaZrO3 and 10 mol% Gd doped ceria ceramic pellets, alumina plates, and Kapton (R) polymer sheets. The in-plane sheet resistance was 30-110 Omega at room temperature after a single deposition cycle. Because of its versatility and low cost per deposition, the proposed method is very promising for a variety of substrates where high quality electrical contacts prepared at low temperature are required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One method for assessing the success of the extraction process is to assess the UV-Vis spectrum profile. This study aims to determine how the exposure of light from akar kuning stem ethanol extract affects the UV-Vis spectrum profile. Extraction is done by maceration with ethanol solvent, using the UV-Vis spectrophotometry method to analyze the resulting extract. The experimental conditions were divided into three groups, consisting of samples that were extracted by exposure to sunlight, exposed to incandescent light bulbs, and not exposed to light at all. The results obtained showed that the extracted akar kuning sample in a condition not exposed to light at all produced the UV-Vis profile with the highest absorbance, almost double that of other conditions. This indicates that the extracted metabolite has the most quantity compared to other conditions. Conversely, the UV-Vis profile in samples exposed to sunlight has a peak profile that is different from other conditions, indicating that UV exposure to sunlight affects the type of metabolites extracted. These results confirm that the most optimal condition for obtaining as many metabolites as possible from akar kuning is in conditions not at all exposed to light.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"In harmonic approximation, the vibrationally resolved S-1 <-> S-0 electronic absorption and emission spectra of 7,8-benzoquinoline were simulated using the Franck-Condon approximation including the Herzberg-Teller and Duschinsky effects, and the results reproduced the experimental spectra very well. Our calculations show that the Herzberg-Teller effect and the Duschinsky mixing play key role in simulating correctly the weak or forbidden transition like the S-1 <-> S-0 bands of 7,8-benzoquinoline, especially the former. Based on the present theoretical results, we tentatively assigned a few bands which were not unambiguously marked in the experimental spectra. Comparing the vibrationally resolved electronic spectra of 7,8-benzoquinoline with that of phenanthrene simulated in the previous study, the increased vibronic activity of 7,8-benzoquinoline is due to the symmetry break, which is caused by the introduction of N-heteroatom into the aromatic ring of phenanthrene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"Low-dimensional materials cleaved from their high performance topological-insulators-property bulk counterparts are attractive to be investigated. Here, the researched X2Te3 (X = Sb, Bi) single layer materials and their thermodynamical stabilities are proved through our calculations. The indirect band gaps pulse with the high carrier mobilities are also discussed based on first-principle calculations. On basis of the calculation, the low cleavage energies are about 0.34 Jm(-2) that is comparable with that of graphite, which imply a high possibility to obtain the single layer from exfoliating bulk counterpart. Band gaps are simulated as between 0.65 and 1.31 eV using different functionals, moreover, the band structures with and without SOC effect are all considered. The SOC effect results certify that X2Te3 monolayers are different from their bulk counterparts, they are not topological insulators. The largest electron mobility selected in their impressive carrier mobilites is 27.91 x 10(3) cm(2)V(-1)S(-1) that bears comparison to that of silicene. Moreover, the mechanical properties include Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio are studied too. Meanwhile, the biaxial strain can effectively modify the band gaps. Finally, outstanding visible and near-infrared light absorption abilities mainly from similar to 400 to around 1400 nm may guide single layer X2Te3 to a promises applications in photovoltaics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33,"Detection of small metabolites is essential for monitoring and optimizing biological gas conversion. Currently, such detection is typically done by liquid chromatography with offline sampling. However, this method often requires large equipment with multiple separation columns and is at risk of serious microbial contamination during sampling. Here we propose real-time optical detection of small metabolites using uniform plasmonic nanoparticles monolayers produced by capillary-assisted transfer. We reproducibly fabricate metal nanoparticles monolayers with a diameter of similar to 1 mm for the detection of acetate, butyrate, and glucose by a glass capillary tube. Metal nanoparticles monolayers are not only uniform in terms of average interparticle distance but also structurally stable under dynamic fluidic conditions. The monolayers resistant to fluid shear stress with surface-enhanced Raman scattering are able to reversibly monitor the concentration of acetate and sensitively detect acetate and glucose at levels as low as 10 mu M, which is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration range of typical biological gas conversion. In addition, structurally similar metabolites such as acetate and butyrate, when mixed, become distinguishable by our method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

37,"When external stimuli are applied on a ferroic material, an ordered microstructure with crystallographic deformations (twins) is formed within the initially homogeneous crystal. However, when the crystal twins are formed during the crystallization, their integrated effect on the crystal properties is poorly examined. This work reveals a mild hydrothermal synthesis of euhedral ferroelastic crystals of sodium germanium titanate (Na2TiGeO5) with ordered twin patterns that can be selectively manipulated with an adaptive beam of light. Within the idiomorphic crystals, a regular circuit of translucency adjustable sectors detached by the combination of permanent and switchable interfaces embedded in equivalent facets is found. The crystals also reveal a rare combination of chemically equivalent segments with contrasting refractive indexes. Finally, by simple fracturing of the crystals, a microstructural reorientation under ambient conditions is achieved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The solid-phase photocatalytic degradation of polyaniline/titanium dioxide (TiO2) composites was compared with that of the pure polyaniline with the aid of weight loss measurements. The structural and morphological properties of the prepared samples were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and X?ray diffraction analysis. The loading of TiO2 nanoparticles in polyaniline enhanced the solid-phase photocatalytic degradation of the pure polymer both under UVA light and under UVC light, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy illustrated that Pani was synthesised successfully in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles. Field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed homogeneous TiO2 dispersion within Pani matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis supported the idea that the thermal property of the pure polymer was improved with the photocatalyst contribution.

We study the propagation of a CW green laser beam through the waveguide structure as a function of beam polarization, laser intensity and sample temperature. It turns out that the plasmonic field created at the interface between AuNPs and POLICRYPS waveguides enables and stabilizes the optical field propagation within the responsive nematic liquid crystal channels. The active role of the liquid crystal is pointed out by a polarization, temperature and beam divergence experimental analysis and evidenced by a peculiar trumpet-shaped discrete diffraction pattern.

Three-coordinated gold(I) complexes of the type (R3P)(2)(AuX)-X-I (1) can be synthesized, whereas the analogous isocyanide complexes (RNC)(2)(AuX)-X-I (2) are not experimentally known. The molecular structures of (R3P)(2)(AuX)-X-I (X = Cl, Br, and I) and (RNC)(2)(AuX)-X-I with X = halide, cyanide, nitrite, methylthiolate, and thiocyanate are compared and structural differences are discussed. Calculations of molecular properties elucidate which factors determine the strength of the gold-ligand interactions in (RNC)(2)(AuX)-X-I. The linear bonding mode of RNC favors a T-shaped geometry instead of the planar Y-shaped trigonal structure of (R3P)(2)(AuX)-X-I complexes that have been synthesized. An increased polarity of the Au-X bond in 2 leads to destabilization of the Y-shaped structure. Chalcogen-containing ligands or cyanide appear to be good X-ligand candidates for synthesis of (RNC)(2)(AuX)-X-I complexes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that, with increasing conditioning time, the residual concentration (frother concentration) and froth height decreased simultaneously, while the adsorbed amount (particle hydrophobicity) increased. Increasing CTAC conditioning time decreased the residual concentration in solutions, resulting in poor froth stability and flotation recovery at high pH; the adsorption rate of CTAC on illite surface was relatively high at higher pH due to strong electrostatic mechanism, making CTAC residual concentration decrease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"As transthyretin (TTR) can prevent A? aggregation, a key protein in Alzheimer disease (AD), we developed a novel nanovector based on single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) functionalized by TTR. The retention factors (k) of the binding of grafted TTR on SWCNT (abbreviated gTTR) to HSPG were determined using an immobilized HSPG stationary phase. The negative values of the thermodynamic data demonstrated that van der Waals and hydrogen bonds played a major role in the binding at all pHs value. This binding was maximal at acidic conditions due to ionic interactions between the protonated His of gTTR with the negatively charged sulfate groups of HSPG. The weaker binding to HSPG for gTTR (k?=?3.70 at pH = 4.00 and 37??C) than free TTR (abbreviated fTTR) (k?=?11.80 at pH = 4.00 and 37??C) observed at acidic pHs was explained by the least facility of the His residue to be protonated when TTR was grafted on carbon nanotube. The nanovectorization of TTR with SWCNT thus stabilized the TTR tetramer structure and decreased the amyloid formation of TTR. Fibril formation of fTTR and gTTR studied by turbidity confirmed the fact that immobilization of TTR on SWCNTs decreased the extent and rate of amyloid fibril formation relative to free TTR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A theoretical analysis is performed and referred to compute the optimum dimensions of the atomizer and a detailed numerical and experimental investigation is presented. Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to model and simulate the flow of solvent through the atomizers in order to determine the most important parameters like the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of the droplets, Turbulent Dissipation Rate, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and the exit velocity through the atomizer. Ultrafine RDX explosive is recrystallized with a mean particle size of 4.99 mu m and a standard deviation of 1.35 mu m. The experimental process performed using the fabricated atomizer is a laboratory scale table-top pilot plant which is simple, cost-effective, and safe.

48,"Joule-heated electrodes have been used to enhance electrochemical analysis. Due to such direct heating, a steep temperature gradient is created near the electrode surface. The heating device that provides the high-frequency AC (50 kHz or more) has to be calibrated, in order to apply the desired temperature during analysis. The applied temperature of the working electrode influences both its electrical resistance and the electrochemical potential of a redox couple. Open circuit potentiometric (OCP) measurements were performed automatically with screen-printed gold loop electrodes (Au-LE), while applying 50 kHz AC heating pulses of increasing intensity provided by a ThermaLab (R) AC generator. Potentiometric temperature calibrations were performed using 5 mM equimolar ferri/ferrocyanide in 0.1 M of potassium chloride at 20 degrees C bulk temperature. Potential differences produced during each heat pulse were used to automatically calculate the electrode temperature using the temperature coefficient of this redox couple (-1.6 mV/K). The electrode resistance values at each heating pulse were obtained by measuring the heating voltage and heating current. The automatic temperature calibration experiments with five AuLEs were shown to be highly reproducible and precise, with an RSD for the temperature of 0.24% and 4% for resistance. The average margin error of OCP temperatures were +/- 0.66 K at a 95% confidence level. The temperature coefficient (alpha) of electrical resistivity of the screen-printed gold layers was found to be 0.0025 degrees C-1, which is 27% lower than the theoretical value for gold metal. These findings were confirmed by DC resistance measurements using a potentiostat. Comparing the OCP temperature with the resistivity method, the temperature difference was about 0.94 degrees C (2.8%). Both methods enable quick, reproducible and accurate temperature calibration for disposable Au-LE, which were also used for trace mercury detection in lake water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

With this method, the pre-processing step is greatly simplified and there is minimal consumption of organic solvents. Further, the method is simple, convenient, and accurate, and it is suitable for the determination of 2,4-diaminotoluene in Mianpi composite packaging film bags.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,"Clinical laboratory regulations require temperature monitoring of facilities, reagent and specimen storage, as well as temperature-dependent equipment. Real-time specimen temperature detection has not yet been integrated into total laboratory automation (TLA) solutions. An infrared (IR) pyrometer was paired with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) laser sensor and connected to an embedded networked personal computer (PC) to create a modular temperature detection unit for closed, moving clinical laboratory specimens. Accuracy of the detector was assessed by comparing temperature measurements to those obtained from thermocouples connected to battery-operated data loggers. The temperature detector was then installed on a pre-analytic laboratory automation system to assess specimen temperature before and after processing on an integrated thawing and mixing (T/M) robotic workcell. The IR temperature detector was able to accurately record temperature of closed, moving specimens on a pre-analytic automation system. The effectiveness of the T/M workcell was independently verified using the temperature detector. Specimen reroute on the pre-analytic automation track was identified as a potential risk for frozen specimens being inadvertently delivered to future, connected instrumentation. Automated IR temperature detection can be used to verify specimen temperature prior to instrument loading and/or sampling. Such systems could be used to prevent frozen specimens from being inadvertently loaded onto analytical instrumentation in TLA solutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,"A hemagglutinin stabilized stem nanoparticle (HA-SS-np) that is designed to provide broad protection against influenza is being developed as a potential vaccine. During an early formulation screening study, reducing gel (rCGE) analysis indicated product degradation in a few candidate buffers at the first-week accelerated stability point, whereas no change was shown in the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) measurement. A LC-MS workflow was therefore applied to investigate the integrity of this large HA-SS-np vaccine molecule (approximate to 1 MDa). Application of LC-MS was critical to rationalize the conflicting results from the rCGE and SEC assays and led to the discovery that (1) an unexpected sequence clipping in the HA-SS-np subunits occurred, explaining the atypical reducing gel profile, and (2) an undisrupted disulfide bond held the two fragments together, explaining the unchanged SEC profile. This analytical case study led to a formulation buffer redesign, which mitigated the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,"A method was developed for the simultaneous quantitative and confirmatory determination of 3-methylquinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (MQCA) residues in pork by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The sample was hydrolyzed with 0.3 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution, and MQCA was extracted by water bath oscillation. MQCA was first extracted with acetonitrile and ethyl acetate and then re-extracted from the extraction solution with 0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution. Then MQCA was purified by an anion exchange solid phase extraction column. The chromatographic separation was performed using an Agilent Eclipse Plus C18 column (50 mmx3.0 mm, 1.8 mu m). The quantitative analysis was performed by the matrix matching addition method. The correlation coefficient of MQCA in the range of 1.0 - 50 mu g/L was greater than 0.99. The recovery was 90.5% - 119.6% at the spiked levels of 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mu g/kg, and the relative standard deviation was 3.14% - 4.22%.

64,"An analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was developed for detecting chlorate and perchlorate residues in milk power. Chlorate and perchlorate in milk power were extracted using a 0.1% (v/v) formic acid-acetonitrile solution. The extract was centrifuged at 10 000 r/min for 10 min, and the supernatant was cleaned up on a PRiME HLB column. Separation of chlorate and perchlorate was performed on an ion-exchange column (Thermo Scientific Acclaim TRINITY P1, 50 mmx2.1 mm, 3 mu m) by gradient elution using acetonitrile and 20 mmol/L ammonium acetate solution as the mobile phase. The analytes were identified by MS/MS. Quantification was achieved using internal standards. Chlorate and perchlorate demonstrated good linearity in the ranges of 2.0 - 40.0 and 1.0 - 20.0 mu g/L, respectively, with correlation coefficients (r(2)) greater than 0.999. The limits of quantification (LOQs) of chlorate and perchlorate were found to be 15.0 and 7.5 mu g/kg, respectively. The recoveries of chlorate and perchlorate ranged from 89.24% to 107.85% at the three spike levels of 30.0, 60.0, and 120.0, and 15.0, 30.0, and 60.0 mu g/kg, respectively, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranging from 3.15% to 10.42% (n = 6).

66,"Depurination occurs via hydrolysis of the purine-deoxyribose glycosyl bond and causes nucleic acid damage. In particular, the DNA sequences that can undergo a self-catalyzed depurination (SCD) will cause a great uncertainty in duplicating, separating, purifying, and storing the DNA samples. Therefore, there is a great demand to develop a rapid detection method for SCD events. Herein, the use of a convenient fluorescence method to follow the site-specific SCD was demonstrated. We found that the resultant apurine site (AP site) from depurination can be selectively recognized by a fluorescent probe of palmatine (PAL) with a turn-on fluorescence response. The dependence of SCD on the bases of the depurination site, pH, metal ions, and time shows that our method can be used to rapidly evaluate the depurination process. Furthermore, the depurination process can be photo-switched using a photoacid as an external initiator. Our work will find wide applications in preliminarily identifying the DNA depurination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,"2-Bromo-4,6-dinitroaniline (BNA) is identified as a domestic-dust pollutant in urban environments, with deleterious atmospheric effects. In the present work, we studied the reaction pathways and kinetics for BNA oxidation by the OH radical using quantum-chemical methods and canonical-variational transition-state theory with small-curvature tunneling correction (CVT/SCT). OH-radial-mediated BNA oxidation was studied by considering OH addition to carbon atoms (C1 to C6) of BNA and H-atom abstraction at the -NH2 group and carbon atoms (C3 and C5) of BNA by OH radicals. It is observed that an OH-addition reaction is energetically more favorable. In addition, the rate constant was calculated for the favorable initial OH-addition reactions over the temperature range of 278 to 1000 K. The subsequent reactions for the favorable BNA-OH adduct intermediate with O-2, HO2 and NO radicals are studied. We have identified the following possible end products from this BNA-oxidation reaction: (i) 2-amino-3-bromo-6-hydroperoxy-5-methyl-1-nitro-cyclohexa-2,4 dienol, (ii) 2-amino-1-bromo-6-hydroperoxy-5-methyl-3-nitro-cyclohexa-2,4-dienol, (iii) 2-amino-1-bromo-6-hydroperoxy-5-methyl-3-nitro-cyclohexa-2,4-dienol, (iv) 3-amino-4-bromo-4-hydroperoxy-8-methyl-2-nitro-6,7-dioxa-bicyclo oct-2-en-8-ol, (v) 2-amino-1-bromo-6-hydroperoxy-5-methyl-3-nitro-cyclohexa-2,4-dienol, and (vi) 3-amino-2-bromo-8-methyl-4-nitro-6,7-dioxa-bicyclo oct-3-ene-2,8-diol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"Microtubules (MTs) experience an effect called ""catastrophe,"" which is the transition from the MT growth to a sudden dramatic shrinkage in length. The straight guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-tubulin cap at the filament tip and the intrinsic curvature of guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-tubulins are known to be the key thermodynamic factors that determine MT catastrophe, while the hydrolysis of this GTP-cap acts as the kinetic control of the process. Although several theoretical models have been developed, assuming the catastrophe occurs when the GTP-cap shrinks to a minimal stabilizing size, the structural effect of the GTP-cap and GDP-curvature is not explicitly included; thus, their influence on catastrophe kinetics remains less understood. To investigate this structural effect, we apply a single-protofilament model with one GTP-cap while assuming a random hydrolysis mechanism and take the occurrence of a crack in the lateral bonds between neighboring protofilaments as the onset of the catastrophe. Therein, we find the effective potential of the tip along the peel-off direction and formulate the catastrophe kinetics as a mean first-passage time problem, subject to thermal fluctuations. We consider cases with and without a compressive force on the MT tip, both of which give a quadratic effective potential, making MT catastrophe an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in our formalism. In the free-standing case, the mean catastrophe time has a sensitive tubulin-concentration dependence, similar to a double-exponential function, and agrees well with the experiment. For a compressed MT, we find a modified exponential function of force that shortens the catastrophe time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"In the present study, we designed tetrahedral tetraarylborate pentads which were synthesized by a typical click reaction, copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cyclization. The synthesis of the borate pentads was confirmed by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopies, and NMR measurements indicated a rapid exchange of bound and unbound counter cations. The obtained borate pentads exhibited a representative behavior of weak electrolytes, and thus a decrease of their concentration caused a rapid increase of their molar conductivity, especially at the limit of dilution. Additionally, the observed association constant did not correspond to the theoretical association constant, probably because of the multivalent ionic dissociation dependent on the dielectric constant of the media.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"The correlation between P-glycoprotein (Pgp) overexpression and multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer is well-established. Recently, we identified (2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-quinolinyl) (2-piperidinyl)methanol (5) (NSC23925) as the most selective and potent MDR inhibitor. NSC23925 binds to Pgp, thus inhibiting its transporter function and reversing MDR in cancer cells. In order to further characterize the chemical properties and Pgp binding mode of the NSC23925 compound, we grew four NSC23925 crystal isomers (NSC23925a, NSC23925b, NSC23925c, and NSC23925d). These crystal isomers were first generated using a vapor diffusion growth technique before their precise structures were analyzed using X-ray crystal-lography. Functionally, the NSC23925a and NSC23925b isomers share a similar stabilization interaction of Cl- mediated hydrogen bonding. In contrast, in isomer NSC23925c, two Cl- are involved in the stabilization of adjacent molecules. In summary, these solved crystal structures may reveal the different activities of the four NSC23925 stereoisomers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"Density-functional theory was applied to the investigation of the structural and electronic properties of C-24 fullerene derivatives. Transition metals (TMs) from groups 11 and 12, in various oxidation and spin-states, are inserted at either endohedral (TM@C-24) or exohedral (TM-C-24) sites and their subsequent energetic stabilities are assessed. With the exception of Ag@C-24, all derivatives are predicted to occupy a minimum on the potential energy surface. The optimized exohedral TM-C-24 geometries yield TM-C bond lengths that are consistent with comparable carbon-metal bond lengths, and the overwhelming majority of the derivatives result in a slight deformation of the C-24 cage as the bonding carbon takes on more sp(3) character. All of the TM@C-24 equilibrium structures maintain the integrity of the cage structure with a moderate increase in the diameter. All neutral exohedral and endohedral complexes favor the low spin-state; conversely, all of the charged exohedral complexes prefer the high spin-state, with the exception of Cu-C-24(1+) molecular ion. The Group 12 charged endohedral derivatives prefer the low spin-state, whereas the Group 11 molecular ions do not necessarily exhibit a definitive trend. Analysis of the energetic data predicts that of the lowest energy endohedral molecular species only four are predicted to be energetically favorable in terms of insertion energy and an advantageous HOMO-LUMO gap: Cu@C-24(2+), Ag@C-24(1+), Au@C-24(3+), and Zn@C-24(2+).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"For the first time, the synthesis of 9-(pyrid-2-yl)indolizine-1 -one from dipyridylpropargyl alcohol together with its molecular structure is reported. As the racemate was used for crystallization, the asymmetric unit contains both enantiomers.

73,"Lipid domains have been obtained using Langmuir-Blodgett films (LBs) and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Three membranes compositions were chosen, the canonical DOPC: DOPS (3:2)/SM/CHOL (1:1:1), the more physiological one: DOPC: DOPS (3:2)/SM/CHOL (2:1:1) and another one with more phospholipid content: DOPC: DOPS (3:2)/SM/CHOL (3:1:1). All systems were well characterized by pi-A isotherms. As the (SM/CHOL (1:1:1)) concentration increases, the membrane fluidity decreases as demonstrated by the compressibility modulus and area per molecule values. Lipid domains morphology was examined by confocal microscopy. Images corroborated the presence of two liquid immiscible phases: a phospholipid-enriched L-d phase and a sphingomyelin enriched L-o phase. GBV-C peptide membrane interaction was examined using P6-2VIR576 peptide and tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence spectroscopy.

75,"Woven fabrics commonly referred to as ?aerocotton? and ?aerolinen? are frequently used in the conservation of books and manuscripts and are valued for their strength and flexibility. Although textiles have a long history in the production and repair of books, aerocottons and aerolinens are relatively recent materials adopted from early aircraft production. In 2007, the main supplier of these woven fabrics to the UK conservation community ceased production, and new producers started supplying a range of woven fabrics under the labels of ?aerocotton? and ?aerolinen?. Understanding the strength, composition, and longevity of repair materials is central to conservation practice and this investigation tested two linens and two cottons alongside the discontinued cotton to quantify the relative strengths of the fabrics. Each fabric was tested before and after laundering, and in three directions (warp, weft, and bias). The tests conducted measured mass per unit area, thickness, sett, tensile strength, folding endurance, and dimensional change. In tensile strength tests the bias-cut fabrics were weakest but extended the most, whilst those cut in the weft direction were strongest. The cottons lasted longest in terms of folding endurance and the samples cut on the bias were the fastest to break. The dimensional change tests showed that washing affected the linens more than the cottons and that across all fabrics there was a greater amount of shrinkage in the warp direction. It is hoped that these results will provide concrete information to guide conservators in the preparation and use of aerocottons and aerolinens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

77,"The growing role of fatty acid amides in medicinal chemistry has recently been observed. Therefore, using simple and fast methods, a series of chiral amide derivatives (24 compounds) of ricinoleic and 3-hydroxynonanoic acid was obtained with 31-95% yields. Then, the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity against 13 microorganisms representing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and molds was performed. The obtained compounds showed antimold potential; however, the tested species of molds were more susceptible to derivatives of 3-hydroxynonanoic acid than to amides obtained from ricinoleic acid (RA). Interestingly, hydroxamic acids derived from RA exhibited the best activity against Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. On the other hand, hydroxamic acids derived from 3-hydroxynonanoic acid showed the best antimicrobial potential against the remaining tested microorganisms, especially against Pseudomonas cedrina. The obtained derivatives can be considered compounds of potential pharmacological significance, which is important due to the increasing problem of microbial resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"The paper presents the risk assessment methodology for the critical group members (infants and adults) as a result of the radioactive effluents releasing, during VVR-S nuclear research reactor decommissioning process. The derived emission limits of the effluents were established using the transport model in the environment in order to comply with dose constraints assigned by the regulatory body for public members. Doses were estimated taking into account the age, weight, metabolism and nutrition habits of an individual, based on the dose constraint of 50 mu Sv/year. The gaseous effluents activities were much lower than the liquids effluents activities. Consequently, for dose calculation a dose constraint of 10 mu Sv/year were assigned for gaseous and 40 mu Sv/year for liquid. Doses received are consistent with the dose constraint for gaseous effluents. On the contrary, the dose received are non-consistent for liquid effluents. For both cases the most restrictive dose values were for the adults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,"The incorporation of a nitrate ion into silver-water aqueous clusters has been examined using PBEO density functional theory with the solvent model density (SMD) solvation model. The Gibbs free energy of solvation and other thermodynamic variables are calculated using the harmonic/rigid rotor/ideal gas model at 298.15 K for aqueous solutes including the effects of solute relaxation in water and with London dispersive forces at the D3 level. Free energies of solvation for Ag+ and NO3- were found to agree well with experimental values of -118.2 and -60.1 kcal/mol, respectively, calculated using cluster-continuum models with six to eight water molecules and including solute relaxation and London D3 dispersive interactions. An analysis of data of varying cluster size upon calculated free energy is presented. A direct procedure is applied to aqueous clusters such as Ag-n(z)(NO3-)(H2O)(5), Ag-n(z)(H2O)(5), and (NO3-)(H2O)(6) n = 1-4; z = 0, +1 in the SMD solvent representation to calculate equilibrium constants for nitrate association with silver clusters in solution that includes fully relaxed solutes. The equilibrium structures of the nitrate-containing clusters involve one or more bonds from nitrate oxygen to positive silver clusters. Water molecules interact with nitrate through H atoms, and overall, the structure represents a silver nitrate cluster with water ligands having similarity to a close ion pair in many aspects. The neutral silver atom is attached to nitrate through H-bonded water molecules. The ratio of nitrate-containing silver clusters to nitrate-free clusters using a calculated equilibrium constant of 0.51 L/mol for Ag+ is small in the range of many experiments. Similar values are found for positive silver clusters up to four atoms in size. The resulting procedures were applied to aqueous clusters of Ag-n(NO3)(m)(+(n-m)) that have been previously experimentally studied for silver reduction in aqueous solution. A chain-like structure with collinear and bidentate oxygen bonds to silver was found, and the equilibrium constants for clustering were determined. A simplified model calculation for the reduction of Ag(H2O)(6) (+) clusters in the presence of silver clusters in aqueous media was studied to understand catalytic effects observed in these systems. The reduction potentials vary with silver cluster size indicating a more favorable reduction caused by the presence of larger silver clusters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While collaborations between chemists and museum workers in charge of easel painting collections were mostly oriented towards the improvement of conservation practices, the involvement of chemists in the nascent field of archaeology was oriented towards material characterization, such as pigment analysis of polychrome surfaces. Since this type of analysis is destructive and damages the artwork, it could, therefore, be assumed that chemists were in these cases less concerned with the conservation of objects with an archaeological and historical provenance. On the contrary, my new reading of nineteenth-century English primary sources reporting pigment analysis shows that chemists also had ethical concerns about the physical integrity of archaeological objects and their conservation.

83,"The anharmonic frequencies of O-H, C-H, and N-H stretching modes of hydrogen-bonded glycine-H2O complexes are calculated using ab initio classical separable potential approximation. In this approach, ab initio molecular 3 dynamic simulations are used to determine an effective classical potential for each of the normal modes of the system. The frequencies are calculated by solving the time-independent Schrodinger equation for each mode using time-averaged potentials. Three complex structures are studied, which differ in the location of the water molecule on the amino acid. Significant differences are found between the spectra of the three structures, and signatures of individual complexes are established. It is demonstrated that anharmonic effects are essential in the discrimination between different structures, while frequency differences at the harmonic level are much smaller. Intensities are also computed and found to carry information on differences between structures, but the role of anharmonicity in this is small.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"Soot is an important anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosol that forms atmospheric smog. The atmospheric presence of smog raises great concerns to human health. Soot also absorbs visible light from solar radiation, likely contributing to the climate change.

To make the simulation more similar to real soot aerosols, two major submodels were integrated, which involved their core-shell structures and their fractal agglomerate structures. Four kinds of shell materials, including nonabsorbing (water, sulfuric acid, salt) and weak-absorbing (brown carbon) materials, were studied in their different shell thicknesses. The effects of the shell on the absorption enhancement of the bare soot particles and the dependence of absorption on the light wavelength were revealed. The brown carbon shell was found to exhibit greater absorption enhancement, and its absorption was doubled at 360 nm compared to that at 800 nm.

85,"Two high nuclearity uranyl cages were crystallized in high yield under mild solvothermal conditions using rigid aryl phosphonate ligands. These compounds are prepared either through an in situ phosphonate ligand condensation reaction or via serendipitous assembly with a bulky phosphonate ligand.

86,"The subaperture processing is one of the essential strategies for low frequency ultrawideband synthetic aperture radar (LF UWB SAR) imaging, especially for the real-time LF UWB SAR imaging because it can improve the parallelization of the imaging algorithm. However, due to the longer synthetic aperture of LF UWB SAR, the traditional subaperture imaging encounters an azimuth ambiguities problem, which severely degrades the focused quality of the imaging results. In this paper, the reason for the presence of azimuth ambiguities in the LF UWB SAR subaperture imaging and its influence on image quality is first analyzed in theory. Then, an extended subaperture imaging method based on the extension of subaperture length before Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) was proposed. By lengthening the subaperture length, the azimuth ambiguities are effectively eliminated. Finally, the extended part of subaperture is wiped off before the azimuth compression (AC), and the LF UWB SAR image of high focused quality is obtained. The correctness of the theory analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method have been validated through simulated and real LF UWB SAR data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"This paper proposes a novel architecture of a wearable Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based platform to dynamically monitor Muscle Fiber ConductionVelocity (MFCV). The system uses a set of wireless sensors for the detection of muscular activation: four surface electromyography electrodes (EMGs) and two footswitches. The beginning of movement (trigger) is set by sensors (footswitches) detecting the feet position. The MFCV value extraction exploits an iterative algorithm, which compares two 1-bit digitized EMG signals. The EMG electrode positioning is ensured by a dedicated procedure. The architecture is implemented on FPGA board (Altera Cyclone V), which manages an external Bluetooth module for data transmission. The time spent for data elaboration is 63.5 ms +/- 0.25 ms, matching real-time requirements. The FPGA-based MFCV estimator has been validated during regular walking and in the fatigue monitoring context. Six healthy subjects contributed to experimental validation. In the gait analysis, the subjects showed MFCV evaluation of about 7.6 m/s +/- 0.36 m/s, i.e., <0.1 m/s, a typical value for healthy subjects. Furthermore, in agreement with current research methods in the field, in a fatigue evaluation context, the extracted data showed an MFCV descending trend with the increment of the muscular effort time (Rested: MFCV = 8.51 m/s; Tired: 4.60 m/s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,"Synthetic procedures, based on integrated flow chemical methods, have been developed for the sequential chemo-selective Suzuki?Miyaura cross-coupling of 1,4-dibromo-2-nitrobenzene (1) with various arylboronic acids.

For such research, simulation is a powerful tool to quickly test algorithms, allowing to do more exhaustive tests before implementation in a real application. However, the transition from an initial simulation environment to a real application may imply substantial rework if early implementation results do not match the ones obtained by simulation, meaning the simulation was not accurate enough. One way to improve accuracy is to incorporate network and control strategies in the same simulation and to use a systematic procedure to assess how different techniques perform. In this paper, we propose a set of procedures called Integrated Robotic and Network Simulation Method (IRoNS Method), which guide developers in building a simulation study for cooperative robots and communication networks applications. We exemplify the use of the improved methodology in a case-study of cooperative control comparison with and without message losses. This case is simulated with the OMNET++/INET framework, using a group of robots in a rendezvous task with topology control. The methodology led to more realistic simulations while improving the results presentation and analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"Linear porphyrin oligomers have found various applications as synthetic molecular wires in the context of light harvesting, solar energy conversion and molecular electronics. In many of these applications a partial ordering of the molecules helps to improve the reaction efficiency or device performance. In this work we study the orientational properties of the building blocks of such porphyrin-based molecular wires, namely a porphyrin monomer and the corresponding butadiyne-bridged dimer. The porphyrins have been embedded in the nematic liquid crystal solvent 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) and the anisotropic properties of their photogenerated triplet states were characterised by transient electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. When aligned in strong magnetic fields, the liquid crystal molecules impose their orientational anisotropy onto the solute guest molecules whose orientation-dependent magnetic properties can then be explored. The line shape analysis of the porphyrin triplet state EPR spectra - highly sensitive to small conformational changes - confirms the orientation of the zero-field-splitting (ZFS) tensors previously determined for these molecules by magnetophotoselection experiments. A biaxial distribution function is shown to be necessary to simulate the experimental EPR data. The biaxial behaviour, in conjunction with symmetry considerations, allows an unambiguous assignment of the three ZFS tensor axes to the molecular axes. From the determined orientational distributions of the porphyrins in 5CB, the biaxial order parameters for both molecules were calculated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"Here we propose an online method to explore the multiway nature of urban spaces data for outlier detection based on higher-order singular value tensor decomposition. Our proposal has two sequential steps: (i) the offline modeling step, where we model the outliers detection problem as a system; and (ii) the online modeling step, where the projection distance of each data vector is decomposed by a multidimensional method as new data arrives and an outlier statistical index is calculated. We used real data gathered and streamed by urban sensors from three cities in Finland, chosen during a continuous time interval: Helsinki, Tuusula, and Lohja. The results showed greater efficiency for the online method of detection of outliers when compared to the offline approach, in terms of accuracy between a range of 8.5% to 10% gain. We observed that online detection of outliers from real-time monitoring through the sliding window becomes a more adequate approach once it achieves better accuracy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"Although cable-based seismic sensing systems have provided reliable data in the past several decades, they become a bottleneck for large-area monitoring and critical environmental (volcanic eruptions) sensing because of their cost, difficulty in deploying and expanding, and lack of accurate three-dimensional geographic information. In this paper, a new wireless sensing system is designed consisting of a portable satellite device, a self-sustaining power source, a low-cost computational core, and a high-precision sensor. The emphasis of this paper is to implement in low-cost hardware without requirements of highly specialized and expensive data acquisition instruments. Meanwhile, a computational-core-embedded algorithm based on compressive sensing (CS) is also developed to compress data size for transmission and encrypt the measured data preventing information loss. Seismic data captured by the accelerometer sensor are coded into compressive data packages and then transferred via satellite communication to a cloud-based server for storage. Acceleration and GPS information is decrypted by the `1-norm minimization optimization algorithm for further processing. In this research, the feasibility of the proposed sensing system for the acquisition of seismic testing is investigated in an outdoor field surface wave testing. Results indicate the proposed low-cost wireless sensing system has the capability of collecting ground motions, transferring data, and sharing GPS information via satellite communication for large area monitoring. In addition, it has a great potential of recovering measurements even with significant data package loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"In this paper, a symmetrical MIM tunnel junction diode with a novel material combination, vanadium-vanadium sequioxide-vanadium (V-V2O3-V) is fabricated and electrically characterized. Analysis of the measured current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the fabricated MIM diode revealed an ultra-high diode sensitivity of -9.24 V-1 at an applied bias of -0.104 V. Based on the measured I-V characteristics, theoretical predictions were performed showing that the diode's dynamic resistance can be tuned for matching to coupled antennas, in rectenna structures, whilst maintaining high levels of sensitivities using practically realizable V2O3 insulator thicknesses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"In this study, a novel vapor-liquid equilibrium equation has been presented based on a simple theory for pure substances. This equation shows a relation between the non-ideal behaviors of the saturated liquid and vapor phases of pure substances, which are in equilibrium with each other. The special shape of this relation lets us to calculate the equilibrium values of the temperature, pressure or molar volume of each one of these phases. Although the idea of this theory-based equation has been raised from investigation of equilibrium PVT values of water, the empirical values of 14 substances have been used for validating the accuracy of the predictions of this equation. This comparison confirms this accuracy with RMSEmean- = 0.0254.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"A highly sensitive and simple high-performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS-MS) assay was developed and validated for the quantification of N-acetyl tryptophan (NAT) in formulations and to identify impurities under different stress conditions. N-acetyl tryptophan was analyzed using a reversed-phase gradient elution after treatment under acidic, basic, oxidative, hydrolytic and thermal stress conditions. Linearity in the calibration curve was obtained at a concentration range of 10-100 mu gmL(-1) (R-2 = 0.9916). The lower limits of detection and quantification were 3.53 and 10.69 mu gmL(-1). The degradation of NAT was observed maximum under oxidation stress (52.84%) and minimum under thermal stress (10.22%). Three major degradation products were formed under acidic and basic stress conditions, of which tryptophan was the major one. Thermal stress yielded a single major impurity at m/z 230. Water hydrolysis could form dihydroxy-N acetyl tryptophan at m/z 279. Oxidation stress led to the formation of seven major degradation products. The most effective stress condition was found to be oxidative which leads to 52.84% degradation of the drug followed by acidic stress (34.64%) and basic stress (15.66%). The present study showed an accurate, precise and sensitive LC-MS-MS method for the systematic investigation of NAT and its impurities in formulations. Graphic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"Concentrations of Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ni and Cr have been estimated in sediments of the Shitalakhya River at Polash-Ghorashal area, Narsingdi, Bangladesh. 36 samples of sediments from nine sampling point at different locations of Shitalakhya River were collected to determine the concentration of Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr and the samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The obtained results were compared with national and international guidelines. The levels of heavy metal concentrations in sediments were found to decrease in the order of Fe > Mn > Zn > Ni > Cu > Cr, respectively. The heavy metal concentration in sediment of Shitalakhya was below the recommended safe limits of heavy metals by WHO, FAO and other international standards. Contamination factor (CF) of Zn and Cu at sampling point Fsd2 show higher (> 1) values due to the influence of external discrete sources like wastage catalysts of ZnO and CuO. Geo-accumulation index values of the study indicate as non-contaminated to moderately contaminate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"The solid state structures of the hexaamine cage complexes [M(Me(8)tricosane)](2+) (M = Zn, Cd, Hg) were previously shown to feature highly symmetric octahedral or trigonal prismatic coordination geometries. Here we show that the solution NMR spectra of each of these three complexes are far more complex than what would be expected if the solid state structures were retained after dissolution. The large numbers of resonances observed in the solution NMR spectra reflects establishment of equilibria involving multiple diastereoisomers with different nitrogen atom configurations. Support for this explanation was provided by the N-15 HSQC spectrum of the Zn complex, and by variable temperature H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra of each of the three metal complexes. In addition, the results of calculations performed using DFT methods showed that the differences in energy between diastereoisomers were sometimes very small, and therefore unlikely to present a significant barrier to isomerisation processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"Inorganic and organic routes were used to synthesize nanosized K-LTL zeolite. The role of synthesis route on the physico-chemical characteristics of synthesized materials was investigated using elemental analysis, powder x-ray diffraction, Raman spectral analysis, SEM, TEM, nitrogen-physisorption, MAS NMR and CO2-temperature programed desorption techniques. It was observed that K-LTL-org material composed of highly dispersed LTL nanocrystals, in contrast K-LTL-inorg sample showed highly agglomerated nanosized LTL particles because of high alkaline nature of Si, Al and K precursors used in the inorganic route. Additionally, material synthesized by organic route possessed large specific surface area with broad pore size (radius of 225 angstrom), and also high density of strong basic sites. Due to these properties, K-LTL-org sample showed superior performance in catalytic transesterification of glyceryl tributyrate compared to K-LTL -inorg sample. Also, the K-LTL-org catalyst showed excellent stability under applied reaction conditions and exhibited outstanding recyclability for (five cycles) without considerable loss of activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
