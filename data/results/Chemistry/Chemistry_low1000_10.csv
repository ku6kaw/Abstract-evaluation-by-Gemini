To this goal, laminated composite samples with a distinct number of layers were bonded using ultrasonic consolidation. Then, tensile and biaxial hydraulic bulge tests at different strain rates and temperature conditions were conducted. The effect of the sample orientation on the mechanical response was also examined. Tensile and hydraulic bulge tests results were compared to observe differences in ultimate tensile strength and strain levels under uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. The effects of loading condition, strain rate, and temperature on the material response were analyzed and discussed on the basis of test results. In general, it was concluded that the maximum elongation values attained were higher for the samples subtracted along the sonotrode movement direction compared to those obtained from the normal to sonotrode movement direction. The elongation was obtained as high as 46% for seven bi-layered samples at high-temperature ranges of 200-300 degrees C. Hydraulic bulge test results showed that elongation improved as the number of bi-layers increased, yet the ultimate strength values did not change significantly indicating an expansion of the formability window.",10.3390/ma12203402,3,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no

The tetraoxazocane ring adopts a boat-chair conformation in the crystalline state, which is due to intramolecular interactions. Conformational analysis of the tetraoxazocane fragment performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, 2p) level of theory showed that there are three minima on the potential energy surface, one of which corresponds to the conformation realized in the solid state, but not to a global minimum. Analysis of the geometry and the topological parameters of the electron density at the (3,-1) bond critical points (BCPs), and the charge transfer in the tetraoxazocane ring indicated that there are stereoelectronic effects in the O-C-O and N-C-O fragments. There is a two-cross hyperconjugation in the N-C-O fragment between the lone electron pair of the N atom (lpN) and the antibonding orbital of a C-O bond (sigma*(C-O)) and vice versa between lpO and sigma*(C-N). The oxazole substituent has a considerable effect on the geometry and the topological parameters of the electron density at the (3,-1) BCPs of the tetraoxazocane ring. The crystal structure is stabilized via intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot N and C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds, which is unambiguously confirmed with PIXEL calculations, a quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) topological analysis of the electron density at the (3,-1) BCPs and a Hirshfeld analysis of the electrostatic potential. The molecules form zigzag chains in the crystal due to intermolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot N interactions being electrostatic in origin. The molecules are further stacked due to C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds.

J,"Kim, B; Cho, S",Hyperspectral Super-Resolution Technique Using Histogram Matching and Endmember Optimization,"In most hyperspectral super-resolution (HSR) methods, which are techniques used to improve the resolution of hyperspectral images (HSIs), the HSI and the target RGB image are assumed to have identical fields of view. However, because implementing these identical fields of view is difficult in practical applications, in this paper, we propose a HSR method that is applicable when an HSI and a target RGB image have different spatial information. The proposed HSR method first creates a low-resolution RGB image from a given HSI. Next, a histogram matching is performed on a high-resolution RGB image and a low-resolution RGB image obtained from an HSI. Finally, the proposed method optimizes endmember abundance of the high-resolution HSI towards the histogram-matched high-resolution RGB image. The entire procedure is evaluated using an open HSI dataset, the Harvard dataset, by adding spatial mismatch to the dataset. The spatial mismatch is implemented by shear transformation and cutting off the upper and left sides of the target RGB image. The proposed method achieved a lower error rate across the entire dataset, confirming its capability for super-resolution using images that have different fields of view.",10.3390/app9204444,9,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,

Therefore, as a new method of applying powders, we tried to evaluate the potential of a chamber method for the development of latent fingerprint using fans in a closed chamber with a fixed capacity that can prevent the powders from being blown outside and exposed to the users, by comparing with the development results of the conventional brush method. Fingerprints on glass and plastic (PET) were extracted with black powder and green fluorescent powder, and the sharpness and minutiae of the developed fingerprints were compared for each method. The results of the black powder showed similar results, but the effect of the chamber method was slightly decreased when the green fluorescent powder was used. In order to improve the development with the green fluorescent powder, the mixture (50 : 50) of the fluorescent powder with the silica gel was tested and the results were similar to those of the brush method.

The transistors' electrostatic was analyzed using a 3D TCAD simulation. We firstly optimized physical parameters such as channel radius and thickness. The NP-FETs for 3.5 nm node had better gate controllability due to smaller channel thickness and therefore showed an advantage in subthreshold swing (S.S.). However, parasitic resistance and capacitance, and low bias condition of scaled device lowered on-current level. These problems of smaller device were also related to limitation of RC-delay performance. Accordingly, the scaled device with optimized physical parameters showed similar to 1% decrease in delay performance compared to 5 nm node device. In order to improve RC-delay performance, trenched contact method and channel strain engineering method were separately applied for the same device. For each engineering technique, the on-current boosting was successful, showing similar to 14% faster RC-delay performance with strain engineering and similar to 18% faster RC-delay with trenched contact method.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17108,11,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Kim, K; Choi, SH; Lee, S; Kim, W",Size measurement and characterization of ceria nanoparticles using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF),"As the size of semiconductors becomes smaller, it is necessary to perform high precision polishing of nanoscale. Ceria, which is generally used as an abrasive, is widely used because of its uniform quality, but its stability is not high because it has a high molecular weight and causes agglomeration and rapid precipitation. Such agglomeration and precipitation causes scratches in the polishing process. Therefore, it is important to accurately analyze the size distribution of ceria particles. In this study, a study was conducted to select dispersants useful for preventing coagulation and sedimentation of ceria. First, a dispersant was synthesized and a ceria slurry was prepared. The defoamer selection experiment was performed in order to remove the air bubbles which may occur in the production of ceria slurry. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF) were used to determine the size distribution of ceria particles in the slurry. AsFlFFF is a technique for separating nanoparticles based on sequential elution of samples as in chromatography, and is a useful technique for determining the particle size distribution of nanoparticle samples. AsFlFFF was able to confirm the presence of a little quantities of large particles in the vicinity of 300 nm, which DLS can not detect, besides the main distribution in the range of 60-80 nm.

To elucidate the structural basis of the EOLA1 function, we determined its crystal structure at 1.71 angstrom resolution and found that EOLA1 is structurally similar to an activating signal cointegrator-1 homology (ASCH) domain with a characteristic beta -barrel fold surrounded by alpha -helices. Despite its low sequence identity with other ASCH domains, EOLA1 retains a conserved 'GxKxxExR' motif in its cavity structure. The cavity harbors aromatic and polar residues, which are speculated to accommodate nucleotide molecules as do YT521-B homology (YTH) proteins. Additionally, EOLA1 exhibits a positively charged cleft, similar to those observed in YTH proteins and the ASCH protein from Zymomonasmobilis that exerts ribonuclease activity. This implies that the positively charged cleft in EOLA1 could stabilize the binding of RNA molecules. Taken together, we suggest that EOLA1 controls protein expression through RNA binding to play protective roles against endothelial cell injuries resulting from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation responses.",10.3390/molecules24193529,13,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

When the level of gate voltage is low, the tunneling width of the TFETs is large. Thus, electrons move via the trap instead of tunneling directly. On the other hand, when the level of gate voltage is high, the tunneling width of the TFETs becomes narrow. Thus, when the gate voltage is low, the noise level of TFETs is high because electrons pass through the trap. However, when the gate voltage is high, electrons pass directly from valence band of source to conduction band of drain, so the noise level is low. Finding the voltage suitable for this TFET is important to determine the optimum conditions for generating BTBT when measuring TFETs and to reduce noise.",10.1166/jnn.2019.16989,15,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

Tramadol was used as an internal standard. JW5473 and internal standard in plasma sample was extracted using acetonitrile (protein precipitation). A centrifuged upper layer was then evaporated and reconstituted with the mobile phase of 0.5% formic acid-acetonitrile (40:60, v/v). The reconstituted samples were injected into a C (18) reversed-phase column. Using MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, JW5473 and tramadol were detected without severe interference from rat plasma matrix. JW5473 produced a protonated precursor ion ([M+H] (+) ) at m/z 432.3 and a corresponding product ion at m/z 114.4.

J,"Kim, YJ; Lee, JC",Quasi-Three-Dimensional Computations of the Microscopic Thermal and Dielectric Characteristics of an SF<sub>6</sub> Rotating Switching Arc,"Pure sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is chemically inert, non-flammable, non-toxic and thermally stable, and it has excellent dielectric strength and arc-quenching and control properties. The switching-off process of SF6 arc discharges occurs at the region between the contacts during the opening sequence to interrupt the flow of excessive current in a faulty network. The arc is tolerated in a controlled manner until a natural current zero when the arc discharge is rapidly quenched to restrict the thermal and dielectric reignition to the interruption. An SF6 self-blast switching chamber combines two advantages of blowing by heat expansion of the SF6 and arc rotation by electromagnetic effect of coil to improve the switching performance on thermal and dielectric reignition. The thermal and aerodynamic behaviors of an SF6 rotating switching arc in the chamber physically are complex and difficult to understand only by measurement due to their three-dimensional effects. Since the late nineteen-eighties, significant progress has been made in the method of computational fluid dynamics describing the physical processes occurring in the switching arc. The final goal of computer simulation technology on the arc switching is to predict the switching phenomena on the thermal and dielectric reignition from an engineering point of view. In this paper, we have conducted quasi-three dimensional computations to predict the thermal and dielectric reignition of SF6 rotating arcs occurring after a current zero in the self-blast switching chamber. Through the complete work, the microscopic thermal and aerodynamic behaviors of the remnant arc column after a current zero should be good criteria to predict the thermal and dielectric reignition of the rotating switching arc in the chamber.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17117,17,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

Special attention was paid to the internal rotation of the thioamide group. Structural refinement was performed taking into account rovibrational corrections to the thermal-average internuclear distances calculated with harmonic and anharmonic (cubic) MP2/cc-pVTZ force constants in terms of static and dynamic models. It was shown that both models fitted the GED data equally well. The results of the GED refinement revealed that in the equilibrium structure, the thioamide group is twisted by about 30 degrees with respect to the phenol ring plane. This is the result of an interatomic repulsion of hydrogen atom in the amide group from the closest hydrogen atom of the benzene ring, which overcomes the energy gain from the pi-pi conjugation of the thioamide group and the aromatic system of thiosalicylamide. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and comparison of the thiosalicylamide molecular structure with those of related compounds revealed hydrogen-bonded fragment between the hydroxyl and thiocarbonyl groups.

This study aims to examine a recently proposed autocorrelation method for estimating three noise parameters involved in the mixed processes (two for AR(1) and one for white noise) of HPLC, which can then be used to calculate the precision profile. This chemometric method was applied to repeatability evaluations of estriol determination using HPLC with UV detection (HPLC-UV). The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of peak area measurements for 5.0 mg/L estriol were observed to be 1.42% for the autocorrelation method and 1.63% for actual repeated measurements of real samples (n = 6). The theoretical RSDs of the autocorrelation method fell within the 95% confidence intervals of the repeated measurements. It is found that the noise parameters are obtained from real chromatographic baseline via the autocorrelation method. Moreover, the instrumental detection limit of estriol based on ISO 11843 was obtained from the precision profile (plot of RSD of measurements against concentration).

In order to replenish these interfacial properties, microwave annealing (MWA) was performed on the device under various conditions. Because MWA utilizes the direct energy transfer (DET) method, the RTA-induced thermal damage on the back interface was effectively removed despite a short processing time.

We confirm an electron density change in SWNTs through optical spectroscopy and conductivity measurement in vacuum.

The total number N-lib of molecules in this library is m(n). In some cases, N-lib can be a very large number (e.g., millions). This is a challenging task because it is costly and often infeasible to synthesize and test all of these molecules. A new algorithm referred to as optimal sequential search is developed to overcome this difficulty. Especially, this algorithm is chemically intuitive which only uses the information of molecule composition, and accessible to practical chemists. The algorithm can be applied to small, medium and large size molecule libraries. With syntheses and property measurements for a limited number of molecules, the top best candidate molecules can be effectively captured from the whole library. Three examples with library size 64, 160,000 and 1,048,576, respectively, are used for illustration. For the first small library, syntheses and property measurements of 17 molecules are sufficient to capture the top 7 best candidate molecules; for the two medium and large libraries, syntheses and property measurements of about one thousand molecules can capture most or a large part of the top 500, especially the top 100 best candidate molecules.

For the enumeration of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), laboratories carrying out the same analytical method (ISO 15214) yielded completely incoherent results while analysing naturally contaminated samples (raw milk, smoked salmon and ham sausage), leading to an atypically large distribution of the PT results. A comprehensive study of these atypical PT results provided insight into the source of systematic errors affecting the LAB enumeration. The main sources of analytical variability turned out to be linked to the ISO 15214:1998 standard. To better harmonize the analytical results, practical improvements can be proposed for the revision of this standard, mainly: the addition of precise criteria for the colony count, a restriction of the allowed incubation conditions and the use of a more selective culture medium (e.g. supplemented with sorbate) to limit the growth of interfering colonies. PT is a privileged observation post to highlight such analytical issues, which would otherwise remain unnoticed. Whenever an unusual distribution of PT results is observed (e.g. high dispersion or non-normal distribution of the values), it is the responsibility of the PT provider to try to identify the causes of non-normality, in a perspective of method improvement. The statistical analysis of atypical PT results requires specific attention: ignoring the non-normality of PT results when it occurs can lead to set an erroneous assigned value, unfairly penalizing participants.",10.1007/s00769-019-01391-x,48,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

Particularly, the immersion characteristics were investigated according to the aging time at room temperature during the production process of the geopolymer. The pH changes of the immersion liquid were analyzed considering the immersion time, and the microstructural changes on the nanometer level of the surface of the geopolymer were observed before and after the immersion. Various shapes of crystals of the zeolite phase formed in the geopolymers prepared in this study, such as needle-like crystals with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 40 nm and lengths of 200 to 300 nm, and plate-shaped crystals overlapped with each other, which is thought to be due to the uneven composition of the slag used as a raw material or to local compositional changes of the alkali activator. By measuring the pH of immersion liquid, the following facts can be seen: foamed geopolymers synthesized from IGCC slag require a room-temperature curing period of at least 7 days, whereas non-foamed specimens require a room-temperature curing period of at least 28 days to consume alkaline activators. This is due to the increase in the specific surface area of the foamed specimen as the specimen is expanded, which thereby increases the contact area between the alkali activator and the slag.

Eight sample types were fabricated with various Cu opening sizes and solder pastes. The Cu opening sizes of the component and substrate were 200 mu m or 380 mu m, respectively, and the component formed a Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) solder bump which was placed on the Sn-58Bi solder paste or epoxy Sn-58Bi solder paste printed on the substrate and then reflowed. The microstructures of the solder joints were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the chemical compositions were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron probe X-ray micro-analyzer (EPMA). Epoxy was formed around the solder joints after the reflow process, improving the bonding strength of the epoxy-contained solder joints.

Callus tissue can be considered as a biomaterial where it's properties change over time due to the stimulated healing process. The proposed model is based on the mechanical stimulus theory. It is used to estimate the stress-stimulated change in the callus, Young's modulus, and the density in the case of a mandible fracture. Three healing loading programs are discussed and compared: optimal, intermittent, and intermittent with residual load. Here, the optimal loading program is understood as the in-time change of stimulating loads, which results in the shortest necessary healing time and, simultaneously, in the most uniform distribution of material density in the analyzed domain. The necessary healing time is a period after which the callus density (and hence the Young's modulus) reaches the desired value. The results of the study suggest a significant difference in the value of the callus maximal density between all three analyzed loading programs for a given healing time interval. The highest values of the density are obtained using the optimal loading program, however, all three programs provide satisfactory density distributions.

After 2 months of a modified diet and/or medication period, the areas of dentin formation and dentinal caries were quantified in the mandibular molars of growing animals. The 60% sucrose diet significantly reduced dentin formation and increased dentinal caries progression. The presence of glucocorticoid medication alone reduced dentin formation.

Rats receiving the control diet positively responded to the dentinal caries by increasing dentin formation to prevent pulpal exposure. The rate of dentine formation was lower in rats with high sucrose diet and predentin area was wider compared to the control group fed normal diet. The enlargement of the predentin region in sucrose diet rats reflects changes in the functionality of the odontoblasts, such as reduction of matrix synthesis and alteration of the mineralization process.

The electrode cleaning/activation procedure lead to the removal of any charged and uncharged residues on the gold nanoplates, leaving the nanostructured surface highly active towards oxygen reduction. The advantages: much lower overpotential and larger current densities of oxygen reduction are ascribed to the unique nanostructures present on the carbon electrode surface-the gold nanoplates. They are rich in edges providing a large population of Au (100) sites with unsaturated coordination exposed to the solution, and catalytically active. Measurements performed using a rotating disc electrode, modified with the gold nanoplates, confirmed that ORR proceeds via two separate steps: oxygen is reduced to hydrogen peroxide, and the peroxide is further reduced in a two-electron reduction to water.",10.1002/elan.201900382,68,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

For a general fixed-type photovoltaic (PV) panel, the misalignment light decreases the efficiency of the system. A solar tracking system was installed for obtaining higher power generation. However, the cost of the PV system and maintenance was 5-10 times higher than the general type. In this study, this module is composed of an array of misalignment light-guiding units that consist of a non-axisymmetric compound parabolic curve (NACPC) and a freeform surface collimator. The NACPC efficiently collects the misalignment light within +/- 30 degrees and guides the light to the collimator. The light has a better uniformity and smaller angle at the exit aperture. The simulation results show that the optical efficiency of the unit was above 70% when the misalignment angle was smaller than 20 degrees. The experimental results show that the power generation of the light-guiding unit was 1.8 times higher than the naked PV panel.",10.3390/mi10100687,69,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

Applied pyrolysis,"Applied pyrolysis is used in this work as a treatment technique for hydrocarbon fraction recovery of used lubricating oils (ULO) with the aim of its further energetic valorisation. Applied pyrolysis bring also the advantage of a better management of metallic compounds that will be concentrated in the solid residue. In this work, technical parameters have been evaluated to establish their influence on the process evolution with the aim of identifying the adequate parameters for obtaining the maximum liquid fraction. It was found that, for an equilibrated energy balance, the final pyrolysis temperature should not exceed 460 degrees C and the main parameter that affect the pyrolysis oil yield and its physical-chemical properties is the heating rate in the thermal range of decomposition. Activated Zeolites (HZSM-5 type) and Na2CO3 were used as catalysts. The catalysed pyrolysis tests were performed using direct contact between ULO and catalyst, the materials being mixed before processing. Experimental results showed that in non-catalysed pyrolysis an increasing heating rate is slightly reducing the yield of liquid fraction. On the other hand, by using catalysts, the liquid fraction is decreasing. Thus, the highest liquid ratio (81 wt. %) was obtained when the Na2O3 is used and the process is run under a heating rate of 3-5 degrees C/min. But then, the zeolite HZSM-5 is leading to the highest overall conversion, 95 wt. % at 15-17 degrees C/min, and is positively influence the formation of gas fractions.",,70,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no

The enhanced production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P with the conventional multistage process needs at least two bioreactors. Shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of the bioreactor from the cell growth of E. coli KACC 91335P to those for its production of CMCase were investigated for development of the simple and economic process with the high productivity and low cost. The production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P with shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed from the cell growth to its production of CMCase in a 100 L pilot-scale bioreactor was 1.36 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for the production of CMCase and it was even 1.54 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for cell growth. The best time for the shift in the optimal conditions was found to be the mid-log phase of cell growth. Owing to the mixed-growth-associated production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P, shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of bioreactors from the cell growth to its production of CMCase seemed to result in relatively more cells for the participation in its production of CMCase, which in turn enhanced its production of CMCase.

Herein, we report on the bioinspired silicification of the nanostructured surfaces of hexagonally close-packed silica bead (hc-SB) arrays using a liquid-phase deposition (LPD) method. This process, governed by the kinetics of silicification, was controlled using the concentration of the reactants and the reaction temperature and monitored in real time using a quartz-crystal microbalance, which allowed the investigation of the silicification on the surface during the LPD reaction. These heterogeneous LPD reactions on hc-SB arrays were optimized to mimic natural 3D hierarchical structures. Anisotropic silicification of the nanostructures occurred owing to differences in the energy and local concentration of silicic acid on the nanostructured surface. A 3D hierarchical pore network was realized via a heterogeneous LPD reaction by controlling the size, location, and arrangement of the SBs. We believe that our silicification process on nanostructured surfaces can lead to great improvements in the bioinspired morphogenesis-based engineering of 3D hierarchical structures.",10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b01998,73,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

However, the authors intended the deposition of the SiCOH films, which does not need the post-deposition process to form the pores by using the dual precursors having different structures. The octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) have different structures which were of the ring shape and the linear shape, respectively. The OMCTS and TEOS were used to fabricate the plasma polymerized low dielectric constant SiCOH film by using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system in this work. A ratio of OMCTS and TEOS was adjusted by controlling flow rates of precursor carrier gases into the process chamber. The SiCOH films, which were deposited with dual precursors, showed the very low dielectric constants (relative dielectric constant k similar to 2.06 and 2.09) at plasma power of 10 W. All the fabricated SiCOH films showed the proper leakage current densities below 10(-6) A/cm(-2) at 1 MV/cm as the intermetallic dielectric material. The SiCOH films were investigated to study the relations between dielectric constants and chemical structures by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

Chromatographic development was performed by using a pre-coated silica gel 60 F-254 aluminum-backed plate, and the development was carried out using toluene-ethyl acetate (9.48:0.52, V/V) as the optimized mobile phase. The developed TLC plates were derivatized by using anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent. The detection of lupeol was carried out at 600 nm. Box-Behnken design was applied for optimization of the chromatographic conditions, and combinations of factors, such as mobile phase composition (volume of ethyl acetate) (A), chamber saturation time (B), and migration distance (C) likely to affect R-F, were identified from preliminary trials and further optimized using a response surface design. Among 3 factors, the significant factor found was the volume of ethyl acetate that resulted in higher change in the R-F value and can be considered as a critical method parameter. Full factorial design was applied for optimization of extraction efficiency. The factors selected for the optimization process were volume of methanol (A) and duration of extraction (B) with percentage yield of extract as response. The linear ranges were found to be 500-3000 ng per band. The accuracy and precision measured were less than 2% relative standard deviation for lupeol. The sensitivity of the method in terms of the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was measured. The proposed method was found to be accurate, precise, reproducible, robust, and specific and can be applicable for the determination of lupeol in the quality-control testing of extract and polyherbal formulations.",10.1556/1006.2019.32.5.6,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical, paraclinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluations were performed. Right ventricular hypertrophy was diagnosed in the M mode subcostal echocardiographic section. RV hypertrophy was defined by a right ventricular free wall thickness of > 5 mm in diastole. We assessed the following RV and LV tissue and spectral systolic indices: apical systolic excursion of the lateral mitral ring (MAPSE), apical systolic excursion of the lateral tricuspid ring (TAPSE), left (Svs) and right (Svd) ventricular tissue systolic velocities, and RV and LV ejection times. We calculated the following to assess systolic ventricular interdependence: MAPSE/TAPSE, the normal value of which was considered as 0.66 +/- 0.14, and Svs/Svd, the normal value of which was considered as 0.76 +/- 0.21. The study group was compared to a control group with the same clinical features but without ventricular hypertrophy. Twenty-one patients were included in the study: 13 men (62%) and eight women (38%) with a mean age of 56 +/- 3.8 years. We compared the values between the study group and control group, with the following results: TAPSE = 20.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 24.1 +/- 0.76 and MAPSE/TAPSE = 0.74 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.75 +/- 0.04. MAPSE was comparable between the groups. Svs was comparable between the groups (0.09 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.02), whereas Svd was different between the groups (0.11 +/- 0.03 vs 0.16 +/- 0.03). Svs/Svd was 0.81 +/- 0.05 in the study group and 0.75 +/- 0.08 in the control group.

Changes in TAPSE and MAPSE/TAPSE, in addition to Svd and Svs/Svd, are related to right ventricular dysfunction and suggest pathological changes in the interdependence mechanism of the ventricles in patients with RV hypertrophy. In addition, RV free wall thickness was strongly correlated with ventricular interdependence parameters, with the exception of MAPSE.

Advanced, accurate and simple spectrophotometric methods with minor manipulation of zero-order spectra were suggested for simultaneous quantitation of Lab or Neb in mixture with HCTZ for quality control purpose in pure form and pharmaceutical formulations. These methods include (a) constant center method, (b) advanced absorbance subtraction method for Lab and HCTZ, (c) absorption factor method (AFM) and (d) the ratio subtraction method. The established methods were successfully applied over concentration ranges 10-100 mu g/mL, 10-75 mu g/mL and 2.5-25 mu g/mL of Lab, Neb and HCTZ, respectively. Results were compared statistically to those of official and reported methods revealing no remarkable difference. Validation of methods followed international conference of harmonization guidelines. Suggested methods require minor processing of zero-order spectra with accurate results that facilitate the quantitative estimation of studied mixtures in quality control laboratories.",10.1007/s13738-019-01699-y,91,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no

J,"Seo, H; Ryu, S",Fabrication of Various Carbon Nanotube/Nickel Nanocomposite Powders by Polyol Process,"We developed a molecular level mixing process for fabricating various types of carbon nanotube (CNT)/nickel (Ni) nanocomposite powders by a polyol process. A CNT/Ni nanocomposite was fabricated by two steps, dehydration of polyol and oxidation of acetaldehyde with the formation of diacetyl. Oxygen functionalized CNTs offer direct nucleation sites for Ni particles and strong chemical bonding between CNT and Ni particles. By controlling nucleation sites and nuclear growth, we successfully fabricated three different types of nanocomposite powders, CNT implanted Ni, Ni coated CNTs, and Ni decorated CNTs. Each type of powder was developed for various applications. During the sintering process, the implanted type retained CNT's crystal structure. As a conductive filler to other matrix, the coated and decorated type offered homogeneous dispersion and an enhanced conductive network. Various types of CNT/Ni nanocomposite powders show potential for remarkable development of bulk scale fabrication where exceptionally high strength and electric conductivity is necessary.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17047,95,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,

J,"Shibata, T",Catalytic and Asymmetric Synthesis of Heteroatom-Containing Cyclic Polyarylenes,"Cyclic polyarylene is a series of compounds, where the cyclic structure is constructed by a number of phenylene and/or heteroarylene moieties. Cyclic polyarylenes consisting of more than three arylene moieties are non-planar, and introduction of substituent(s) induces axial chirality. We comprehensively studied catalytic and enantioselective synthesis of various cyclic polyphenylenes by consecutive inter- and intramolecular cycloadditions of triynes, where 1,6-diyne and alkyne moieties were tethered by phenylene moiety. We further used this strategy for the construction of cyclic heteroarylenes using thiophene-tethered triynes. Next, we focused on the enantioselective construction of sulfur-containing benzo-fused medium ring systems. For examples, intermolecular cycloaddition of 1,8-diynes tethered by sulfur and two ortho-phenylene moieties with an alkyne gave axially chiral poly-substituted tribenzothiepins possessing a seven-membered ring core. We succeeded in the enantioselective synthesis of seven to eleven-membered benzo-fused compounds by intramolecular reaction of triynes consisting of sulfur-tethered 1,6-diyne and 1, n-diyne moieties (n = 8-11).",10.5059/yukigoseikyokaishi.77.1005,98,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes

Therefore, any improvement and optimization in the structure of these dosimeters can lead to accurate measurements of the absorbed dose. In the present study, the structure of a specific cylindrical ionization chamber (PTW, model 23361, Freiburg, Germany) was improved and optimized. After the design and construction of the new cylindrical ionization chamber, the performance of this dosimeter was investigated by saturation, ion collection efficiency, polarization, leakage current, stability, and linearity of response tests. The findings of performance tests showed that the response of the introduced dosimeter agrees with the recommended standards. The new design and construction of the guard electrode, both in length and arrangement of the dosimeter structure, can improve the electric field and decrease the leakage current. Moreover, the use of pure graphite in the chamber's wall can result to improve in the electric field of the chamber's sensitive volume, thereby improving the performance of the dosimeter.",10.1016/j.radphyschem.2019.04.058,99,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,
