J,"Coey, JMD; Venkatesan, M; Fitzgerald, CB",Donor impurity band exchange in dilute ferromagnetic oxides,"Dilute ferromagnetic oxides having Curie temperatures far in excess of 300 K and exceptionally large ordered moments per transition-metal cation challenge our understanding of magnetism in solids. These materials are high-k dielectrics with degenerate or thermally activated n-type semiconductivity. Conventional super-exchange or double-exchange interactions cannot produce long-range magnetic order at concentrations of magnetic cations of a few percent. We propose that ferromagnetic exchange here, and in dilute ferromagnetic nitrides, is mediated by shallow donor electrons that form bound magnetic polarons, which overlap to create a spin-split impurity band. The Curie temperature in the mean-field approximation varies as (xdelta)(1/2) where x and delta are the concentrations of magnetic cations and donors, respectively. High Curie temperatures arise only when empty minority-spin or majority-spin d states lie at the Fermi level in the impurity band. The magnetic phase diagram includes regions of semiconducting and metallic ferromagnetism, cluster paramagnetism, spin glass and canted antiferromagnetism.",10.1038/nmat1310,0,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

A key limitation to this technology is its low energy density and for this reason there is considerable interest in exploring pseudocapacitive materials where faradaic mechanisms offer increased levels of energy storage. Here we show that the capacitive charge-storage properties of mesoporous films of iso-oriented alpha-MoO3 are superior to those of either mesoporous amorphous material or non-porous crystalline MoO3. Whereas both crystalline and amorphous mesoporous materials show redox pseudocapacitance, the iso-oriented layered crystalline domains enable lithium ions to be inserted into the van der Waals gaps of the alpha-MoO3. We propose that this extra contribution arises from an intercalation pseudocapacitance, which occurs on the same timescale as redox pseudocapacitance. The result is increased charge-storage capacity without compromising charge/discharge kinetics in mesoporous crystalline MoO3.",10.1038/NMAT2612,3,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,

Here, we show a fundamental relationship in electrocatalytic trends on Pt3M (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Ti, V) surfaces between the experimentally determined surface electronic structure (the d-band centre) and activity for the oxygen-reduction reaction. This relationship exhibits 'volcano-type' behaviour, where the maximum catalytic activity is governed by a balance between adsorption energies of reactive intermediates and surface coverage by spectator (blocking) species. The electrocatalytic trends established for extended surfaces are used to explain the activity pattern of Pt3M nanocatalysts as well as to provide a fundamental basis for the catalytic enhancement of cathode catalysts.

For example, the edge sites of MoS2 are highly catalytically active and are thus preferred at the catalyst surface over MoS2 basal planes, which are inert. However, thermodynamics favours the presence of the basal plane, limiting the number of active sites at the surface. Herein, we engineer the surface structure of MoS2 to preferentially expose edge sites to effect improved catalysis by successfully synthesizing contiguous large-area thin films of a highly ordered double-gyroid MoS2 bicontinuous network with nanoscaled pores. The high surface curvature of this catalyst mesostructure exposes a large fraction of edge sites, which, along with its high surface area, leads to excellent activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This work elucidates how morphological control of materials at the nanoscale can significantly impact the surface structure at the atomic scale, enabling new opportunities for enhancing surface properties for catalysis and other important technological applications.",10.1038/NMAT3439,7,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

We report electrochemical, in situ electrical, photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurements on Ni1-xFex(OH)(2)/Ni1-xFexOOH thin films to investigate the changes in electronic properties, OER activity, and structure as a result of Fe inclusion. We developed a simple method for purification of KOH electrolyte that uses precipitated bulk Ni(OH)(2) to absorb Fe impurities. Cyclic voltammetry on rigorously Fe-free Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH reveals new Ni redox features and no significant OER current until >400 mV overpotential, different from previous reports which were likely affected by Fe impurities. We show through controlled crystallization that beta-NiOOH is less active for OER than the disordered gamma-NiOOH starting material and that previous reports of increased activity for beta-NiOOH are due to incorporation of Fe-impurities during the crystallization process. Through-film in situ conductivity measurements show a >30-fold increase in film conductivity with Fe addition, but this change in conductivity is not sufficient to explain the observed changes in activity. Measurements of activity as a function of film thickness on Au and glassy carbon substrates are consistent with the hypothesis that Fe exerts a partial-charge-transfer activation effect on Ni, similar to that observed for noble-metal electrode surfaces.

In systems where the force along the minimum energy path is large compared to the restoring force perpendicular to the path and when many images of the system are included in the elastic band, kinks can develop and prevent the band from converging to the minimum energy path. We show how the kinks arise and present an improved way of estimating the local tangent which solves the problem.

J,"Grimme, S",Semiempirical hybrid density functional with perturbative second-order correlation,"A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (a(x)) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G2/97 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum a(x) is found to be quite large (53% with c=27%) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G2/97 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5 kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minium errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10-20 kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.",10.1063/1.2148954,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The iridium complexes have two cyclometalated ((CN)-N-boolean AND) ligands and a single monoanionic, bidentate ancillary ligand (LX). i.e., (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(LX). The (CN)-N-boolean AND ligands can be any of a wide variety of organometallic ligands. The LX ligands used for this study were all beta -diketonates, with the major emphasis placed On acetylacetonate (acac) complexes. The majority of the (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(acac) complexes phosphoresce with high quantum efficiencies (solution quantum yields, 0.1-0.6), and microsecond lifetimes (e.g., 1-14 mus). The strongly allowed phosphorescence in these complexes is the result of significant spin-orbit coupling of the Ir center, The lowest energy (emissive) excited state in these (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(acac) complexes is a mixture of (MLCT)-M-3 and (3)(pi-pi*) states. By choosing the appropriate (CN)-N-boolean AND ligand, (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(acac) complexes can be prepared which emit in any color from green to red. Simple, systematic changes in the (CN)-N-boolean AND ligands, which lead to bathochromic shifts of the free ligands, lead to similar bathochromic shifts in the Ir complexes of the same ligands, consistent with ""(CN2)-N-boolean AND-Ir""-centered emission.

The three Ir complexes, i.e., bis(2-phenylpyridinato-N,C-2')iridium(acetylacetonate) [ppy(2)Ir(acac)], bis(2-phenyl benzothiozolato-N,C-2')iridium(acetylacetonate) [bt(2)Ir(acac)], and bis(2-(2'-benzothienyl)-pyridinato-N,C-3')iridium(acetylacetonate) [btp(2)Ir(acac)], were doped into the emissive region of multilayer, vapor-deposited OLEDs. The ppy(2)Ir(acac)-, bt(2)Ir(acac)-, and btp(2)Ir(acac)-based OLEDs give green, yellow, and red electroluminescence, respectively, with very similar current-voltage characteristics. The OLEDs give high external quantum efficiencies, ranging from 6 to 12.3%, with the ppy(2)Ir(acac) giving the highest efficiency (12.3%, 38 lm/W, > 50 Cd/A). The btp(2)Ir(acac)-based device gives saturated red emission with a quantum efficiency of 6.5% and a luminance efficiency of 2.2 lm/W. These (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(acac)-doped OLEDs show some of the highest efficiencies reported for organic light emitting diodes. The high efficiencies result from efficient trapping and radiative relaxation of the singlet and triplet excitons formed in the electroluminescent process.",10.1021/ja003693s,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Graphite is a practical anode material used for LIB, because of its capability for reversible lithium ion intercalation in the layered crystals, and the structural similarities of GNS to graphite may provide another type of intercalation anode compound. While the accommodation of lithium in these layered compounds is influenced by the layer spacing between the graphene nanosheets, control of the intergraphene sheet distance through interacting molecules such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) or fullerenes (C-60) might be crucial for enhancement of the storage capacity. The specific capacity of GNS was found to be 540 mAh/g, which is much larger than that of graphite, and this was increased up to 730 mAh/g and 784 mAh/g, respectively, by the incorporation of macromolecules of CNT and C-60 to the GNS.",10.1021/nl800957b,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Ritchie, RO",The conflicts between strength and toughness,"The attainment of both strength and toughness is a vital requirement for most structural materials; unfortunately these properties are generally mutually exclusive. Although the quest continues for stronger and harder materials, these have little to no use as bulk structural materials without appropriate fracture resistance. It is the lower-strength, and hence higher-toughness, materials that find use for most safety-critical applications where premature or, worse still, catastrophic fracture is unacceptable. For these reasons, the development of strong and tough (damage-tolerant) materials has traditionally been an exercise in compromise between hardness versus ductility. Drawing examples from metallic glasses, natural and biological materials, and structural and biomimetic ceramics, we examine some of the newer strategies in dealing with this conflict. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between the mechanisms that individually contribute to strength and toughness, noting that these phenomena can originate from very different lengthscales in a material's structural architecture. We show how these new and natural materials can defeat the conflict of strength versus toughness and achieve unprecedented levels of damage tolerance within their respective material classes.",10.1038/NMAT3115,31,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,

Depending on the wavelength range and whether or not denatured proteins are included in the reference set, five reference sets were constructed with the number of reference proteins varying from 29 to 48. The performance of three popular methods for estimating protein secondary structure fractions from CD spectra (implemented in software packages CONTIN, SELCON3, and CDSSTR) and a variant of CONTIN, CONTIN/LL, that incorporates the variable selection method in the locally linearized model in CONTIN, were examined using the five reference sets described here, and a aa-protein reference set. Secondary structure assignments from DSSP were used in the analysis. The performances of all three methods were comparable, in spite of the differences in the algorithms used in the three software packages. While CDSSTR performed the best with a smaller reference set and larger wavelength range, and CONTIN/LL performed the best with a larger reference set and smaller wavelength range, the performances for individual secondary structures were mixed. Analyzing protein CD spectra using all three methods should improve the reliability of predicted secondary structural fractions. The three programs are provided in CDPro software package and have been modified for easier use with the different reference sets described in this paper.

Projections of future developments using carbon indicate that energy densities of 10 Wh/kg or higher are likely with power densities of 1-2 kW/kg.

Here, using 3d-M hydr(oxy)oxides, with distinct stoichiometries and morphologies in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) regions, we establish the overall catalytic activities for these reaction as a function of a more fundamental property, a descriptor, OH-M2+delta bond strength (0 <= delta <= 1.5). This relationship exhibits trends in reactivity (Mn < Fe < Co < Ni), which is governed by the strength of the OH-M2+delta energetic (Ni < Co < Fe < Mn). These trends are found to be independent of the source of the OH, either the supporting electrolyte (for the OER) or the water dissociation product (for the HER). The successful identification of these electrocatalytic trends provides the foundation for rational design of 'active sites' for practical alkaline HER and OER electrocatalysts.",10.1038/NMAT3313,51,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Jakalian, A; Jack, DB; Bayly, CI","Fast, efficient generation of high-quality atomic charges. AM1-BCC model: II. Parameterization and validation","We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AMI population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of >2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER. 13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules.

The crystal structure of complex 2 confirms the presence of a Ru(II)N6 central core derived from the terpyridine ligand and three N-bonded thiocyanates. Intermolecular H-bonding between carboxylates on neighboring terpyridines gives rise to 2-D H-bonded arrays. The absorption and emission maxima of the black dye show a bathochromic shift with decreasing pH and exhibit pH-dependent excited-state lifetimes. The red-shift of the emission maxima is due to better pi -acceptor properties of the acid form that lowers the energy of the CT excited state. The low-energy metal-to-ligand charge-transfer absorption band showed marked solvatochromism due to the presence of thiocyanate ligands. The Ru(II)/(III) oxidation potential of the black dye and the ligand-based reduction potential shifted cathodically with decreasing number of protons and showed more reversible character.

First, the cyclic voltammetry data established that only a thin layer of MnO2 is involved in the redox process and electrochemically active. Second, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that the manganese oxidation state was varying from III to IV for the reduced and oxidized forms of thin film electrodes, respectively, during the charge/discharge process. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data also show that Na+ cations from the electrolyte were involved in the charge storage process of MnO2 thin film electrodes. However, the Na/ Mn ratio for the reduced electrode was much lower than what was anticipated for charge compensation dominated by Na+, thus suggesting the involvement of protons in the pseudofaradaic mechanism.

J,"Dewanto, V; Wu, XZ; Adom, KK; Liu, RH",Thermal processing enhances the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing total antioxidant activity,"Processed fruits and vegetables have been long considered to have lower nutritional value than their fresh commodities due to the loss of vitamin C during processing. This research group found vitamin C in apples contributed <0.4% of total antioxidant activity, indicating most of the activity comes from the natural combination of phytochemicals. This suggests that processed fruits and vegetables may retain their antioxidant activity despite the loss of vitamin C. Here it is shown that thermal processing elevated total antioxidant activity and bioaccessible lycopene content in tomatoes and produced no significant changes in the total phenolics and total flavonoids content, although loss of vitamin C was observed. The raw tomato had 0.76 Â± 0.03 Î¼mol of vitamin C/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 Â°C, the vitamin C content significantly dropped to 0.68 Â±0.02, 0.64 Â± 0.01, and 0.54 Â± 0.02 Î¼mol of vitamin C/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). The raw tomato had 2.01 +/- 0.04 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degreesC, the translycopene content had increased to 3.11 +/- 0.04, 5.45 +/- 0.02, and 5.32 +/- 0.05 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato (p < 0.01).

The mechanical properties measured were the Young's modulus, ultimate tensile strength, fracture toughness, fracture energy, and the material's resistance to fatigue crack propagation. The results indicate that grapheme platelets significantly out-perform carbon nanotube additives. The Young's modulus of the graphene nanocomposite was similar to 31% greater than the pristine epoxy as compared to similar to 3% increase for single-walled Carbon nanotubes.

In order to purify the as-received material, a non-oxidative treatment (with hydrochloric acid) was also applied. Electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis clearly revealed that the nitric acid-treated material under reflux conditions suffered the highest degree of degradation, such as, nanotube shortening and additional defect generation in the graphitic network. Basic oxidative treatment led to the complete removal of amorphous carbon and metal oxide impurities but the structural integrity was found to be intact. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to confirm the different functionalities produced for each oxidation agent, whereas titration measurements determined the relative concentration of carboxylic functions onto the graphitic surface. Moreover, a general relationship between the chemical treatment and the amount of non-graphitic carbon was established by means of Raman spectroscopy measurements. The possibility of controlling the required amount of functionality, carboxylic and hydroxyl, via these oxidation procedures is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The photoconduction mechanism in these devices has been elucidated by means of time-resolved measurements spanning a wide temporal domain, from 10(-9) to 10(2) s, revealing the coexistence of fast (tau similar to 20 ns) and slow (tau similar to 10 s) components of the carrier relaxation dynamics. The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the NW surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears to be effective even at the shortest time scale investigated of t < 1 ns. Despite the slow relaxation time, the extremely high internal gain of ZnO NW photodetectors results in gain-bandwidth products (GB) higher than similar to 10 GHz.

J,"Van Lenthe, E; Baerends, EJ",Optimized slater-type basis sets for the elements 1-118,"Seven different types of Slater type basis sets for the elements H (Z = 1) up to E 118 (Z = 118), ranging from a double zeta valence quality up to a quadruple zeta valence quality, are tested in their performance in neutral atomic and diatomic oxide calculations. The exponents of the Slater type functions are optimized for the use in (scalar relativistic) zeroth-order regular approximated (ZORA) equations. Atomic tests reveal that, on average, the absolute basis set error of 0.03 kcal/mol in the density functional calculation of the valence spinor energies of the neutral atoms with the largest all electron basis set of quadruple zeta quality is lower than the average absolute difference of 0.16 kcal/mol in these valence spinor energies if one compares the results of ZORA equation with those of the fully relativistic Dirac equation. This average absolute basis set error increases to about 1 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of triple zeta valence quality, and to approximately 4 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality. The molecular tests reveal that, on average, the calculated atomization energies of 118 neutral diatomic oxides MO, where-the nuclear charge Z of M ranges from Z = 1-118, with the all electron basis sets of triple zeta quality with two polarization functions added are within 1-2 kcal/mol of the benchmark results with the much larger all electron basis sets, which are of quadruple zeta valence quality with four polarization functions added. The accuracy is reduced to about 4-5 kcal/mol if only one polarization function is used in the triple zeta basis sets, and further reduced to approximately 20 kcal/mol if the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality are used. The inclusion of g-type STOs to the large benchmark basis sets had an effect of less than I kcal/mol in the calculation of the atomization energies of the group 2 and group 14 diatomic oxides. The basis sets that are optimized for calculations using the frozen core approximation (frozen core basis sets) have a restricted basis set in the core region compared to the all electron basis sets. On average, the use of these frozen core basis sets give atomic basis set errors that are approximately twice as large as the corresponding all electron basis set errors and molecular atomization energies that are close to the corresponding all electron results., Only if spin-orbit coupling is included in the frozen core calculations larger errors are found, especially for the heavier elements, due to the additional approximation that is made that the basis functions are orthogonalized on scalar relativistic core orbitals.

Hydrogen-treated rutile TiO2 (H:TiO2) nanowires were prepared by annealing the pristine TiO2 nanowires in hydrogen atmosphere at various temperatures in a range of 200-550 degrees C. In comparison to pristine TiO2 nanowires, H:TiO2 samples show substantially enhanced photocurrent in the entire potential window. More importantly, H:TiO2 samples have exceptionally low photocurrent saturation potentials of -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs RHE), indicating very efficient charge separation and transportation. The optimized H:TiO2 nanowire sample yields a photocurrent density of similar to 1.97 mA/cm(2) at -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, in 1 M NaOH solution under the illumination of simulated solar light (100 mW/cm(2) from 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter). This photocurrent density corresponds to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of similar to 1.63%. After eliminating the discrepancy between the irradiance of the xenon lamp and solar light, by integrating the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the H:TiO2 nanowire sample with a standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum, the STH efficiency is calculated to be similar to 1.1%, which is the best value for a TiO2 photoanode. IPCE analyses confirm the photocurrent enhancement is mainly due to the improved photoactivity of TiO2 in the UV region. Hydrogen treatment increases the donor density of TiO2 nanowires by 3 orders of magnitudes, via creating a high density of oxygen vacancies that serve as electron donors. Similar enhancements in photocurrent were also observed in anatase H:TiO2 nanotubes.

Graphene has strong cytotoxicity toward bacteria. To better understand its antimicrobial mechanism, we compared the antibacterial activity of four types of graphene-based materials (graphite (Gt), graphite oxide (GtO), graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) toward a bacterial model Escherichia coli. Under similar concentration and incubation conditions, GO dispersion shows the highest antibacterial activity, sequentially followed by rGO, Gt, and GtO. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and dynamic light scattering analyses show that GO aggregates have the smallest average size among the four types of materials. SEM images display that the direct contacts with graphene nanosheets disrupt cell membrane. No superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is detected. However, the four types of materials can oxidize glutathione, which serves as redox state mediator in bacteria. Conductive rGO and Gt have higher oxidation capacities than insulating GO and GtO. Results suggest that antimicrobial actions are contributed by both membrane and oxidation stress. We propose that a three-step antimicrobial mechanism, previously used for carbon nanotubes, is applicable to graphene-based materials. It includes initial cell deposition on graphene-based materials, membrane stress cared by direct contact with sharp nanosheets, and the ensuing superoxide anion-independent oxidation.

We first describe the evolution in the electrolyte area with particular attention to ionic liquids, discussing the expected application of these room temperature molten salts and listing the issues that still prevent their practical implementation. The attention is then focused on the electrode materials presently considered the most promising for enhancing the energy density of the batteries. At the anode side a discussion is provided on the status of development of high capacity tin and silicon lithium alloys. We show that the morphology that is the most likely to ensure commercial exploitation of these alloy electrodes is that involving carbon-based nanocomposites. We finally touch on super-high-capacity batteries, discussing the key cases of lithium-sulfur and lithium-air and attempting to forecast their chances to eventually reach the status of practically appealing energy storage systems. We conclude with a brief reflection on the amount of lithium reserves in view of its large use in the case of global conversion from gasoline-powered cars to hybrid and electric cars.",10.1039/c1ee01388b,96,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,

The Co3O4 nanoparticles obtained are 10-30 nm in size and homogeneously anchor on graphene sheets as spacers to keep the neighboring sheets separated. This Co3O4/graphene nanocomposite displays superior Li-battery performance with large reversible capacity, excellent cyclic performance, and good rate capability, highlighting the importance of the anchoring of nanopartides on graphene sheets for maximum utilization of electrochemically active Co3O4 nanopartides and graphene for energy storage applications in high-performance lithium-ion batteries.",10.1021/nn100740x,97,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Cygan, RT; Liang, JJ; Kalinichev, AG","Molecular models of hydroxide, oxyhydroxide, and clay phases and the development of a general force field","The fate of chemical and radioactive wastes in the environment is related to the ability of natural phases to attenuate and immobilize contaminants through chemical sorption and precipitation processes. Our understanding of these complex processes at the atomic level is provided by a few experimental and analytical methods such as X-ray absorption and NMR spectroscopies. However, due to complexities in the structure and composition of clay and other hydrated minerals, and the inherent uncertainties of the experimental methods, it is important to apply theoretical molecular models for a fundamental atomic-level understanding, interpretation, and prediction of these phenomena. In this effort, we have developed a general force field, CLAYFF, suitable for the simulation of hydrated and multicomponent mineral systems and their interfaces with aqueous solutions. Interatomic potentials were derived from parametrizations incorporating structural and spectroscopic data for a variety of simple hydrated compounds. A flexible SPC-based water model is used to describe the water and hydroxyl behavior. Metal-oxygen interactions are described by a Lennard-Jones function and a Coulombic term with partial charges derived by Mulliken and ESP analysis of DFT results. Bulk structures, relaxed surface structures, and intercalation processes are evaluated and compared to experimental and spectroscopic findings for validation. Our approach differs from most others in that we treat most interatomic interactions as nonbonded. This allows us to effectively use the force field for a wide variety of phases and to properly account for energy and momentum transfer between the fluid phase and the solid, while keeping the number of parameters small enough to allow modeling of relatively large and highly disordered systems. Simulations of clay, hydroxide, and oxyhydroxide phases and their interfaces with aqueous solutions combine energy minimization and molecular dynamics methods to describe the structure and behavior of water, hydroxyl, surface species, and intercalates in these systems. The results obtained to date demonstrate that CLAYFF shows good promise to evolve into a widely adaptable and broadly effective force field for molecular simulations of fluid interfaces with clays and other clay-related phases, as well as other inorganic materials characterized by complex, disordered, and often ill-determined structure and composition.",10.1021/jp0363287,98,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,,
