0,"Graphene nanoscroll introduced recently is another form of a graphene-based two-dimensional material, which is especially attractive in nanoelectronic applications. As carriers can travel ballistically or semi-ballistically, they can reach high-speed and energy if the channel length is enough. Therefore, they can collide and result in an excessive current called ionisation current. As a result, it is important to study this mechanism carefully. In this paper, we propose an analytical approach to calculate an ionisation coefficient.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

The local behavior of the surface and the bulk of the alloy sheets was studied by means of an electrochemical microcell in combination with glow-discharge optical-emission spectrometry. Surface layers strongly enhance the electrochemical activity of the fin material.

2,"Combining autoantigens with immune-modulating drugs has emerged as an attractive approach to selectively reinstate tolerance in autoimmune diseases. The disparate properties of autoantigens and small-molecule immunosuppressants commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases can confound efforts to co-deliver these therapies. However, both components may be co-delivered with adjuvants which have been successful in delivering antigens to immune cells. We evaluated several common adjuvants as vehicles to co-deliver a model antigen and immunosuppressant, ovalbumin (OVA) and dexamethasone (DEX), respectively. Formulations were developed, and the release of DEX from adjuvants was investigated. Next, the effect of adjuvant, DEX, and OVA was tested in vitro using a DC line. A MF59-analog (MF59a) formulation was advanced to more sophisticated co-culture studies using OVA-primed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and splenocytes or T-cells from OT-II mice. Most of these studies indicated MF59a-based antigen-specific immunotherapies could diminish the markers of inflammation associated with OVA recognition. We rationalized MF59a co-delivery of antigen and drug could reduce the risk of side effects typically associated with these drugs and reinstate immune tolerance, thus prompting continued investigation of emulsion adjuvants as delivery vehicles for antigen-specific immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases.

3,"Over the last few years, Nitinol (NiTi) has become one of the most attractive alloy materials for industrial applications. However, its implementation is still problematic due to its surface nickel content, making it sensitive to pitting corrosion. In applications, it is often necessary to modify NiTi surfaces by using organic coatings, which provides new physico-chemical properties as well as functionalities and often contributes to a reinforcement of the alloy corrosion resistance. In this work, we assess the differences between the molecular layers made out of methylphosphonic acid (C1P) and the bi-phosphonic acid derivatives: (methylimino)dimethylene-bisphophonic acid (MIP2) and 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEP2) using conventional (CG) and electro-assisted (EG) graftings.

5,"For the purpose of modeling internal corrosion of the stainless steel fuel pins in fast nuclear reactors, the present work presents a thermodynamic description of the Fe-Ni-Te system modeled via the Calphad method. The liquid phase was modeled using the ionic 2-sublattice liquid model. Only binary parameters were optimized in the beta 2, delta and tau solid phases, to fit the isothermal section at 600 degrees C. The liquid did not require much adjustment from the extrapolation from the binary Fe-Te, Ni-Te and Fe-Ni systems. The paper presents a re-optimization of the Fe-Te liquid description in order to remove inverted liquid miscibility gaps at high temperatures. The resulting phase diagrams reproduce experimental isothermal sections well, and fits liquidus and solidus data very well. The description will be incorporated into the Thermodynamics of Advanced Fuels - International Database (TAF-ID). This will then be coupled with the Germinal system code to model the fission-product induced corrosion in nuclear fuel pins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"The solubility of stevioside (a natural sweetener) in 12 pure solvents (methanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-buthanol, 2-buthanol, 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 2-propoxyethanol, 2-buthoxyethanol, water, and acetone) and in binary mixed solvents (2-ethoxyethanol + water) have been determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method at temperatures ranging from 288.15 to 328.15 K and atmospheric pressure. From the experimental data, it was found that the solubility increased with the rising temperature in all selected solvents. The experimental data for the solubility of stevioside were correlated with Apelblat and non-random two-liquid (NRTL) models. It was found that the Apelblat model has the better quality in fitting the solubility data. Also, thermodynamic functions of dissolution, mixing and transfer process were calculated by the van't Hoff equation. Furthermore, the crystal habits of stevioside in selected solvents were studied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Micronized CaO with pores was synthesized by calcining the reaction product CaCO3 from NH4HCO3 and Ca(OH)(2). Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis were used to characterize CaO, which confirmed that after calcining at 800 degrees C for 2 hr, CaCO3 was completely converted into porous micronized CaO with a surface area of about 7.295m(2)/g and a particle size of 0.5-1.5 mu m. The porous CaO microparticles were used as heterogeneous catalysts for producing biodiesel from transesterification of soybean oil and methanol. The influences of reaction time, calcined temperature, and reusability of CaO were explored. The experiments showed that CaO has high catalytic activity for transesterification reaction, and the yield of biodiesel reaches more than 98% under the conditions of methanol/oil mole ratio of 9, and the catalyst amount (catalyst/oil) of 3% after reaction for 2.5 hr. The CaO catalyst can be recycled easily and it also has the advantage of low pollution. Simple synthetic route, low cost, high catalytic activity, good reusability, and great potential for industrialization are the advantages of the porous micronized CaO catalyst that was proposed in this work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Anecdotal evidence and a further report from leather experts show that there is close to no enlightenment of the production of leather vessels in Ghanaian leather industries. This study was, therefore, conducted as a result of the need to add leather as supplementary material to the traditional materials such as clay, metal, wood and half-gourd used for producing vessels in Ghana. The purpose of the study was to find out how Ghanaian indigenous leather could be used in the production of leather vessels. The qualitative study employed three key techniques, namely: 'Cuir bouilli' leather hardening methods, the sand pounding technique, and assemblage and construction technique. Based on the results, the baking and hot wax methods adversely affected the indigenous leather positively in the hardening of the leather. The results also show that using only one part of the leather (the back, belly or butt) affected the quality of the leather vessels, but incorporating the various parts of the hide helped improve the quality and durability of the leather vessels. The implications of the results and future research directions are also presented. This study has, therefore, expanded the usefulness of the Ghanaian indigenous vegetable tanned leather apart from the conventional usage for making shoes, bags and belts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Rattlesnakes are easily recognized by a rattle on the tail. Despite the advances in molecular, morphological, and evolutionary studies about several aspects of rattles, there are no studies elucidating these nanoscale topographical features using high-resolution techniques. Here we propose a set of approaches to show these micro/nano surface features searching for patterns or hidden signatures. The results showed that the older rattle ring (segment 8) presented higher roughness values when compared to other segments. Cluster analysis allowed the observation of similarities/differences among some groups, which reinforced the strong discrepancy of the segment 8 when compared to the others and enable possible topographical transitions among each segment features, considering their linkages and Euclidean distances. Attractive forces and surface hardness were also significant increased on segment 8, while adhesion was significantly decreased on the segments 5, 6, and 7 compared to segment 1 (P < 0.05). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed typical profiles of keratin spectra considering the amino acids present in this protein structure. Energy dispersive spectroscopy results indicated possible different molecular composition on each segment. These set of approaches applied on the present study represents an array of new possibilities towards the qualitative and quantitative analyses of this type of biomaterials enabling to address several structural, chemical and mechanical questions ongoing on scientific world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"Like the drug-salt interactions, drug-amino acid interaction in the aqueous medium is dependent upon different physiological events occurring in the body. In this context, investigations on the interactions of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CFX) being a second-generation antibiotic with both nonessential amino acid and essential amino acid have been done. The physicochemical properties like apparent molar volume (V-2,V-phi) and apparent molar isentropic compression (K-s,K-2,K-phi) of drug, CFX in water and in the presence of glycine (GLY), and L-isoleucine (ILU) at m(B) (molality of GLY or ILU) = 10, 20, 35, 50, and 75 mmol.kg(-1) have been determined over the temperature range of 288.15-323.15 K and at p = 1 x 10(5) Pa. These data have further been used to calculate different parameters, which help to obtain valuable information corresponding to the distinct kinds of interactions present in the ternary systems. The volumes and compressibility studies have shown that the predominant interactions are hydrophilic-hydrophilic and hydrophilic-ionic in the studied systems. It may be postulated that the effect of CFX prevails through the hydrophilic groups of the constituents of proteins. Dehydration behavior of drug is also observed using hydration number and calorimetry at higher m(B) values. Both hyperchromic and hypsochromic changes have been observed from the absorption spectra for the CFX/ILU system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are of significances for energy storage or conversion. However, the preparation of excellent electrocatalysts and their utilizations are still great challenges. In this paper, the in situ enrichment of cobalt by sulfate-reducing bacteria (IEC-SRB-Xs) with more uncovered by-production was successfully cultured and carbonized to serve as the OER electrocatalysts triumphantly. The carbonized remains of IEC-SRB-1.00 (named SRB-1.00) showed an excellent potential 1.553 V at current density 10 mA cm(-2), and Tafel slope was 47 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the SRB-1.00 performed constant activity and without any decline of activity after 24 h of OER testing. In addition, the SRB-1.00 exhibited high electron transfer efficiency of 0.803.

12,"We carried out a detailed investigation of the local ordering and dynamics of the lithium intercalation in paramagnetic LixVOPO4 center dot 2H(2)O (with 0 < x <= 1) materials. This question was addressed using a combination of X-ray diffraction, P-31 and Li-7 MAS NMR experiments. We first studied the structure of the fully ordered end-member of the series, Li1VOPO4 center dot 2H(2)O, revisiting the X-ray single crystal diffraction data on the basis of the information provided by P-31 MAS NMR. We then carried out Li-7 MAS and exchange NMR experiments and P-31 MAS experiments on the polycrystalline powders obtained after partial lithium insertion in VOPO4 center dot 2H(2)O phases.

13,"The new aminocoumarin derivatives 3-[1-(3-hydroxyanilino)ethylidene]-3H-chromene-2,4-dione, (1), 3-[1-(4-hydroxyanilino)ethylidene]-3H-chromene-2,4-dione, (2), and 3-[1-(2-hydroxyanilino)ethylidene]-3H-chromene-2,4-dione, (3), all C17H13NO4, were synthesized by reacting an equimolar amount of 3-acetyl-4-hydroxycoumarin and the corresponding aminophenol in absolute ethanol. Structural and spectroscopic analysis of these phases revealed that derivatives (1) and (2) are isomers of previously reported (3) [Brahmia et al. (2013). Acta Cryst. E69, o1296]. The crystal structures of meta derivative (1) and para derivative (2) were ab initio determined from powder X-ray diffraction data using the direct-space approach. Both (1) and (2) adopt the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). These isomers show hydrogen bonds and rich pi-pi stacking, together with pi center dot center dot center dot H interactions, which are built by conjugated systems of coumarin and phenol rings. In the crystalline lattice, the packing of (1) and (3) are mainly stabilized through O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding between neighbouring coumarin molecules, while hydrogen bonds between coumarin and water molecules build the stable crystal structure of derivative (2). A big similarity in the skeletons of the IR spectra of these isomers was noticed. Derivative (2) exhibits two weak bands which were not present in the spectra of the other two derivatives, at 2370 and 2948 cm(-1), which can be assigned to the O-H vibrations of the solvent (H2O) trapped in the structure of (2). These aminocoumarin derivatives display absorption maxima in the visible region, attributed to pi-pi delocalization involving the whole electronic system of the compounds with a considerable charge-transfer character originating from the aminophenyl ring and pointing towards the coumarin system which is characterized by a high electron-accepting character. Additionally, the isolated molecular ground-state geometries were optimized at the PBE0/TZP level and the electronic properties, molecular electrostatic potential and Hirshfeld charges were determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the speed of sound in liquid methyl hexanoate was measured by the Brillouin light scattering method in the temperature range of 297.83-588.07 K and at pressures of up to 10 MPa. The relative uncertainty of the speed of sound experimental system is estimated to be less than 0.43%, and when considering the impurity of the sample, the relative uncertainty is 0.47%. The variation of the speed of sound with the temperature and pressure was analyzed.

Together with the study on the performance of the sensor, the characteristics of modified nanoclusters were investigated by UV-Vis and FTIR and the electrochemical characteristics of the electrode surface were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), respectively. It was demonstrated that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the modified electrode (Mb-MPA-AuNPs/Au) was 7862 ft, the exchange current density (i0) was 32.7 pA/cm(2). And a pair of reversible and symmetrical redox peaks appeared after the coordination of Cu2+, and the electrical signal response of Cue /Mb-AuNPs-MPA/Au reached the highest.

Conformer insecticide ensembles were modeled using the MMFF94s force field. Minimum energy conformers were employed to calculate structural parameters, which were related to the experimental pLC(50) values. Several statistical criteria of goodness of fit and predictivity were checked to validate the models. Robust and predictable MLR models were obtained. Further, the Phase module from Schrodinger suite was engaged in the generation of the ligand-based pharmacophore models. The atom-based 3D-QSAR module from the aforementioned software was used for the validation of a best four-point pharmacophore model.

28,"Quercetin (Qu), a noted polyphenolic flavonol molecule, exhibits remarkable antioxidant properties against bioenzymes like peroxidase and tyrosinase. However, it was found that under pH = 3.5-5.5 and room temperature, Qu cannot reduce hydrogen peroxide (HP) which is a well-perceived reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for oxidative stress. We found that in presence of noble-metal nano-particles, such redox interactions can be accomplished. We thus synthesized homogenous PVP-coated nano-platinum particles (PNP) to catalyze the oxidation of Qu by HP. On reaction, Qu is oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone (QQ) following the first-order kinetics. The observed rate constant, k(o), gradually increases and tends to saturate with increasing [HP](T) where T represents the analytical concentrations of the reactant. The saturation kinetics indicates that the activities of PNP resemble to that of bioenzymes and similarly, the nano-particles host the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The estimated value of the k(cat) reveals that the extent of catalysis of even 10(-10) M PNP is nearly comparable with the rate constants of oxidation of Qu in presence of enzymes like horseradish peroxidase and tyrosinase. Graphical abstract Quercetin (Qu) is a ubiquitous natural antioxidant. However, in acidic buffer media (pH = 3.5-5.5), hydrogen peroxide (HP) cannot oxidize Qu. Strikingly, in presence of nano-platinum particles (PNP), Qu is promptly oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone following the first-order kinetics. PNP hosts the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The saturation kinetics with respect to HP resembles to enzyme-like activities of PNP, and indeed, the calculated value of the rate constant, k(cat), is comparable with those of the rate constants of enzyme-mediated oxidation of Qu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to producing the mesophase pitch materials, the removal of complex low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the original petroleum pitch is essential. In the study, we have developed a two-step process using high pressure CO2 for separating the useful part with desired properties from the raw petroleum pitch sample. Firstly, a stepwise supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)) extraction process was employed for removing the lightest molecular weight fractions. The residual and CO2-insoluble fractions were further separated by a subcritical anti-solvent (SAS) process using CO2 at 25 degrees C and three high pressure conditions. A modified SAS apparatus was utilized in this study. The gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis system with standard calibrations was used to determine the molecular weight of various pitch samples. The GPC system was equipped with dual Ultraviolet (UV) and Refractive Index (RI) detectors. The polydispersity index (PDI) value of the raw petroleum pitch 6 (PP6) sample was 6.9, and it was reduced to 3.8 after the scCO(2) extraction and under the appropriate SAS processing pressure. The corresponding weight average molecular weight (M-w) was increased from 987 to 1493 g/mol. This study provides an effective separation and product identification method that only employs commonly used GPC analyses with dual UV and RI detectors. A useful screening method has been developed for selecting the most appropriate separation parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"Currently, there is no imaging procedure for radionuclide therapy utilizing Erbium-169 (Er-169). We have recently published the first post-radiosynovectomy imaging of Er-169 citrate in a case report (Farahati et al., 2017). In this study, we performed in-vitro and in-vivo studies to evaluate the feasibility to assess the distribution of Er-169 citrate after radiosynovectomy in fourteen patients with seventeen affected joints treated for refractory chronic synovitis. Post-radiosynovectomy imaging revealed the feasibility of post-radiosynovectomy detection and distribution utilizing Er-169 citrate in all cases. However, additional in-vitro studies including in-vitro imaging, gamma spectrometry and analysis of half-life indicated that emitted gamma-rays of the Ytterbium-169 in the radio-pharmaceutical together with bremsstrahlung induced by Er-169 are the imaging source of emitted counts. Post-radiosynovectomy imaging utilizing Er-169 citrate is feasible and should be implemented in the guidelines for theranostics for quality control, patient safety and therapy monitoring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was used to characterize and identify mixed selenium-sulfur compounds with the formula SenSm in synthetic selenium-sulfur melts and selenium-impacted sediments. This method shows strong fragmentation of SenSm compounds in the electron ionization source, which makes conclusive identification of discrete compounds difficult. Despite these limitations, three SenSm compounds (SeS4, SeS5, and SeS6) were identified conclusively in synthetic samples, and several others were shown to be mixed SeS compounds, without being able to determine a molecular formula. Three selenium-impacted sediments from sites containing similar total selenium concentrations (11.0-18.5 ppm) were extracted with carbon disulfide (CS2); each of the three sediments contained at least 12 SenSm compounds, ten of which were common to all three sediments. Two of the compounds identified in the synthetic samples were also found in all three sediments, SeS4 and SeS5, and a third, SeS6 was found in one sediment sample. This is the first time that cyclic SenSm compounds have been confirmed to exist in the environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"SrTiO3 nanopowders doped with various percentages of Fe (0, 1, 3, and 5 mol%) was synthesized, determining its chemical and structural properties using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of the samples were studied using hysteresis curves obtained by an alternating gradient magnetometer. Theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory are also performed to support experimental data. The results indicated that Fe incorporated into de SrTiO3 structure induced intrinsic magnetic properties, which increase as the Fe percentage increase. At 5 mol% of Fe in the sample showed a single-domain state, typical of a ferromagnetic material capable for information storage. This latter result would be due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies as more Fe was added and to the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions reinforced the magnetic behaviour of the compound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"Some processes such as air conditioning absorption systems have been developed as a feasible and economical alternative to help reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and prevent the impact of gas emission produced by electrical air conditioning. However, a main disadvantage of these systems is the absorbent's crystallization phenomenon in the working mixture, which occurs when the absorbent concentration is higher than the saturation point. Among the aqueous working mixtures, NaOH solution shows several advantages for absorption system applications. The aim of this paper is to propose new mathematical correlations to predict or estimate the NaOH concentrations and refractive index in aqueous solutions (H2O NaOH) for an air conditioning absorption system application. The experimental measurements of NaOH concentration and refractive index were made in situ from aqueous solutions with concentrations from 20 to 50% (weight/weight %, with increases of 5%) and temperatures between 10 and 60 C (with increments of 1 C). Two correlations for predicting the concentration of NaOH and refractive index based on cubic regression models with R2 of 0.99704 and 0.99918, respectively, are presented for the first time. The normalized error for NaOH estimation using experimental data lies between 0.026 and 0.040, and for refractive index, the estimation lies between 0.002 and 0.001. Both correlations present a good fit to predict the NaOH concentration between 25 and 45% of concentration ratio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"Heterocyclic moieties have become more interesting for chemists, pharmacologists, microbiologists, and other researchers owing to their indomitable biological potential as anti-infective agents. Among heterocyclic compounds, 1,2,3-triazole nucleus is one of the most important and well-known heterocycles. Triazole core is considered as essential structure in medicinal chemistry which is widely used to synthesize molecules with medical benefits. In this work, a set of triazole analogues were identified as anti-tubercular agents through a series of computer-aided drug design processes, including three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) modeling, molecular docking, and ADMET studies to determine properties of these new proposed drugs. The CoMFA and CoMSIA models employed for a training set of 25 compounds reliable values of Q(2) (0.63 and 0.65, respectively) and R-2 (0.85 and 0.71, respectively). These results indicate that the developed models possess good predictive ability. Based on the 3D-QSAR contours, new molecules with high predicted activities were designed. Moreover, surflex-docking was applied to highlight the important interactions between the ligand and mycobacterium tuberculosis receptor, supporting the stability of the predicted molecules in the receptor.

39,"As many studies have revealed, the introduction of a CF3 group into an organic compound can result in significant enhancement of biological activity. Factors which lead to this enhancement are thus of great interest. To investigate further this area, we have looked at the ability of fluorine to form close contacts with various atoms in organic compounds, e.g. F center dot center dot center dot F, F center dot center dot center dot O/O center dot center dot center dot F, F center dot center dot center dot C/C center dot center dot center dot F, H center dot center dot center dot F/F center dot center dot center dot H and F center dot center dot center dot N/N center dot center dot center dot F, as indicated from crystal structure determinations and Hirshfeld analysis studies on trifluoromethylated compounds. Herein we first report the crystal structures, Hirshfeld surface analyses (HSA), and PIXEL energy calculations of three trifluoromethylated quinoline derivatives, namely 2-(trifluoromethyl) quinolin-4-ol, 1, 4-ethoxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)quinoline, 2, and N-1-(2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinolin-4-yl)ethane-1,2-diamine, 3. Of particular interest is the determination of the various fluorine. atom close contacts. The total percentages of fluorine. -atom close contacts in compounds 1-3 were determined to be high at 47, 41.2 and 60.7%, respectively. As relatively few HSA studies on trifluoromethylated compounds have reported the percentages of individual atom atom close contacts, we have also determined the percentages of atom center dot center dot center dot atom close contacts for 20 more trifluoromethylated compounds: the range of total fluorine center dot center dot center dot atom close contacts for these compounds was 20-60%. While these data are based on connections between similar molecules in a crystalline state, they also clearly suggest that a compound containing CF3 group(s) has the potential to make extensive intermolecular connections/close contacts with organic material. Thus a possible factor for the enhanced biological activity of a compound bearing CF3 group(s) could be the propensity of the CF3 group to form many close contacts, thereby aiding binding or interaction with a biological target.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"In this paper, we demonstrate the formation of Schottky contact formed by Al with a new class of synthesized conjugated pure poly(Schiff base) (PSB) and its blend with varied concentrations of polyaniline (PANI). The Schottky behavior was transformed into Ohmic in the blended polymer. PSB was synthesized from the solution of polycondensation of terephthaloyl chloride (T) and 4-(4-hydroxybenzylideneamino)phenol (SB). The polymer showed good thermal stability with T-g of 312 degrees C as determined by thermal gravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry TGA-DSC and high molecular weight 3.5 x 10(5) (g/mol) with coiled conformation as determined by laser light scattering. PBS was blended with various weight percentage ratios of PANI (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 percent by weight of the pristine polymer). The metal contact (Au) was formed and studied in the temperature range of 293-373 K, which showed that Schottky behavior in the intrinsic polymer with an ideality factor was close to 2 and then reduced to 1.0-1.2 in the blended polymers. In blended polymers, the conduction across the junction was characterized by Schottky emission at low field and Poole-Frenkel emission at high field. The Schottky barrier height showed a small increase with temperature, which was attributed to reduction in the built up of image charge. The Schottky and Poole-Frenkel emission coefficients were also determined and Schottky emission coefficient agreed with the theoretical value, while Poole-Frenkel emission coefficient was small. In short, the metal-semiconductor junction was affected by the blending, while conduction within the polymer remained independent of PANI concentration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"The structure of periodic metallic slits with asymmetric binary grooves is proposed to reduce the width of the transmission peak due to the similar Fabry-Perot (F-P) resonances. It is well known that the F-P resonance in a slit can enhance the transmission and performs as a peak in the spectrum. However, the groove F-P resonance appeared as a dip in the spectrum. In the proposed structure, by coupling the slit and the groove modes, the width of transmission peak can be reduced due to the two dips introduced by the asymmetric binary grooves. The proposed plasmonic structure is promising in application of improving the quality factor, sensing sensitivity, and narrow band filters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"In this research, we focused on the tuning of the absorption properties of acceptor materials based on naphthothiophene diimide (NTI) with a triad structures (NTI-pi-NTI) by modifying the central pi-unit. Novel NTI-based acceptors with a spirobifluorene (SF) unit (SF-NTIs) were designed and synthesized. Their absorption range (400-600 nm) were clearly different from that of previously reported acceptor with a NTI-indacenodithiophene-NTI structure (IDT-NTI, 650-800 nm). Although, the SF-NTI with the same solubilizing groups as IDT-NTI (2-ethylhexyl groups) is not soluble enough for solution processes and favorable molecular orientation properties for OSC devices, the 1-hexylheptyl substituted SF-NTI showed a good solubility and favorable ""face-on"" orientation in the active layer films. The fabricated OSCs showed power conversion efficiency as high as 5.2%, and excellent thermal stability. These results indicate that the absorption of the NTI-triads can be tuned by modifying the central pi-unit and that their orientation nature and solubility can be controlled by altering the alkyl groups on the imide moieties. These properties allow us to develop efficient NTI-based acceptors with various absorption ranges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work is to study the importance of the cyclization conditions of the lactam ring on the purity and yield of the final compounds. For this purpose, replacing L-Thr10 with L-Asp allowed the application of different cyclization methodologies. In all analogues, the Dab5,8,9 residues were replaced with Arg, while the Dab4 residue involved in lactam cyclization was replaced with Lys. Modification of the linear tripeptide tail was applied to two of the analogues. The obtained compounds were characterized with different spectroscopic techniques and will be tested for their antimicrobial activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"Metabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of all metabolites and intermediate products of reactions present within a biological system, is a promising field to enable precision medicine. Clinical metabolomics faces two main challenges at the bioanalytical level. The first is the need for high resolution to obtain maximum metabolome coverage. This is exemplified by the latest version of the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), which reports more than 110,000 metabolites and endogenous compounds. The second is the high-throughput needed to enable the analysis of a large number of samples typically encountered in large-scale cohort studies. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC)-at regular or ultrahigh pressures-combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has long been considered the ""gold standard"" in metabolomics. However, these conventional reversed-phase LC-MS approaches are no longer sufficient to analyze the vast variety of polar compounds, as well as discriminate closely related compounds such as isomers or enantiomers. This review article discusses the novel separation and detection strategies that are considered promising in clinical metabolomics to enhance the metabolome coverage. It includes hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), multidimensional LC approaches, as well as ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) analysis methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"The modification of the structural and surface characteristics of Ti1-xZrxO2 nanocrystallites by post-synthesis treatments is revealed as an effective way to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Starting with the same batch of mixed oxide prepared from reverse microemulsions, different photocatalysts have been obtained by either solvothermal treatment, calcination or a combination of both. Extensive physicochemical characterization of the resulting materials shows that solvothermally treated oxides present lower crystallite size and larger surface area, although without previous calcination these samples appear to have a higher degree of structural disorder. These differences are sharply reflected in the changes in photocatalytic activity for the removal of methylcyclohexane (MCH) and toluene vapours at relatively high concentrations. Thus, the best performance for MCH elimination is obtained with the photocatalysts prepared by calcination and subsequent solvothermal treatment. Following this procedure, the resulting Ti1-xZrxO2 material presents larger surface area and high Zr surface concentration with minimal disturbance of the anatase structure. In contrast, for toluene photooxidation, the solvothermally prepared sample shows improved performance, most likely due to its larger surface area, which contributes to hinder deactivation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"In this article, hybrid functional B3LYP method is used to construct the reactant structure of energetic components in propellant at the bhandhlyp/6-31 g(d) level, and to calculate the closed-shell layer of the system. At the bhandhlyp/6-31g(d) level, the energy difference (activation energy) between the transition state and the reactant was calculated and the reaction mechanism between energetic components was analyzed. It is found that the O-30 atom of RDX first breaks off from the nitro group and is easier to break away from RDX and interact with the vertex atom Al-1 of the Al-13 cluster. With the further separation of O-30, it also acts with Al-11 until it completely breaks away from N-26 atom. The activation energy of this reaction is 56.448 x 10(3) J mol(-1). The oxygen dioxide atom in ammonium perchlorate is more likely to interact with the Al-11 atom of the Al-13 cluster.

47,"Exploring hybrid gap surface plasmon polariton waveguides (HGSPPWs) is an important milestone in developing the nextgeneration, nanoscale integrated photonic circuit technology. To advance their potential applications, HGSPPWs are required to have tunable capability, highly reliable, simple fabrication process, and feasible integration. In this paper, we propose two tunable HGSPPWs fulfilling the requirements. The proposed HGSPPWs consist of a metallic wedge laterally coupled with a dielectric waveguide. The modal characteristics of HGSPPWs are investigated at the optical telecommunication wavelength, which shows the modal characteristics could be effectively controlled by tuning the key geometry parameters and structure of HGSPPWs. The propagation length could achieve the centimeter scale while maintaining the propagation mode size at the deep-subwavelength scale (similar to lambda(2)/10(5)). The studies on fabrication tolerance and waveguide crosstalk show their robust property for practical implementations. The effective tunable mechanism is also proposed and studied, which shows remarkable feasibility to realize multifunctional plasmon-based photonic components. Compared with the conventional HGSPPWs, the proposed HGSPPWs exhibit superior features in ultralow loss deep-subwavelength light guiding, are highly reliable, and are easy to integrate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"A proof of concept for a novel approach towards enantiomerically highly enriched acyclic secondary amines and beta-aminothiols as non-cyclic target molecules when starting from 3-thiazolines as heterocycles is presented.

49,"The minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) is one of the crucial and substantial parameters in the gas injection projects for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This parameter indicates the minimum pressure at constant temperature and composition conditions for reaching 100 percent of the oil production recovery, which leads to a huge economic income. Therefore, an inaccurate prediction of the MMP may lead to increase the costs of oil production. Among the various methods for prediction of the MMP: slim-tube experiment, slim-tube simulation techniques and their simplified cell-to-cell could be considered as the most accurate methods. Although the experimental methods for calculation of the MMP take into account the real crude oil, but they are always expensive; therefore, thermodynamic simulation is a better way for the estimation of this parameter. Indeed, the analytical methods are fast and some of them like multiple mixing-cell method used in this study lead to the reliable results and often show good agreements with the experimental methods. A combination of multiple mixing-cell model proposed by Ahmadi-Johns and pressure-temperature (P-T) flash calculations including the PC-SAFT equation of state (EoS), and the cubic equations of state of Peng-Robinson (PR) and Esmaeilzadeh-Roshanfekr (ER) were used in this work for the prediction of MMP. The overall AAD% of the PC-SAFT, PR and ER EoSs were 3.49%, 6.32% and 7.59%, respectively. It is concluded that the SAFT EoS can decrease the AAD of MMP calculation by about 50%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,"beta -Cyclodextrins (beta -CD) are widely used in multiple fields such as medicine, agriculture, alimentation, and cosmetics because their hydrophobic cavity enables the formation of inclusion complexes with various organic compounds to improve their performances. There are three types of methylated beta -CDs (M-beta -CDs) on the market, prepared by the introduction of methyl groups on various sites: 2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-beta -CD (TM-beta -CD), 2,6-di-O-methyl-beta -CD (DM-beta -CD), and randomly methyl-beta -CD (RM-beta -CD). M-beta -CDs are now used in medical as well as non-medical systems due to their significant water solubility compared to beta -CD and unique amphiphilic property in water and organic solvents despite the possibility of tissue damage from nephrotoxicity. It is important to investigate the degree of substitution of M-beta -CDs by methyl groups for further applications in a wide range of fields. Studies investigating the substitution degree of M-beta -CDs have been carried out for many years. The aim of this study is to analyze the tendency of substitution number of methyl group in RM-beta -CD, as a simpler analysis method. First, we analyzed RM-beta -CD with simple methods such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) using a refractive index detector (RID) that is widely used for the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of sugars.

60,"It is of great importance to separate potassium salts from carbonate-based lakes, especially the low-[K+] but high-[Nal brine which has been discovered around the world. Here the phase diagram of the quaternary system Na+, K+/Cl-, CO32--H2O was experimentally studied at 298.15 K via the method of isothermal evaporation, and the results corrected the previous diagram reported by Blasdale (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1923, 45, 2935-2946). The type of salts appeared and their solubility during the evaporation, and the density vs composition diagram and the pH values were plotted based on the experimental data. It was found that there were six invariant points, seven univariant curves, and five crystallization fields in the equilibrium phase diagram. To extract single-salt of potassium, certain areas in the Na+, K+//C1-, C032 --H2O diagram were chosen to be acidified by the compressed CO2, and potassium in the form of KHCO3 was precipitated from the mother solution. The compressed CO2 was able to avoid formation of NaKCO3.6H2O during evaporation of the original system Na+, K+//C1-, CO32--H2O. Based on experiment data, the region area for potassium salt extraction was determined, and this area was suitable for extracting K+ salts from brines with a [Na+/ICl ratio even lower than 0.44.

However, the gradient heterojunction has yet been studied due to the complicated process and great random error inside. Especially in the field of transient optics, the light on/off in femto/picosecond range is vitally important for high-speed optical systems, such as application in fiber communications. In this paper, the wedge-structured organic heterojunction was fabricated based on molecular beam epitaxy. The devices were combined with both wedge-structured heterojunction and half-wave plate. When the probe light was tuned to 2.0 eV, a narrow passband was instantly observed once the pump and probe light were perpendicular to each other.

In fact, a strong correlation between the EFG values, especially at the La site, and the Jahn-Teller distortion was found and used to confirm the importance of an appropriate description of the electron-electron correlations when predicting the ground state properties of LaMnO3 using a GGA + U approximation for the exchange-correlation functional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,"This article presents the synthesis of a series of amides, based on the interaction of several 3-aminospirohydantoins with nalidixic acid. The target compounds were characterized by physicochemical parameters, IR, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of the products obtained was determined against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella abony, the yeasts Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the molds Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus niger. The relationship between structure and biological activity of the products obtained was discussed. It was found that the most effective compounds are tetralin (5f) and indane (5g) derivatives, which exhibit a pronounced antimicrobial activity against both tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"Dependence of amplification A of the tunnel current in the electrochemical bridged tunneling junction on the bias voltage V-b, reorganization free energy E-r, the broadening A of the electronic level of the redox molecule (RM) and intensity of the Debye screening in the tunneling gap is studied for the cases of the fully adiabatic and partially adiabatic electron transitions. We consider a one-level single RM within the spin-less model and assume the wide-band approximation for the electronic structure of the working electrodes. It is shown that amplification in the fully and partially adiabatic limits is appreciably smaller than that in the diabatic limit studied earlier [I.G. Medvedev, Electrochim. Acta 186 (2015) 613-623] due to the sufficiently large values of the broadening Delta. It is also shown that, in contrast to the diabatic limit, amplification depends weekly on the asymmetry of the coupling of the RM to the working electrodes. On the other hand, similar to the diabatic limit, amplification as a function of the bias voltage V-b approaches to relatively large values at large values of V-b in the case of the full Debye screening while, in the realistic case of the intermediate Debye screening, amplification increases at first with the increase of V-b, then reaches a maximum value A(max) at some value V-b max and, when V-b farther increases, decreases to A = 1. The functions A(V-b) are calculated for different values of the parameters of the tunneling junction and it is shown that A(max) increases with the increase of E-r and the intensity of Debye screening and decrease with the increase of Delta. The approximate analytical expression which shows in the explicit form the dependence of A on the parameters of the system is presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"The observed linear thermal shifts of ten fluorescence peaks Y-1-Y-10 from room temperature to about 1000 K for Y3Al5O12:Sm3+ (grown by the Czochralski method) were investigated by considering both the static effect owing to lattice thermal expansion and the dynamic effect stemming from electron-phonon interaction. The static effects were acquired by, using the pressure dependences of these fluorescence peak positions. The static effects for the ten fluorescence peaks resulted in thermal blue shift, but the dynamic effects for all peaks except Y-7 led to thermal red shift. The observed nature of thermal shift (i.e. red or blue) of a fluorescence peak was due to competition between the static and dynamic effects. Based on an approximate treatment, the static parameter A (characterizing the static effect) and electron-phonon coupling parameter alpha' (characterizing the dynamic effect) for these fluorescence peaks were estimated in the case where therrhal shift curves from low temperature to near or higher than room temperature were not measured. Parameters A for all fluorescence peaks and alpha' for all peaks except Y-7 were comparable in sign and magnitude with those of the sharp luminescence peaks of other rare earth ions in crystals and so were deemed to be reasonable. The causes of the exception for alpha' of Y-7 spectral peak (including the very large observed thermal blue shift of this peak) remain unclear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"The coordination chemistry of platinum (Pt) covers a huge field as shown by a recent survey covering the crystallographic and structural data of almost 200 monomeric examples of the Pt(eta(2)-P2L)Cl-2 type. About 20% of these complexes exist as isomers and are discussed in this review. Included are distortion (64%), cis-trans (20%), and ligand (16%) isomers. These are discussed in terms of the metallocyclic rings, and coordinations are drawn between donor atoms, bond lengths, and interbond angles, with attention to any trans-influence. Distortion isomers, differing only by the degree of distortion in Pt-L and L-Pt-L angles, are the most numerous. In this series of distortion and ligand isomers, the squareplanar configuration about the Pt(II) atom has only cis-configuration.

74,"The interaction of a nucleoside analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) with human serum albumin (HSA) was studied to investigate the binding phenomenon and analyse the protein conformation upon BrdU binding. Multiple spectroscopic techniques, viz. intrinsic and 3-D fluorescence, UV-Vis absorption, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy along with molecular docking were used. Decrease in the Stern-Volmer constant (K-sv) as well as the association constant (K-a) with increase in temperature suggested BrdU-HSA complex formation. Intermediate binding affinity between BrdU and HSA was evident from the K-a values (2.49-3.97 x 10(4) mol(-1) dm(3)), while BrdU-HSA complex formation was driven by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions along with hydrogen bonds, as revealed by thermodynamic data (Delta S = + 28.48 J mol(-1) K-1; Delta H = - 17.16 kJ mol(-1)). Minor changes occur in both secondary and tertiary structures as well as in the fluorophores' microenvironment of HSA, as recognized from the CD spectral results in the far-UV and the near-UV regions and 3-D fluorescence spectra, respectively. Use of site markers (warfarin and indomethacin for site I; diazepam for site II) as well as docking results suggested BrdU binding to both site I (more preferred) and site II, located in subdomains IIA and IIIA, respectively, of HSA.

Salicylic acid was complexed with phospholipid through simple mixing and incorporated into carbopol 940 gel containing drug-loaded vesicles, prepared by thin-film hydration method. The morphology, physicochemical properties, rheological behavior, release profile, and dermatokinetics of developed gel were compared with control gel (developed gel without keratolytic agent). In ex vivo drug release studies across the rat skin, there was significant increase in the steady-state permeation flux (J(ss)) and skin retention of drug from developed gel in comparison with control. Therewas favorable change in almost every evaluated dermatokinetic parameter. The innocuous nature of control gel had not changed on addition of skin structure-altering agent.

Two minima were found on the potential energy surface (PES) for each complex, one in which HF is forming directly an H-bond with pnicogen while the other one in which HF is interacting with the heterocyclic ring in addition to normal H-bond. The latter one is highly stable with MP2/CBS extrapolated binding energies ranging from -10.67 kcal mol(-1) to -6.33 kcal mol(-1). The interaction energies in these complexes follow the order P-PyrHF > P-ThioHF > P-FuHF > P-PyHF > As-PyrHF > As-ThioHF > As-FuHF > As-PyHF. NBO analysis demonstrated that LPAs/P -> sigma H-F orbital interaction plays a major role in stabilizing these complexes, and the largest charge is transferred in P-type complexes compared with their As-type analogs. The LMO-EDA pointed out that all the partitioning terms are stabilizing in nature with a dominant role carried out by exchange energy while as the repulsion energy is the only term being destabilizing in nature.

Material safety should be considered in biomedical devices, but the effectiveness of electrospun nanofibers is limited with only the approved chemicals. Therefore, we considered the material in FDA-approved polymers and solvents and developed nanofibers using the general additives in the pharmaceutical industry, such as hypromellose, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and Gellan. The nanofiber, mainly composed of hypromellose and PVA, was applied to a local peptide drug delivery system. Electrostatically complexed Gellan and peptide were loaded in the nanofiber by co-electrospinning. The morphology of the nanofibers with different PVA blending ratios was visualized by scanning electron microscope. The nanofiber composed of only hydrophilic polymers quickly wetted in water and became a transparent gel-like lump. A drug release test of peptide-loaded nanofiber was performed resulted in 37% of initial burst release suppression with the gellan and peptide loaded nanofiber compared with solely peptide loaded hypromellose nanofiber. In addition, higher PVA blending to hypromellose was slightly effective for sustained release of peptide compared with pure peptide-loaded hypromellose nanofiber. Therefore, we suggest the potential application of hypromellose/PVA nanofiber-loaded Gellan/peptide complex to a mucosal layer drug delivery patch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

91,"DNA levels in mitochondria are closely related to serious genetic diseases, but their inherently low levels and high dynamic changes, present great obstacles to the precise detection of trace changes of DNA content in mitochondria, especially for living cells. This work aims to precisely detect DNA in mitochondria of living cells, by using ultrasmall fluorescent hybrid Ag2Se-imide nanodots (NDs) ( < 3.0 nm, negative surface charge zeta = - 29.2 mV) with signal amplification. The hybrid NDs are constructed by integrating naphthalene fluorophore in the Ag2Se core with a modified layer of chitooligosaccharide and bovine serum albumin (ACBH). The lowest detection for DNA is as low as 107.5 ng mL(-1). On the basis of multiple synergistic interactions, ACBH can specifically bind to mitochondrial DNA of living cells. ACBH can also emit an amplified signal (163-fold), which is beneficial for sensitivity analysis. Given its high sensitivity and selectivity, as well as signal amplification, ACBH can be used to in situ image trace DNA in the mitochondria of living cells. In particular, ACBH has been successfully used to sort different cell cycle stages under high-throughput. We expect the proposed ACBH probe to provide comprehensive information for the analysis of trace DNA in mitochondria and guide the early diagnosis of mitochondria-related genetic diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, electrochemical reaction of coenzyme Q(0) (CoQ(0)) on the gold electrode was studied by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). A high vacuum compatible microfluidic electrochemical cell was fabricated for the electrochemical study of CoQ(0). Then, a micro-hole with diameter of 2 mu m was fabricated on the electrochemical cell by the primary ion beam of ToF-SIMS for the subsequent analysis. To evaluate the feasibility of ToF-SIMS for liquid sample measurement, the chemical distribution of CoQ(0) and the SiN- around the micro-hole were measured. The stable distribution of CoQ(0) and the SiN- during the ToF-SIMS measurement indicated that the microfluidic electrochemical cell was compatible for the in-situ detection of the electrode-electrolyte interface in high vacuum environment (1 x 10(-5) Pa). Electrochemical behavior of CoQ(0) in the electrochemical cell was further studied. The variations of CoQ(0), CoQ(0)H(2) and related intermediate at different potentials agreed well with the electrochemical reaction of CoQ(0) in aqueous solution, which showed that the direct molecular evidence of the electrode-electrolyte interface was obtained. The direct monitoring of electrode-electrolyte interface by ToF-SIMS revealed the electrochemical evolution on the electrode at molecular level, which was of great potential for the detailed understanding of the electrochemical reaction mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"A heterometallic trinuclear complex with three metal-metal bonds, which is constituted of three kinds of metal-ligand units bridged by two sulfido ligands, reacts with a 2-electron donor to afford an adduct accompanied with elongation of the metalmetal bonds. Cyclic voltammograms of the complexes showed that the adduct releases the 2-electron donor after electrochemical 1-electron reduction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"Novel calamitic liquid crystals with asymmetrically substituted structure base on the dibenzo[c,h][2,6]naphthyridine (DBN) moiety as an electron-deficient core, 2-(4-decylphenyl)dibenzo[c,h][2,6]-naphthyridine (C10-Ph-DBN), 2-chloro-8-decyl-DBN (Cl-DBN-C10) and 2-decyl-8-phenyl-DBN (Ph-DBN-C10), were synthesized and their carrier transport properties were investigated. The lower ordered smectic phase of SmA emerged in a very wide temperature range of 130 degrees C in all DBN derivatives, which allowed us to study the carrier transport properties in SmA phase in detail for the first time: we purified Cl-DBN-C10 enough to evaluate the carrier transport property in the SmA phase by time-of-flight method. It showed the temperature and electric field dependence of the mobility, indicating the energetic disorder of transport levels. We analyzed it within the framework of the Gaussian disorder model for electrons and obtained a Gaussian width of the density of states to 109meV in the SmA. This is the first experimental result analyzed for the SmA phase in calamitic liquid crystals with nonnegligible dipole moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"The cationic water-pillar[5] arene (CP5A) modified zeolite (NZ) was prepared for adsorption of anionic dye bromocresol purple (BCP). The CP5A/NZ was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The effects of NZ particle size, concentration of CP5A during modification, adsorption time, initial BCP concentration and solution pH on the removal percentage of BCP were studied. In addition, the kinetics and adsorption isotherms of BCP adsorption by CP5A/NZ were also analyzed, and the adsorption mechanism was discussed. SEM showed that the scaly structure of the NZ disappeared after CP5A modification, showing an enlarged bulk structure. The vibration of CH3-N+ and -CH2-N+ in CP5A appeared in the CP5A/NZ. XRD revealed that the zeolite had different crystal structure after CP5A modification, and all of the above phenomena indicated that CP5A was successfully loaded into the NZ. Adsorption studies showed that due to charge repulsion, NZ had no scavenging ability to BCP. However, when CP5A solution (10 g/L) was used to modify NZ in the range of 0.42-0.59 nm, the removal percentage of BCP was 93.98%, and the adsorption reached equilibrium in 300 min. CP5A/NZ had a high removal percentage when treated with low concentrations (< 100 mg/L) of BCP solution. The second-order kinetic equation and the Langmuir isotherm could better fit the adsorption process of CP5A/NZ to BCP. The adsorption mechanism of CP5A/NZ on BCP could be described as follows: after the cation exchange of CH2-N+ with NZ in CP5A, -CH2-N+ bound to the negative potential point on the surface of NZ, which increased the positive charge activity adsorption site of NZ surface, and thus the anion dye BCP had good scavenging ability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"A novel three-dimensional coordination polymer, namely, poly[[diaquabis(4,40-bipyridine)bis{3-5-[(2-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]isophthalato}tricadmium(III)] dimethylformamide monosolvate 2.5-hydrate], {[Cd-3(C16H9O7)(2)(C10H8N2)(2)(H2O)(2)](2)C3H7NO5H2O}(n), was obtained by the reaction of ether-linked 5-[(2-carboxyphenoxy)methyl]isophthalic acid (H3L) with CdII salts in the presence of 4,40-bipyridine (bpy) under solvothermal conditions. In this complex, the CdII centres are connected by the carboxylate ligands to form two-dimensional wave-like layers, which are pillared by bpy ligands and extended into a rare three-dimensional (3,6)-connected sqc27 framework. The complex demonstrated good water stability and strong luminescence emissions. It not only possesses excellent luminescence sensing activities toward Fe3+ and Cr2O72 in aqueous solution, but can also distinguish between Cr2O72 and CrO42 by luminescence. Furthermore, it could be simply and quickly regenerated at least five times. A study of the sensing mechanism indicated that luminescence quenching may be related to the energy competition between the complex and sensing analytes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
