0,"Pyrazolines are important agents in medicinal chemistry as a promising scaffold for structural modification and drug development studies due to their wide range of biological activities such as anticancer, antifungal, antibacterial, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antitubercular, antioxidant, antileishmanial and antiinflammatory activity. These heterocyclic compounds can be prepared by refluxing chalcone with hydrazine hydrate and anhydrous sodium acetate in the presence of glacial acetic acid. The structural characterization, molecular and crystalline structure, of these organic compounds, allows studying their biological properties to know their potential applications. Hence the use of XRPD is very important because it allows obtaining a record to be used as a method of identification. The aim of this investigation was to obtain and reported good quality X-ray powder diffraction data the pyrazoline compound 1-(3-(4-iodophenyl)-5-(3-methyl thiophen-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethan-1-one, which could be used as potential anti-microbial and anti-cancer agent.

1,"Conveyor belts of special importance must have superior mechanical characteristics. The joining by vulcanization of the conveyor belts allows to obtain superior performances, but it has been found that at the vulcanizing joint of the conveyor belts, there is a ""bell""-type defect. This type of defect can cause the quick removal of the conveyor belts from use; thus, within this paper, we realized the constructive optimization of vulcanization installations using the finite element method (FEM). Thus, the FEM analysis was performed for the installation used at the present time, which has four spacers for stiffening, moving to the next stage to a stiffening system with seven spacers and, in the last stage, it was proposed to use a stiffening plate. The joined conveyor belts were of type ST 2000, and by the constructive optimization of the vulcanizing press type DSLQ, the bell-type defect was greatly reduced. Also, an analysis of the effects that the constructive optimization of the vulcanization installation has on the resistance to extraction of the metallic insert from the rubber matrix of the costs determined by the proposed constructive modifications, has been performed.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
2,"The complete oxidation of ethane in the presence of catalysts containing 1, 3, and 5 wt % CuO deposited on four supports (zirconia, sulfated zirconia, tungstated zirconia, and La2O3-stabilized zirconia) is studied. The supports and the catalysts are characterized via BET, XRD, and thermal analysis. It is shown that 100% conversion of ethane is achieved even at a temperature of 300 degrees C. It is found that the temperature of 100% conversion falls upon an increase in the copper content; the lowest temperature is obtained for catalysts based on unmodified zirconia. With respect to catalytic activity, the samples with the highest copper content are in the order 5%Cu/ZrO2 > 5%Cu/5%La2O3/ZrO2 > 5%Cu/15%WO3/ZrO2 > 5%Cu/5%SO4/ZrO2.

3,"The microcapsule nanoparticles were prepared by in-situ copolymerization of hydrotalcites (MAH) with the polymer (MF, PF, PS and PU) monomers, respectively, where the MF-wrapped MAH (MAH@MF) had the best monodispersity. The composites of the microcapsules and EVA were prepared by incorporating the microcapsule nanoparticles into ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), respectively. To further understand the intrinsic correlation between microcapsule fillers and EVA matrix, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was introduced to qualitatively analyze the contribution of microcapsule fillers on improving compatibility and mechanical properties of the EVA matrix. The compatibility of microcapsule nanoparticles with EVA matrix were detected in sequence through SEM, DSC and tensile strength tests. And the combustion, thermal behavior and flame retardance were also characterized by TG analyses as well as LOI and UL-94 level. As a result, the MAH@MF filler had the best performances in improving the flame retardancy and mechanical properties among the microcapsule fillers, attributed to high compatibility of the MAH@MF and EVA matrix, which made uniform distribution of the MAH@MF filler due to the reciprocity of triazine functional ring with vinyl acetate linkages.",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
4,"It is well known that ions play important roles in our life sciences, and the detection of ions has attracted more and more attention. In this work, we focus on the sensing response mechanism of a novel fluoride chemosensor, 4-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)isophthalaldehyde (BIPA). Based on density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory methods, we clarify that fluoride anions could trigger the cleavage reaction of the Si-O bond of BIPA in the ground state. And, the potential energy curve of desilylation process reveals the rapid response to fluoride anions. Comparing the binding energies between fluoride anions and other anions, we confirm that only the fluoride anions could be detected using the BIPA chemosensor in ethanol solvent. Considering the photo-excitation process, we find the strong intramolecular charge transfer process for the S-0 -> S-1 transition could explain the red shift of the absorption spectra of the BIPA system. This work not only clarifies the specific fluoride-sensing mechanism, but also plays a role in facilitating designing and synthesizing of novel fluorescent sensors in future.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes
5,"A new type of catanionic surfactant phosphonium benzene sulfonate was synthesized by quaternization of triphenyl phosphine with dimethyl carbonate and followed by anion exchange with alkyl benzene sulfonic acid. The molecular structure was characterized by FT-IR, H-1-NMR, and P-31-NMR. The thermal stability of phosphonium benzene sulfonate was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Its surface properties were studied systematically through equilibrium surface tension, electrical conductivity, and dynamic surface tension measurements. The wettability, foam properties, and emulsification of phosphonium benzene sulfonate were estimated in this paper. TGA results revealed that it has an excellent thermostability and could be used below 350 degrees C. Equilibrium surface tension results indicated that it has a low critical micelle concentration (CMC, about 0.10 mmol/L), lower than that of ammonium benzene sulfonate and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate. Furthermore, the micellization of phosphonium benzene sulfonate in aqueous solution is an entropy-driven spontaneous process. The adsorption process of phosphonium benzenesulfonate at the air-liquid interface is controlled by hybrid kinetic adsorption. Moreover, it has excellent wetting and emulsifying properties and low foam properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"While certain residues have clear involvement in determining the 3D structure of a macromolecule because they affect the folding topology or the overall protein stability, the role of different residues in ligand accommodation and binding has attracted less attention. On the basis of the assumption that drug-binding sites on target molecules have specific amino acid compositions, the incidence of each standard amino acid at the binding sites of small molecules and their correlations are calculated for an unprecedented large set of high-quality X-ray structures. Results show, for the first time, strong and highly correlated enrichments of aromatic and sulfur-containing residues, which play an important role in ligand binding and shape the nature of the chemical interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Novel and efficient synthetic strategies are developed for the first synthesis of two new impurities found in obeticholic acid. The synthetic routes to the impurities are designed without column purification using 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride as a selective protecting group. The impurities, which are obtained in good yields and high purity, are identified and characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared, one-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1, C-13, distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer), and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (Correlated Spectroscopy, heteronuclear single quantum coherence, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation, and rotating-frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy) techniques.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"This work proposes a new method for the determination of phenanthrene (FEN) in aqueous medium with a cobalt phthalocyanine modified glassy carbon electrode (ECV / CoPc), using Differential Pulse Voltammetry (VPD), whose oxidation of FEN occurs between 1,3 and 1,4 V. The electrode was modified with a 1x10(-3) mol.L-1 CoPc methanolic solution containing 10% Nafion. For voltammetric measurements in Differential Pulse mode, an amplitude of 0.7V and a scan rate of 0.04V s(-1) were used. Experimental parameters were optimized for the purpose of determination of FEN in groundwater collected in a water well of a Sao Luis-MA fuel station. Under these optimized conditions, an analytical curve was obtained in the 0.49 to 2,4 mu M concentration range, with a detection limit of 1,2 x 10(-10) mol.L-1. The method was applied to a real groundwater sample from a water well located at a fuel station, and an average concentration of 0.037 mu M FEN was found (n = 5), presenting a variation coefficient of 0.88, indicating good precision. Accuracy was assessed by the recovery test, whose average value was 99.9%. These results indicate that the proposed procedure is a good alternative for the analysis of FEN in natural water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,"Previous studies on Passiflora edulis (sour passion fruit) rinds reported some biological activities and there is a growing interest on rinds flour as a possible functional food, but its alkaloid composition was not detailed investigated. This work reports on for the first time in the literature the identification of norharman in P. edulis rinds, by using stir bar sorptive extraction combined with ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry [SBSE(EG-Silicone)-UFLC-MS/MS)]. This beta-carboline alkaloid is suspected to be neurotoxic. Therefore, another purpose of this study was to develop methods of targeted quantification of norharman in P. edulis rinds extracts using polydimethylsiloxane as stationary phase (SBSE(PDMS)) and a copolymer of polydimethylsiloxane and polyethylene glycol as stationary phase (SBSE(EG-Silicone)) combined with high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-Flu) and ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/ MS). Norharman extraction by SBSE(PDMS) and SBSE(EG-Silicone) was optimized and compared, and the analytical performance of SBSE(EG-Silicone) method was superior to that of SBSE(PDMS). The analysis of a sample of dried P. edulis rind indicated (332.16 +/- 8.43) pg g(-1) of norharman.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"A high-pressure/high-temperature experiment at 7.5 GPa and 1673 K led to the formation of the new compound beta-Y2B4O9. In contrast to the already known polymorph alpha-Y2B4O9, which crystallizes in the space group C2/c, the reported structure could be solved via single-crystal X-ray diffraction in the triclinic space group P1 over bar (no. 2) and is isotypic to the already known lanthanide borates beta-Dy2B4O9 and beta-Gd2B4O9.

12,"The behavior of gaseous components of forest soil was assessed by simultaneous monitoring of Rn-222, CO2 and its carbon isotopes (delta C-13, Delta C-14) in soil air under a semi natural forest in northern Japan. The isotope ratio of C-14 (Delta C-14) in soil air CO2 was found to decrease towards late summer, suggesting gradual depletion of easily decomposed soil organic matter. There was a specific case that soil air CO2 with depleted C-14 appeared suddenly under snowpack in winter. It is not always appropriate to use soil Rn-222 as a tracer of CO2 efflux from the soil surface to the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Modular allosteric aptamers with discrete recognition and signaling regions provide a facile method of carrying out label-free detection by forgoing complex target labeling requirements. Herein, we describe the design and function of an aptamer scaffold capable of forming a hairpin loop in the presence of FAD (the signaling trigger). The aptamer includes a recognition region for the microRNA (miR) Let-7i. Upon selective miR hybridization, the aptamer undergoes a conformational shift to release FAD and thus produce a measurable response. As a result, the described method can sensitively and selectively detect miR Let-7i with a wide linear range of 0.1 pM to 1 mu M and a detection limit of 150 fM. Additionally, this strategy was able to selectively discriminate between sequences with 1- and 2-nucleotide (nt) differences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"The mechanical properties of protective powder coatings based on epoxy-polyester applied to steel substrates were studied. The mechanical characteristics of coatings, as well as their influence on the behavior of samples under mechanical loading, were determined. Tests of samples with coatings, created by Nano indentation methods, with subsequent processing of experimental data using standard analytical simplified models and using numerical finite element modeling were performed. In tensile tests it was demonstrated that presence of coatings leads to changes in the nature of fracture of the samples. In stability tests, the results of experimental data were compared with the results of analytical and numerical calculations, which demonstrated the effect of coatings on the stability of thin-walled samples. The mechanical properties of samples with coatings on one or both sides of the sample were studied, which also confirmed the elastic modulus of the studied coatings at a level of up to 10 GPa (with the average value for bulk materials up to 3.5 GPa). In the process of testing at elevated temperature, the importance of ensuring tight clamping of the samples was established, in the absence of which significant increase in the measurement error takes place. Due to temperature deformations, stiffness of the samples is reduced and, accordingly, deviate from conditions assumed in calculations. The results obtained are aimed at developing an understanding about mechanical properties, as well as about methods for changing and calculating mechanical properties, thin protective coatings used in various industries and, in particular, a wide class of coatings used to protect aircraft structural components from corrosion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Ultrasonography (US) findings and Doppler sonography of renal vessels can provide useful information on the structural and vascular supply of patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). The purpose of this study was to compare the US findings of patients with diabetic nephropathy with the pathologic findings of their renal biopsy. In this descriptive study, US parameters including resistivity index (RI), renal size and volume and cortical and medullary echogenicity, and histopathological findings of renal biopsy (fibrosis, inflammation and chronicity) of 60 patients (27 women and 33 men) with diabetic nephropathy admitted in Hasheminejad kidney center (HKC) of Tehran were extracted and analyzed. Of 60 patients, interstitial fibrosis (IF) in 47 patients, interstitial inflammation (II) in 50 patients and signs of chronicity in 43 patients in pathology report were observed. Patients with IF had larger renal length, higher sinus volume, coarse echogenicity, and abnormal medullary echogenicity, significantly. The presence of II was associated with larger renal length, higher renal and sinus volume, higher cortical echogenicity, and more patients with coarse echogenicity and abnormal medullary echogenicity. The observation of chronicity was significantly correlated with higher sinus volume and more patients with irregular renal rim. According to the findings of this study, renal length and volume, renal sinus volume, and the presence of coarse echogenicity and abnormal medullar echogenicity strongly correlate with renal histopathologic findings in patients with diabetic nephropathy. RI is not a suitable marker for identifying tubulointerstitial changes in these patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"The thermal behavior of the eutectic powder particles mixture Ag-28% Cu (mass) represents the aim of this research. This comportment is studied from the point of view of the structural changes induced to the powder mixture processing by the wet mechanical alloying (WMA) technique. After 80 h of WMA in ethylene glycol aqueous solution and argon atmosphere, the initial powder mixture becomes nanostructured composite particles with bimetallic AgCu matrix reinforced by in situ processed Cu2O. The particle size distribution, depicted by laser diffraction technique, reveals the nanometric range of the composite particles between 60 and 80 nm. The phase identification, quantitative analysis as well as crystallite size measurements by XRD confirm the nanostructured feature of the bimetallic matrix, acknowledged by SEM with EDX and FIB, as well as the reinforcing components synthesis during the WMA process. Two successive melting processes have been developed to point out the increased melting point in the range of 928.00-946.10 degrees C. The thermal analysis, developed in argon atmosphere, highlights the thermal effects of AgCu/Cu2O nanoparticles generated by argon adsorption/desorption from the powders surface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"In this paper, we suggest a new computational technique for the minimization of Hylleraas' functional with additional orthogonality restrictions imposed on the desired vectors. It is shown how Hylleraas' constrained problem can be reduced to an unconstrained one by minimal computational efforts. The asymptotic projection (AP) method proposed earlier to minimize Rayleigh's quotient subject to some orthogonality restrictions is applied to construct a modified Hylleraas' functional whose solution fulfills the required constraints automatically. Specifically, equivalence between the original problem and the one for the modified Hamilton operator is derived. It is shown that the AP methodology allows additional restrictions to be treated in a unified approach for both Rayleigh's quotient and Hylleraas' functional. Specific features of the method are demonstrated on the electronic parallel polarizability of H-2(+). Some emphasis is put on the choice of specific distributed basis set adapted for polarizability computation. A comparison with other methods, considered exact or extremely accurate, is also given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"In this work, SiO2-encapsulated copper particles/PA12 (Cu-SiO2/PA12) composite powders were prepared by electroless composite plating, and the laser sintering behavior was investigated. Results showed that Cu, Cu2O, CuO, and SiO2 (Cu-SiO2) composite particles were plated on the surface of KH550-modified PA12 powders. The Cu-SiO2 particles existed independently on PA12 surface, and the size was around 200 nm. The melting temperature and crystallization temperature of Cu-SiO2/PA12 composite powders were 183 degrees C and 150 degrees C. The results indicate that the selective laser sintering (SLS) process involved the contact of Cu-SiO2/PA12 powders, the formation of sintering neck, the growth of sintering neck, and the formation of fused solid. The Cu-SiO2 composite particles uniformly dispersed in the part due to surface tension, and the contact interface was good due to their similar polarity. The Cu-SiO2/PA12 SLS parts had excellent dimensional precision. The tensile strength of the 15 W-sintered Cu-SiO2/PA12 specimen was 48 MPa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

20,"Rhenium(I) and (VII) complexes with cyclohex-1-enylolonium cation and bridging pyridyl derivatives are reported. Additionally, the CO-bridged pyridyl and their related compounds have shown interesting behaviour in their reactivity towards compounds containing two amino groups. The unusual cationic compound: (2,6-diaza-cyclohex-1-enylolonium)2-aza-benzoate (H(2)den), was isolated from the reaction mixture of 1,2-di(pyridin-2-yl)ethane-1,2-dione with propane-1,3-diamine in methanol. The latter ligand: H(2)den, was used in the synthesis of rhenium(I) complex in its reaction with [Re(CO)(5)Cl] that gave rise to novel rhenium(I) complex fac-[Re(CO)(3)(Hhdm)] (1). The surprising aspect in the formation of (1) is the modification of H(2)den which was stabilized into a coordinated six-membered pyrimidine ring, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-2-yl)di(pyridin-2-yl)methanol (H(2)hdm) chelate. The derived ligand acts as a tridentate monoanionic N-2,O-donor ligand towards the fac-[Re(CO)(3)](+) core. Surprisingly, the 2-aza-benzoate counter-ion that was present in the used ligand is not displayed in the crystal structure of complex 1, and might have been stabilized into 2-aza-benzoic acid (picolinic acid). The reaction of the potential tridentate N-2,O-donor ligand 2,2 '-dipyridylketone (dpk) with trans-[ReOI2(OEt)(PPh3)(2)] led to the isolation of [ReO3(dpk center dot OH)] (2).

21,"The present research aimed at comparing the effectiveness of promethazine and diazepam in patients suffering from acute peripheral vertigo. This is a double blind clinical trial with a sample of 154 patients visiting the emergency section of Shahid Mohammadi Hospital in Bandar Abbas in 2017-18. The participants were randomly divided into two groups of 77, one treated with intravenous promethazine (50 mg) and the other with intravenous Diazepam (10 mg). The severity of vertigo was measured qualitatively and quantitatively 20 minutes later in both groups. Participants were 46 (29.9%) male and 108 (70.1%) female visiting the emergency section of hospital. The mean score of vertigo severity in Promethazine group was 44.44 +/- 17.94 and that of Diazepam group was 2.49 +/-+3.87. The severity scores before and after the treatment in promethazine group were respectively 7.75 +/- 1.59 and 2.72 +/- 1.93. The mean scores of vertigo severity before and after the treatment in promethazine group was -5.04+2.10 and in the diazepam group it was -3.83+3.09. The intergroup difference was statistically significant (p=.013). The results revealed that intravenous promethazine and diazepam applied 20 minutes after prescription are both effective in controlling the severity of vertigo. Considering the probability of occurrence of extrapyramidal side-effects it can be suggested that the infusion of this medication can be done slowly as it takes longer time. Meanwhile, vital signs should be precisely controlled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"It is important to be able to control the physical and chemical integrity of carbon-based porous monolith structures while being tailored for targeted analytical, energy and catalytic based applications. A set up using a CO2 laser in continuous mode (CW CO2 laser) was implemented to cut fragile and porous carbon monolithic (CM) and nanotemplated carbon monolithic (NTCM) rods into discs with a prescribed thickness and dimensional integrity (denoted as LCM and LNTCM, or LCMs). Changes in structure, porosity and composition of LCMs were induced by the efficient thermal energy afforded by the CW CO2 laser irradiation under tightly controlled process conditions. The main effects observed before and after laser cutting were studied in comparison with traditional scalpel blade cutting of carbon monolithic (SCM). FE-SEM images confirmed that the resulting LCMs exhibited a more open, interconnected macroporous structure and smoothed mesopores to a depth of approximately 5 while the structure of the bulk section remained intact. Minimal changes in chemical compositions were confirmed by XPS. Raman spectroscopy revealed a modest increase in the graphitic content on the cross sections of LCM discs. Phenol and Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as a model analyze for demonstration of resulting discs adsorption performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"Electrolytic conductivity measurement is one of the important parameters to evaluate the concentration of dissolved substances in a solution and has been widely used in various fields of life, science, and technology. It was being used for process control and quality assurance. The traceability of the measuring results is a crucial requirement to guarantee reliability. The electrochemistry laboratory - chemical metrology Indonesia has started to develop a secondary method for electrolytic conductivity measurement. The objective of this work is to provide a traceability chain for electrolytic conductivity measurement in Indonesia through secondary reference material of Potassium Chloride (KCI) 1 M. The secondary reference material of KCI 1 M can be used as a standard for calibrating the conductivity meter, especially in seawater analysis. The secondary reference material that is developed has an electrolytic conductivity value of about 111 mS/cm and was measured using cell type D from ZMK, Germany. This cell is made from glass with two platinization electrodes inside. The distance of the electrodes is 60 mm, and the diameter of the electrode is 20 mm. The uncertainty measurement was estimated according to the ISO GUM recommendation by identifying all possible uncertainty sources in the electrolytic conductivity measurement process. The result showed that the expanded uncertainty of electrolytic conductivity measurement for KCI 1 M by a secondary method using cell type D was 0.33% at k=2 for 95% confidence level with a repeatability of the measurements and cell constant as the biggest sources of uncertainty which contributed as 80% and 17%, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"The aim of this questionnaire survey study is to find out if the three socio-demographic aspects gender, age and household size have any influence on washing-up behaviour and whether people's washing-up behaviour changes due to them. The data was collected via a questionnaire created and carried out by Forum Waschen"" that could be answered by German consumers either on the internet or on the day of sustainable washing created by Forum Waschen"". In addition to the socio-demographic facts, the questionnaire involved questions about both manual and automatic dishwashing. The results of this study vary; some aspects of washing-up behaviour are correlated and some are not. Only some aspects are dependent on gender, more the manual dishwashing behaviour than the automatic. By contrast, most aspects depend on or correlate with the participant's age. The biggest difference between households of different size are the quantities of dishes used and need to be washed per day. Besides the connections to socio-demographic aspects, there are also connections between different aspects of dishwashing behaviour itself, such as the positive correlation between the frequency of changing the tea-towel and its usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"Stiffness and anisotropy of culture substrates are important factors influencing the cell behavior and their responses to external stimuli. Herein, we report a fabrication method of oblique polymer pillars which allow modulating both stiffness and anisotropy of the substrate for spreading and elongation studies of Rat Mesenchymal Stem Cells (RMSCs). Poly (Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid) (PLGA) has been chosen to produce micropillars of different heights and different pitches using a combined method of soft-lithography and hot embossing. The stiffness of such pillar substrates varies over a large range so that RMSCs show effectively different spreading behaviors which are also sensitive to the inclining angle of the pillars. Our results showed that with the increase of the pillar height the area of cell spreading decreases but the cell elongation aspect ratio increases. Moreover, cells preferentially elongate along the direction perpendicular to that of the pillars' inclining, which is in agreement with the calculated anisotropy of the pillar substrate stiffness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"Fatty acids (FAs) are basic components in plants. The pharmacological significance of FAs has attracted attentions of nutritionists and pharmaceutists. Sensitive and accurate detection of FAs is of great importance. In the present study, a pre-column derivatization and online mass spectrometry-based qualitative and quantitative analysis of FAs was developed. Nineteen main FAs were derivatized by 2-(7-methyl-1H-pyrazolo-[3,4-b]quinoline-1-yl)ethyl-4-methyl benzenesulfonate (NMP) and separated on reversed-phase Hypersil BDS C8 column with gradient elution. All FAs showed excellent linear responses with correlation coefficients more than 0.9996. The method obtained LOQs between 0.93 ng/mL and 5.64 ng/mL. FA derivatives were identified by both retention time and protonated molecular ion corresponding to m/z [M + H](+). A comparative study based on FA contents in peel and pulp, seeds and leaves of Nitraria tangutourum Bobr (NTB) from different geographical origins was performed with the established method. Results indicated that NTB were rich in FAs, and the types and contents of FAs varied among tissues. On the other hand, the same tissue of NTB from different geographical areas differed in the content, but not in type, of FAs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"For a supercritical solvent-solute system, as a critical end point (CEP) is approached, the solubility becomes sensitive to temperature variations. By virtue of this phenomenon, a conceptual model is proposed to combine extraction and crystal growth. CO2-naphthalene is chosen as the reference system. Theoretical optimizations suggest that the newly defined pseudo-CEPs are favorable reference states, especially those close to the lower CEP. In each near-CEP region, the performance is promoted when the CEP is approached. The temperature at the bottom wall should be higher than that at the top one to offset the stabilizing concentration gradient due to gravity and initiate double-diffusive convection in the cooperative regime. Numerical simulations confirm that the performance of the current model operating at the optimized reference state is better than the previous experimental results in terms of crystal growth rates. The conceptual model provides an efficient configuration for coupled extraction and crystal growth apparatuses. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/alpha-Al2O3 shows its potential to be an efficient catalyst for CH4-SCR of NO in our former study. This paper focuses on its activity with water vapor in simulated flue gas and two different pretreatments aimed at improving its performance were also studied. The effects of temperature, residence time and initial O-2 content were investigated by experiment. XRD and SEM results indicate that all three catalysts can remove NO and the vapor-treated catalyst may have the worst behavior due to its poor porous structure. Experiment results show the fresh catalyst can gain a high NO removal rate (> 95%) in certain conditions as well as the other two pretreated catalysts. In general, the NO conversion rates decrease with the increase of the initial O-2 content. The calcined catalyst has the best oxygen resistance ability while the vapor-treated catalyst has the worst tolerance to O-2.

29,"A theoretical study was carried out of CumCon-O-2-H2O (2 <= m + n <= 7) clusters using density functional method. The results indicate that O-2 and H2O molecules are adsorbed at top sites. The presence of H2O promotes more charge transfer to anti-bonding orbitals of O-2 molecules which can lead to the elongation of O-O bond. And the effect of charge transfer suggests the occurrence of chemisorption. Comparison between CumCon-O-2 and CumCon-O-2-H2O, PDOS are also discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"A microwave-assisted diazotization reaction of ciprofloxacin was used for the analysis of ciprofloxacin in pharmaceutical samples. The ciprofloxacin was diazotized with phenol using acidified sodium nitrite in a domestic microwave oven. Faster microwave heating and microwave effects were found to be very effective for the process of diazotization. The microwave-assisted reaction was initiated in an acidic media and the colored product was stabilized in a slightly basic medium using a NaOH solution as a neutralizer. The product was found to exhibit the maximum absorbance at 440 nm. All of the experimental conditions like the concentration of reagents, microwave power and reaction time were optimized. The optimum concentrations for phenol, sodium nitrite, HCl and NaOH were found to be 140 ppm, 300 ppm, 0.006 M and 0.006 M respectively. The optimum reaction time was found to be 2 min and a medium high power of the microwave was found to be most effective. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were found to be 1.08 and 3.61 mg L-1 respectively. The developed method was successfully applied for the determination of ciprofloxacin in pharmaceutical samples. This new spectrophotometric method for the analysis of ciprofloxacin is fast, sensitive, easy and cost effective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An experiment is performed that meets the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization for measuring processes and equipment. The scattering process is expressed through the densities of volumetric charge density fluxes transferred through the irradiated volume.

36,"The rationale for the present study is explained by a high spread of metabolic syndrome among the young population, living in an area equivalent to the Far North. The study is aimed at the investigation of the association between a deletion allele of the polymorphism of deletion/insertion in the alit:1133 integrin gene and metabolic syndrome in young residents Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug - Ugra (Russia). The 758 young people aged 18-44 (mean age 36.62 +/- 5.12 years old) with metabolic syndrome and 77 healthy young people without metabolic disorders were examined. The carriership of the allele I associated with the cardiovascular risk was revealed in 63% of the examined patients that had an increased risk of the development of metabolic disorders (OR 1.409, 95% CI 0.858-2.311, p=0.253). There was no significant difference between the native and non-native populations in the rate of occurrence of allele I (62.2% and 64.7%). Genotype II had significant association with arterial hypertension (OR 1.377, 95 % CI 0.912-2.080, p=0.073), obesity (OR 1.353, 95% CI 0.825-2.219, p=0.071), hypercholesterinemia (OR 1.386, 95% CI 0.977-1.966, p=0.115), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 1.232, 95% CI 0.889-1.706, p=0.097).

However, the performances of vegetable tanned leathers still need a further improvement. In this work, a kind of nonionic gemini aliphatic polyurethane surfactants (GPUs) with different hydrophobic chain lengths as a retanning agent combined with polyacrylic acid (PAA) for condensed tannin tanned leathers to improve their performances. The effects of the alone or combined use of the PAA and GPU, the hydrophobic chain length of GPU, and the offer percentage of retanning agent were studied by evaluating the organoleptic properties, shrinkage temperature, mechanical properties of the obtained leathers. The best performance was found in the leather retanned with PAA and 12-GPU-550 complex retanning agent, and the mechanical properties of leather could be improved when the total offer percentage was controlled at 4 wt%. Moreover, the collagen fibers morphologies and lightfastness properties of leathers retanned with different retanning agents were investigated. The results showed that the total color difference Delta E and the yellowness index Delta b decreased significantly with the introduction of 12-GPU-550, and the leather retanned with PAA and 12-GPU-550 complex retanning agent showed the lowest value of Delta E, demonstrating that the lightfastness properties were improved significantly.

42,"Bispecific antibodies open new opportunities in drug development and have become a desirable drug format in cancer immunotherapy. In this type of application, one arm of the bispecific antibody binds to a cancer-specific receptor, while the other arm binds to a T-cell specific receptor to induce cancer cell elimination. Because up to four different polypeptide chains are involved in the assembly of a full-length bispecific antibody, many strategies have been developed to maximize the yield of the desired product (heterodimer) and facilitate the removal of undesired variants, such as homodimers. The successful adaptation of each strategy requires the development of suitable analytical methods to detect and measure the levels of undesired variants. Because the physicochemical properties of the undesired variants can be very similar to those of the desired heterodimer, it is paramount to magnify the minor differences as part of method development. In addition, given that the facilitation of heterodimerization of bispecific antibodies often relies on specific mutations that may impact the physicochemical properties, additional method assessments may need to be considered to ensure their suitability, such as interference from desired product to undesired variants. In the first half of this article, a summary of the common strategies employed in the production of full-length bispecific antibodies is provided. Then two case studies are presented in the second half. In the first case study, the proof-of-concept results are shared for a novel analytical method for variant detection using hinge specific proteases that cleave at defined sites above or below the disulfide bonds in the hinge region.

Previously, the excitonic origin of this feature has been demonstrated experimentally, but a detailed understanding still lacks a model Hamiltonian being able to reproduce absorption as well as exciton relaxation time scales. Here, we propose a system-bath model which accommodates these observables. It combines Frenkel exciton theory for a dimerized and energetically heterogeneous B800 pigment pool with a quantum master equation approach describing phase and energy relaxation according to an experimental spectral density. The analysis of this model shows that the LH2 of Alc. vinosum features an interesting interplay of two excitonic bands, which are originating from the different pigment pools.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"A method is described for the determination of DNA via nucleic acid amplification by using nucleic acid concatemers that result from DNA supersandwich self-assemblies (SSAs). The method employs two auxiliary probes to form self-assembled biotin SSAs. These exhibit strong fluorescence if labeled with intercalator SYBR Green I. In the presence of the target (as exemplified for a 30-mer), streptavidin is released from the surface of the functionalized magnetic microparticles (FMMPs) by competitive hybridization on the surface. However, the SSA products do not conjugate to the FMMPs. This leads to a large amount of SYBR Green I intercalated into the concatemers and eventually results in amplified fluorescence in the supernate. The SSA products can be prepared beforehand, and amplification therefore can be completed within 50 min. The method is more efficient than any other conventional amplification. The detection limit for the 30-mer is 26.4 fM which is better by a factor of 10 compared to other amplification methods. Conceivably, the method can be further extended to the determination of a wide variety of targets simply by replacing the sequences of the probes. Finally, this rapid and highly sensitive method was employed for detection of Ebola virus gene (approximate to 30-mer) and ATP in spiked serum with satisfactory results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

49,"Bio-degreasing technology based on the use of lipases has attracted more attention in the leather industry. Although lipases have been applied in leather making in the past, the previously reported lipase degreasing ratio is still not very high, i.e. less than 60%. In order to correctly understand the mechanism of lipase degreasing and to choose lipases and optimize the degreasing process for achieving efficient degreasing, a novel method of evaluating the catalytic hydrolysis properties of lipases towards skin fats based on a greasy skin powder substrate in an aqueous medium was established. This simulated the actual leather degreasing process and detected the amount of fatty acids produced. The special substrate was prepared; the determination conditions were optimized; then the performances of several typical lipases were evaluated. The results revealed that the lipase performances determined by the novel method were quite different from the standard method using emulsified olive oil substrate. There was a strong product-inhibition characteristic in the catalytic hydrolysis reaction of lipase, and the inhibition concentration of fatty acids varied with the lipase type, thus the maximum hydrolysis ratio of fats was only 67%. The lipases exhibited ""super-activity"" at pH around 9.5. This occurred because the fatty acids produced transformed into soluble soaps, thus the product-inhibition was weakened. According to the above results, a two-step lipase processing was made, i.e., beginning at pH 7.5 then 9.5. The hydrolysis ratio of fats rose to 82.57% from 46.23%, and the degreasing ratio increased from 50.78% to 89.68%. The new method with better repeatability can be used as a tool to correctly select lipases and optimize process parameters for lipase degreasing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We documented this knowledge to prevent its loss under the Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol. We conducted bibliographic research and identified quercetrin as a significant bioactive molecule. We studied its in silico biological activity. The selected methodology was virtual docking experiments with the proteins responsible for the venomous action of snakes. The molecular structures of quercetrin and 21 selected toxins underwent corresponding tests with SwissDock and Chimera software. The results point to support its antiophidic use. They show reasonable geometries and a binding free energy of -7 to -10.03 kcal/mol. The most favorable values were obtained for the venom of the Asian snake Naja atra (5Z2G, -10.03 kcal/mol).

In this investigation, effects of 4, 6 and 8 buds per cane with pruning intensity as light, moderate and severely pruned and their interaction in the course two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018 in 'Sahebr and 'Halagho' were studied. Results revealed striking differences which in either cultivar, pulp phenolic content was 2 to 5 fold higher in 2017 compared to 2018 with the severely pruned 'Halagho' at the highest (5.14 mg/g DVV). Whereas, lightly pruned 'Halagho' with 6 buds per canes had the highest peel anthocyanin content (1.09 mg/g DVV), in the same condition but with severely pruning 'Halagho' showed the highest anthocyanin content in pulp (0.86 mg/g DVV) while in the second year, 2018, severely or lightly pruned this type with 6 buds per cane had a significant increase in phenolic compound accumulation (10 mg/g DVV). From the results of this experiment, it could be concluded that the pruning of the vines is a stressor and generates enhanced phytochemical constitutes to possibly mitigate the negative consequences. However, variation in the biochemical properties manifested a notable grape cultivar dependency in addition to the time factor, which was more pronounced in 'Halagho' than Zahebr.

53,"In a present work, a comparative study of two types of LiTiZn samples of ferrite ceramics, which were sintered using conventional ceramic technology at a temperature of 1010 degrees C for 2 h and which were made with preliminary mechanical treatment in a ball planetary mill, was carried out. It is shown that mechanical treatment in a ball mill leads to a decrease in the defects level, an increase in the Curie point and a demagnetizing factor of ferrite ceramics. The growth of the demagnetizing factor is associated with an increase in the porosity of ferrite ceramics samples pre-grinded in ball. According to the X-ray phase analysis data, the lattice parameter and the coherent scattering region decrease in this case, and the microstrain is reduced by an order of magnitude. The defects level was assessed by the results of mathematical processing of the temperature dependences of the initial permeability using the previously proposed phenomenological expression. Measuring TG/DTG curves in a magnetic field allowed, on the one hand, to confirm a significant difference in Curie points for different types of samples, on the other hand, to detect the presence of an additional magnetic phase in ball-milled ferrite ceramics samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

56,"The main purpose of this article is the in vitro study of elastin from the bovine neck ligament using dielectric spectroscopy in the alpha electric field dispersion region in the temperature range from 22 to 200 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the relative permittivity of wet elastin indicates a maximum of about 50 degrees C due to the thermal decomposition of loosely bound water, as well as a rapid decrease in this parameter above 185 degrees C. For a dry elastin, the change in relative permittivity with temperature represents only one peak of high temperature around 185 degrees C, corresponding to the glass transition temperature (T-g). Below T-g, the activation energy of conductivity for wet and dry elastin at 50 kHz, responsible for the breaking of hydrogen bonds between bound water molecules and hydrophilic polar groups of the main elastin chains, is 27 and 11 kJ mol(-1), respectively, and above T-g, corresponding activation energy values associated with relaxation of the main chain increase to 72 and 34 kJ mol(-1).

58,"The problem of post-stress disorders of cerebral circulation, the most severe of which is cerebral hemorrhage, or hemorrhagic stroke, is extremely urgent. Concerning the survival rate, previous studies have shown that in the same type of conflict situations, individuals resistant and predisposed to emotional stressful influences are clearly distinguished. However, the neural mechanisms providing neuromediatory regulation of responses to stressful effects are still little studied. The analysis of neurochemical sensitivity to acetylcholine and norepinephrine of the sensorimotor cortex neurons of rats having different activity according to behavior parameters, i.e., resistance to emotional stress influences before and after experimental hemorrhagic stroke (EHS) was carried out. The recovery process after an EHS due to neural activity in prognostically stable (VA) and predisposed (NA) to stressful situation rats has individual characteristics. Acute stress influence before EHS development changes the nature of neurons activity of the sensorimotor cortex in VA and NA rats on the third and seventh day after EHS. EHS leads to specific changes in the sensitivity of neurons to acetylcholine and norepinephrine in VA and NA rats. Acetylcholine microionophoresis causes activation of the neuron impulse activity in VA and NA rats, and these changes are the same after EHS. Acute stress influence before EHS development does not change nature of neuron responses to norepinephrine microionophoresis in VA animals. On the contrary, in NA rats loss of neuron sensitivity to norepinephrine during EHS development against stress was noted. It is possible that acute stress influence before EHS development can change brain noradrenergic system activity in NA rats, which are prognostically predisposed to stress influences. The data obtained stress the plasticity of the central nervous structure in development of response to stressful influences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The flow pattern and concentration of hydrogen peroxide decide the thrust produced in such micro-thrusters in which the thrust is of the order of milli-Newton.

Thus, 2-ethoxyphenyl substituent in 1,2,4-triazine allowed to form, besides appropriate oximes, also new nitronic acid derivatives stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The synthesis pathway and molecular structures of oximes were confirmed by X-ray analysis performed for model compound 1-[3-(2-ethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazin-5-yl]ethanone oxime. The presence of the new nitronic acid derivatives in the reaction mixture and the theoretical calculations at DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level strongly suggest that intermediate stabilized by bifurcated intramolecular hydrogen bond is a common intermediate for the construction of appropriate oximes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,"In the present work a tissue-equivalent (TE) nanocomposite is prepared by mixing polyamide 6 (PA6), polyethylene (PE) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to be a substitution for the expensive and difficult to obtain A-150 plastic as the wall material of tissue-equivalent proportional counters (TEPCs). It is found that 3% of CNTs in the nanocomposite produced 3 x 10(-6)S cm(-1) electrical conductivity comparable with that of A-150 and the soft tissue. Also, TEM picture shows the electrical network formation in the continuous PA phase and the interface of PA and PE phases. Determination of the density and the weight percentage of elements of this nanocomposite reveal that the obtained values are similar to A-150 and the soft tissue. On the other hand, simulations carried out by Geant4 toolkit show that the fluence of secondary charged particles of the gamma rays or neutrons inside the gas cavity originating from A-150 and the nanocomposite (3% CNT) is similar. In addition, microdosimetric distributions derived from a TEPC with the nanocomposite wall agree well with a TEPC with A-150 wall. Hence, the frequency-mean and dose-mean lineal energies obtained by the two TEPCs are also compatible. A maximum difference 3% is observed between the frequency-mean lineal energies. Also, the dose-mean lineal energies differ up to 10%. Consequently, the dose-equivalent determined by the two above TEPCs is found similar. Finally, it is concluded that the fabricated nanocomposite can be a reliable substitution for A-150 plastic as a wall material of TEPCs in the neutrons and gamma ray measurements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,"Ion composition contained in individual rain droplets provides important information to investigate the chemistry in rain and clouds, but general rain sampling equipment temporally and spatially averages the information. Determination of the SO42- concentration in an individual rain droplet was achieved by precipitate production in synthesized acrylamide polymer gel. Concentration of the target ion was calculated from the droplet print diameter and precipitation area measured from digital microscope images. We investigated the effects of the interior electrolyte concentration in the polyacrylamide gel and UV irradiation time on the physical properties of the gel and precipitate formation. The precipitated components were identified by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. We also clarified the effects of coexisting ions on the reaction between the interior and exterior electrolytes. For actual rainwater, the SO42- concentration estimated by this method was in agreement with the results obtained by ion chromatography.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

65,"Small sized electrocatalysts, which can be obtained by rapid nucleation and high supersaturation are imperative for outstanding methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Conventional microwave synthesis processes of electrocatalysts include ultrasonication, stirring, pH adjustment, and microwave irradiation of the precursor mixture. Ethylene glycol (EG), which serves as a reductant and solvent was added during the ultrasonication or stirring stage. However, this step and pH adjustment resulted in unintended multi-stage gradual nucleation. In this study, the microwave reduction approach was used to induce rapid nucleation and high supersaturation in order to fabricate small-sized reduced graphene oxide-supported palladium (Pd/rGO) electrocatalysts via the delayed addition of EG, elimination of the pH adjustment step, addition of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), prior microwave irradiation of the EG mixed with Na2CO3, and addition of room temperature precursor mixture. Besides its role as a second reducing agent, the addition of Na2CO3 was primarily intended to generate an alkaline condition, which is essential for the high-performance of electrocatalysts. Moreover, the microwave irradiation of the EG and Na2CO3 mixture generated highly reactive free radicals that facilitate rapid nucleation. Meanwhile, the room temperature precursor mixture increased supersaturation. Results showed improved electrochemically active surface area (78.97 m(2) g(-1), 23.79% larger), MOR (434.49 mA mg(-1), 37.96% higher) and stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The necessity of performance of such investigations was determined by two aspects. The first is the development of the innovative technologies with the purpose of formation of the heat-resistant coatings and other coatings with various functions and necessary properties (formation of such coatings with the help of supersonic heterogeneous streams). The second is the creation of the supersonic heterogeneous streams, which are required for the development of experimental investigations of processes of the erosive and corrosive wear of structural components of the high-speed air vehicles, which conduct flights in atmospheric anomalies (rain clouded sky and dust-in-air conditions). This study describes the entire cycle of the experimental investigations, which were performed with the purpose of construction of the more reliable mathematical model of flow of the nonisentropic heterogeneous streams in the gas-dynamic accelerators with great elongation. The viscous gas flow parameters were calculated using the classical model of a flat boundary layer. The value of the characteristics of the carrier gas flow, the dispersion of particles and their material for accelerating particles in a heterogeneous flow were found out. The study showed that the design of gas-dynamic micro accelerators must be carried out taking into account the increase in the thickness of the boundary layer along the walls of the particle accelerator. In addition, this article presents a more detailed description of gas dynamics of flow and heat exchange of the heterogeneous mixtures within supersonic gas-dynamic accelerators with mass concentration of the powder particles (""K-phase"") in the stream up to 15%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this article is to calculate dimensions of the electrolyte circuit and the crystallizer. There were experimental studies of the decomposition kinetics of the process solutions of potassium aluminate in the range of temperatures and compositions corresponding to operating conditions with PS AA CCS for various purposes. This study presents the results of applying various methods of cleaning an alkaline electrolyte from dissolved reaction products formed during the operation of an air-aluminum (AA) chemical current source (CCS).

70,"Gradient descent method is an essential algorithm for learning of neural networks. Among diverse variations of gradient descent method that have been developed for accelerating learning speed, the natural gradient learning is based on the theory of information geometry on stochastic neuromanifold, and is known to have ideal convergence properties. Despite its theoretical advantages, the pure natural gradient has some limitations that prevent its practical usage. In order to get the explicit value of the natural gradient, it is required to know true probability distribution of input variables, and to calculate inverse of a matrix with the square size of the number of parameters. Though an adaptive estimation of the natural gradient has been proposed as a solution, it was originally developed for online learning mode, which is computationally inefficient for the learning of large data set. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive natural gradient estimation for mini-batch learning mode, which is commonly adopted for big data analysis. For two representative stochastic neural network models, we present explicit rules of parameter updates and learning algorithm. Through experiments on three benchmark problems, we confirm that the proposed method has superior convergence properties to the conventional methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike existing approaches, the proposed framework provides natural 3D manipulation of a face without background distortion and interactive face editing by a user's input, which leads to freeform manipulation without any limitation of range or shape. To achieve these features, a 3D morphable face model is fitted to a face region in a video frame and is deformed by the user's input. The video frame is then mapped as a texture to the deformed model, and the model is rendered on the video frame. Because of the high computational cost, parallelization and acceleration schemes are also adopted for real-time performance. Performance evaluation and comparison results show that the proposed framework is promising for 3D face editing in live video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"The rationale for the present study is explained by a high risk of the development of side effects, including nephrotoxic, in patients that receive the treatment with cytostatics bleocin, lastet, and cisplatin for oncologic diseases. The present article focuses on the evaluation of the toxicity of the mentioned drugs. The method of plasma-free renal tissue cultures in mice on the perforated millipore filters was used. The identification of the toxicity of different doses of the drugs was performed by the comparison of the areas of the grown colonies. The authors presented the data that the inhibition of the growth of renal tissue cultures (by 50%) required a 4.3-fold increase in the dose of lastet in comparison with bleocin. The inhibition of the tissue culture colony growth with cisplatin by 85% was registered in the dose of the drug that corresponded to a 3% solution.

76,"The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the ambiguous role of biochemical mediators in the development of angioplasty complications with stenting and the lack of consensus on the timing of laboratory indicators determine to specify the approaches to the study of biochemical parameters that indicate the nature of the course of coronary heart disease (CHD) and the development of possible undesirable complications after percutaneous coronary intervention. This article aims to analyze the parameters of lipid spectrum and markers of vascular inflammatory reaction in patients with CHD, in groups with stable angina and unstable angina episode after angioplasty with stenting, to trace the dynamics of biochemical parameters and to reveal the predictors of undesirable coronary events. Patients with CHD with significant coronary artery stenosis (CKS, n=95) revealed after coronary angiography (CAG) at the point of maximum increase in the markers of the inflammatory response (3 months after angioplasty) are divided into 2 groups - patients with stable angina pectoris (AP, n=77) until the end of the study and patients with a developed post-revascularization episode of unstable angina (UA, n=18) after angioplasty with stenting. It was established that patients with UA at the initial stage have a significantly higher risk of developing coronary blood flow instability in the post-revascularization period due to initially elevated levels of homocysteine and rf-CRP. The results obtained are very important for the implementation of an optimal program for monitoring patients with coronary artery disease, improving measures to increase adherence to therapy at the outpatient stage of treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"In order to create models of extended surfaces in the long and short wavelength parts of the wave spectrum, it is necessary to know the dispersion characteristics of tape-like obstacles perfectly located both in free space and on an extended surface. Methods of remote studying of extended surfaces, based on an analysis of signals that are generated by reflection or radiation of electromagnetic waves passing neoplasms allows us to view the topography, characteristics, and type of the different locations, sizes of various objects.

79,"The purpose of this paper is to study the diffusion of silver ions, Ag+, into TiO2 nanotubes, using Fick's second law. The mathematical simulations were carried out using the finite element method to solve this partial differential equation. A single nanotube, immersed in an aqueous solution containing Ag+ ions, composes the physical two-dimensional model. The most relevant results show that the system final concentration can be calculated in the function of solution initial concentration, of solution volume and nanotube volume. The equation obtained can be generalized to the study of diffusion for other ions in aqueous solution through nanotubular structured materials, because the equation does not take into account the diffusion coefficient of the ions. The height of nanotube is exponentially proportional to the equilibrium time, proving the relation of height with the diffusion course. On the other hand, the diameter of nanotube does not have a significant relationship with the equilibrium time. These results indicate that for ions incorporation into materials, with nanotubular structure, it should prioritize experimental conditions that favor the vertical growth of the nanotubes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present work was to study the antagonistic interactions between the soil bacteria of the order Bacillales and phytopathogenic fungi. The spore-forming soil bacteria attract increasing interest as biocontrol agents, but little is known about the influence of local soil conditions on the development of antagonism in indigenous bacterial strains. This can lead to unsuccessful attempts of bacterial antagonists isolation. To determine the sequences of primary nucleotide DNA, the authors used the Sanger sequencing method, the detection of sequencing products was performed automatically, using the method of capillary electrophoresis. Homology of at least 97% was considered as the criterion for classifying a microorganism as a certain species. This study presents new data on the influence of soil type and preceding crop on the level of antagonism against Fusarium and Plectosphaerella. The results show that both the soil type and preceding crop influence the fungal-bacterial antagonistic interactions.

For practical applications the adhesion of gold to the ITO electrode was improved by modifying the ITO surface with 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS). Compared to Au/ITO, the Au/MPS/ITO electrode showed vastly improved electrochemical activity toward various electron transfer reactions when subjected to mechanical stress.

82,"The article discusses the thermal protection of spacecraft under various types of thermal and climatic influences. During the pre-launch preparation, several types of icing are possible on the surface of the tiled structure, consisting of quartz heat-shielding tiles. It is very important in the process of operation, to determine normal and shear stresses during icing and the impact of ice formed in the tile gaps. It is necessary to calculate the strength and performance of the tiled thermal protection in active stages of flight of spacecraft. A mathematical model was constructed that allows, with a sufficient degree of accuracy, to research the tiled structure for strength, shear and tearing of the tile when exposed to ice. Calculations for strength, shear, and tearing of tiles under the influence of ice were performed. Theoretical and experimental studies were compared. The performed calculations made it possible to show that the tile will not collapse under the considered load. The strength of the substrate withstands the emerging shear forces. The values of the adhesion strength of ice appearing on the surface of quartz fiber heat-protective coating were obtained. It was demonstrated that the proportion of tangents in the stressed state of the tile does not exceed 10%. The proposed mathematical model for studying the characteristics of the tiled thermal protection of a spacecraft adequately describes the processes under study. Experimental studies have shown satisfactory agreement with theoretical results. The calculations performed to determine the ultimate shear stresses in the substrate showed that the strength of the substrate withstands the emerging shear forces. Consideration of climatic conditions can significantly reduce risks in the design of thermal protection of modern aircraft. The results of this study can be used in further studies, and they can also be taken into account in the construction of aircraft.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

85,"The basis of SLT is the postulate of nonequilibrium, according to which there is an objective property of matter - ""nonequilibrium"", which characterizes the uneven distribution of matter and motion in space. A new formulation of the SLT is given in relation to the set of locally equilibrium subsystems that make up the nonequilibrium system: when real (irreversible) processes occur, the nonequilibrium of the isolated system (IS) decreases, and in reversible processes the nonequilibrium in the system of locally equilibrium subsystems does not change (the increment of one kind of nonequilibrium completely compensated by a decrease in the disequilibrium of some other kind). The maximum work that can be done when the nonequilibrium system goes into equilibrium is considered as a quantitative characteristic of the nonequilibrium system. The article provides a calculated confirmation of the theoretical provisions of the concept of nonequilibrium and its mathematical apparatus by examples of determining the loss of IS disequilibrium during operation of a heat engine performing an irreversible cycle and the nonequilibrium state of an adiabatic system (AS). Schemes of an IS consisting of a hot body, the environment, and a working fluid performing a temperature-imperfect Carnot cycle are given, as well as an AS consisting of the environment and a working fluid, upon expansion of which work is given to an external work receiver. It is shown that the external work of the adiabatic system should be determined not by the decrease in the thermodynamic potential of the working fluid, as is generally accepted, but by the decrease in the potential of all AS bodies (the working fluid and the environment). As a result, analytical expressions are obtained for the practical calculation of nonequilibrium and its reduction during real processes in systems consisting of an aggregate of locally-equilibrium subsystems, which is new in thermodynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monitoring reactions through H-1 and P-31{H-1} NMR of 8a,b in CDCl3 and 9a,b in C6D6 and CDCl3 showed the influence of the temperature and solvent in the equilibrium of isomers in the reaction mixture.

90,"The reaction of silica with various cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by water electrolysis was investigated as a means of preventing the formation of silica scales in geothermal binary power generation. Through batch and continuous experiments, it was found that all silica in the cathode phase of a reaction device could be removed if the necessary amounts of magnesium and calcium were present. This occurs because a silica-magnesium-calcium compound is produced via a polymerization reaction with cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by electrolysis. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows that this material has the formula 2CaO-5MgO-8SiO(2)-H2O, and thus is likely generated by the reaction proposed by Sheikholeslami et al. (2019). Increasing the current sent through the reaction solution subsequently produces calcium carbonate. This technique for the separation of silica and calcium from aqueous solutions can be operated continuously without channel clogging, which indicates the possibility of practical applications. However, overly high currents promote the migration of protons from the anode to cathode phases, which inhibits the formation of precipitates due to a neutralization reaction. The proposed method is an effective approach for removing silica from a solution in geothermal binary power generation; although, a means of suppressing the effects of proton generation will be necessary if the process is also to be used to remove calcium ions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"Top Bajocian progressive deposits are marly accumulation and limestone filled with ammonites and other marine fossils that are called 'Dalichai formation' with 1420m in thickness. There are erosion and inconsistent boundary that distinct Dalichai formation from Shemshak formation. The boundary of Dalichai and Lar formations is isocline and graded. The presence of Benthic foraminifera, sponge sparkles, and ammonites in the Sharaf section alludes the existence of shallow to deep open marine. Such diagenetic processes as cementation, micritization, porosity, accumulation, iron oxide and bioturbation are observed in Dalichai formation. The carbonates in this formation could have primary aragonitic composition according to the studies on main and secondary elements, carbon and oxygen isotopes, and drawing these values against each other. In such condition, non-marine diagenesis influenced the carbonates mostly. By comparing Sr/Ca and Mn, a semi-closed to open diagenetic environment can be suggested to have impacts on carbonates. Dalichai formation and Lar formation can identify a boundary in 1200m thickness since there are changes in Sr/Ca, Sr/Na, Sr, and carbon and oxygen isotopes to study. Dalichai formation limestone temperature was calculated 32.9 degrees C. Regarding lithology and analysis of Sharaf section microfacies, three microfacies are specified that appear as deposits in outer ramp. In this study, the model of Homoclinal ramp is suggested to utilize for such formation. Sharaf section Dalichai Formation entails aragonitic mineralogy composition on which burial diagenesis has substantially influenced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,The priority of V.A. Kistyakovskii in the discovery of hydration was substantiated. The history of D.I. Mendeleev's chemical theory of hydrates and S. Arrhenius' physical theory of electrolytic dissociation was considered; the Kistyakovskii concept spans these theories. The role of I.A. Kablukov in hydration research and modern aspects of the theory were discussed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"The new complex [Cu4L2(H(2)AEDP)(2)(H2O)(4)] center dot 34H(2)O was prepared by the reaction of CuSO4 with bis(2-pyridyl-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)butane (H2L) and 1-aminoethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid (H(4)AEDP) and studied by X-ray diffraction (CIF file CCDC no. 1913117). The complex is a spacer-armed dimer in which two dimer subunits formed with participation of diphosphonate dianions are linked to each other via two doubly deprotonated bis(pyridyl)triazoles. The bridging diphosphonate anion exists in the zwitter ion form, bis(triazolyl)butane is coordinated via the nitrogen atoms of the pyridyl moiety and the deprotonated triazole ring. Analysis of the ESR spectrum of the polycrystalline sample attests to weak exchange interactions in the dimeric moieties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"Off-the-shelf clinical linear electron accelerators (LINAC) have been suggested as alternative to research accelerators once they are no longer suitable for the medical applications. We investigated feasibility of utilising a modified LINAC for instrumental photon activation analysis (IPAA) as a tool in environmental geochemistry studies. The IPAA results were compared with those obtained using a MT-25 research accelerator at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. To investigate soil pollution in Antalya, Turkey, 90 surface soil samples were analysed and significant enrichments of Ni, Cr and As were found.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"The possibility of using natural or modified polymers to formulate drug-containing nanocapsules is a pharmaceutical option for cases in which an increase in the half-life of medications in the body and a decrease in side effects is required, and may also be used for better pharmacological targeting of the site. Related to low production costs with these characteristics and renewable availability. Gums and mucilages have been studied for use in natural alternative drug delivery systems. The gum from the trunk of Mangifera indica has few studies aimed at this purpose, although it has shown promising results in previous studies. Characterization of the gum formation pathways are explained, as well as their extraction and purification. The similarity of properties of Acacia gum widely used in tablet blends has been confirmed. Mangifera indica gum was also used for accelerated drug release. The versatility of this gum is associated with the presence of mucilage. Chemical modifications of the Mangifera indica gum and mixtures among other gums may be made to adapt their properties to the various forms of controlled drug release. Several isolated compounds with pharmaceutical properties are demonstrated. Physical chemical characteristics of several articles on this gum have been compiled. The techniques already used for the formation of nanocapsules through Mangifera indica gum are presented. Several studies have been reported specifically using Mangifera indica gum from the Mango trunk used as drug release. These studies justify a summary of the pharmaceutical properties for drug delivery already performed with this gum. Complementary studies for utilization and valorization of Mango cultivation are suggested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"In the first article of this series, we have introduced the concept of an atom of space-time-matter (STM), which is described by the spectral action of noncommutative geometry, corresponding to a classical theory of gravity. In the present work, we use the Connes time parameter, along with the spectral action, to incorporate gravity into trace dynamics. We then derive the spectral equation of motion for the STM atom, which turns out to be the Dirac equation on a noncommutative space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"It is well known that a nonhomogeneous state of stress occurs in compounds of dissimilar materials upon heating. Uon the assessment of the strength of the joints, it is necessary to factor in the physical specifications of the soldered elements, the geometric dimensions and temperature conditions of their operation. The purpose of the research was to perform the stress-strain state analysis of the contact zone of a semiconductor upon electrodegradation of a metallization track on its surface. Thin-film metal-semiconductor structures were researched. As substrates, it was used phosphorus-doped silicon single-crystal wafers oriented in the (111) and (100) directions, with a resistivity in the range rho = 1 ... 0.01 Omega.cm, and a 30 ... 50 mu m n-epitaxial layer was deposited on a part of the wafers. As a conductive metal film, aluminum 1 ... 2 mu m thick was used. The test structure was formed by optical photolithography. The oscillograms of the U(t) inclusion in the process of passage of the current pulse were taken by the corresponding probes from potential sites and recorded by a digital storage oscilloscope. An estimation procedure for the semiconductor stressed region at local surface heating of a metallized surface area with electric pulse was given. The calculated size of deformed silicon substrate region was compared with the experimental one under passage of square electric pulses. It was estimated the deflected region that depends on duration and amplitude of electric pulse. A considerable nonuniformity of the metallization track after electric pulse passage was fixed experimentally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"This work aims to find the most suitable method that is practically applicable for the calculation of P-31 NMR chemical shifts of Pt(II) complexes. The influence of various all-electron and ECP basis sets, DFT functionals, and solvent effects on the optimized geometry was tested. A variety of combinations of DFT functionals BP86, B3LYP, PBE0, TPSSh, CAM-B3LYP, and omega B97XD with all-electron basis sets 6-31G, 6-31G(d), 6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), and TZVP and ECP basis sets SDD, LanL2DZ, and CEP-31G were used. Chemical shielding constants were then calculated using BP86, PBE0, and B3LYP functionals in combination with the TZ2P basis. The magnitude of spin-orbit interactions was also evaluated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,We report on novel reference-free methods to determine the instrumental resolution of transmission-type bent crystal spectrometers. The novel methods are based on the measurements of a selected X-ray line in several orders of diffraction. It is shown that the angular broadening of the spectrometer and the natural linewidth of the selected transition can be obtained directly from the novel methods. No reference X-ray line or gamma-ray line is needed. The precision of the results is about 10 times better than the one obtained with the standard method consisting of measuring a reference X-ray line and keeping fixed in the fit the natural width of this line at the value taken from available databases. The novel methods are illustrated for a DuMond-type bent crystal spectrometer with the K alpha(1) X-ray line of Gd measured in the first five orders of diffraction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
