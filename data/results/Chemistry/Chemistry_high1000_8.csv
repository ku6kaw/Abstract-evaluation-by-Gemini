These nanostructured TiO2-graphene hybrid materials were used for investigation of Li-ion insertion properties. The hybrid materials showed significantly enhanced Li-ion insertion/extraction in TiO2. The specific capacity was more than doubled at high charge rates, as compared with the pure TiO2 phase. The improved capacity at high charge-discharge rate may be attributed to increased electrode conductivity in the presence of a percolated graphene network embedded into the metal oxide electrodes.",10.1021/nn900150y,0,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,

J,"Yu, M; Trinkle, DR",Accurate and efficient algorithm for Bader charge integration,"We propose an efficient, accurate method to integrate the basins of attraction of a smooth function defined on a general discrete grid and apply it to the Bader charge partitioning for the electron charge density. Starting with the evolution of trajectories in space following the gradient of charge density, we derive an expression for the fraction of space neighboring each grid point that flows to its neighbors. This serves as the basis to compute the fraction of each grid volume that belongs to a basin (Bader volume) and as a weight for the discrete integration of functions over the Bader volume. Compared with other grid-based algorithms, our approach is robust, more computationally efficient with linear computational effort, accurate, and has quadratic convergence. Moreover, it is straightforward to extend to nonuniform grids, such as from a mesh-refinement approach, and can be used to both identify basins of attraction of fixed points and integrate functions over the basins.

In most cases, specialized applications require incorporation of functional chemical groups. This work is a systematic investigation of the effect that simple substituents attached to the aromatic linker have on the stability and property to the parent MOF. A family of isoreticular MOFs, based on the UiO-66 structure was obtained from the three different linker ligands H2N-H2BDC, O2N-H2BDC, and Br-H2BDC. The physicochemical and chemical investigation of these materials demonstrate that this class of MOFs retains high thermal and chemical stabilities, even with functional groups present at the linker units. The results demonstrate the possibility of incorporating active functional groups into the UiO-66 structure almost without losing its exceptionally high thermal and chemical stability. It has been established that the functional groups, at least in the amino functionalized UiO-66 sample, are chemically available as evidenced by the H/D exchange experiment, making the tagged UiO series MOFs very interesting for further studies within the field of catalysis.",10.1021/cm102601v,3,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

Previously, an aggressive acid hydrolysis and sonication of cellulose I containing fibers was shown to lead to a network of weakly hydrogen-bonded rodlike cellulose elements typically with a low aspect ratio. On the other hand, high mechanical shearing resulted in longer and entangled nanoscale cellulose elements leading to stronger networks and gels. Nevertheless, a widespread use of the latter concept has been hindered because of lack of feasible methods of preparation, suggesting a combination of mild hydrolysis and shearing to disintegrate cellulose I containing fibers into high aspect ratio cellulose I nanoscale elements. In this work, mild enzymatic hydrolysis has been introduced and combined with mechanical shearing and a high-pressure homogenization, leading to a controlled fibrillation down to nanoscale and a network of long and highly entangled cellulose I elements. The resulting strong aqueous gels exhibit more than 5 orders of magnitude tunable storage modulus G' upon changing the concentration. Cryotransmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) C-13 NMR suggest that the cellulose I structural elements obtained are dominated by two fractions, one with lateral dimension of 5-6 nm and one with lateral dimensions of about 10-20 nm. The thicker diameter regions may act as the junction zones for the networks. The resulting material will herein be referred to as MFC (microfibrillated cellulose). Dynamical rheology showed that the aqueous suspensions behaved as gels in the whole investigated concentration range 0.125-5.9% w/w, G' ranging from 1.5 Pa to 10(5) Pa. The maximum G' was high, about 2 orders of magnitude larger than typically observed for the corresponding nonentangled low aspect ratio cellulose I gels, and G' scales with concentration with the power of approximately three.

Herein, we developed a new highly active Fe-N-C ORR catalyst containing Fe-N-x coordination sites and Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals (Fe@C-FeNC), and revealed the origin of its activity by intensively investigating the composition and the structure of the catalyst and their correlations with the electrochemical performance. The detailed analyses unambiguously confirmed the coexistence of Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals and Fe-N-x in the best catalyst. A series of designed experiments disclosed that (1) N-doped carbon substrate, Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals or Fe-N-x themselves did not deliver the high activity; (2) the catalysts with both Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals and Fe-N-x exhibited the high activity; (3) the higher content of Fe-N-x gave the higher activity; (4) the removal of Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals severely degraded the activity; (5) the blocking of Fe-N-x downgraded the activity and the recovery of the blocked Fe-N-x recovered the activity. These facts supported that the high ORR activity of the Fe@C-FeNC electrocatalysts should be ascribed to that Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals boost the activity of Fe-N-x. The coexistence of high content of Fe-N-x and sufficient metallic iron nanoparticles is essential for the high ORR activity. DFT calculation corroborated this conclusion by indicating that the interaction between metallic iron and Fe-N-4 coordination structure favored the adsorption of oxygen molecule. These new findings open an avenue for the rational design and bottom-up synthesis of low-cost highly active ORR electrocatalysts.",10.1021/jacs.6b00757,5,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
J,"Zoete, V; Cuendet, MA; Grosdidier, A; Michielin, O",SwissParam: A Fast Force Field Generation Tool for Small Organic Molecules,"The drug discovery process has been deeply transformed recently by the use of computational ligand-based or structure-based methods, helping the lead compounds identification and optimization, and finally the delivery of new drug candidates more quickly and at lower cost. Structure-based computational methods for drug discovery mainly involve ligand-protein docking and rapid binding free energy estimation, both of which require force field parameterization for many drug candidates. Here, we present a fast force field generation tool, called SwissParam, able to generate, for arbitrary small organic molecule, topologies, and parameters based on the Merck molecular force field, but in a functional form that is compatible with the CHARMM force field. Output files can be used with CHARMM or GROMACS. The topologies and parameters generated by SwissParam are used by the docking software EADock2 and EADock DSS to describe the small molecules to be docked, whereas the protein is described by the CHARMM force field, and allow them to reach success rates ranging from 56 to 78%. We have also developed a rapid binding free energy estimation approach, using SwissParam for ligands and CHARMM22/27 for proteins, which requires only a short minimization to reproduce the experimental binding free energy of 214 ligand-protein complexes involving 62 different proteins, with a standard error of 2.0 kcal mol(-1), and a correlation coefficient of 0.74. Together, these results demonstrate the relevance of using SwissParam topologies and parameters to describe small organic molecules in computer-aided drug design applications, together with a CHARMM22/27 description of the target protein.

An experimental method has been developed that begins with the detection and characterization of isolated nanoparticles in the optical far field. The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy sources covering the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

The traditional understanding of the OER mechanism on metal oxides involves four concerted proton-electron transfer steps on metal-ion centres at their surface and product oxygen molecules derived from water. Here, using in situ O-18 isotope labelling mass spectrometry, we provide direct experimental evidence that the O-2 generated during the OER on some highly active oxides can come from lattice oxygen. The oxides capable of lattice-oxygen oxidation also exhibit pH-dependent OER activity on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale, indicating non-concerted proton-electron transfers in the OER mechanism. Based on our experimental data and density functional theory calculations, we discuss mechanisms that are fundamentally different from the conventional scheme and show that increasing the covalency of metal-oxygen bonds is critical to trigger lattice-oxygen oxidation and enable non-concerted proton-electron transfers during OER.",10.1038/NCHEM.2695,11,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Electrochemical performances were evaluated In two-electrode cells versus metallic lithium. It Is demonstrated that the obtained MoS2/G composites show three-dimensional architecture and excellent electrochemical performances as anode materials for U-ion batteries. The MoS2/G composite with a Mo:C molar ratio of 1:2 exhibits the highest specific capacity of similar to 1100 mAh/g at a current of 100 mA/g, as well as excellent cycling stability and high-rate capability.

J,"Sevilla, M; Fuertes, AB",The production of carbon materials by hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose,"Highly functionalized carbonaceous materials were produced by means of the hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose at temperatures in the 220-250 degrees C range. The formation of this material follows essentially the path of a dehydration process, similar to that previously observed for the hydrothermal transformation of saccharides such as glucose, sucrose or starch. The materials so formed are composed of agglomerates of carbonaceous microspheres (size similar to 2-5 mu m), as evidenced by SEM. The combination of the results of the elemental analysis with that obtained by different spectroscopic techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and XPS) has allowed us to inferred that, from a chemical point of view, the solid product consists of small clusters of condensed benzene rings that form stable groups with oxygen in the core (i.e. ether, quinone, pyrone), whereas the shell possesses more reactive/hydrophilic oxygen functionalities (i.e. hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic, ester).

We show that such a TiO2-GR nanocomposite exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity and stability than bare TiO2 toward the gas-phase degradation of benzene, a volatile aromatic pollutant in air. By investigating the effect of different addition ratios of graphene on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-GR systematically, we find that the higher weight ratio in TiO2-GR will decrease the photocatalytic activity. Analogous phenomenon is also observed for the liquid-phase degradation of dyes over TiO2-GR. In addition, the key features for TiO2-GR including enhancement of adsorptivity of pollutants, light absorption intensity, electron-hole pairs lifetime, and extended light absorption range have also been found in the composite of TiO2 and carbon nanotubes (TiO2-CNT). These strongly manifest that TiO2-GR is in essence the same as other TiO2-carbon (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and activated carbon) composite materials on enhancement of photocatalytic activity of TiO2, although graphene by itself has unique structural and electronic properties. Notably, this key fundamental question remains completely unaddressed in a recent report (ACS Nano 2010, 4, 380) regarding liquid-phase degradation of dyes over the TiO2-GR photocatalyst. Thus, we propose that TiO2-GR cannot provide truly new insights into the fabrication of TiO2-carbon composite as high-performance photocatalysts.

The interfaces of the metacrystals support helical edge states that exhibit spin-polarized one-way propagation of photons, robust against disorder.

J,"Walkey, CD; Olsen, JB; Guo, HB; Emili, A; Chan, WCW",Nanoparticle Size and Surface Chemistry Determine Serum Protein Adsorption and Macrophage Uptake,"Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its ""synthetic identity"", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct ""biological identity"". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials.",10.1021/ja2084338,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the g-C3N4 photocatalysis system, the photodegradation of Rh B and MO is attributed to the direct hole oxidation and overall reaction, respectively; however, for the MO photodegradation the reduction process initiated by photogenerated electrons is a major photocatalytic process compared with the oxidation process induced by photogenerated holes.

The self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, ionic conductivity, and molar conductivity change with temperature following the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation, and the density shows a linear decrease. The pulsed-field-gradient spin-echo NMR method reveals a higher self-diffusion coefficient for the cation compared to that for the anion over a wide temperature range, even if the cationic radius is larger than that of the anion. The summation of the cationic and anionic diffusion coefficients for the RTILs follows the order [emim][(CF3SO2)(2)N] > [mmim][(CF3SO2)(2)N] > [bmim][(CF3SO2)(2)N] > [C(6)mim][(CF3SO2)(2)N] > [C(8)mim][(CF3SO2)(2)N], which greatly contrasts to the viscosity data. The ratio of molar conductivity obtained from impedance measurements to that calculated by the ionic diffusivity using the Nernst-Einstein equation quantifies the active ions contributing to ionic conduction in the diffusion components, in other words, ionicity of the ionic liquids.

In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost.

The maximum apparent quantum yield of the NiO/NaTaO3:La photocatalyst was 56% at 270 nm. The factors affecting the highly efficient photocatalytic water splitting were examined by using various characterization techniques. Electron microscope observations revealed that the particle sizes of NaTaO3:La crystals (0.1-0.7 mum) were smaller than that of the nondoped NaTaO3 crystal (2-3 mum) and that the ordered surface nanostructure with many characteristic steps was created by the lanthanum doping. The small particle size with a high crystallinity was advantageous to an increase in the probability of the reaction of photogenerated electrons and holes with water molecules toward the recombination. Transmission electron microscope observations and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses indicated that NO cocatalysts were loaded on the edge of the nanostep structure of NaTaO3:La photocatalysts as ultrafine particles. The H-2 evolution proceeded on the ultrafine NiO particles loaded on the edge while the O-2 evolution occurred at the groove of the nanostep structure. Thus, the reaction sites for H-2 evolution were separated from those of O-2 evolution over the ordered nanostep structure.

J,"Dabrowski, A",Adsorption - from theory to practice,"Adsorption at various interfaces has concerned scientists since the beginning of this century. This phenomenon underlies a number of extremely important processes of utilitarian significance. The technological, environmental and biological importance of adsorption can never be in doubt. Its practical applications in industry and environmental protection are of paramount importance. The adsorption of substrates is the first stage in many catalytic processes. The methods for separation of mixtures on a laboratory and on an industrial scale are increasingly based on utilising the change in concentration of components at the interface. Moreover, such vital problems as purification of water, sewages, air and soil are involved here too. On the other hand, many areas in which technological innovation has covered adsorption phenomena have been expanded more through art and craft than through science. A basic understanding of the scientific principles is far behind; in part because the study of interfaces requires extremely careful experimentation if meaningful and reproducible results are to be obtained. In recent years, however, considerable effort has been increasingly directed toward closing the gap between theory and practice. Crucial progress in theoretical description of the adsorption has been achieved, mainly through the development of new theoretical approaches formulated on a molecular level, by means of computer simulation methods and owing to new techniques which examine surface layers or interfacial regions. Moreover, during the last 15 years new classes of solid adsorbents have been developed, such as activated carbon fibres and carbon molecular sieves, fullerenes and heterofullerenes, microporous glasses and nanoporous - both carbonaceous and inorganic - materials. Nanostructured solids are very popular in science and technology and have gained extreme interest due to their sorption, catalytic, magnetic, optical and thermal properties. Although the development of adsorption up to the 1918s has been following rather a zig-zag path, this arm of surface science is now generally considered to have become a well-defined branch of physical science representing an intrinsically interdisciplinary area between chemistry, physics, biology and engineering. This review presents in brief the history of adsorption and, highlights the progress in theoretical description of the phenomenon under consideration. The paper deals with the above problems critically, showing the development of adsorption, presenting some of the latest important results and giving a source of up-to-date literature on it. Moreover, in this paper the most important aspects are overviewed referring to today's trends and visions in application of adsorption science in industry, environmental protection and in environmental analysis. The relationship between development of adsorption theory and adsorption practice is pointed out. Current understanding and perspectives pertaining to applications of adsorption phenomena on laboratory and on industrial scale as well as environmental protection are discussed and illustrated by means of a few spectacular examples.

J,"Stewart, JJP",Optimization of parameters for semiempirical methods VI: more modifications to the NDDO approximations and re-optimization of parameters,"Modern semiempirical methods are of sufficient accuracy when used in the modeling of molecules of the same type as used as reference data in the parameterization. Outside that subset, however, there is an abundance of evidence that these methods are of very limited utility. In an attempt to expand the range of applicability, a new method called PM7 has been developed. PM7 was parameterized using experimental and high-level ab initio reference data, augmented by a new type of reference data intended to better define the structure of parameter space. The resulting method was tested by modeling crystal structures and heats of formation of solids. Two changes were made to the set of approximations: a modification was made to improve the description of noncovalent interactions, and two minor errors in the NDDO formalism were rectified. Average unsigned errors (AUEs) in geometry and Delta H (f) for PM7 were reduced relative to PM6; for simple gas-phase organic systems, the AUE in bond lengths decreased by about 5 % and the AUE in Delta H (f) decreased by about 10 %; for organic solids, the AUE in Delta H (f) dropped by 60 % and the reduction was 33.3 % for geometries. A two-step process (PM7-TS) for calculating the heights of activation barriers has been developed. Using PM7-TS, the AUE in the barrier heights for simple organic reactions was decreased from values of 12.6 kcal/mol(-1) in PM6 and 10.8 kcal/mol(-1) in PM7 to 3.8 kcal/mol(-1). The origins of the errors in NDDO methods have been examined, and were found to be attributable to inadequate and inaccurate reference data. This conclusion provides insight into how these methods can be improved.",10.1007/s00894-012-1667-x,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such repulsion also prevented the single layers from overlapping during compression, leading to excellent reversibility of the monolayers. In contrast to molecular and hard colloidal particle monolayers, the single layers tend to fold and wrinkle at edges to resist collapsing into multilayers. The monolayers can be transferred to a substrate, readily creating a large area of flat graphite oxide single layers. The density of such films can be continuously tuned from dilute, close-packed to overpacked monolayers of interlocking single layers. For size-mismatched single layers, face-to-face interaction caused irreversible stacking, leading to double layers. The graphite oxide monolayers can be chemically reduced to graphene for electronic applications such as transparent conducting thin films.",10.1021/ja806262m,47,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no

A possible downside of these capabilities is harmful interactions with biological systems, with the potential to generate toxicity. An approach to assess the safety of nanomaterials is urgently required. We compared the cellular effects of ambient ultrafine particles with manufactured titanium dioxide (TiO2), carbon black, fullerol, and polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs). The study was conducted in a phagocytic cell line ( RAW 264.7) that is representative of a lung target for NPs. Physicochemical characterization of the NPs showed a dramatic change in their state of aggregation, dispersibility, and charge during transfer from a buffered aqueous solution to cell culture medium. Particles differed with respect to cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under biotic and abiotic conditions. Spontaneous ROS production was compared by using an ROS quencher (furfuryl alcohol) as well as an NADPH peroxidase bioelectrode platform. Among the particles tested, ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) and cationic PS nanospheres were capable of inducing cellular ROS production, GSH depletion, and toxic oxidative stress. This toxicity involves mitochondrial injury through increased calcium uptake and structural organellar damage. Although active under abiotic conditions, TiO2 and fullerol did not induce toxic oxidative stress. While increased TNF-alpha production could be seen to accompany UFP-induced oxidant injury, cationic PS nanospheres induced mitochondrial damage and cell death without inflammation. In summary, we demonstrate that ROS generation and oxidative stress are a valid test paradigm to compare NP toxicity. Although not all materials have electronic configurations or surface properties to allow spontaneous ROS generation, particle interactions with cellular components are capable of generating oxidative stress.",10.1021/nl061025k,49,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

In addition to graphene, the most studied 2D material, monolayers of other layered materials such as semiconducting dichalcogenides MoS2 or WSe2 are gaining in importance as promising channel materials for field-effect transistors (FETs). The presence of a direct bandgap in monolayer MoS2 due to quantum-mechanical confinement allows room-temperature FETs with an on/off ratio exceeding 10(8). The presence of high-kappa dielectrics in these devices enhanced their mobility, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report on electrical transport measurements on MoS2 FETs in different dielectric configurations. The dependence of mobility on temperature shows clear evidence of the strong suppression of charged-impurity scattering in dual-gate devices with a top-gate dielectric. At the same time, phonon scattering shows a weaker than expected temperature dependence. High levels of doping achieved in dual-gate devices also allow the observation of a metal-insulator transition in monolayer MoS2 due to strong electron-electron interactions.

Different kinds of important inorganic and organic electroactive compounds (i.e., probe molecule (potassium ferricyanide), free bases of DNA (guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T), and cytosine (C)), oxidase/dehydrogenase-related molecules (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2/beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)), neurotransmitters (dopamine (DA)), and other biological molecules (ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), and acetaminophen (APAP)) were employed to study their electrochemical responses at the CR-GO/GC electrode, which shows more favorable electron transfer kinetics than graphite modified glassy carbon (graphite/GC) and glassy carbon (GC) electrodes. The greatly enhanced electrochemical reactivity of the four free bases of DNA at the CR-GO/GC electrode compared with that at graphite/GC and GC electrodes makes the CR-GO/GC electrode a better choice for the electrochemical biosensing of four DNA bases in both the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at physiological pH without a prehydrolysis step. This allows us to detect a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site for short oligomers with a particular sequence at the CR-GO/GC electrode without any hybridization or labeling processes in this work, suggesting the potential applications of CR-GO in the label-free electrochemical detection of DNA hybridization or DNA damage for further research. Based on the greatly enhanced electrochemical reactivity of H2O2 and NADH at the CR-GO/GC electrode, CR-GO/GC electrode-based bioelectrodes (in connection with glucose oxidase (GOD) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)) show a better analytical performance for the detection of glucose and ethanol compared with graphite/GC- or GC-based bioelectrodes. By comparing the electrochemical performance of CR-GO with that of the conventional graphite and GC, we reveal that CR-GO with the nature of a single sheet showing favorable electrochemical activity should be a kind of more robust and advanced carbon electrode material which may hold great promise for electrochemical sensors and biosensors design.",10.1021/ac900136z,53,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration.

It was found that even in cases where the surface films formed on lithium contain elastomers, or where the lithium metal reactivity is reduced by doping with elements such as N, As, Al, Mg, Ca, etc., it is impossible to achieve sufficient passivation with lithium electrodes and liquid solutions. Passivation is considerably worsened when Li electrodes are operated at high rates (especially at high charging, Li deposition rates). Thus, there is no way that rechargeable Li batteries can compete with Li-ion batteries in any application that requires high charging rates (e.g., in powering portable electronic devices). The electrochemical behavior of lithiated graphite electrodes also depends on passivation phenomena. The surface films formed on lithiated graphite are similar to those formed on Li metal in the same solutions. The volume changes of graphite electrodes during Li insertion-deinsertion are small enough to enable their reasonable passivation in a variety of electrolyte solutions. A critical factor that determines the stability of graphite electrodes is their morphology. It was found that the shape of graphite particles plays a key role in their application as active mass in anodes for Li-ion batteries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J,"Song, CS","Global challenges and strategies for control, conversion and utilization of CO<sub>2</sub> for sustainable development involving energy, catalysis, adsorption and chemical processing","Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) has become an important global issue due to the significant and continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, accelerated growth in the consumption of carbon-based energy worldwide, depletion of carbon-based energy resources, and low efficiency in current energy systems. The barriers for CO2 utilization include: (1) Costs Of CO2 capture, separation, purification, and transportation to user site; (2) energy requirements of CO2 chemical conversion (plus source and cost of co-reactants); (3) market size limitations, little investment-incentives and lack of industrial commitments for enhancing CO2-based chemicals; and (4) the lack of socio-economical driving forces. The strategic objectives may include: (1) use CO2 for environmentally-benign physical and chemical processing that adds value to the process; (2) use CO2 to produce industrially useful chemicals and materials that adds value to the products; (3) use CO2 as a beneficial fluid for processing or as a medium for energy recovery and emission reduction; and (4) use CO2 recycling involving renewable sources of energy to conserve carbon resources for sustainable development. The approaches for enhancing CO2 utilization may include one or more of the following: (1) for applications that do not require pure CO2, develop effective processes for using the CO2-Concentrated flue gas from industrial plants or CO2-rich resources without CO2 separation; (2) for applications that need pure CO2, develop more efficient and less-energy intensive processes for separation of CO2 selectively without the negative impacts of co-existing gases such as H2O, 02, and N-2; (3) replace a hazardous or less-effective substance in existing processes with CO2 as an alternate medium or solvent or co-reactant or a combination of them; (4) make use of CO2 based on the unique physical properties as supercritical fluid or as either solvent or anti-solvent; (5) use CO2 based on the unique chemical properties for CO2 to be incorporated with high 'atom efficiency' such as carboxylation and carbonate synthesis; (6) produce useful chemicals and materials using CO2 as a reactant or feedstock; (7) use CO2 for energy recovery while reducing its emissions to the atmosphere by sequestration; (8) recycle CO2 as C-source for chemicals and fuels using renewable sources of energy; and (9) convert CO2 under either bio-chemical or geologic-formation conditions into ""new fossil"" energies. Several cases are discussed in more detail. The first example is tri-reforming of methane versus the well-known CO2 reforming over transition metal catalysts such as supported Ni catalysts. Using CO2 along with H2O and 02 in flue gases of power plants without separation, tri-reforming is a synergetic combination of CO2 reforming, steam reforming and partial oxidation and it can eliminate carbon deposition problem and produces syngas with desired H-2/CO ratios for industrial applications. The second example is a CO2 ""molecular basket"" as CO2-selective high-capacity adsorbent which was developed using mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 and polyethylenimine (PEI). The MCM41-PEI adsorbent has higher adsorption capacity than either PEI or MCM-41 alon and can be used as highly CO2-selective adsorbent for gas mixtures without the pre-removal of moisture because it even enhances CO2 adsorption capacity. The third example is synthesis of dimethyl carbonate using CO2 and methanol, which demonstrates the environmental benefit of avoiding toxic phosgene and a processing advantage. The fourth example is the application of supercritical CO2 for extraction and for chemical processing where CO2 is either a solvent or a co-reactant, or both. The CO2 utilization contributes to enhancing sustainability, since various chemicals, materials, and fuels can be synthesized using CO2, which should be a sustainable way in the long term when renewable sources of energy are used as energy input.

We consider ribbons with different edge nature including bare and hydrogen-terminated ribbons, several crystallographic orientations, and widths up to 3 nm. Our results can be extrapolated to wider ribbons providing a qualitative way of determining the electronic properties of ribbons with widths of practical significance. We predict that in order to produce materials with band gaps similar to Ge or InN, the width of the ribbons must be between 2 and 3 nm. If larger bang gap ribbons are needed (like Si, InP, or GaAs), their width must be reduced to 1-2 nm. According to the extrapolated inverse power law obtained in this work, armchair carbon nanoribbons of widths larger than 8 nm will present a maximum band gap of 0.3 eV, while for ribbons with a width of 80 nm the maximum possible band gap is 0.05 eV. For chiral nanoribbons the band gap oscillations rapidly vanish as a function of the chiral angle indicating that a careful design of their crystallographic nature is an essential ingredient for controlling their electronic properties.

Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be crumpled(2). These fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes meaning that a 2D membrane can exist but will exhibit strong height fluctuations(2-4).

The atoms aluminum through argon revisited,"For molecules containing second row atoms, unacceptable errors have been found in extrapolating dissociation energies calculated with the standard correlation consistent basis sets to the complete basis set limit. By carefully comparing the convergence behavior of D-e(O-2) and D-e(SO), we show that the cause of these errors is a result of two inter-related problems: near duplication of the exponents in two of the d sets and a lack of high-exponent functions in the early members of the sets. Similar problems exist for the f sets (and probably in higher angular momentum sets), but have only a minor effect on the calculated dissociation energies. A number of approaches to address the problems in the d sets were investigated. Well behaved convergence was obtained by augmenting the (1d) and (2d) sets with a high-exponent function and by replacing the (3d) set by the (4d) set and the (4d) set by the (5d) set and so on. To ensure satisfactory coverage of both the L and M shell regions, the exponents of the new d sets were re-optimized. Benchmark calculations on Si-2, PN, SO, and AlCl with the new cc-pV(n+d)Z sets show greatly improved convergence behavior not only for D-e but for many other properties as well.

J,"Ryoo, R; Joo, SH; Kruk, M; Jaroniec, M",Ordered mesoporous carbons,"Ordered mesoporous carbons have recently been synthesized using ordered mesoporous silica templates. The synthesis procedure involves infiltration of the pores of the template with appropriate carbon precursor, its carbonization, and subsequent template removal. The template needs to exhibit three-dimensional pore structure in order to be suitable for the ordered mesoporous carbon synthesis, otherwise disordered microporous carbon is formed. MCM-48, SBA-1, and SBA-15 silicas were successfully used to synthesize carbons with cubic or hexagonal frameworks, narrow mesopore size distributions, high nitrogen Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas (up to 1800 m(2) g(-1)), and large pore volumes. Ordered mesoporous carbons are promising in many applications, including adsorption of large molecules, chromatography, and manufacturing of electrochemical double-layer capacitors.",10.1002/1521-4095(200105)13:9<677::AID-ADMA677>3.0.CO;2-C,95,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

The large choice of building blocks means that the structures and pore characteristics of the metal-organic frameworks can be tuned relatively easily. However, despite much research, it remains challenging to prepare frameworks specifically tailored for particular applications. Here, we have used computational modelling to design and predictively characterize a metal-organic framework (NU-100) with a particularly high surface area. Subsequent experimental synthesis yielded a material, matching the calculated structure, with a high BET surface area (6,143 m(2) g(-1)). Furthermore, sorption measurements revealed that the material had high storage capacities for hydrogen (164 mg g(-1)) and carbon dioxide (2,315 mg g(-1))-gases of high importance in the contexts of clean energy and climate alteration, respectively-in excellent agreement with predictions from modelling.",10.1038/NCHEM.834,96,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,
J,"Xin, S; Gu, L; Zhao, NH; Yin, YX; Zhou, LJ; Guo, YG; Wan, LJ",Smaller Sulfur Molecules Promise Better Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,"The lithium-sulfur battery holds a high theoretical energy density, 4-5 times that of today's lithium ion batteries, yet its applications have been hindered by poor. electronic conductivity of the sulfur Cathode and, most importantly, the rapid fading of its capacity due, to the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates (Li2Sn, n = 4-8). Despite numerous efforts concerning this issue, combatting sulfur loss remains one of the greatest challenges. Here we show that this problem can be effectively diminished by controlling the sulfur as smaller allotropes. Metastable small sulfur molecules of S2-4 were synthesized in the confined space of a conductive microporous carbon matrix. The confined S2-4 as a new cathode material can totally avoid the unfavorable transition between the commonly used large S-8 and S-4(2-). Li-S batteries based on this concept exhibit unprecedented electrochemical behavior with high specific capacity, good cycling stability, and superior rate capability, which promise a practicable battery with high energy density for applications in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage systems.",10.1021/ja308170k,97,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Sun, YG; Mayers, B; Herricks, T; Xia, YN",Polyol synthesis of uniform silver nanowires: A plausible growth mechanism and the supporting evidence,"We have recently demonstrated an approach based on the polyol process for the large-scale synthesis of silver nanowires with uniform diameters (see Sun, Y.; Gates, B.; Mayers, B.; Xia, Y. Nano Leff. 2002, 2,165. Sun, Y.; Xia, Y. Adv. Mater. 2002, 14,833. Sun, Y.; Yin, Y.; Mayers, B. T.; Herricks, T.; Xia, Y. Chem. Mater. 2002, 149 4736). Although the capability and feasibility of this method have been successfully illustrated with the production of silver nanowires 30-60 nm in diameter and 1-50 mum in length, the growth mechanism of this process is yet to be elucidated. Here we report some progress on this matter: First, electron microscopy studies on microtomed samples indicated that the cross sections of such silver nanowires had a pentagonal shape, together with a 5-fold twinned crystal structure. Second, the side surfaces (bounded by {100} facets) and the ends (bounded by {111} facets) of each nanowire were shown to have significant difference in reactivity toward dithoil molecules, with the side surfaces being completely passivated by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and the ends being partially passivated (or essentially uncovered) by PVP. This result implied that the PVP macromolecules interacted more strongly with the {100} planes than with the {111} planes of silver. On the basis of these new results, we proposed that each silver nanowire evolved from a multiply twinned nanoparticle (MTP) of silver with the assistance of PVP at the initial stage of the Ostwald ripening process. The anisotropic growth was maintained by selectively covering the {100} facets with PVP while leaving the {111} facets largely uncovered by PVP and thus highly reactive.",10.1021/nl034312m,99,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
