0,"The magnetic and electrical properties of the BiFe1-xMnxO3 (x = 0.05, 0.15) films in the temperature range of 80-600 K have been investigated. The Curie temperature (Tc) of the films has been determined. A decrease in the conductivity of the films with x = 0.05 upon cooling in an electric field from the temperatures T<Tc has been found. This effect has been described in the model of decreasing quantum well (domain wall) density and the tunneling coefficient drop. A decrease in the conductivity of the BiFe1-xMnxO3 film by more than an order of magnitude upon cooling from high temperatures in a magnetic field has been established.

1,"A single step fast track method is proposed to determine melamine based on strong hydrogen bonding between exocyclic amine group in melamine moiety and hydroxyl group of tannic acid (TA); acting as reducing and functionalizing agent for synthesis of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The proposed strategy is facile and highly time saving; as the detection of melamine with label-free gold nanoparticles was accomplished within five minutes. The colorimetric probe exhibits high detection limit of 8 nM for melamine determination in raw milk, which is very low as compared to other capping ligands employed for Au NPs such as borohydride, citrate and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid.

3,High pressure has the capacity to produce potential novel structures with exciting physical and chemical properties. Nitrides find diverse usages in industry and captivate much attention in research. We have explored Sn-N system under pressure range 0-300 GPa with an objective to construct the complete phase diagram of Sn-N system. We have revealed two thermodynamically stable compounds; SnN2-Pa-3 and SnN4-P-1. The SnN2-Pa-3 has a wide indirect band gap 4.2 eV and transformed to a tetragonal structure SnN2-I4/mcm at 100.5 GPa.

4,"Thermomechanical streaking is a common optical surface defect that affects architectural 6xxx series aluminum extrusions, and can be cause for rejection of the product. AA6060 profiles were extruded at a range of ram speeds using a specialized die with internal geometry purposely designed to produce thermomechanical variation throughout the profile. Subsequently, the extrudates underwent an industrial anodization pretreatment process that revealed the presence of streaks throughout three designated regions. The optical appearance, microstructure and surface topography of streaked and surrounding regions of the extrudate surface were analyzed using colorimetry, electron backscattered diffraction, and optical profilometry. Differences in perceived lightness, roughness, and grain size were observed between streaked and surrounding regions. Changes in appearance of the surface directly correlated with the surface roughness, with rougher surfaces yielding an increase in the perceived lightness. The surface roughness was determined to be primarily dependent on the size and distribution of grain etching steps as related to the surface grain size. A difference in grain size in the regions surrounding the streaks was determined to be the microstructural origin of the visual defect.

5,"With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a model of future Internet and pervasive computing that has its own particular difficulties gained from the Internet as far as adaptability, vague topology, and so on are concerned. The proposed work means to determine the difficulties posed by IoT in the service discovery field. Most of the data analytics algorithms applied for data collected through sensors and actuators assume that the data are complete such that each property of the instances is filled with the appropriate value. These data have temporal and spatial correlation between them, and missing such data results in a significant decrease in accuracy and reliability of data analysis performed. Considering the importance of estimating the spatial data and the intricacies involved in estimating it using interpolation techniques, the proposed work bases its system development using an aspect-oriented programming improvement technique, thereby addressing the interpolation strategy as a cross-cutting aspect and reducing the complexity involved thereof. The proposal analyzes the situation of missing data and appropriately weaves the aspect and the application together, thereby decreasing the complexity in handling the interpolating data. The woven aspect estimates the missing data using an inverse distance weighting method and updates the information. Observation of the experimental results reveals significant improvement in response time compared with estimating the unknown value in a conventional manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"During a crystal growth from a thin melt layer, the transport of dopant occurs mostly by diffusion. One can describe the dopant distribution by simplified analytical equations, as, for example, those previously obtained by Tiller. We performed numerical 2D axi-symmetric computations of heat and mass transfer in a thin melt layer (0.05 < h/d < 0.2), in order to find the limits of the validity of such approaches. Sb doped Ge, in a cylindrical volume with a diameter of 200 mm, was used as a model material. Compared with the heat transfer, the mass transfer was found to be much more sensitive to residual convection. Some restrictions in the application of the analytical equations for the description of the experimental data are revealed and necessary recommendations to improve the results are made. In order to provide the uniform axial dopant distribution in the very last portion of the ingot, too, it is necessary to vary the rate of solidification by changing the cooling rate with time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These perfluoroperoxides were used radical copolymerization initiators for fluoroorganic compounds. Copolymers with given characteristics were synthesized by casting a solution of the copolymers to form membranes with several characteristics exceeding those of Nafion membrane (DuPont).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"In order to provide the safest possible built environment for pedestrian use, care must be taken to supply walking surfaces that are slip resistant. However, there remains an inability to establish a method of consensus for determining whether a surface is slip resistant. Two current walkway-safety standards illustrate two different approaches to this issue-ANSI A137.1, American National Standards Specifications for Ceramic Tile, and ANSI/NFSI B101.3, Test Method for Measuring Wet DCOF of Common Hard-Surface Floor Materials, promotes a numeric threshold model, while ASTM F2508, Standard Practice for Validation, Calibration, and Certification of Walkway Tribometers Using Reference Surfaces, is a validation standard based on the relative ranking of walkway surface materials. The goal of this study was to determine whether these two standards are compatible in how they rank/evaluate surfaces. To do this, two tribometers, (the BOT-3000E (BOT) (Regan Scientific Instruments, Southlake, TX, USA) and English XL Variable Incidence Tribometer (XL) (Excel Tribometers, Chesapeake, VA, USA)) were used to take slip resistance measurements using the four reference surfaces designated in the ASTM F2508 standard. Measurements for the BOT were taken under three conditions: (1) styrene-butadiene-rubber (SBR) test foot with distilled water and surfactant (consistent with ANSI/NFSI B101.3), (2) SBR test foot with distilled water, and (3) Neolite test foot with distilled water. Measurements for the XL were taken using a Neolite test foot with distilled water. Results indicate that the vinyl composite tile was the reference surface nearest to the ANSI threshold for high slip resistance but fell approximately 11 % below the threshold value of 0.42. The two most slippery reference surfaces (granite and porcelain) fell well below the ANSI threshold for high slip resistance, while the most slip resistant (ceramic tile) was well above the threshold. Unexpectedly, we also found a strong linear correlation (R-2 = 0.99) between the measurements from the XL versus the BOT with SBR and surfactant test condition, which allowed for conversion of slip resistance readings between the two tribometers under these conditions. These results provide new data that allow aspects of the ASTM and ANSI standards to be directly compared.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"The bioavailability of a drug at the target site is vital to repair the degenerated cartilage following trauma or osteoarthritis (OA). Previously, we developed targeted nanosomes with anti-type II collagen monoclonal antibody (MabCII) on their surface that can bind to the damaged cartilage. The efficiency of nanosomes is highly dependent on their physicochemical nature. Therefore, in this study, we presented a rigorous method for examining the physicochemical characteristics and biological efficacy of nanosomes. Nanosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Specificity of nanosomes for type II collagen was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Release kinetics of nanosomes was determined by dialysis method using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye. The biological efficacy of targeted nanosomes encapsulating TGF-beta 3 was determined in porcine chondrocytes (pChon). Moreover, the binding specificity of targeted nanosomes to the damaged cartilage was confirmed onto the cartilage explants and in a mouse model of spontaneous osteoarthritis (OA). The synthetic targeted nanosomes were unilamellar with a mean diameter of 200 nm. Retention factor (Rf) values for all the lipids were in accordance with the standards with a mean 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) concentration of 3.22 nM. It was found that nanosomes release approximately 50% the encapsulated product at 37 degrees C within 24 h. TGF-beta 3-targeted nanosomes found to reduce the expression of inflammatory marker matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1) in chondrocytes stimulated with TNF alpha. In brief, in this study, we present a comprehensive approach to characterize the physicochemical and biological characteristics of nanosomes. Furthermore, this approach can be utilized to deliver the drug or molecule of interest to the diseased or damaged tissues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"In this work, the charge transport properties of bulk heterojunction formed by p-type benzodithieno-imidazole (BDTI-Br) based ?-conjugated polymer and PCBM acceptor has been investigated in photovoltaic configuration under dark conditions. Temperature dependent current-voltage (J ? V) characteristics show a transition from ohomic (J?V<i) to trap dominated space charge limited current with a power law J ?V-m, m?2 for higher applied voltages. Capacitance-voltage measurement shows that capacitance value at reverse bias is drift controlled and the accumulation of diffused charge carriers contribute at forward bias. An equivalent impedance model gives charge carrier lifetime values in milliseconds and electron mobility values in the range of ?10(?5) cm(2) V-?1 s(?1); in line with that obtained by charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage method. The extrapolated dc conductivity values in 113 K?473 K show Arrhenius like behavior with an activation energy of 145 meV. Notable changes in temperature dependent conductivity, carrier concentration and carrier mobility values around 320 K indicate a strong correlation of charge transport process with structural changes that may occur in bulk heterojunction around its thermodynamic glass transition temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"Applications of porous materials require macroscopic shapes, which makes it easier to handle and recover them. The direct fabrication of hierarchically porous macroscopic shapes, without the use of additional binders or complex post-treatments, is both challenging and promising. Flow devices offer a convenient route, with high controllability, to synthesize monodisperse particles. Hierarchically macro/mesoporous silica beads were prepared by means of a co-axial flow device combined with the co-micelle/emulsion dual templating strategy. Precursor droplets, which react to form the silica beads, were produced with the flow device and the size of the droplets was strongly influenced by the external fluid flow rate. Hierarchically porous silica beads with diameters from 300 to 800 mu m were produced as the flow rate was decreased over the range investigated. Furthermore, it was observed that the hierarchical pore structure and sizes of the pores on the different length scales were not significantly affected by the bead sizes, which provides the ability to optimize the size of the beads independently. The silica beads had mesopores around 4 nm in diameter, BET surface areas above 350 m(2)/g and mesopore volumes of approximately 0.25 cm(3)/g.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"The oxidation behaviors of Al-Cr-Y coatings with different Al contents prepared by pack cementation process were investigated. The results show that the coating with 2 wt% Al in the pack has a three-layer structure, while the coatings with 2.5 wt% and 3 wt% Al have two layers. In addition, the main phases in the coatings with 2 wt% and 3 wt% Al are alpha-Cr and NiAl, respectively, while the main phase in the coating with 2.5 wt% Al is NiAl with several Cr-rich particles and solid-solution Cr atoms in the coating. The oxidation test demonstrates that the coated specimen with 2 wt% Al has the poorest oxidation resistance and the coated specimen with 2.5 wt% Al has the best oxidation resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"In order to solve the problems of the brittleness, high hardness, complex shapes, long production times and high cost of ceramic parts, a novel 3D printing system for ceramics is proposed for the fabrication of ceramic parts by means of continuous extrusion. Based on an analysis of the principle of continuous extrusion of ceramics as a forming process, the system structure, nozzle extrusion device and motion control system were developed. The influence of the process parameters on the quality and defects of printed parts was analyzed in a series of printing experiments. The causes of defects (tiny cracks, porosity, holes and irregular morphology) were explored and summarized. Precise contours, size and high bonding quality can be obtained when the printing speed is matched well to the speed of ceramic extrusion. Vases and model heads were fabricated using the 3D printing system. The results of the experiments show that the 3D printing system can meet the precision requirements for ceramic parts. The feasibility and correctness of the 3D ceramic printing technique are verified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Fundamentally different responses of a LiTaO3 thin film detector are observed when it is subjected to short microwave pulses as the pulse intensity is altered over a wide range. We start from weak microwave pulses which lead to only trivial pyroelectric peak response. However, when the microwave pulses become intense, the normally expected pyroelectric signal seems to be suppressed and the sign of the voltage signal can even be completely changed. Analysis indicates that while the traditional pyroelectric model, which is a linear model and works fine for our data in the small regime, it does not work anymore in the large signal regime. Since the small-signal model is the key foundation of electromagnetic-wave sensors based on pyroelectric effects, such as pyroelectric infrared detecters, the observation in this work suggests that one should be cautious when using these devices in intense fields. In addition, the evolution of detector signal with respect to excitation strength suggests that the main polarisation process is changed in the large signal regime. This is of fundamental importance to the understanding on how crystalline solids interact with intense microwaves. Possible causes of the nonlinear behaviour is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"The effect of an Electro-Fenton system on the deep treatment of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and corresponding removal rate was investigated in this article. By using simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater, it included a Cl- concentration of 3000 mg/L, SO42- concentration of 100 mg/L according to conventional leather wastewater conditions. Furthermore, Cl- and SO42- can be used as supporting electrolyte. After pretreatment, the ammonia nitrogen concentration kept about 100 mg/L. The optimal treatment conditions of Electro-Fenton system were obtained throughout single factors experiments. The current density was 150 A/m(2), the reaction time was 30 min, the plate spacing distance was 40 mm, and the reaction temperature was adjusted to 40 degrees C. After flocculation treatment of leather wastewater, the ammonia nitrogen concentration was 142.11 mg/L, and the tanning wastewater was further treated with an Electro-Fenton system. The final ammonia nitrogen concentration was 11.23 mg/L, which meets the first-level wastewater discharge standard. The removal rate was 92.10%, which indicated that the Electro-Fenton system is one kind of clean, feasible and sustainable treatment method for the deep treatment of ammonia nitrogen in tannery wastewater.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"The effect of pre-deformation on the fatigue properties of 2024-T4 aluminum alloy is evaluated, including pre-tension of 1, 2, 3, and 4 % as well as pre-torsion of 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 40 degrees. Multiaxial low-cycle fatigue (LCF) tests are carried out under a constant amplitude sinusoidal wave loading with a tension-torsion ratio root 3 in air at room temperature. The results indicate that the multiaxial LCF life of the specimen reduces with the pre-deformation level. The observed mechanical behavior and associated phenomena are directly linked to microstructure characteristics, such as dislocation density, surface defects, and microcracks. The analysis of mechanism reveals a competition between beneficial effects that are due to hardening and detrimental influences that are due to defects that are caused by the pre-deformation. However, the multiaxial loading makes the detrimental influence more prominent. The typical fracture morphology of multiaxial fatigue can be observed. With the consideration of the effect of pre-deformation on fatigue limit, a modified criterion is developed to predict the multiaxial fatigue life of 2024-T4 aluminum alloy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"With the development of basic theoretical research and equipment, laser additive manufacturing technology is widely used in the manufacture of large complex components. However, the internal stress in laser additive manufacturing process tends to result in distortion and cracking. Stress and deformation control has become an urgent issue in laser additive manufacturing process. In this paper, research progress of residual stress in laser additive manufacturing was reviewed from various aspects such as residual stress forming mechanism, test methods, control measures.

19,"Interface engineering plays a critical role in the device performance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In inverted OPVs, the top anode must have a high work function to match the highest occupied molecular orbital level of a p-type organic semiconductor. Therefore, a functional interlayer with a high work function is inserted between the light-absorbing layer and anode. OPVs with a dual-anode buffer layer have been reported to exhibit a superior performance than those with a single-anode buffer layer. Herein, the device performance of inverted OPVs with a poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester light-absorbing layer and dual-anode buffer layer of MoO3 and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) is investigated. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPV with the HAT-CN/MoO3/Al anode system is lower than that with the conventional MoO3/Al anode system. However, the PCE of the OPV with MoO3/HAT-CN/Al is slightly higher than that with MoO3/Al. The change in the device performance by varying the deposition sequence of HAT-CN and MoO3 is discussed based on the built-in potential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"The effect of NaF and CaO/SiO2 mass pct. ratio (C/S) on the hydrogen solubility in terms of the hydroxyl capacity of the CaO-SiO2-NaF welding flux system was investigated at 1823 K. As a cost-effective alternative to CaF2 in welding fluxes, NaF can potentially increase the fluidity, electrical conductivity, and hydroxyl capacity of welding fluxes in advanced high-strength steels. Additions of 1.9 to 5.9 mass pct. of NaF was found to depolymerize the structural units in the flux system. Depending on the flux composition, the dominant hydrogen dissolution mechanism varied. At C/S values less than 1.06, the incorporated-hydroxyl dissolution mechanism was dominant in the present flux system, in which SiO2-based complex structural units were pronounced. At C/S values above 1.06, the free-hydroxyl dissolution mechanism was pronounced due to the strong network-modifying CaO content supplemented by NaF. A combination of Fourier transformed infrared, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis was used to determine the structural implications of NaF additions and C/S, which were correlated to the hydroxyl capacity of the flux. High NaF contents and C/S values were found to depolymerize the complex structural units of the molten flux by supplying greater amounts of network-modifying free oxygen (O2-) and fluorine (F-) anions to the flux system in the compositional range of this work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

22,"Recently, the five-year review for ASTM D7310, Standard Guide for Detection and Rating of Plastic Films Using Optical Sensors, was carried out. One of the key goals for this review was refining the document such that it may eventually be transitioned to a full-fledged test method. However, before such a goal could be realized, it was necessary to determine the practical limitations of the technique relative to the expected precision, repeatability, and reproducibility. To that end, interlaboratory studies were carried out in two stages. Stage one served as a pilot study and the participating laboratories were given limited guidance. This allowed identification of key control variables that would need to be defined in subsequent broader studies and ultimately in the future method. In stage two, the key variables identified in stage one were controlled and the precision of the technique was elucidated for three material types: polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, and low-density polyethylene. The results from these studies are discussed herein.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"We present a novel design of a parameterization image stitching algorithm for ultrashort throw laser MEMS projectors. The resultant method allows the use of projectors with short or even long throw ratios to achieve ultrashort throw projection through a parameterized algorithm to stitch multiple images into one single frame, alleviating the trade-off between the resolution and frame rate in conventional laser MEMS displays. To evaluate the effectiveness, we construct a test system that consists of three off-the-shelf projectors with a throw ratio of 1.3 and three planar reflective mirrors. Using our method, the integrated system yields an ultrashort throw ratio of 0.26, greatly reducing the projection distance from 12 to 2.6 ft for the 120-in. screen in diagonal. Moreover, our algorithm can be fine-tuned to correct for image distortion, intensity variation, and edge mismatch induced by two-axis light beam steering, thereby further improving the image quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

26,"The shifts in quality of global reserves of iron ore, as well as the progressive advances in environmental legislations, are tendencies that have motivated researches on the usage of iron and carbon-bearing residues in the production of sinter for blast furnace ironmaking. These residues, however, are commonly limited in use due to their physical (particle size distribution) and chemical (heavy metals, alkali and zinc contents) properties as compared to sinter feed. In that sense, it is necessary to verify the impact of these materials on sinter quality and on sintering process parameters. In order to assess the recycling potential of residues via sintermaking, mixtures with increasing proportions (4.5-50%) of iron and steel-making residues were prepared and tested in controlled laboratory conditions representing those of the sintering machine. The effect of residues on sinter mineral phases and chemical quality was evaluated and showed few differences in sinter quality for a mixture resulting from recycling 100% of a plant's residue generation (4.5% of the mix). The greatest impact was an increased presence of wustite in the produced sinter, beyond 25% of residues in the mixture. The results indicated that there are opportunities, in the industry, for increasing the recycling of residues via sintermaking. (C) 2019 The Authors.

28,"Carbon Fibers Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) composite material bars were machined on the lathe. In experiments -15 degrees, 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees approach angles, 0.1 mm x rev(-1), 0.15 mm x rev(-1), and 0.2 mm x rev(-1) feed rates and 560 rpm, 800 rpm, and 1120 rpm spindle speeds were selected. At -15 degrees and 0 degrees approach angles, the deformation influence was dominant on surface roughness and chip morphology, while the cutting effect taking place at the cutting edge was dominant at 30 degrees and 45 degrees approach angles. Primarily at 45 degrees, the most significant roughness values and the shortest cut fibers were achieved due to the occurrence of maximum shear stress according to Tresca. However, fibers were removed from samples on the whole form as bundles, without any cutting, at -15 degrees and 0 degrees approach angles, by the effect of deformation. According to ANOVA, regression and variance analysis results were obtained with p-values and probability results of surface roughness smaller than 0.05 and 5 %, respectively. These results showed that the feed rate was the most influential parameter for turning of CFRP material, followed by the approach angle and spindle speed, respectively. However, the least influential parameter in the processes was spindle speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,"Conveyor belts of special importance must have superior mechanical characteristics. The joining by vulcanization of the conveyor belts allows to obtain superior performances, but it has been found that at the vulcanizing joint of the conveyor belts, there is a ""bell""-type defect. This type of defect can cause the quick removal of the conveyor belts from use; thus, within this paper, we realized the constructive optimization of vulcanization installations using the finite element method (FEM). Thus, the FEM analysis was performed for the installation used at the present time, which has four spacers for stiffening, moving to the next stage to a stiffening system with seven spacers and, in the last stage, it was proposed to use a stiffening plate. The joined conveyor belts were of type ST 2000, and by the constructive optimization of the vulcanizing press type DSLQ, the bell-type defect was greatly reduced. Also, an analysis of the effects that the constructive optimization of the vulcanization installation has on the resistance to extraction of the metallic insert from the rubber matrix of the costs determined by the proposed constructive modifications, has been performed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The composites of the microcapsules and EVA were prepared by incorporating the microcapsule nanoparticles into ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), respectively. To further understand the intrinsic correlation between microcapsule fillers and EVA matrix, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was introduced to qualitatively analyze the contribution of microcapsule fillers on improving compatibility and mechanical properties of the EVA matrix. The compatibility of microcapsule nanoparticles with EVA matrix were detected in sequence through SEM, DSC and tensile strength tests. And the combustion, thermal behavior and flame retardance were also characterized by TG analyses as well as LOI and UL-94 level. As a result, the MAH@MF filler had the best performances in improving the flame retardancy and mechanical properties among the microcapsule fillers, attributed to high compatibility of the MAH@MF and EVA matrix, which made uniform distribution of the MAH@MF filler due to the reciprocity of triazine functional ring with vinyl acetate linkages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the minimum requirement of the normal physiological function is around 8.00 D. In this study, the haptic is connected to an optical-grade silicon wafer made of polydimethylsiloxane, establishing a human optical system with an optical power of approximately 23.02 D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"Shear strength of carbon-reinforced concrete members without shear reinforcement - Experimental investigations of the influence of the reinforcement ratio on load-bearing behaviour Fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) as reinforcement for concrete members in structural engineering are becoming increasingly important. Compared to conventional steel reinforcement, FRP reinforcement is different in terms of modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and bond behaviour. If concrete compression failure can be excluded, members with the same mechanical ratio of longitudinal reinforcement have the same bending load bearing capacity. The high tensile strengths of FRP reinforcement can lead to a reduced required reinforcement area and thus geometric ratio of longitudinal reinforcement. This effect leads to a reduced shear strength and increased crack widths and spacings. This article presents and evaluates experimental investigations on the shear strength of concrete members without shear reinforcement. Two different member types were analysed: slabs with textile carbon reinforcement and beams with carbon bars. For a direct comparison with conventionally reinforced members, reference tests with steel reinforcement and comparable mechanical reinforcement ratio were carried out. In addition to a detailed description of the specific properties of the used materials and a comparison of the load-bearing and deformation behaviour of the members, a precise evaluation of the cracking behaviour is shown. Finally, the influence of the reinforcement ratio on the shear strength is presented and the resulting conclusions are summarised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"The crystal shape algorithm as a tool in the quantitative characterization of agglomerated morphologies of materials is reviewed. Irrespective of whether there is agglomeration or not, the material morphology is made up of a fundamental unit known as the crystal habit, which is captured by the crystal shape algorithm. Using this algorithm both agglomerated and un-agglomerated morphologies were studied. Enhanced electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4 cathode material is achieved not only from a preferred crystal orientation along the 400 direction, but also when the crystal growth completely stops along the 311 direction. The cubic crystal habit of LiMn2O4 thus shows much better electrochemical performance as compared to the hexagonal crystal habit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) is one of the ecologically and economically important conifer species in the southeastern USA. However, a disease decline syndrome, southern pine decline (SPD), associated with beetle-vectored root-infecting fungi, has emerged as one of the major challenges confronting loblolly pine production in this part of the country. Although several studies have been conducted to screen the susceptibility of the commercially grown families to these fungi, little information exists on wood properties associated with the susceptible and resistant families. Thus, the objectives of this study were (1) to understand variation in wood quality parameters among the families regarded as susceptible and tolerant to SPD, (2) to evaluate the utility of acoustic tool to differentiate between those families. The results indicated the velocity, fiber length, microfibril angle and slenderness of the susceptible families are comparable or superior to those of the tolerant families. The mean error rate of classification associated with acoustic tool ranged from 35 to 40% depending on the distance between the transmitter and receiver probes. The mean error rate of classification was 35% when probes were placed 120 cm apart. The results from this study signify that a family tolerant to pine decline is not synonymous to a quality wood family and possibility of using acoustic tools to allocate pine species into PD susceptibility classes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"Organic electronic devices have seen a new enthusiasm in flexible electronics. Indeed, they know new applications and improved performances even fabricated at low temperatures by low-cost solution-process and printing technologies. Nonetheless, some critical aspects remain to be improved, such as organic semiconductor (OSC) patterning and the control and alignment of organic crystal growth in the desired location and direction. Herein, a new controlled OSC solution-growth processing, which directly occurs within planar electrodes patterning, is reported. A capillary-driven flow occurs in air-opened microchannels and then confines the OSC solution before growing these crystals in the desired region and direction. 1) The modeling, 2) fabrication, 3) experimental functionality of such capillary-driven flow techniques, and 4) growth of OSC single-colored crystals in situ integrated planar device electrodes are reported. Polarized optical images show large crystal growth (i.e., >100 mu m) of typical pi-conjugated small molecules (diF-TES-ADT and C8-BTBT). By such a technology, benefits from both 1) the meniscus-guided coating mechanisms and 2) advantages of maskless and noncontact digital printing technologies are taken. Finally, these results visualize the directional control of OSC single-crystal growth in a printing-compatible (dispensing, inkjet) route in a reliable and reproducible way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"Providing peculiar enhanced features to leather items is a factor of primary importance for the marketing of high-end articles; although tanning production is oriented to satisfy a wide market range, it is mainly in the 'high end' and 'premium luxury' categories that the quality properties of the material are more expressed, indeed. It is particularly on this market segment that the main current challenges have been focussed, according to the growing requirement of technological innovation, sustainability and product quality. Light-coloured leathers, with particular reference to white items, belong to the category of materials designed especially for the luxury market. For this type of articles, the uniformity of colour and the agreeable appeal of the overall surface appearance are crucial requirements for the most international fashion and luxury brands. One of the most common and undesirable defects of this type of article is the alteration of the colour, with particular reference to the localised or diffused effects of yellowing of the surface of the material. There are several causes able to contribute to the production of this type of defects, due to the complexity of the matrix and to the variability of traditional or innovative production processes used: from the intrinsic fragility, photosensitivity and thermo-sensitivity of the finishing polymers, to the chemical instability of some components of the finishing pigments, further the presence of photosensitive chemical additives, the migration of skin components or assembly components of the manufactured articles (fats, fillers, plasticisers, glues etc.), up to the indirect contribution of environmental and thermo-climatic factors able to affect negatively the performance of the material. SSIP, which has always been involved in research and consulting activities for the leather industry with regards to defect monitoring, through this work, would offer an overview of all the main tools for advanced diagnostics (with particular reference to Scanning Electronic Microscopy and to chromatographic and spectroscopic methods) aimed to the identification of the causes of yellowing, beside to explore innovative solutions for the development of strategies for the resolution and/or minimisation of the problem of yellowing. The technical solutions will include innovative tanning processes, innovative finishing methods, and leather surface treatments carried out in order to provide a sensible attenuation of surface absorption of IR and UV-visible radiation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"This paper describes the development of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for regulation of the airflow in a ventilation system. The flow was adjusted by controlling the speed of the fan installed in the system. The PID control algorithm was developed for an embedded system in an Atmega 2560 microcontroller contained in an Arduino Mega development kit, where the airflow rate was detected by a Hall-effect sensor that generated a pulsed signal at a frequency proportional to the speed of the fan. Simulation results were used to parameterize the control algorithm, minimizing the benchtop development time. Full details of the procedure are presented in order to assist future PID proposals involving embedded systems in microcontrollers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"A flow-focusing microfluidic chip based on assembled capillary method is developed and the solid-core encapsulation behaviors of double emulsion in a flow-focusing microchannel are visually observed via high-speed microscopic imaging system. The experimental results identify the encapsulation of single, double and triple cores in a flow-focusing microchannel arising from the competition among the inertial force of inner phase, the shear force of outer phase fluid, and the interfacial tension. In addition, the solid-core encapsulation of double emulsion in flow-focusing microchannel is either in the stable state or in the transition state, depending on the flow rates of inner and outer phase fluid. The stable microencapsulation includes the stable single-core, double-cores and triple-cores encapsulation states, while the transition microencapsulation includes the single-double-cores and double-triple-cores transition encapsulation state. Irrespective of encapsulation state, the solid-core encapsulation process can be classified into four stages, including entering, neck stretch, neck shrinking and breakup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"Wireless Sensor Networks contain an incredible number of hubs with limited registering, detecting, and wireless communication capacities. These systems have been utilized as a part of a wide zone of utilizations, such as human services, contamination checking, and target-following frameworks. The dynamic clustering of sensors into bunches is a prevalent procedure to expand the system lifetime and increment adaptability. To accomplish this, in this article the sensor hubs are adjusted to ensure a long lifetime and the activities are arranged into rounds that use fixed time intervals. In the first phase, a clustering topology is found, and a group head is picked in view of the outstanding energy level. Then the cluster head screens the network energy threshold value to identify the energy drain rate of all its cluster members. In the second stage, the Long-Lifetime and Low-Latency Data Aggregation Scheduling method is used. This scheduling method assigns schedule openings to group part information parcels. Here, congestion occurrence is completely kept away from the scenario. In the third stage, an Energy-Efficient Distributed Schedule-based convention is used to keep up greatest residual energy level over the network. The experimental outcome shows the steps proposed in this article ensure an increase in the network lifetime and decrease in the energy utilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"The porous silicon (PSI) process is a wafering method to fabricate high quality kerfless crystalline Si wafers by epitaxial wafer growth on porous Si and subsequent detachment from a reusable substrate wafer. The process yield is a key parameter for the economic viability of the PSI process. We experimentally demonstrate the detachment of 59 out of 62 PSI wafers with a size of 10 x 10 cm(2), and separation layer etch current densities of 105-120 mA/cm(2) for electrochemically etching the porous Si, and for substrate wafers with a resistivity of 15.7-16.9 m Omega cm. We discuss the statistics of how to deduce a detachment probability from this. From our experiments, we determine a detachment yield of at least 88% with an error probability of 5%. The demonstration of a 99% detachment yield with an error probability of 5% would require at least 300 successfully detached wafers with no failed detachment. Samples have a minority carrier density ranging from 1 to 1.7 ms before any external gettering, which demonstrates the high electric quality of the PSI wafers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"Single-molecule spin transport represents the lower limit of miniaturization of spintronic devices. These experiments, although extremely challenging, are key to understand the magneto-electronic properties of a molecule in a junction. In this context, theoretical screening of new magnetic molecules provides invaluable knowledge before carrying out sophisticated experiments. Herein, we investigate the transport properties of three equatorially low-coordinated erbium single ion magnets with C-3 nu symmetry: Er[N(SiMe3)(2)](3) (1), Er (btmsm)(3) (2) and Er(dbpc)(3) (3), where btmsm = bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl and dbpc = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresolate. Our ligand field analysis, based on previous spectroscopic data, confirms a ground state mainly characterized by M-J = +/- 15/2 in all three of them. The relaxation of their molecular structures when placed between two Au (1 1 1) electrodes leads to an even more symmetric similar to D-3h environment, which ensures that these molecules would retain their single-molecule magnet behavior in the device setup. Hence, we simulate spin dependent transport using the DFT optimized structures on the basis of the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, which, in 1 and 2, suggests a remarkable molecular spin filtering under the effect of an external magnetic field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"Poly(3-hexylthiophene), (P3HT), is widely used in organic semiconductor applications. Time of Flight measurements on P3HT displayed three distinct hole transport pathways with corresponding mobilities above 10(-4), between 10(-5) and 10(-4) and below 10(-5) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) over a range of sample thickness (1.1 mu m-4.2 mu m), and electric field (2.4 MVm(-1) to 37.7 MVm(-1)). The space-charge limited current (Mott-Gurney) device mobility was in agreement with that obtained for the fastest route (10(-4) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)). The transport pathways were distinguished using a dispersive transport plot of reciprocal transit time versus electric field to thickness ratio and are described by single (pseudo dispersion) parameters: alpha(t1) = 0.97, alpha(t2) = 0.73 and alpha(t3) = 0.62. The P3HT displayed 3 M mass peaks obtained by Gel Permeation Chromatography, which are the most likely cause of the three pathways. The dispersive transport analysis used here offers clearer distinction between pathways than Poole-Frenkel plots and offers a full mobility description, including the dependence on sample thickness, making it suitable for general application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"O-doping has proved to be one of the most promising approaches to further enhance the supercapacitive performance of carbon materials. However, it is presently not clear how the type of doped-O species affects the capacitive performance. In this paper, an attempt has been made to probe into the possible correlation between the type of doped-O species and the corresponding capacitive performance. Three O species (C=O, C-O and O-C=O) have been introduced onto TiC-derived carbon (TiC-CDC) by using a facile room-temperature oxidation strategy with three typical oxidizing agents (H2O2, HNO3 and (NH4)(2)S2O8), respectively. The results have shown that as the content of the C=O species increases, both the specific capacitance and the capacitance retention for the oxidized TiC-CDC samples become higher, showing a positively correlative performance. This work suggests that optimizing the type of doped-O species will be great potential for obtaining the optimal electrochemical performances for the O-doped carbon materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

45,"Au-Pt-Ti/high-k/n-InAlAs metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors with HfO2-Al2O3 laminated dielectric were fabricated. We found that a Schottky emission leakage mechanism dominates the low bias conditions and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling became the main leakage mechanism at high fields with reverse biased condition. The sample with HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm) laminated dielectric shows a high barrier height phi(B) of 1.66 eV at 30 degrees C which was extracted from the Schottky emission mechanism, and this can be explained by fewer In-O and As-O states on the interface, as detected by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test. These effects result in HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm)/n-InAlAs MOS-capacitors presenting a low leakage current density of below 1.8 x 10(-7) A/cm(2) from -3 to 0 V at 30 degrees C.

XRD showed that In3+ ion not changed phase formation in low doped content. Grain size had obvious changes due to In3+ ions. Under In3+ ion doping, magnetic hysteresis loops showed both saturation magnetization (M-s) first increased and then decreased, and the maximum value was 33.2 emu g(-1) (x = 0.10).

48,"In order to observe the microstructure and morphology of porous titanium -oxide thin film, deposition is performed under a higher Ar gas pressure than is used in the general titanium thin film production method. Black titanium thin film is deposited on stainless steel wire and Cu thin plate at a pressure of about 12 Pa, but lustrous thin film is deposited at lower pressure. The black titanium thin film has a larger apparent thickness than that of the glossy thin film. As a result of scanning electron microscope observation, it is seen that the black thin film has an extremely porous structure and consists of a separated column with periodic step differences on the sides. In this configuration, due to the shadowing effect, the nuclei formed on the substrate periodically grow to form a step. The surface area of the black thin film on the Cu thin plate changes with the bias potential. It has been found that the bias of the small negative is effective in increasing the surface area of the black titanium thin film. These results suggest that porous titanium-oxide thin film can be fabricated by applying the appropriate oxidation process to black titanium thin film composed of separated columns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

50,"It is important to be able to control the physical and chemical integrity of carbon-based porous monolith structures while being tailored for targeted analytical, energy and catalytic based applications. A set up using a CO2 laser in continuous mode (CW CO2 laser) was implemented to cut fragile and porous carbon monolithic (CM) and nanotemplated carbon monolithic (NTCM) rods into discs with a prescribed thickness and dimensional integrity (denoted as LCM and LNTCM, or LCMs). Changes in structure, porosity and composition of LCMs were induced by the efficient thermal energy afforded by the CW CO2 laser irradiation under tightly controlled process conditions. The main effects observed before and after laser cutting were studied in comparison with traditional scalpel blade cutting of carbon monolithic (SCM). FE-SEM images confirmed that the resulting LCMs exhibited a more open, interconnected macroporous structure and smoothed mesopores to a depth of approximately 5 while the structure of the bulk section remained intact. Minimal changes in chemical compositions were confirmed by XPS. Raman spectroscopy revealed a modest increase in the graphitic content on the cross sections of LCM discs.

Results showed that the equiatomic alloy was composed mainly by austenite and Ti-rich phases, growth rate and porosity of samples were reduced with the graphite substitution.

Poly (Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid) (PLGA) has been chosen to produce micropillars of different heights and different pitches using a combined method of soft-lithography and hot embossing. The stiffness of such pillar substrates varies over a large range so that RMSCs show effectively different spreading behaviors which are also sensitive to the inclining angle of the pillars.

Moreover, cells preferentially elongate along the direction perpendicular to that of the pillars' inclining, which is in agreement with the calculated anisotropy of the pillar substrate stiffness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,"Sputtering is the method widely used to fabricate thin films including nitrides in spintronic research fields. One of the issues to fabricate the nitride thin films via sputtering is the control of N deficiency. In this work, it was demonstrated that the use of atomic diffusion improved the insulating property of amorphous BN (a-BN): BN deposition caused the nitridation of Co underlayer, and the diffusion of N from Co-N into BN reduced the N deficiency of BN. The a-BN formed via this sequence showed flat interfaces and no pinholes and could be used as a tunneling barrier layer. This provides an insight into synthesizing stoichiometric BN thin films. A negative tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of -0.2% was observed at room temperature. The TMR ratio increased with a decrease in temperature to -0.7% at 10 K. The effective thickness and height of the barrier were estimated to be 1.78 nm and 0.52 eV, respectively, for 2 nm thick BN-MTJs based on the dependences of transport properties on the bias voltage and temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"In the present study, the effect of Si addition on the microstructure and subsequently, on the oxidation behavior of nanostructured oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS, 14YWT) ferritic steel was investigated. Two types of nanostructured ODS ferritic steel powders viz. Fe-14Cr-2W-0.3Ti-0.3Y(2)O(3) (Si-free) and Fe-14Cr-2W-0.3Ti-1Si-0.3Y(2)O(3) (Si-containing) were mechanically alloyed up to 50 h and consolidated via spark plasma sintering. The Si-containing sintered ODS steel contained single phase ferritic microstructure with finer grains and nanoparticles of Y2Ti2O7, SiO2, and Cr2TiO4; whereas, the Si-free one contained different phases such as ferrite, austenite, and martensite with nanoparticles of Cr2O3 and Y2Ti2O7. After performing oxidation at 850 degrees C for 100 h, the weight gain in the Si-containing sample was similar to 18 times lower than that of the Si-free sample. Analyzing the surface and cross-section of the oxide layers via SEM-EDS, XRD, Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns and Raman spectroscopy, it was revealed that Si-free ODS steel consisted of outer Fe2O3 and inner FeCr2O4 layers which were porous and possessed whisker-like morphology. However, the oxidized Si-containing ODS steel possessed thin, dense, adherent and strong protective outer layer of (Fe, Cr)(2)O-3 and the inner layer consisted mixture of Cr2O3 and Fe2SiO4 oxides. Synergistic effect of the single-crystal structure matrix and Si addition in the Si-containing ODS steel played a crucial role in forming thin, dense and protective oxide layers during the oxidation process, resulting in improved oxidation resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,"The propagation of surface acoustic wave (SAW) on the piezoelectric substrate requires conventionally an interdigitated electrode structure to excite the mechanical displacement at resonance frequency. The control of the electrode thickness could be useful to manipulate the energy confinement and the band dispersion of the surface guided mode. It has been demonstrated recently that high aspect ratio (HAR) electrode could produce a dispersive shear horizontal and vertically polarized surface modes in the bulk piezoelectric substrate. In this theoretical study, we propose to employ a high aspect ratio electrode on top of the GaN/sapphire-layered substrate enabling the presence of Sezawa surface mode. Based from the dispersion band, we obtained a higher frequency of surface guided mode in the non-radiative zone in the GaN/sapphire heterostructure configuration compared to the bulk GaN substrate. Indeed, these guided modes are induced by the hybridization between Sezawa surface mode and the mechanical resonance of the HAR electrode producing nearly a flat band at the limit of First Brillouin Zone. Furthermore, the displacement of each guided modes indicates the confinement of energy mostly in the electrode with a slight amount of energy in the top layer of the substrate. We demonstrated also the frequency tuning of guided mode using diverse materials for the electrode but also the thickness of GaN layer. The obtained results could be useful for the development of high-frequency telecommunication and sensing device based on Sezawa surface acoustic wave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, the formation volume was found to be equivalent to the difference between the volumes of the relaxed bulk and defective structures. The formation volume versus 'x' exhibited a nonlinear pattern with regions of Fe-induced volume contraction (within x<50%, i.e., Si-rich region) and expansion (x>50%, i.e., Ge-rich region).

57,"To lower the fabrication cost in the direct formation of 2-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials on substrates, tungsten disulfide (WS2) layers were deposited on soda-lime glass substrates instead of sapphire glass substrate by radio-frequency (RF) sputtering and rapid thermal annealing (RTA) was carried out at temperatures lower than 600 degrees C (from 400 degrees C to 550 degrees C). From the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) images, it was possible to observe much larger bumps on the surface of WS2 on soda-lime glass at higher RF sputtering powers and higher RTA temperatures. The Raman spectra results showed the 2D WS2 layers were formed at the higher RF sputtering powers as a formation of E-2g(1) peak and A(g)(1) peak and the Hall measurement results also showed the carrier mobility was dependent on the RF sputtering powers and RTA temperatures. The structural and electrical characteristics showed that 2D WS2 layers can be directly formed on soda-lime glass substrates at temperatures below 600 degrees C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The synthesized powders consisted of the Ba1.3Ca0.7SiO4 phase with a hexagonal structure. The photoluminescence spectra of the powders exhibited two emission bands in the blue-green (A-band) and red (B-band) regions, which were assigned to the 4f(7)-4f(6)5d transition of Eu2+ and spin-forbidden d-d transition of Mn2+, respectively. The B-band arose from an energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+. The multiple photoluminescence resulted in Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates occurring in the warm white light region. Increasing x and y had differing effects on the crystal structures, photoluminescence properties, and particle morphologies of the synthesized powders. The B-band was closely dependent on the x values, whereas increasing y mainly produced a change in the luminescence of the A-band. The particle size increased with the x and y values. The findings were explained using an ionic radius discrepancy, the crystal field strength, and a site occupancy factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,"Design equations to evaluate the bursting force in a post-tensioned anchorage zone have been introduced in many design codes, and one equation in AASHTO LRFD is widely used. However, this equation may not determine the bursting force exactly because it was designed on the basis of two-dimensional numerical analyses without considering various design parameters such as the duct hole and shape of the bearing plate. To improve the design equation, modification of the AASHTO LRFD design equation was considered. The behavior of the anchorage zone was investigated using three-dimensional linear elastic finite element analysis with design parameters such as bearing plate size and diameter of sheath hole. Upon the suggestion of a modified design equation for evaluating the bursting force in an anchorage block with a rectangular anchorage plate (Kim and Kwak 2018), additional influences of design parameters that could affect the evaluation of bursting force were investigated. An improved equation was introduced for determining the bursting force in an anchorage block with a circular anchorage plate, using the same procedure introduced in the design equation for an anchorage block with a rectangular anchorage plate. The validity of the introduced design equation was confirmed by comparison with AASHTO LRFD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The I-p and electron affinity of the thin films are determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy. The I-p is tuned from 63 to 7.1 eV by varying Ga concentration from similar to 20 to similar to 50%. In addition, the electron affinity shifts from 3.8 to 4.3 eV by varying Cd concentration. Carrier concentration and mobility strongly depend on Cd concentration for Cd concentrations greater than 50%. Carrier concentration (mobility) decreases (increases) with increasing Cd concentration. In contrast, the influence of Ga concentration seems to be greater for Cd concentrations less than 50%. Carrier concentration varies in the range of 10(17) to 10(20) cm(-33).

61,"In this paper, nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide(rGO) is obtained by thermal annealing of nitrogen-containing compounds and graphene oxide (GO) manufactured by modified Hummers' method. We use melamine as a nitrogen-containing compound and treat GO thermally with melamine at over 800 similar to 1,000 degrees C and 1 similar to 3 hr under Ar atmosphere. The electrical conductivity of doped rGO is measured by 4-point probe method. As a result, nitrogen contents on rGO are found to be in the range of 2.5 to 12.5 at% depending on the doping conditions after thermal annealing. The main doping site on graphene oxide is changed from pyridinic-N and pyrrolinic N to the graphitic site as the heat treatment temperature increases. The electrical conductivity of doped rGO increases as the N doping content increases. As the thermal treatment time increases, the change of both total doping contents and doping sites is slight and the surface resistance is remarkably reduced, which is caused by healing effects of doped graphene oxide at high temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

63,"A heating of a carbon-made product and thermophysical properties of a carbon material in the temperature range from 300 to 2,500 K were studied. A discrete-heterogeneous mechanism of heating the surface of a multi-dimensionally reinforced carbon-carbon composite material (CCCM) subject to accelerated heating was revealed. Based on the results of testing carbon materials in the temperature range from 300 to 3,000 K, a numerical stress analysis of the product was performed, in which the arising stress condition was considered to be resultant from constraining the deformation of the heated parts of the product by relatively cold fragments. The safety factor levels were found for different parts of the product. It was shown that an additional increase in thermal strength as part of the combined definition of thermal resistance of CCCM products is associated with high thermal conductivity of 1D-reinforced rods of material structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation of such vortices demonstrates the nonuniqueness of the corresponding boundary value problem. We present some evidence that such vortices can be related with ptygmatic folds, which are observed in rock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"The results of investigations on autogenous laser welding of 5.0-mm-thick high-strength steel Domex 960 are presented in this article. The experimental plates delivered directly from the steel manufacturer were used for butt joint welding. The disk laser with maximum output power (maximum capacity of the laser generator) of 3.3 kW, emitting at 1.03 mu m, and with the beam spot diameter of 200 mu m was used for the trails of welding. Initially, the beadon-plate welding tests were carried out, and then the test butt joints were laser welded. The influences of basic technological welding parameters, especially the energy input of laser welding on the shape of the fusion zone, the microstructure of weld metal and heat affected zone, and the impact toughness were analyzed. Laser welding trials were conducted in a wide range of energy input from 100 to 400 J/mm. Despite the low energy input of the laser welding process and also the short cooling times t8/5, tendency to cold crack was found neither in the weld metal nor in the heat affected zone. The carbon equivalent (CET), determined by the chemical analysis of the experimental melt, was just 0.341, indicating moderate tendency to increase hardness after welding because of martensitic transformation. It was found that the energy input has a clear influence on the microstructure and the impact toughness of the weld metal. The weld metal of the test butt joint welded at the energy input of 198 J/mm showed the average impact toughness at approximately 80 % of the base metal, whereas the weld metal of the test butt joint welded at a lower energy input of 132 J/mm showed the average impact toughness at the level of just 60 % of the base metal of Domex 960 steel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"Vegetable tanned leathers with good embossing, air permeability, natural look and pleasing firm handle properties have applied in many goods with multiple uses. However, the performances of vegetable tanned leathers still need a further improvement. In this work, a kind of nonionic gemini aliphatic polyurethane surfactants (GPUs) with different hydrophobic chain lengths as a retanning agent combined with polyacrylic acid (PAA) for condensed tannin tanned leathers to improve their performances. The effects of the alone or combined use of the PAA and GPU, the hydrophobic chain length of GPU, and the offer percentage of retanning agent were studied by evaluating the organoleptic properties, shrinkage temperature, mechanical properties of the obtained leathers. The best performance was found in the leather retanned with PAA and 12-GPU-550 complex retanning agent, and the mechanical properties of leather could be improved when the total offer percentage was controlled at 4 wt%. Moreover, the collagen fibers morphologies and lightfastness properties of leathers retanned with different retanning agents were investigated. The results showed that the total color difference Delta E and the yellowness index Delta b decreased significantly with the introduction of 12-GPU-550, and the leather retanned with PAA and 12-GPU-550 complex retanning agent showed the lowest value of Delta E, demonstrating that the lightfastness properties were improved significantly. Therefore, it was an attractive way to combine use of PAA and 12-GPU-550 as complex retanning agent, which can improve the mechanical and lightfastness properties of vegetable tanned leathers simultaneously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,"In this study, the glass melting properties are evaluated to examine the possibility of using refused coal ore as replacement for ceramic materials. To fabricate the glass, refused coal ore with calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in it (which are added as supplementary materials) is put into an alumina crucible, melted at 1,200 similar to 1,500 degrees C for 1 hr, and then annealed at 600 degrees C for 2 hrs. We fabricate a black colored glass. The properties of the glass are measured by XRD (X-ray diffractometry) and TG-DTA (thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis). Glass samples manufactured at more than 1,300 degrees C with more than 60 % of refused coal ore are found by XRD to be non-crystalline in nature. In the case of the glass sample with 40 % of refused coal ore, from the sample melted at 1,200 degrees C, a sodium aluminum phosphate peak, a disodium calcium silicate peak, and an unknown peak are observed. On the other hand, in the sample melted at 1,300 degrees C, only the sodium aluminum phosphate peak and unknown peak are observed. And, peak changes that affect crystallization of the glass according to melting temperature are found. Therefore, it is concluded that glass with refused coal ore has good melting conditions at more than 1,200 degrees C and so can be applied to the construction field for materials such as glass tile, foamed glass panels, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"In this study, we investigated the characteristics of densification, phase formation, and electrical properties during reaction sintering when a Ga-doped ITO, with 10 at% Sn, served as the target material. Results showed that Ga doping enhanced the densification of ITO at a relatively low sintering temperature. Interestingly, the 1 at % Ga- and 20 at% Ga-doped samples showed shrinkage values of 19.5% and 23.0%, respectively, despite the fact they both starting shrinking at the same temperature. In addition, the second phase Ga3-xIn5+xSn2O16 was formed at 5 at% Ga-doped ITO. Moreover, the ITO lattice parameters decreased up to 40 at% Ga doping, since the ionic radius of Ga3+ is smaller than that of In3+. Furthermore, as the Ga concentration increased, the carrier concentration and mobility decreased and resistivity increased. These modifications are thought to result from an increasing quantity of the Ga3-xIn5+xSn2O16 s phase and the corresponding resistivity increase, both of which occur as a function of increasing Ga concentration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"In this work, we study physical and mechanical properties of oxide films formed on AZ91D magnesium alloy by plasma anodization at different temperatures. It is found that the higher the electrolyte temperature, the lower is the breakdown voltage of oxide layer. This is probably because films formed at higher temperatures are thinner and denser. Moreover, electrolyte temperature plays an important role in the physical properties of the films. As the electrolyte temperature increases from 20 to 50 degrees C, the hardness of the oxide layer increases. Friction test against steel balls indicates that wear scars become narrower for films formed at higher temperatures because the films are harder, as indicated by the Vickers hardness. The thinner and denser nature of the oxide film formed at 50 degrees C is also advantageous for heat transfer when film is used as a heat sink. Laser flash test results show very fast heat transfer for AZ91D with plasma anodized oxide layer formed at higher temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"Carbon dioxide emissions involved in global warming are one of the most important issues in the world, and carbon dioxide emissions from the cement industry are about 7% of total carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, reduction in the amount of utilized cement can contribute to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. The average life of concrete is 20 similar to 30 years, and if concrete life can be improved by ten years, cement use will be much lower. In this study, we examined the use and effect of fructan from microbes as a method for the densification of the pore structure of cement. The effect of fructan on the hydration reaction and pore distribution, as well as the water absorption of hardened cement mortar were studied. Pores distribution increased in mesopore OPC, and absorption rate was found to decrease with the use of fructan, which has a glue-like and swelling character.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"In the hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) process, the filament temperature is the most important factor because the temperature distribution has an effect on diamond film quality. In this work, the numerical simulation method to predict the filament temperature and the temperature distribution in a chamber was developed. The radiative heat transfer was simulated in 3-dimension using a commercial fluid dynamics (CFD) code, ANSYS-FLEUNT. Two color pyrometry has been applied to measure filament temperature. The filament temperature was numerically estimated and experimentally measured at the power levels of 480, 576, and 672 W at the fixed current of 32 A. The calculated temperatures were 2,070, 2,167 and 2,253 K by increasing the power level, while the measured temperatures were 2,051, 2,160 and 2,214 K, respectively. The numerical simulation result is reliable by comparing experimental measurement with a small error less than 2%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, wastewater from a paper mill making coated products was treated by a sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) after a lab-scale coagulation, resulting in COD, colour, and TSS removal efficiencies of 87.7 +/- 1.0%, 33.5 +/- 5.2%, and 41.4 +/- 3.7%, respectively, which exceeded the biological treatment performance in the paper mill. The removal of COD and colour was attributed to the removal of recalcitrant organic matter, and the removal of TSS was attributed to the biofilm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"FeNiHCF was prepared by co-precipitation method, and the influence of synthetic temperature on the sodium storage performance was studied. The microstructure and micromorphology of the as-prepared FeNiHCF were characterized by XRD and SEM. A sodium ion half cell was constructed with FeNiHCF as cathode and sodium as anode. The sodium storage performance of the prepared FeNiHCF was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge test. The results show that the change of synthetic temperature affects the micromorphology and sodium storage performance of the material. The initial sodium content, specific capacity and cycle stability of FeNiHCF prepared at 60 degrees C are the best. The FeNiHCF prepared at 60 degrees C is a very promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its specific radial charge current configuration, charges gather together on the central circular platform and form a plasmonic hotspot, covering a large circular region with a diameter of 200 nm, where E-field magnitude attains 34-time enhancement than that of the incident light, providing more potentials for energy harvesting or nanoparticle trapping, manipulating of light-matter interaction, and optical data storage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"Inspired by the integrated adsorption/degradation purification performances of paddy soil, a biomimetic paddy-soil-like superior purification material has been hydrothermally synthesized from natural zeolites. The formations of tobermorite and hydroxyapatite benefited the flexural strength up to 12 MPa and adsorptive properties to contaminants. In sewage treatment experiments, the zeolite-based materials achieved the limited removal rates of 34.6% (from 364 to 238 mg/L) and 26.3% (from 46.6 to 34.3 mg/L) respectively for COD and NH4+ due to saturation adsorption. After bioburden, the removal rate of COD and NH4+ increased significantly to 93.4% (from 364 to 24 mg/L) and 81.1% (from 46.6 to 8.8 mg/L), reflecting the integrated function of adsorption and further degradation.

76,"In this work, in vitro and in vivo corrosion degradation behavior of bone fixation screws made of Mg-3.0 wt%Zn-0.8 wt%Zr alloy (MZZ) aiming for a bone fixation material was investigated. In vitro immersion tests showed the corrosion type of MZZ screws were mainly pitting corrosion and the corrosion degree of the screw body especially the thread part was more severe in contrast to the screw cap. In vivo x-ray imaging analysis showed the joint connecting screw cap with screw body had fractured in three months following surgery. Micro-CT analysis confirmed the experimental results of the above x-ray analysis. And Up to three months after operation, the residual volume fraction (RVF) of screw body and screw cap was maintained about 35% and 45% respectively. Moreover, compared with the screws implanted in the lateral position of the condyle (hereafter, denoted as the condyle), the volume loss of MZZ screws implanted in the region between the trochanter and the medullary cavity (hereafter, denoted as the trochanter) was higher. Histological evaluation showed new bone tissues were generated on the surface of MZZ screws at one month postoperation. And some granular degradation products distributed in the soft tissue surrounding the MZZ screws. Obvious inflammation reaction to periosteal cells cannot be confirmed indicating the good biocompatibility of MZZ screws. Therefore, MZZ screws are expected to apply to medical installations in bone fixation surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"With the ever-increasing usage of recycled fibers, dry-strength agents play an increasingly important role in the papermaking industry. In this study, a new kind of dry-strength agent (CMS-g-PAM) was developed via grafting polyacrylamide onto carboxymethyl starch (CMS). Effects of the operation conditions, including the CMS-g-PAM dosage, polyaluminium chloride (PAC) dosage, and pH value of pulp system, on the properties of the paper were investigated. The contrasting effects when comparing the CMS-g-PAM and CMS were also researched. The results indicated that CMS-g-PAM had a beneficial effect on the paper properties. Compared to the control sample, when 1% CMS-g-PAM was added, the tensile index, burst index, and folding endurance of handsheets displayed noticeable increases of 38.2%, 34.7%, and 97.7%, respectively, and these properties were increased by 27.4%, 17.2%, and 46.6% when compared with the CMS-treated sample of this addition level.

There is only one reflected wave for a single impurity. The amplitude of the beads oscillation increases as the initial velocity of the boundaries beads increases, while it decreases as the viscosity coefficient increases. Two reflected waves will be produced if the impurity number is larger than a critical value. This critical value depends on both the initial velocity and the viscosity coefficient. In addition, the maximum amplitude of reflected wave is a constant, when the viscosity coefficient is large enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,"Molybdenum is a low-resistivity transition metal that can be applied to silicon devices using Si-metal electrode structures and thin film solar cell electrodes. We investigate the deposition of metal Mo thin film by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD). Mo(CO)(6) and H-2 plasma are used as precursor. H-2 plasma is induced between ALD cycles for reduction of Mo(CO)(6) and Mo film is deposited on Si substrate at 300 degrees C. Through variation of PE-ALD conditions such as precursor pulse time, plasma pulse time and plasma power, we find that these conditions result in low resistivity. The resistivity is affected by Mo pulse time. We can find the reason through analyzing XPS data according to Mo pulse time. The thickness uniformity is affected by plasma power. The lowest resistivity is 176 mu Omega.cm at Mo(CO)(6) pulse time 3s. The thickness uniformity of metal Mo thin film deposited by PE-ALD shows a value of less than 3% below the plasma power of 200 W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Big data has evolved as an ultimate approach in data origination, attainment, and processing and also analysis, coping with the heterogeneity of the data in order to obtain useful insights from it.

Numerous technologies are being developed with the evolution of big data. The input to those technologies and approaches is to be processed in such a way that they guarantee data quality, to yield better processing and results. An effective preprocessing approach is proposed in this article for the processing of big data. No single model can work well in the case of data processing, considering the challenges imposed with big data. Hence, a hybrid preprocessing approach is imposed here to deal with the data and processing, ensuring a better outcome.

81,"GH4169 alloy samples with V-grooves were experimentally repaired by electromagnetic stirring assisted laser repairing under different magnetic field currents. The morphologies and volume fraction of Laves in the repaired zone were compared, and the contents of Nb element in the matrix gamma and the hardness of the repaired sample were measured by changing the magnetic field currents to explain the relationship between the magnetic field currents and the element segregation as well as mechanical properties. The results show that with the assistance of electromagnetic field, the morphology of Laves is obviously changed from reticulate to rod-like and granular shape and its volume fraction is decreased. The content of Nb element in the matrix gamma is increased with the increase of the magnetic field current. When the magnetic stirring current is 60 A, the content of Nb element is 3.72 wt%, and it is increased by 0.33% compared to that without electromagnetic stirring. The hardness test shows that the electromagnetic stirring greatly increases the hardness of the repaired sample, which is related to the increase in the solid solubility of alloy elements such as Nb in the gamma phase of dendrite core. The electromagnetic stirring improves both the flow of liquid metal in the melting pool vertical to the dendrite growth direction and the homogeneous distribution of solute element; as a result, the dendrite arm is more developed and the eutectic structure is more homogeneous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"Phase composition, crystal structure as well as microwave dielectric properties of Li2O-3ZnO-5TiO(2) ceramics (LZT135, for short) with the addition of B2O3 and TiO2 were investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results revealed that the samples with added B2O3 and sintered at 900 degrees C had formed solid solutions with a similar crystal structure to Zn2Ti3O8. When 0.25 wt% B2O3 was added, LZT135 ceramics could be densified at about 900 degrees C, while the negative tau(f) value of about -31.5 ppm/K restricted its applications. TiO2 was added for further adjustment of the tau(f) value of LZT135 ceramics. Finally, with the addition of 0.25 wt% B2O3 and 9 wt% TiO2, near zero tau(f) values of about -0.5 ppm/K can be achieved for LZT135 ceramics, and at the same time, high Qf values of about 48 300 GHz are attractive for low-temperature co-firing ceramics technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"The electromagnetic acoustic resonance (EMAR) method with shear wave is sensitive to boundary conditions and plate thickness. In this paper, a new noncontact ultrasonic testing method based on the electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) in the resonant mode is proposed for the bonding strength evaluation in metal-based adhesive structures. Different from the conventional pulse-echo method using short-burst excitation for bonding inspection, the attenuation coefficient feature of the resonant ultrasonic signal with long-burst excitation is applied to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and detecting sensitivity of the EMAT for adhesive bonding strength evaluation. A theoretical model for adhesive bonding testing with EMAT signals in the resonant mode is established. To extract the signal feature representing the reflection coefficient, the time-domain signal was processed by Hilbert transformation and exponential curve fitting. Through the simulation on the received signal, the correlation between the attenuation coefficient of the exponent fitted curve and the strength on the adhesive imperfect interface were confirmed. Finally, the proposed correlation is verified by an experiment on stainless steel plates bonded with polymethyl methacrylate plates by epoxy adhesion via a permanent magnetic EMAT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

85,"In order to study the nature of interaction between Ba2+ and the KDP crystal surface, the adsorption behavior of Ba2+ on the KDP (100) surface was calculated by using density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the adsorption energies of Ba2+ on the KDP (100) surface are negative, indicating the adsorption processes are spontaneous and exothermic. Three types of adsorption configurations are formed after structure optimizations, and final adsorption positions are top sites on O atoms or bridge sites between two O atoms. The most stable adsorption system can be observed when Ba2+ on the bridge site between two O atoms within a phosphate group. In the three different adsorption configurations, Ba2+ can form ionic bonds with the surface O atoms, while interactions between Ba2+ and the surface H atoms exhibit covalent character.

86,"Bio-degreasing technology based on the use of lipases has attracted more attention in the leather industry. Although lipases have been applied in leather making in the past, the previously reported lipase degreasing ratio is still not very high, i.e. less than 60%. In order to correctly understand the mechanism of lipase degreasing and to choose lipases and optimize the degreasing process for achieving efficient degreasing, a novel method of evaluating the catalytic hydrolysis properties of lipases towards skin fats based on a greasy skin powder substrate in an aqueous medium was established. This simulated the actual leather degreasing process and detected the amount of fatty acids produced. The special substrate was prepared; the determination conditions were optimized; then the performances of several typical lipases were evaluated. The results revealed that the lipase performances determined by the novel method were quite different from the standard method using emulsified olive oil substrate. There was a strong product-inhibition characteristic in the catalytic hydrolysis reaction of lipase, and the inhibition concentration of fatty acids varied with the lipase type, thus the maximum hydrolysis ratio of fats was only 67%. The lipases exhibited ""super-activity"" at pH around 9.5. This occurred because the fatty acids produced transformed into soluble soaps, thus the product-inhibition was weakened. According to the above results, a two-step lipase processing was made, i.e., beginning at pH 7.5 then 9.5. The hydrolysis ratio of fats rose to 82.57% from 46.23%, and the degreasing ratio increased from 50.78% to 89.68%. The new method with better repeatability can be used as a tool to correctly select lipases and optimize process parameters for lipase degreasing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"The main thermodynamic constants Delta H-298(0) (change in the enthalpy of formation) and S-298(0) (entropy), as well as the equation for the dependence of the heat capacity in the entire temperature range of existence were first obtained for the compounds with the beta-quartz structure (PQS) and beryllian indialite (BI). The study samples were obtained by the sol-gel method from the solution of nitrates of beryllium, magnesium and aluminum and tetraethoxysilane. The calculated ratio of the components in the resulting MgO:BeO:Al2O3:SiO2 mixture was expected to be 2:1:1:6, respectively. The solid-phase synthesis included sintering the dry ground mixture in air and sampling at the crystallization temperature of the PQS and BI. With the physic-chemical analysis the traditional Babushkin method with the Taranenkova modification was used to account for the multi-component nature of the compounds. The thermodynamic analysis of both phases was accomplished with the scheme for a complex oxygen compound consisting of solid oxides, not having polymorphic transformations and melting congruently. The assumptions made do not contradict the data on the phase formation and thermometry in the phylogenetic series, their primary and final members being PQS and BI.

89,"Although several studies have been conducted on the mechanism of the formation of white layer by cyclic large shear deformation, and its effect on rolling contact fatigue, limited research has been carried out to find a correlation between sub-superficial layer of running contact surface and the crystallographic orientation, microstructural changes, and distribution of shear deformation and dislocation density. In order to understand the microstructural evolution (i.e., microstructure and crystallographic orientation) a used pearlitic rail sample removed from the heavy-haul railroad was investigated in the current work. A very thin superficial white layer was observed, approximately 15 mu m below the running contact surface. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a supersaturated ferrite phase with carbon content of approximately 3.78 C wt%. It could be attributed to the cementite dissolution due to severe shear and compressive stresses, during intense shear plastic deformation, from the rail-wheel interaction. The dominance of {110} ferrite grains parallel to the rail direction was characterised, in the transition layer between white layer and non-deformed pearlite structure, by X-ray diffraction and electron backscattered diffraction techniques. Formation of these grains, corresponding to the closed-pack plane of the ferrite matrix at the transition region, leads to great ductility and retarded crack formation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

91,"The moisture sorption isotherm of wheat gluten/epoxydized sesame or sunflower oil resin was determined at 25, 40, and 55 degrees C. The resin was prepared by cross-linking epoxydized oil and wheat gluten using I, 2, and 3% zinc chloride as the catalyst. The experiment was carried out over 0.1-0.9 water activity (a(w)) range using gravimetric sorption analyzer (Q 2000, TA Instruments, New Castle, PA, USA). The resin isotherms were found to be type III shape where the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) was higher at lower temperatures. The EMC of gluten epoxy resin was dependent on the degree of cross-linking because more cross-linking decreased EMC. The Guggenheim Anderson-de Boer (GAB) parameters support the theory of the free volume as it relates to monolayer absorption. This could be attributed to the decrease in the number of water binding sites due to the development of dense areas during cross-linking and increase in the free volume. The GAB and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller were found to be suitable for predicting the water sorption isotherm for gluten protein resin because it provided low root mean square error. The heat of sorption based on the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (q(st)) increased with decrease in moisture content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For first four samples only the diameter of core was varied and for other four samples only the weight percentage of CuO phase was varied. The existence of both cubic spinel ZnFe2O4 phase along with monoclinic CuO phase was verified by X-ray patterns recorded at room temperature. The average core diameter was in between 8 and 13 nm as estimated using Scherrer's formula and further verified by HRTEM images. A reduction in lattice parameter with increasing core thickness and also with increasing CuO phase was observed. A notable enhancement in coercivity and saturation magnetization were observed in field cooled (5 T) hysteresis loops obtained at 5 K for the first four varying core diameter core-shell structured nanoparticles in comparison to bare zinc ferrite nanoparticles of almost same size. A decreasing trend in coercivity and saturation magnetization was also noticed in low temperature hysteresis loops for higher CuO content samples. A considerable improvement in blocking temperature (T-B) as well as Neel temperature (T-N) for all the different core diameter samples were also found in M(T) protocols. Both blocking temperature and Neel temperature decreased for increasing CuO content in composite nanoparticles.

In this study, the microwave reduction approach was used to induce rapid nucleation and high supersaturation in order to fabricate small-sized reduced graphene oxide-supported palladium (Pd/rGO) electrocatalysts via the delayed addition of EG, elimination of the pH adjustment step, addition of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), prior microwave irradiation of the EG mixed with Na2CO3, and addition of room temperature precursor mixture. Besides its role as a second reducing agent, the addition of Na2CO3 was primarily intended to generate an alkaline condition, which is essential for the high-performance of electrocatalysts. Moreover, the microwave irradiation of the EG and Na2CO3 mixture generated highly reactive free radicals that facilitate rapid nucleation. Meanwhile, the room temperature precursor mixture increased supersaturation. Results showed improved electrochemically active surface area (78.97 m(2) g(-1), 23.79% larger), MOR (434.49 mA mg(-1), 37.96% higher) and stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"In this study, using a wet chemical process, we evaluate the effectiveness of different solution concentrations in removing layers from a solar cell, which is necessary for recovery of high-purity silicon . A 4-step wet etching process is applied to a 6-inch back surface field(BSF) solar cell. The metal electrode is removed in the first and second steps of the process, and the anti-reflection coating(ARC) is removed in the third step. In the fourth step, high purity silicon is recovered by simultaneously removing the emitter and the BSF layer from the solar cell. It is confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy(ICP-MS) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy(SIMS) analyses that the effectiveness of layer removal increases with increasing chemical concentrations. The purity of silicon recovered through the process, using the optimal concentration for each process, is analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy(ICP-AES). In addition, the silicon wafer is recovered through optimum etching conditions for silicon recovery, and the solar cell is remanufactured using this recovered silicon wafer. The efficiency of the remanufactured solar cell is very similar to that of a commercial wafer-based solar cell, and sufficient for use in the PV industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

96,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate how different disinfection protocols affect the surface roughness of gutta-percha (GP) cones used for the dental root canal filling using DIN 4768 standard and another alternative process for assessing roughness of small surface area (multiple profile), comparing both methods in order to identify similarities. The GP cones used were the conventional (C) and a new one impregnated with zirconia oxide, known as the coated cone (CC). Samples were distributed for each group and they were immersed in the correspondent chemical solution as follows: Group 1 (G1), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) at 5.25% for 1 min; Group 2 (G2), sodium hypochlorite at 2.5% for 10 min; and Group 3 (G3), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) at 2% for 5 min, as recommended by dentistry protocols. The averages and standard deviations of the surface roughness parameters-average roughness (Ra) and root mean square deviation roughness (R-q)-were calculated. Statistical analysis was made before and after immersion by paired t-test. Results showed a statistically significant difference for C GP cones after immersion in 2% CHX and 2.5% NaOCl (p < 0.01). No difference was found in CC GP cones. DIN 4768 standard and multiple profile measurements showed similar trends and behavior. (C) 2019 The Authors.

97,"Delonix regia has good potential for medicinal, nutritional, and energy applications. However, the manual process of decorticating Delonix regia is labor-intensive, slow, and tedious. Mechanization of the decorticating process would be of value to its utilization for medicinal, food, feed, or fuel purposes. In this study, preliminary compressive strength tests were carried out on the D. regia pods to determine the force required to fracture the pods. Subsequently, a machine capable of separating the D. regia seeds from the pods was designed based on impact of beaters on pods. A prototype of the developed machine was evaluated to determine its performance in terms of decorticating efficiency, whole seed recovery, feed rate, and throughput. The compressive tests showed that a force of 602 N was required to fracture the D. regia pods in transverse orientation. The decorticating efficiency of the designed machine, which had a power rating of 6 kW, was 100.0%, and the whole seed recovery was estimated to be 98.4%. The throughput of the machine was 56.4 kg/h. The developed decorticating machine allows enhanced potential for medicinal and nutritional application of D. regia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"Catalytically active cerium dioxide is used as light reflection materials for cosmetic applications. In fact, cosmetics containing this pigment cause too much oxidation on the skin. Therefore, the substitute for cerium dioxide is required to prepare the cosmetics without catalytic activity. Herein, as novel white pigments for use in cosmetics, cerium phosphates were prepared from cerium carbonate with hydrothermal treatment. The chemical composition (X-ray diffraction pattern and Infrared spectrum), powder properties (scanning electron microscopy images and particle size distributions), the photo and oxidation catalytic activity, color phase (ultraviolet-visible reflectance spectra and L*a*b* values), and smoothness of the cerium phosphates were evaluated. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was assessed from the decomposition of methylene blue. The oxidation catalytic activity of samples was estimated with ascorbic acid solution. All samples prepared in this work indicated X-ray diffraction pattern of cerium phosphate hydrate. Samples prepared in this work had no photo and oxidation catalytic activities. They indicated the absorption at 300-330 nm and high reflectance within the range of visible light. Because samples indicated higher L* values than 89, these materials are possible to use as white pigments. All materials prepared in this work had higher smoothness than cerium oxide.

99,"Gradient descent method is an essential algorithm for learning of neural networks. Among diverse variations of gradient descent method that have been developed for accelerating learning speed, the natural gradient learning is based on the theory of information geometry on stochastic neuromanifold, and is known to have ideal convergence properties. Despite its theoretical advantages, the pure natural gradient has some limitations that prevent its practical usage. In order to get the explicit value of the natural gradient, it is required to know true probability distribution of input variables, and to calculate inverse of a matrix with the square size of the number of parameters. Though an adaptive estimation of the natural gradient has been proposed as a solution, it was originally developed for online learning mode, which is computationally inefficient for the learning of large data set. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive natural gradient estimation for mini-batch learning mode, which is commonly adopted for big data analysis. For two representative stochastic neural network models, we present explicit rules of parameter updates and learning algorithm. Through experiments on three benchmark problems, we confirm that the proposed method has superior convergence properties to the conventional methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
