J,"Park, J; Seo, BK; Park, JI",A Framework for Real-Time 3D Freeform Manipulation of Facial Video,"This paper proposes a framework that allows 3D freeform manipulation of a face in live video. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed framework provides natural 3D manipulation of a face without background distortion and interactive face editing by a user's input, which leads to freeform manipulation without any limitation of range or shape. To achieve these features, a 3D morphable face model is fitted to a face region in a video frame and is deformed by the user's input. The video frame is then mapped as a texture to the deformed model, and the model is rendered on the video frame. Because of the high computational cost, parallelization and acceleration schemes are also adopted for real-time performance. Performance evaluation and comparison results show that the proposed framework is promising for 3D face editing in live video.",10.3390/app9214707,0,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,
J,"Park, Y; Hyun, S; Hong, YW",A Stochastic Model for Virtual Data Generation of Crack Patterns in the Ceramics Manufacturing Process,"Artificial intelligence with a sufficient amount of realistic big data in certain applications has been demonstrated to play an important role in designing new materials or in manufacturing high-quality products. To reduce cracks in ceramic products using machine learning, it is desirable to utilize big data in recently developed data-driven optimization schemes. However, there is insufficient big data for ceramic processes. Therefore, we developed a numerical algorithm to make ""virtual"" manufacturing data sets using indirect methods such as computer simulations and image processing. In this study, a numerical algorithm based on the random walk was demonstrated to generate images of cracks by adjusting the conditions of the random walk process such as the number of steps, changes in direction, and the number of cracks.",10.4191/kcers.2019.56.6.12,1,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Parlak, S; Tetik, E",Soil Characteristics of Natural Silver Linden (<i>Tilia tomentosa</i> Moench) Populations,"Studies regarding the determination of the ecological characteristics of the natural distribution areas of the silver linden (Tilia tomentosa Moench) are limited. It is of great importance to select areas with similar natural cultivation characteristics in the plantations established for flower or timber production. Physiographical factors affecting these forests were explored to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil. The soil samples were collected from three natural populations, and a total of 43 samples were examined in terms of aspect, elevation, declivity position, and slope. It was determined that the natural linden populations expanded between the altitudes of 0 m and 400 m and 88% of the populations were denser in aspects with shadow. It was found that 91% of the soil was in the class of ""deep to very deep"", 61% showed an expansion in sandy clay loam soils, and 30% showed an expansion in sandy loam soils. Average soil pH ranged between 5.6 and 6.6. The soils were found to be salt-free and slightly limy.

J,"Paulin, H; Milton, RS; JanakiRaman, S; Chandraprabha, K",Audio-Visual (Multimodal) Speech Recognition System Using Deep Neural Network,"Recognizing the voice of a person by a smart device has become the need of the hour. Our cell phones are equipped with such features that converts speech to text, receives a command as a voice instruction instead of screen touch or pressing of a button. There are numerous intelligent machines such as automatic cars, robots, smart phones that use speech recognition features. These features are also very useful for people who are disabled and cannot use the smart devices with their hands. There are numerous techniques available to implement a speech recognition system. The need of such a system is to accurately recognize human voice at any circumstances, because the accent of each human differs for a single language, and also, the human voice is never devoid of noise and other emotional elements. So, the aim of such systems is to recognize human voices of different accents, even in a noisy environment. Because of this, an effective and robust speech recognition system has become important for machine and human interaction. Much voice-recognizing software depends purely on audio to recognize a voice, and one cannot guarantee that the audio will be noise free. In order to improve the accuracy and performance of traditional speech recognition system in a noisy environment, a new, nontraditional approach called a multimodal speech recognition system that uses both the audio and video features such as lip movement facial expression to recognize a speech is used. This article discusses the advantage of using video features along with the audio features with an experiment that proves it.",10.1520/JTE20180505,3,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,

J,"Persaud, SY; Arioka, K; Farquharson, K; Dixon, C; Judge, CD",A Mechanistic Study of Carbon Steel Cracking in 360Â°C Air and Hydrogen Environments,"Thirty percent cold-worked (CW) carbon steel tensile specimens were exposed to 360 degrees C air and hydrogen environments (2 MPa H-2 and 20 MPa H-2) under an applied load to produce intergranular creep cracking. In this study, cutting-edge microscopy techniques were applied to characterize cracking on multiple length scales and in three dimensions. The objective was to develop a better mechanistic understanding of creep cracking in carbon steel, and the known deleterious effect of hydrogen (attack) at the micro-to-nanoscale. Amorphous carbon along the fracture path was observed in all experiments, with evidence for nanoscale cavities/methane bubbles in hydrogen exposures, particularly at cementite-ferrite boundaries. Results suggested that creep or residual stress led to breakdown of cementite to amorphous carbon, cavitation, and/or formation of methane (depending on H-2 content); it is suggested that the combination of deleterious mechanisms leads to initiation and/or acceleration of creep cracking in CW carbon steel. Comparisons are made between the morphology of creep cracking in these laboratory experiments and recent results from characterization of creep cracking in ex-service carbon steel piping from a CANDU nuclear power plant. Although more subtle, similar morphology and chemistry at crack tips in laboratory and ex-service CW carbon steel suggests that the mechanism(s) of creep cracking is similar.",10.5006/3294,7,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,,

The films are studied by means of x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and optical spectrophotometry techniques. The structure of the films is found to be composed monoclinic MoO3, tetragonal indium and cubic In2O3. The phase percentage of In2O3 in the films increased to 26.3% upon annealing at 250 degrees C. The annealing process increased the microstrain, the defect density, the oxygen atomic content and lowered the crystallites and grains sizes in the films. Optically, two energy band gaps of values of 3.20 and 1.70 eV were detected for the MoO3/In/MoO3 system. In addition, nonlinear dielectric response associated with wide range of tunability in the dielectric constant value, in the optical conductivity and in the terahertz cutoff frequency was observed in the near IR spectral range. The annealing of the samples improved the nonlinearity in these parameters and make MoO3/In/MoO3 system more appropriates for optoelectronic technology applications as terahertz cavities and frequency convertors.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab5266,10,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,,

J,"Rahman, TU; Amin, S; Haroon, SS",A novel methodology for volume reduction of HV capacitors using highly electronegative composite nano materials,"Capacitors play a key role in many electrical applications and devices. High voltage capacitors are commonly used in many stationary and mobile applications. Mobile applications of high voltage capacitors are of special interest for military installations and weapons. Size reduction of military equipment has always been a point of interest as it favours its easy handling, transportation and deployment. Capacitance offered by common dielectrics for high voltage capacitors is inversely proportional to thickness whereas withstand voltage is directly proportional to thickness. So, increasing the capacity of a high voltage capacitor without increasing its size is a daunting task. This research was aimed at reducing the size of high voltage capacitor while preserving its capacitance at same level by a novel method. Three of the common dielectric materials (polyethene, mylar and paper) for making high voltage capacitors, were surface treated with different concentrations of a nano powder specially formulated beforehand in a separate process. An increase in capacitance of about 12?35 times for different dielectrics was observed while keeping the size constant. This means a net reduction in volume while offering the same capacity. The method used in this work is promising way to decrease the volume of high voltage capacitors especially for mobile and military applications.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab51d5,12,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,

The effluents were collected from a textile industry at different stages of treatment, such as Collection Tank Effluent, Effluent after Anaerobic Treatment (EAT), Tertiary Treatment Effluent, and Reverse Osmosis Feed Effluent. The collected effluent samples have been analyzed to establish physicochemical characteristics and their effects on the properties of concrete, such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength. Higher salt content in effluent mix water significantly increased the final setting time of the binder. Furthermore, the workability of the concrete made with effluent mix water is relatively higher than that of the control concrete mix. Also, concrete mixes made with textile effluent mix water demonstrated greater strength than that of the control concrete. Furthermore, EAT mixes have exhibited maximum compressive strength compared with other mixes and also had superior durability compared with the control concrete mix. The higher strength can be attributed to the nucleation effect caused by the presence of a high concentration of total solids in the effluent.

J,"Sano, Y; Yamaguchi, M",Preventing Silica Scale Formation Using Hydroxide Ions Generated by Water Electrolysis,"The reaction of silica with various cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by water electrolysis was investigated as a means of preventing the formation of silica scales in geothermal binary power generation. Through batch and continuous experiments, it was found that all silica in the cathode phase of a reaction device could be removed if the necessary amounts of magnesium and calcium were present. This occurs because a silica-magnesium-calcium compound is produced via a polymerization reaction with cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by electrolysis. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows that this material has the formula 2CaO-5MgO-8SiO(2)-H2O, and thus is likely generated by the reaction proposed by Sheikholeslami et al. (2019). Increasing the current sent through the reaction solution subsequently produces calcium carbonate. This technique for the separation of silica and calcium from aqueous solutions can be operated continuously without channel clogging, which indicates the possibility of practical applications. However, overly high currents promote the migration of protons from the anode to cathode phases, which inhibits the formation of precipitates due to a neutralization reaction. The proposed method is an effective approach for removing silica from a solution in geothermal binary power generation; although, a means of suppressing the effects of proton generation will be necessary if the process is also to be used to remove calcium ions.",10.3390/membranes9110154,18,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,

Thermogravimetric studies of the cured materials show that the thermal stability, the degradation pattern and the char yield are much dependent on the structure of the diphenol that is used for blending. The decreased thermal stability of materials from the blends is attributed to decreased cross links owing to the opening of the isomaleimide rings by diphenols during thermal polymerization. The materials with trimethylphenylindane and tetramethylspirobiindane units exhibit char residue of 21% at 800 degrees C. This is due to the thermal stability of the indane and spirobiindane moieties present in the diphenol molecules. The apparent activation energy for thermal degradation (E-a-D) and pre-exponential factor (ln A) are derived. The Friedman, corrected Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, corrected Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and advanced Vyazovkin methods are used to calculate the E-a-D values for various reaction extents (alpha s). The E-a-D values of poly(4,4 '-bisisomaleimido-diphenyl methane) vary from 168 to 226 kJ mol(-1). A slight decrease in E-a-D is noted for the initial alpha levels and increases constantly up to alpha = 0.3-0.75 and then the E-a-D values decrease with increasing alpha values. The highest values of E-a-D and ln A are observed for the polymer derived from the blend of VS with tetramethylspirobiindane diphenol.

The interference effects can be minimized with the help of adaptive directional antennas. The proposed model for implementing adaptive antenna techniques in MANET is a cross layer design. Utilizing adaptive antennas, two nodes are able to communicate when both the transmitter's and receiver's unidirectional radiation beams are directing toward each other's nodes. A cross layer methodology for dynamic topology control enables the interaction between medium access control layer and the routing layer for reaching the necessary quality of service (QoS) of various data packets. After the initialization of a network, the algorithm initially develops a topology and the routing techniques use this network topology to find out the route paths for data transmission.

The generalized version of this model is capable of covering any complex element. The contour tracing technique is employed to extract pattern elements from the image, and the closest model instance is selected in virtue of invariance of the improved Hu moments. The selected instances are transformed with respect to the geometric center, the coverage, and the coincidence to match the pattern elements in the image so as to reconstruct the whole pattern. The element filters are conducted on the reconstructed patterns to modify the elements and produce new innovative patterns of constant skeleton.

The surface structure of the catalyst with large specific surface area was obtained by surface etching of the gradient membrane with 1 mol/L HNO3. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis show that the PtCu replacement solid solution alloy is formed on the surface of the composite membrane electrode, the original Pt lattice is contracted and the spacing between the crystal planes is narrowed. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) RTEM-STEM measurements show that the surface of the post-processed samples has multi-peak structure and trench-pore structure. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were used to test the electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance of the samples. The results show that the dealloying of gradient materials can effectively reduce the platinum loading and improve the exchange current density of electrochemical hydrogen evolution. The Pt loading of the post-treatment sample is decreased by 20. 29%, the exchange current density of electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaches 0. 004217A/cm(2), and the catalytic performance is improved by 20. 58%.",10.11868/j.issn.1001-4381.2018.001256,50,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,
J,"Wei, C; Yang, WD; Cai, YM",Secure Transmission for Buffer-Aided Relay Networks in the Internet of Things,"This paper investigates the secure transmission for buffer-aided relay networks in the Internet of Things (IoT) in the presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers. For security enhancement, we adopt the max-link relay selection policy and propose three secure transmission schemes: (1) non-jamming (NJ); (2) source cooperative jamming (SCJ); and (3) source cooperative jamming with optimal power allocation (SCJ-OPA). Moreover, to analyze the secrecy performance comprehensively, two eavesdropping scenarios, i.e., non-colluding eavesdroppers (NCE) and colluding eavesdroppers (CE) are considered. Based on this, by modeling the dynamic buffer state transition as a Markov chain, we derive the exact closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability, the average secrecy throughput, and the end-to-end delay for each schemes. The analytical analysis and simulation shows that the SCJ-OPA scheme achieves similar performance as the NJ scheme when the total transmit power is small. On the other hand, when the transmit power is high, the performance achieved by SCJ-OPA is similar to that of SCJ. Thereby, the SCJ-OPA scheme can achieve better performance across the entire total transmit power, which makes up the defects of NJ and SCJ exactly.",10.3390/app9214506,51,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Woo, R; Kim, WK",Material and Structure Optimization of Substrate Support for Improving CVD Equipment Up Time,"We study substrate support structures and materials to improve uptime and shorten preventive maintenance cycles for chemical vapor deposition equipment. In order to improve the rolling of the substrate support, the bushing device adopts a ball transfer method in which a large ball and a small ball are mixed. When the main transfer ball of the bushing part of the substrate support contacts the substrate support, the small ball also rotates simultaneously with the rotation of the main ball, minimizing the resistance that can be generated during the vertical movement of the substrate support. As a result of the improvement, the glass substrate breakage rate is reduced by more than 90 similar to 95 %, and the equipment preventive maintenance and board support replacement cycles are extended four times or more, from once a month to more than four months, and the equipment uptime is at least 15 % improved.

Ultrasonic waves propagate in austenitic stainless steel welds with multiple paths and modes. This study employed a multi-view total focusing method using an ultrasonic phased array for defect detection in the welds of small-diameter austenitic stainless steel pipes. The detection capability of four different direct wave modes and eight different half-skip wave modes for typical defects were compared and analysed through numerical simulation. A fusion imaging method was developed using the preferred direct and half-skip wave modes. The process was further verified with a weld defect detection experiment carried out on small-diameter austenitic stainless steel pipes.

Its structure was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that 1) cross-linking increased the Schiff base in SDP, 2) immobilization barely changed the secondary structure such as alpha-helix and beta-sheet of SDP, and 3) adhesives were evenly distributed on the surface after immobilization. Studies on the enzymatic properties of SDP showed that the substrate imprinting significantly improved heat resistance and neutralization resistance of SDP. For example, the relative activity of SDP at 35 to 75 degrees C and at pH 4.4 to 6.5 was 5% and 15% more than that of the adsorption and crosslinking double immobilized pectinase (DP), respectively. In addition, after 8 cycles of use, the relative enzyme activity of SDP still reached 39.5%. Moreover, use of SDP decreased the cation demand in whitewater by 10% compared with DP. Overall, the use of a broad-spectrum substrate for imprinting to obtain SDP provides a new idea and method for using pectinase in in complex systems such as juice clarification and wastewater treatment.",10.15376/biores.14.4.9364-9374,57,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

J,"Xu, Z; Yuan, B; Gao, Y",The Positive Effect of Hydrogen Alloying on the Phase Tailoring and Mechanical Properties of Sintered Ti-13Nb SMAs,"The effect of hydrogen alloying on phase tailoring and mechanical properties of the sintered Ti-13Nb (at pct) shape memory alloy (SMA) was investigated. It was found that hydrogen addition changed the microstructure of the sintered Ti-13Nb-(0-31)H (at pct) alloys gradually from alpha + beta dual phase to single beta phase due to the lowered transition temperature of beta phase to alpha phase by hydrogen action. The reduction of alpha phase precipitation in the alloy reduced the amount of Nb squeezed out from the Nb-depleted alpha phase, and consequently decreased the mean Nb content in the beta phase. Thus, the Ms temperature of Ti-13Nb alloy was successfully increased from lower temperature to near room temperature, which consequently enhanced the recoverable strain of the alloy by easier martensitic transformation. The sintered Ti-13Nb-18H alloy presented a Ms temperature of 22 degrees C and a remarkable recoverable strain of 3.9 pct at room temperature, which is the highest value ever reported in the sintered Ti-Nb based SMAs. Meanwhile, the Ti-13Nb-18H alloy exhibited a fracture strain of 23.1 pct and a fracture strength of 1321 MPa, both better than that of the Ti-13Nb alloy, which was attributed to the hydrogen atoms in the alloy which caused solid solution strengthening and also increased the content of the b phase with higher plasticity.

The AAO is chosen as the leak element because its conductance remains constant from vacuum to atmosphere. The container to be measured is connected to the vacuum system via the AAO leak element. The dynamic differential pressure decay with time between the inlet and outlet of AAO leak assembly was measured and fitted by an exponential function, followed by volume calculation. The volume of two different containers has been obtained using this method with nitrogen, helium, and argon, respectively. The influence of temperature fluctuation on experimental results under vacuum and atmospheric pressure outlet conditions was discussed. For vacuum outlet conditions, the temperature change caused by pressure decay in one single experiment is small enough to satisfy the isothermal hypothesis, which makes the influence of temperature fluctuation on the experimental results negligible.

This paper introduces a method for producing an MCH with high bonding strength of the bonding wires by adding oxide additives (Al2O3, SiO2, and MgO) to a metal slurry. Pilot experiments were carried out at 1600 degrees C under a protective atmosphere. The results indicate that the temperature coefficient of resistance of the samples decreases whereas the bonding strength vastly increases, and the pulling forces of the bonding wires in the samples extends from 2 to 32 N. The pulling forces are progressively increased as the content of the spinel phase in the oxide additives increases. The mechanism of enhancement of the bonding strength is discussed herein. The microstructure characterization, element mapping, and element analysis of different samples were performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results indicate that the formation of a W-Si solid solution in the sample is the main reason for the decrease in temperature coefficient of resistance. The interface between the metal and spinel layers forms a zigzag and interlocked shape, which significantly improves the bonding strength between the lead wires and the ceramic matrix of the MCH.",10.1111/ijac.13319,76,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,

When the bilayer was heated in a temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment, the ordering in the alkylbenzene substrate caused the overlayer of naphthalenes to crystalize due to heteroepitaxy. Finally, the two layers mixed when the surface temperature was nearly at the desorption temperature and resonance energy transfer was observed from the alkylbenzene to naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes when the alkylbenzene percolated through the naphthalene and methylnaphthalene adlayers.

The corrosion resistance of the Co-17Re-23Cr-xNi alloys improved with increasing Ni concentration, in turn facilitating the formation of a protective chromia layer. This observation can be attributed to an enhanced Cr diffusivity, as quantitatively confirmed by the determination of the Cr diffusion coefficients of the Co-17Re-18Cr-xNi alloys. Reduction of the Cr concentration from 23 at.% to 18 at.% deteriorated the oxidation behavior, as mass loss was detected. Unexpectedly, the alloy with intermediate Ni concentration exhibited the best oxidation behavior among the various Co-17Re-18Cr-xNi alloys studied.

The delay of the transition from off-state to on-state, when a switching voltage U-0 is applied to a sample, is related to the time t(don) required to heat a sample to the metal-semiconductor phase transition temperature in VO2. The delay time t(don) decreases with the increase of U-0. It is shown that the calculated dependence of t(don) on the voltage U-0, obtained with the simplified heat balance equation of a sample and the ""critical temperature"" model, is in good conformity with the experimental data. It was found that the delay of reverse transition from the on-state to the off-state controls the conductive channel, within which the crystallites of VO2 are in the metallic phase. The delay time t(doff) of this transition determines the time during which, after turning off the voltage U-0, a conductive channel exists in a sample. The value of t(doff) increases with the increase of U-0. The reason for this behavior is the expansion of conductive channel with the increase of U-0. As a consequence, takes place the increasing number of VO2 crystallites in the metallic phase. Therefore, t(doff) increases due to an increase in the time required for dissipation of the heat released during the transition of the VO2 crystallites from the metallic phase to the semiconducting phase.",10.1007/s10832-019-00187-2,84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By comparing the experimental data and the theory, the size of the rotating elementary emitters was estimated. The size obtained (similar to 0.9 nm) is appreciably less than the diameter of carbon nanodots under study (similar to 3 nm), which indicates that the atomic groups responsible for the luminescence of carbon nanodots are nonrigidly connected with their cores and can rotate almost independently of them.",10.1080/1536383X.2019.1680977,96,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,
J,"Slewa, LH; Abbas, TA; Ahmed, NM; Hassan, Z",Synthesis of Architectural-Cubic Porous Silicon by Electroless Stain Etching in V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and HF Solution,"Porous silicon (PSi) samples were prepared via electroless stain etching of silicon substrates in HF using V2O5 as an oxidant and ethanol as a surfactant for different etching times. The effects of etching time, the use of ethanol in the etchant as a surfactant, and routine change of the etching solution during the chemical stain etching were studied. The morphologies of the etched silicon surfaces were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). For short etching duration of 1 to 2 h, few numbers of very large sized pores and inhomogeneous micro pores appeared on the etched silicon. By increasing the etching time to 3 h, relatively larger numbers of homogenous nanopores were formed. The addition of ethanol (surfactant) to the etching solution of V2O5 and HF led to the development of deep pores. Furthermore, routine change of the solution significantly increased the pore volume and pore depth of the sample, with large cubic pores appearing on the surface. Thus, the pore morphology of PSi is significantly influenced by the use of ethanol as a surfactant and the routine change of the etching solution.",10.1007/s12633-019-00265-8,97,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,,
J,"Wen, C; Shi, ZQ; Yang, WB",Doping sites observation of deep-level impurities in hyperdoped silicon via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy,"The direct observation of the doping sites of deep-level impurities in hyperdoped silicon is essential to determine the impurity diffusion, distribution, and precipitation via different hyperdoping processes or thermal annealing conditions. This is crucial to clarify the functioning of a mechanism, which can improve the impurity electroactivity. However, this observation, which is usually performed by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), is limited by some restrictions in the microscopic imaging conditions, such as the microscope resolution, the defocus of the objective lens, the specimen thickness, and the projected orientation of the specimen (i.e. the zone axis). Therefore, to eliminate these restrictions, conventional field-emission-gun HRTEM images in combination with image processing (deconvolution) were investigated in order to obtain structure images with atomic resolution. Both the substitutional and the interstitial doping sites of oxygen, chalcogen (sulfur and selenium), and transition metal (titanium and cobalt) impurities in silicon were determined by image contrast analysis. Finally, the favorable conditions for the direct observation of doping sites were defined. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.
