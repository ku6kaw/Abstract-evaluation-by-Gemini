0,"Hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon (HPNC) nanosheets (NS) have been prepared via simultaneous activation and graphitization of biomass-derived natural silk. The as-obtained HPNC-NS show favorable features for electrochemical energy storage such as high specific surface area (S-BET: 2494 m(2)/g), high volume of hierarchical pores (2.28 cm(3)/g), nanosheet structures, rich N-doping (4.7%), and defects. With respect to the multiple synergistic effects of these features, a lithium-ion battery anode and a two-electrode-based supercapacitor have been prepared. A reversible lithium storage capacity of 1865 mA h/g has been reported, which is the highest for N-doped carbon anode materials to the best of our knowledge. The HPNC-NS supercapacitor's electrode in ionic liquid,electrolytes exhibit a capacitane of 242 F/g and energy density of 102 W h/kg (48W h/L), with high cycling life stability (9% loss after 10 000 cycles). Thus, a high-performance Li-ion battery and supercapacitors were successfully assembled for the same electrode material, which was obtained through a one-step and facile large-scale synthesis route.

1,"By creating nanoscale pores in a layer of graphene, it could be used as an effective separation membrane due to its chemical and mechanical stability, its flexibility and, most importantly, its one-atom thickness. Theoretical studies have indicated that the performance of such membranes should be superior to state-of-the-art polymer-based filtration membranes, and experimental studies have recently begun to explore their potential. Here, we show that single-layer porous graphene can be used as a desalination membrane. Nanometre-sized pores are created in a graphene monolayer using an oxygen plasma etching process, which allows the size of the pores to be tuned. The resulting membranes exhibit a salt rejection rate of nearly 100% and rapid water transport. In particular, water fluxes of up to 10(6) g m(-2) s(-1) at 40 degrees C were measured using pressure difference as a driving force, while water fluxes measured using osmotic pressure as a driving force did not exceed 70 g m(-2) s(-1) atm(-1).",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

3,"A central goal of modern materials physics and nanoscience is the control of materials and their interfaces to atomic dimensions. For interfaces between polar and nonpolar layers, this goal is thwarted by a polar catastrophe that forces an interfacial reconstruction. In traditional semiconductors, this reconstruction is achieved by an atomic disordering and stoichiometry change at the interface, but a new option is available in multivalent oxides: if the electrons can move, the atoms do not have to. Using atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy, we have examined the microscopic distribution of charge and ions across the (001) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. We find that there is a fundamental asymmetry between the ionically compensated AlO2/SrO/TiO2 interface, and the electronically compensated AlO2/ LaO/TiO2 interface, both in interfacial sharpness and charge density. This suggests a general strategy to design sharp interfaces, remove interfacial screening charges, control the band offset and, hence, markedly improve the performance of oxide devices.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

5,"Photopolymerized hydrogels are being investigated for a number of tissue engineering applications because of the ability to form these materials in situ in a minimally invasive manner such as by injection. In addition, hydrogels, three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that are able to swell large amounts of water, can be made to resemble the physical characteristics of soft tissues. Hydrogel materials also generally exhibit high permeability and good biocompatibility making, these materials attractive for use in cell encapsulation and tissue engineering applications. A number of hydrogel materials can be formed via photopolymerization processes mild enough to be carried out in the presence of living cells. This allows one to homogeneously seed cells throughout the scaffold material and to form hydrogels in situ. This review presents advantages of photopolymerization of hydrogels and describes the photoinitiators and materials in current use. Applications of photopolymerized hydrogels in tissue engineering that have been investigated are summarized. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

6,"Electronics that are capable of intimate, non-invasive integration with the soft, curvilinear surfaces of biological tissues offer important opportunities for diagnosing and treating disease and for improving brain/machine interfaces. This article describes a material strategy for a type of bio-interfaced system that relies on ultrathin electronics supported by bioresorbable substrates of silk fibroin. Mounting such devices on tissue and then allowing the silk to dissolve and resorb initiates a spontaneous, conformal wrapping process driven by capillary forces at the biotic/abiotic interface. Specialized mesh designs and ultrathin forms for the electronics ensure minimal stresses on the tissue and highly conformal coverage, even for complex curvilinear surfaces, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical studies. In vivo, neural mapping experiments on feline animal models illustrate one mode of use for this class of technology. These concepts provide new capabilities for implantable and surgical devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8,"The potential position of and drivers for inorganic polymers (""geopolymers"") as an element of the push for a sustainable concrete industry are discussed. These materials are alkali-activated aluminosilicates, with a much smaller CO2 footprint than traditional Portland cements, and display very good strength and chemical resistance properties as well as a variety of other potentially valuable characteristics. It is widely known that the widespread uptake of geopolymer technology is hindered by a number of factors, in particular issues to do with a lack of long-term (20+ years) durability data in this relatively young research field. There are also difficulties in compliance with some regulatory standards in Europe and North America, specifically those defining minimum clinker content levels or chemical compositions in cements. Work on resolving these issues is ongoing, with accelerated durability testing showing highly promising results with regard to salt scaling and freeze-thaw cycling. Geopolymer concrete compliance with performance-based standards is comparable to that of most other high-strength concretes. Issues to do with the distinction between geopolymers synthesised for cement replacement applications and those tailored for niche ceramic applications are also discussed. Particular attention is paid to the role of free alkali and silicate in poorly-formulated systems and its deleterious effects on concrete performance, which necessitates a more complete understanding of the chemistry of geopolymerisation for the technology to be successfully applied. The relationship between CO, footprint and composition in comparison with Portland-based cements is quantified. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Accurately predicting the lifetime of complex, nonlinear systems such as lithium-ion batteries is critical for accelerating technology development. However, diverse aging mechanisms, significant device variability and dynamic operating conditions have remained major challenges. We generate a comprehensive dataset consisting of 124 commercial lithium iron phosphate/graphite cells cycled under fast-charging conditions, with widely varying cycle lives ranging from 150 to 2,300 cycles. Using discharge voltage curves from early cycles yet to exhibit capacity degradation, we apply machine-learning tools to both predict and classify cells by cycle life. Our best models achieve 9.1% test error for quantitatively predicting cycle life using the first 100 cycles (exhibiting a median increase of 0.2% from initial capacity) and 4.9% test error using the first 5 cycles for classifying cycle life into two groups. This work highlights the promise of combining deliberate data generation with data-driven modelling to predict the behaviour of complex dynamical systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"An effective method to control the rate of perovskite crystallization by incorporating rationally chosen additives into the perovskite precursor solutions is demonstrated. The processing additives simultaneously facilitate nucleation and modulate the kinetics of crystal growth during crystallization, leading to much smoother perovskite morphology with improved coverage area and crystal uniformity. As a result, it enables very high PCE (similar to 12%) planar-heterojunction solar cells to be fabricated through the low-temperature solution processes (under 150 degrees C). This study opens up a new direction for optimizing perovskite active layer properties to expand device performance ceilings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Colloidal-quantum-dot (CQD) optoelectronics offer a compelling combination of solution processing and spectral tunability through quantum size effects. So far, CQD solar cells have relied on the use of organic ligands to passivate the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticles. Although inorganic metal chalcogenide ligands have led to record electronic transport parameters in CQD films, no photovoltaic device has been reported based on such compounds. Here we establish an atomic ligand strategy that makes use of monovalent halide anions to enhance electronic transport and successfully passivate surface defects in PbS CQD films. Both time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and transient device characterization indicate that the scheme leads to a shallower trap state distribution than the best organic ligands. Solar cells fabricated following this strategy show up to 6% solar AM1.5G power-conversion efficiency. The CQD films are deposited at room temperature and under ambient atmosphere, rendering the process amenable to low-cost, roll-by-roll fabrication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"Targeted drug delivery vehicles with low immunogenicity and toxicity are needed for cancer therapy. Here we show that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, can deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice. To reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, mouse immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were used for exosome production. Tumor targeting was facilitated by engineering the imDCs to express a well-characterized exosomal membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused to alpha v integrin-specific iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC). Purified exosomes from imDCs were loaded with Dox via electroporation, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 20%. iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to am integrin-positive breast cancer cells in vitro as demonstrated by confocal imaging and flow cytometry. Intravenously injected targeted exosomes delivered Dox specifically to tumor tissues, leading to inhibition of tumor growth without overt toxicity. Our results suggest that exosomes modified by targeting ligands can be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications.

14,"Recently there is strong interest in lightweight, flexible, and wearable electronics to meet the technological demands of modern society. Integrated energy storage devices of this type are a key area that is still significantly underdeveloped, Here, we describe wearable power devices using everyday textiles as the platform. With an extremely simple ""dipping and drying"" process using single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) ink, we produced highly conductive textiles with conductivity of 125 S cm(-1) and sheet resistance less than 1 Omega/sq. Such conductive textiles show outstanding flexibility and stretchability and demonstrate strong adhesion between the SWNTs and the textiles of interest. Supercapacitors made from these conductive textiles show high areal capacitance, up to 0.48F/cm(2), and high specific energy. We demonstrate the loading of pseudocapacitor materials into these conductive textiles that leads to a 24-fold increase of the areal capacitance of the device. These highly conductive textiles can provide new design opportunities for wearable electronics and energy storage applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Chitin, extracted primarily from shellfish sources, is a unique biopolymer based on the N-acetyl-glucosamine monomer. More than 40 years have lapsed since this biopolymer had aroused the interest of the scientific community around the world for its potential biomedical applications. Chitin, together with its variants, especially its deacetylated counterpart chitosan, has been shown to be useful as a wound dressing material, drug delivery vehicle and increasingly a candidate for tissue engineering. The promise for this biomaterial is vast and will continue to increase as the chemistry to extend its capabilities and new biomedical applications are investigated. It is interesting to note that a majority of this work has come from Asia. Japan has been the undisputed leader, but other Asian nations, namely Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand have also. made notable contributions. More recently, China has joined the club to become an increasingly major research source for chitin and chitosan in Asia, This review surveys select works of key groups in Asia developing chitin and chitosan materials for implantable biomedical applications.

16,"This year, the battery industry celebrates the 25th anniversary of the introduction of the lithium ion rechargeable battery by Sony Corporation. The discovery of the system dates back to earlier work by Asahi Kasei in Japan, which used a combination of lower temperature carbons for the negative electrode to prevent solvent degradation and lithium cobalt dioxide modified somewhat from Goodenough's earlier work. The development by Sony was carried out within a few years by bringing together technology in film coating from their magnetic tape division and electrochemical technology from their battery division. The past 25 years has shown rapid growth in the sales and in the benefits of lithium ion in comparison to all the earlier rechargeable battery systems. Recent work on new materials shows that there is a good likelihood that the lithium ion battery will continue to improve in cost, energy, safety and power capability and will be a formidable competitor for some years to come.

17,"We evaluate the ability of the embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials and the tight-binding (TB) method to predict reliably energies and stability of nonequilibrium structures by taking Cu as a model material. Two EAM potentials are used here. One is constructed in this work by using more fitting parameters than usual and including ab initio energies in the fitting database. The other potential was constructed previously using a traditional scheme. Excellent agreement is observed between ab initio, TB, and EAM results for the energies and stability of several nonequilibrium structures of Cu, as well as for energies along deformation paths between different structures. We conclude that not only TB calculations but also EAM potentials can be suitable for simulations in which correct energies and stability of different atomic configurations are essential, at least for Cu. The bcc, simple cubic, and diamond structures of Cu were identified as elastically unstable, while some other structures (e.g., hcp and 9R) are metastable. As an application of this analysis, nonequilibrium structures of epitaxial Cu films on (001)-oriented fcc or bcc substrates are evaluated using a simple model and atomistic simulations with an EAM potential. In agreement with experimental data, the structure of the film can be either deformed fee or deformed hcp. The bcc structure cannot be stabilized by epitaxial constraints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"We compare the results of equilibrium and nonequilibrium methods to compute thermal conductivity. Using Sillinger-Weber silicon as a model system, we address issues related to nonlinear response, thermal equilibration, and statistical averaging. In addition, we present an analysis of finite-size effects and demonstrate how reliable results can be obtained when using nonequilibrium methods by extrapolation to an infinite system size. For the equilibrium Green-Kubo method, we show that results for the thermal conductivity are insensitive to the choice of the definition of local energy from the many-body part of the potential. Finally, we show that the results obtained by the equilibrium and nonequilibrium methods are consistent with each other and for the case of Si are in reasonable agreement with experimental results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"One of the most effective methods to achieve high-performance perovskite solar cells has been to include additives that serve as dopants, crystallization agents, or passivate defect sites. Cl-based additives are among the most prevalent in literature, yet their exact role is still uncertain. In this work, we systematically study the function of methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI(3))-based perovskite. Using density functional theory, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the interaction of MACl with a perovskite. We show that MACl successfully induces an intermediate to the pure FAPbI(3) alpha-phase without annealing. The formation energy is related to the amount of incorporated MACl. By tuning the incorporation of MACl, the perovskite film quality can be significantly improved, exhibiting a 6 x increase in grain size, a 3 x increase in phase crystallinity, and a 4.3 x increase in photoluminescence lifetime. The optimized solar cells achieved a certified efficiency of 23.48%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Fused deposition modeling, a rapid prototyping technology, was used to produce novel scaffolds with honeycomb-like pattern, fully interconnected channel network, and controllable porosity and channel size. A bioresorbable polymer poly(epsilon -caprolactone) (PCL) was developed as a filament modeling material to produce porous scaffolds. made of layers of directionally aligned microfilaments, using this computer-controlled extrusion and deposition process. The PCL scaffolds were produced with a range of channel size 160-700 mum, filament diameter 260-370 mum and porosity 48-77%, and regular geometrical honeycomb pores, depending on the processing parameters. The scaffolds of different porosity also exhibited a pattern of compressive stress-strain behavior characteristic of porous solids under such loading. The compressive stiffness ranged from 4 to 77 MPa, yield strength from 0.4 to 3.6MPa and yield strain from 4% to 28%. Analysis of the measured data shows a high correlation between the scaffold porosity and the compressive properties based on a power-law relationship. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

21,"Lithium (Li) metal has been considered as an important substitute for the graphite anode to further boost the energy density of Li-ion batteries. However, Li dendrite growth during Li plating/stripping causes safety concern and poor lifespan of Li metal batteries (LMB). Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additives are used to form a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The FEC-induced SEI layer is compact and stable, and thus beneficial to obtain a uniform morphology of Li deposits. This uniform and dendrite-free morphology renders a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency of 98% within 100 cycles in a Li | Cu half-cell. When the FEC-protected Li metal anode matches a high-loading LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NMC) cathode (12 mg cm(-2)), a high initial capacity of 154 mAh g(-1) (1.9 mAh cm(-2)) at 180.0 mA g(-1) is obtained. This LMB with conversion-type Li metal anode and intercalation-type NMC cathode affords an emerging energy storage system to probe the energy chemistry of Li metal protection and demonstrates the material engineering of batteries with very high energy density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"We employ scanning probe microscopy to reveal atomic structures and nanoscale morphology of graphene-based electronic devices (i.e., a graphene sheet supported by an insulating silicon dioxide substrate) for the first time. Atomic resolution scanning tunneling microscopy images reveal the presence of a strong spatially dependent perturbation, which breaks the hexagonal lattice symmetry of the graphitic lattice. Structural corrugations of the graphene sheet partially conform to the underlying silicon oxide substrate. These effects are obscured or modified on graphene devices processed with normal lithographic methods, as they are covered with a layer of photoresist residue. We enable our experiments by a novel cleaning process to produce atomically clean graphene sheets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"The present work shows that optimization of mechanical properties via heat treatment of parts produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is profoundly different compared to conventionally processed Ti6Al4V. In order to obtain optimal mechanical properties, specific treatments are necessary due to the specific microstructure resulting from the SLM process. SLM is an additive manufacturing technique through which components are built by selectively melting powder layers with a focused laser beam. The process is characterized by short laser-powder interaction times and localized high heat input, which leads to steep thermal gradients, rapid solidification and fast cooling. In this research, the effect of several heat treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V processed by SLM is studied. A comparison is made with the effect of these treatments on hot forged and subsequently mill annealed Ti6Al4V with an original equiaxed microstructure. For SLM produced parts, the original martensite alpha' phase is converted to a lamellar mixture of alpha and beta for heat treating temperatures below the beta-transus (995 degrees C), but features of the original microstructure are maintained. Treated above the beta-transus, extensive grain growth occurs and large beta grains are formed which transform to lamellar alpha + beta upon cooling. Post treating at 850 degrees C for 2 h, followed by furnace cooling increased the ductility of SLM parts to 12.84 +/- 1.36%, compared to 7.36 +/- 1.32% for as-built parts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

25,"Binary Mg-Ca alloys with various Ca contents were fabricated under different working conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and optical microscopy observations showed that Mg-xCa (x = 1-3 wt%) alloys were composed of two phases, alpha(Mg) and Mg2Ca. The results of tensile tests and in vitro corrosion tests indicated that the mechanical properties could be adjusted by controlling the Ca content and processing treatment. The yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation decreased with increasing Ca content. The UTS and elongation of as-cast Mg-1Ca alloy (71.38 +/- 3.01 MPa and 1.87 +/- 0.14%) were largely improved after hot rolling (166.7 +/- 3.01 MPa and 3 +/- 0.78%) and hot extrusion (239.63 +/- 7.21 MPa and 10.63 +/- 0.64%). The in vitro corrosion test in simulated body fluid (SBF) indicated that the microstructure and working history of Mg-xCa alloys strongly affected their corrosion behaviors. An increasing content of Mg2Ca phase led to a higher corrosion rate whereas hot rolling and hot extrusion could reduce it. The cytotoxicity evaluation using L-929 cells revealed that Mg-1Ca alloy did not induce toxicity to cells, and the viability of cells for Mg-1Ca alloy extraction medium was better than that of control. Moreover, Mg-1Ca alloy pins, with commercial pure Ti pins as control, were implanted into the left and right rabbit femoral shafts, respectively, and observed for 1, 2 and 3 months. High activity of ostroblast and osteocytes were observed around the Mg-1Ca alloy pins as shown by hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections. Radiographic examination revealed that the Mg-1Ca alloy pins gradually degraded in vivo within 90 days and the newly formed bone was clearly seen at month 3. Both the in vitro and in vivo corrosion suggested that a mixture of Mg(OH)(2) and hydroxyapatite formed on the surface of Mg-1Ca alloy with the extension of immersion/implantation time. In addition, no significant difference (p > 0.05) of serum magnesium was detected at different degradation stages. All these results revealed that Mg-1Ca alloy had the acceptable biocompatibility as a new kind of biodegradable implant material. Based on the above results, a solid alloy/liquid solution interface model was also proposed to interpret the biocorrosion process and the associated hydroxyapatite mineralization.

26,"The formation of semiconductor composites comprising multicomponent or multiphase heterojunctions is a very effective strategy to design highly active photocatalyst systems. This review summarizes the recent strategies to develop such composites, and highlights the most recent developments in the field. After a general introduction into the different strategies to improve photocatalytic activity through formation of heterojunctions, the three different types of heterojunctions are introduced in detail, followed by a historical introduction to semiconductor heterojunction systems and a thorough literature overview. Special chapters describe the highly-investigated carbon nitride heterojunctions as well as very recent developments in terms of multiphase heterojunction formation, including the latest insights into the anatase-rutile system.

27,"A method of fabricating ultrathin (approximate to 22-53 nm thick) graphene nanofiltration membranes (uGNMs) on microporous substrates is presented for efficient water purification using chemically converted graphene (CCG). The prepared uGNMs show well packed layer structure formed by CCG sheets, as characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The performance of the uGNMs for water treatment was evaluated on a dead end filtration device and the pure water flux of uGNMs was high (21.8 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)). The uGNMs show high retention (>99%) for organic dyes and moderate retention (approximate to 20-60%) for ion salts. The rejection mechanism of this kind of negatively charged membranes is intensively studied, and the results reveal that physical sieving and electrostatic interaction dominate the rejection process. Because of the ultrathin nature of uGNMs, 34 mg of CCG is sufficient for making a square meter of nanofiltration membrane, indicating that this new generation graphene-based nanofiltration technology would be resource saving and cost-effective. The integration of high performance, low cost, and simple solution-based fabrication process promises uGNMs great potential application in practical water purification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"We report on the use and effect of the alkali elements rubidium and caesium in the place of sodium and potassium in the alkali post deposition treatment (PDT) as applied to Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 (CIGS) solar cell absorbers.

We examine the electrical device parameters of these fully functional devices and observe a positive trend in the I-V parameters when moving from devices without PDT to KF-, RbF-, and eventually to CsF-PDT.

29,"Characterizing the state of nanoparticles (such as size, surface charge, and degree of agglomeration) in aqueous suspensions and understanding the parameters that affect this state are imperative for toxicity investigations. In this study, the role of important factors such as solution ionic strength, pH, and particle surface chemistry that control nanoparticle dispersion was examined. The size and zeta potential of four TiO2 and three quantum dot samples dispersed in different solutions (including one physiological medium) were characterized. For 15 nm TiO2 dispersions, the increase of ionic strength from 0.001 M to 0.1 M led to a 50-fold increase in the hydrodynamic diameter, and the variation of pH resulted in significant change of particle surface charge and the hydrodynamic size. It was shown that both adsorbing multiply charged ions (e.g., pyrophosphate ions) onto the TiO2 nanoparticle surface and coating quantum dot nanocrystals with polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol) suppressed agglomeration and stabilized the dispersions. DLVO theory was used to qualitatively understand nanoparticle dispersion stability. A methodology using different ultrasonication techniques (bath and probe) was developed to distinguish agglomerates from aggregates (strong bonds), and to estimate the extent of particle agglomeration. Probe ultrasonication performed better than bath ultrasonication in dispersing TiO2 agglomerates when the stabilizing agent sodium pyrophosphate was used. Commercially available Degussa P25 and in-house synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles were used to demonstrate identification of aggregated and agglomerated samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"Organolead trihalide perovskite (OTP) materials are emerging as naturally abundant materials for low-cost, solution-processed and highly effcient solar cells(1-9). Here, we show that, in OTP-based photovoltaic devices with vertical and lateral cell configurations, the photocurrent direction can be switched repeatedly by applying a small electric field of < 1V mu m(-1). The switchable photocurrent, generally observed in devices based on ferroelectric materials, reached 20.1 mAcm(-2) under one sun illumination in OTP devices with a vertical architecture, which is four orders of magnitude larger than lthat measured in other ferroelectric photovoltaic devices(10,11). This field-switchable photovoltaic effect can be explained by the formation of reversible p-i-n structures induced by ion drift in the perovskite layer. The demonstration of switchable OTP photovoltaics and electric-field-manipulated doping paves the way for innovative solar cell designs and for the exploitation of OTP materials in electrically and optically readable memristors and circuits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), unlike its bulk form, is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.8 eV. Recently, field-effect transistors have been demonstrated experimentally using a mechanically exfoliated MoS2 monolayer, showing promising potential for next generation electronics. Here we project the ultimate performance limit of MoS2 transistors by using nonequilibrium Green's function based quantum transport simulations. Our simulation results show that the strength of MoS2 transistors lies in large ON-OFF current ratio (>10(10)), immunity to short channel effects (drain-induced barrier lowering similar to 10 mV/V), and abrupt switching (subthreshold swing as low as 60 mV/decade). Our comparison of monolayer MoS2 transistors to the state-of-the-art III-V materials based transistors, reveals that while MoS2 transistors may not be ideal for high-performance applications due to heavier electron effective mass (m* = 0.45m(0)) and a lower mobility, they can be an attractive alternative for low power applications thanks to the large band gap and the excellent electrostatic integrity inherent in a two-dimensional system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A polydopamine surface coating provides chemical activation on material surfaces, is resistant to hydrolysis, and offers selectivity in coupling of biomolecules via nucleophilic groups through simple pH control. Control of orientation of immobilized biomolecules may be possible using terminally modified DNA or His-containing proteins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"A material strength depends on its microstructure, which in turn, is controlled by an engineering process. Strengthening mechanisms like work hardening, precipitate, and grain boundary strengthening can alter the strength of a material in a predictive, quantitative manner and are readily linked to the deformation mechanism. This quantification strongly depends on the characteristic length scale of a particular microstructure, thereby dictating bulk material's strength as a function of, for example, grain or precipitate size, twin boundary spacing, or dislocation density. This microstructural, or intrinsic, size governs the mechanical properties and post-elastic material deformation at all sample dimensions, as the classical definition of ""ultimate tensile strength"" deems it to be ""an intensive property, therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen."" Yet in the last 5 years, the vast majority of uniaxial deformation experiments and computations on small-scale metallic structures unambiguously demonstrated that at the micron and sub-micron scales, this definition no longer holds true. In fact, it has been shown that in single crystals the ultimate tensile strength and the yield strength scale with external sample size in a power law fashion, sometimes attaining a significant fraction of material's theoretical strength, and exhibiting the now-commonly-known phenomenon ""smaller is stronger."" Understanding of this ""extrinsic size effect"" at small scales is not yet mature and is currently a topic of rigorous investigations. As both the intrinsic (i.e. microstructural) and extrinsic (i.e. sample size) dimensions play a non-trivial role in the mechanical properties and material deformation mechanisms, it is critical to develop an understanding of their interplay and mutual effects on the mechanical properties and material deformation, especially in small-scale structures. This review focuses on providing an overview of metal-based material classes whose properties as a function of external size have been investigated and provides a critical discussion on the combined effects of intrinsic and extrinsic sizes on the material deformation behavior.

35,"We suggest that if a localized phase at nonzero temperature T > 0 exists for strongly disordered and weakly interacting electrons, as recently argued, it will also occur when both disorder and interactions are strong and T is very high. We show that in this high-T regime, the localization transition may be studied numerically through exact diagonalization of small systems. We obtain spectra for one-dimensional lattice models of interacting spinless fermions in a random potential. As expected, the spectral statistics of finite-size samples cross over from those of orthogonal random matrices in the diffusive regime at weak random potential to Poisson statistics in the localized regime at strong randomness. However, these data show deviations from simple one-parameter finite-size scaling: the apparent mobility edge '' drifts '' as the system's size is increased. Based on spectral statistics alone, we have thus been unable to make a strong numerical case for the presence of a many-body localized phase at nonzero T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"We report here preliminary studies of blocidal effects and cellular internalization of ZnO nanoparticles on Escherichia coli bacteria. ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized in di(ethylene glycol) (DEG) medium by forced hydrolysis of ionic Zn2+ salts. particle size and shape were controlled by addition of small molecules and macromolecules such as tri-n-octylphosphine oxide, sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyoxyethylene stearyl ether, and bovine serum albumin. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction analyses were used to characterize particle structure, size, and morphology. Bactericidal tests were performed in Luria-Bertani medium on solid agar plates and in liquid systems with different concentrations of small and macromolecules and also with ZnO nanoparticles. TEM analyses of bacteria thin sections were used to study biocidal action of ZnO materials. The results confirmed that E. coli cells after contact with DEG and ZnO were damaged showing a Gram-negative triple membrane disorganization. This behavior causes the increase of membrane permeability leading to accumulation of ZnO nanoparticles in the bacterial membrane and also cellular internalization of these nanoparticles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"Cold gas spraying is a relatively new coating process by which coatings can be produced without significant heating of the sprayed powder. In contrast to the well-known thermal spray processes such as flame, arc, and plasma spraying, in cold spraying there is no melting of particles prior to impact on the substrate. The adhesion of particles in this process is due solely to their kinetic energy upon impact. Experimental investigations show that successful bonding is achieved only above a critical particle velocity, whose value depends on the temperature and the thermomechanical properties of the sprayed material. This paper supplies a hypothesis for the bonding of particles in cold gas spraying, by making use of numerical modelling of the deformation during particle impact. The results of modelling are assessed with respect to the experimentally evaluated critical velocities, impact morphologies and strengths of coatings. The analysis demonstrates that bonding can be attributed to adiabatic shear instabilities which occur at the particle surface at or beyond the critical velocity. On the basis of this criterion, critical velocities can be predicted and used to optimise process parameters for various materials. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

38,"The transition metal oxides ZrO2 and HfO2 as well as their solid solution are widely researched and, like most binary oxides, are expected to exhibit centrosymmetric crystal structure and therewith linear dielectric characteristics. For this reason, those oxides, even though successfully introduced into microelectronics, were never considered to be more than simple dielectrics possessing limited functionality. Here we report the discovery of a field-driven ferroelectric phase transition in pure, sub 10 nm ZrO2 thin films and a composition- and temperature-dependent transition to a stable ferroelectric phase in the HfO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide. These unusual findings are attributed to a size-driven tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition that in thin films, similar to the anticipated tetragonal to monoclinic transition, is lowered to room temperature. A structural investigation revealed the orthorhombic phase to be of space group Pbc2(1), whose noncentrosymmetric nature is deemed responsible for the spontaneous polarization in this novel, nanoscale ferroelectrics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"In this work, poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels with different degree of hydrolysis (DH) were prepared by chemical crosslinking with glutaraldehyde (GA). The nanostructure of the resulting hydrogels was investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering characterization (SAXS). In vitro tests were performed by swelling ratio assays in different pH solutions. The infrared spectra of the crosslinked PVA showed absorption bands of the acetal bridges resulted from the reaction of the GA with the OH groups from PVA. Also the FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine the crystallinity of the PVA film based on the relative intensity of the vibration band at 1141 cm(-1). The results have showed an increase of hydrogel crystallinity with higher DH of PVA. SAXS patterns have clearly indicated important modifications on the PVA semicrystalline structure when it was crosslinked by GA. The swelling ratio was significantly reduced by chemically crosslinking the PVA network. PVA-derived hydrogel with chemically modified network was found to be pH-sensitive, indicating a high potential to be used in drug delivery polymer system. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

40,"Heterogeneous catalysis is of paramount importance in chemistry and energy applications. Catalysts that couple light energy into chemical reactions in a directed, orbital-specific manner would greatly reduce the energy input requirements of chemical transformations, revolutionizing catalysis-driven chemistry. Here we report the room temperature dissociation of H-2 on gold nanoparticles using visible light. Surface plasmons excited in the Au nanoparticle decay into hot electrons with energies between the vacuum level and the work function of the metal. In this transient state, hot electrons can transfer into a Feshbach resonance of an H-2 molecule adsorbed on the Au nanoparticle surface, triggering dissociation. We probe this process by detecting the formation of HD molecules from the dissociations of H-2 and D-2 and investigate the effect of Au nanoparticle size and wavelength of incident light on the rate of HD formation. This work opens a new pathway for controlling chemical reactions on metallic catalysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"We present a study of ""nodal-semimetal"" phases in which nondegenerate conduction and valence bands touch at points (the ""Weyl semimetal"") or lines (the ""line-node semimetal"") in three-dimensional momentum space. We discuss a general approach to such states by perturbation of the critical point between a normal insulator (NI) and a topological insulator (TI), breaking either time-reversal (TR) or inversion symmetry. We give an explicit model realization of both types of states in a NI-TI superlattice structure with broken TR symmetry. Both the Weyl and the line-node semimetals are characterized by topologically protected surface states, although in the line-node case, some additional symmetries must be imposed to retain this topological protection. The edge states have the form of ""Fermi arcs"" in the case of the Weyl semimetal: these are chiral gapless edge states, which exist in a finite region in momentum space, determined by the momentum-space separation of the bulk Weyl nodes. The chiral character of the edge states leads to a finite Hall conductivity. In contrast, the edge states of the line-node semimetal are ""flat bands"": these states are approximately dispersionless in a subset of the two-dimensional edge Brillouin zone, given by the projection of the line node onto the plane of the edge. We discuss unusual transport properties of the nodal semimetals and, in particular, point out quantum critical-like scaling of the dc and optical conductivities of the Weyl semimetal and similarities to the conductivity of graphene in the line-node case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"Overall water splitting to form hydrogen and oxygen over a heterogeneous photocatalyst using solar energy is a promising process for clean and recyclable hydrogen production in large-scale. In recent years, numerous attempts have been made for the development of photocatalysts that work under visible-light irradiation to efficiently utilize solar energy.

43,"Recent advances in colloidal synthesis enabled the precise control of the size, shape and composition of catalytic metal nanoparticles, enabling their use as model catalysts for systematic investigations of the atomic-scale properties affecting catalytic activity and selectivity. The organic capping agents stabilizing colloidal nanoparticles, however, often limit their application in high-temperature catalytic reactions. Here, we report the design of a high-temperature-stable model catalytic system that consists of a Pt metal core coated with a mesoporous silica shell (Pt@mSiO(2)). Inorganic silica shells encaged the Pt cores up to 750 degrees C in air and the mesopores providing direct access to the Pt core made the Pt@mSiO(2) nanoparticles as catalytically active as bare Pt metal for ethylene hydrogenation and CO oxidation. The high thermal stability of Pt@mSiO(2) nanoparticles enabled high-temperature CO oxidation studies, including ignition behaviour, which was not possible for bare Pt nanoparticles because of their deformation or aggregation. The results suggest that the Pt@mSiO(2) nanoparticles are excellent nanocatalytic systems for high-temperature catalytic reactions or surface chemical processes, and the design concept used in the Pt@mSiO(2) core-shell catalyst can be extended to other metal/metal oxide compositions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a solid-vapor phase thermal sublimation technique, nanocombs, nanorings, nanohelixes/nanosprings, nanobows, nanobelts, nanowires, and nanocages of ZnO have been synthesized under specific growth conditions. These unique nanostructures unambiguously demonstrate that ZnO is probably the richest family of nanostructures among all materials, both in structures and properties. The nanostructures could have novel applications in optoelectronics, sensors, transducers, and biomedical science because it is bio-safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"The optoelectronic and physicochemical properties of nanoscale matter are a strong function of particle size. Nanoparticle shape also contributes significantly to modulating their electronic properties. Several shapes ranging from rods to wires to plates to teardrop structures may be obtained by chemical methods; triangular nanoparticles have been synthesized by using a seeded growth process. Here, we report the discovery that the extract from the lemongrass plant, when reacted with aqueous chloroaurate ions, yields a high percentage of thin, flat, single-crystalline gold nanotriangles. The nanotriangles seem to grow by a process involving rapid reduction, assembly and room-temperature sintering of 'liquid-like' spherical gold nanoparticles. The anisotropy in nanoparticle shape results in large near-infrared absorption by the particles, and highly anisotropic electron transport in films of the nanotriangles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,Visible radiation at resonant frequencies is transduced to thermal energy by surface plasmons on gold nanoparticles. Temperature in <= 10-mu L aqueous suspensions of 20-nm gold particles irradiated by a continuous wave Ar+ ion laser at 514 nm increased to a maximum equilibrium value. This value increased in proportion to incident laser power and in proportion to nanoparticle content at low concentration. Heat input to the system by nanoparticle transduction of resonant irradiation equaled heat flux outward by conduction and radiation at thermal equilibrium. The efficiency of transducing incident resonant light to heat by microvolume suspensions of gold nanoparticles was determined by applying an energy balance to obtain a microscale heat-transfer time constant from the transient temperature profile. Measured values of transduction efficiency were increased from 3.4% to 9.9% by modulating the incident continuous wave irradiation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"Reduced dimensionality and interlayer coupling in van der Waals materials gives rise to fundamentally different electronic(1), optical(2) and many-body quantum(3-5) properties in monolayers compared with the bulk. This layer-dependence permits the discovery of novel material properties in the monolayer regime. Ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional materials is a coveted property that would allow fundamental studies of spin behaviour in low dimensions and enable new spintronics applications(6-9). Recent studies have shown that for the bulk-ferromagnetic layered materials Crl(3), (ref. (9) ) and Cr2Ge2Te6 (ref. (10)), ferromagnetic order is maintained down to the ultrathin limit at low temperatures. Contrary to these observations, we report the emergence of strong ferromagnetic ordering for monolayer VSe2, a material that is paramagnetic in the bulk(11,12). Importantly, the ferromagnetic ordering with a large magnetic moment persists to above room temperature, making VSe2 an attractive material for van der Waals spintronics applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"Electrospinning has been applied to prepare uniaxially aligned nanofibers made of organic polymers, ceramics, and polymer/ceramic composites. The key to the success of this method was the use of a collector consisting of two pieces of electrically conductive substrates separated by a gap whose width could be varied from hundreds of micrometers to several centimeters. As driven by electrostatic interactions, the charged nanofibers were stretched to span across the gap and thus to become uniaxially aligned arrays over large areas. Because the nanofibers were suspended over the gap, they could be conveniently transferred onto the surfaces of other substrates for subsequent treatments and various applications. Materials that have been successfully incorporated into this procedure include conventional organic polymers, graphite carbon, and metal oxides. By controlling the parameters for electrospinning, we have also fabricated a number of simple device structures, for example, an individual nanofiber spanning across two electrodes, 2D arrays of crossbar junctions, and optical polarizers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"Fluorescent imaging of biological systems in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) can probe tissue at centimetre depths and achieve micrometre-scale resolution at depths of millimetres. Unfortunately, all current NIR-II fluorophores are excreted slowly and are largely retained within the reticuloendothelial system, making clinical translation nearly impossible. Here, we report a rapidly excreted NIR-II fluorophore (similar to 90% excreted through the kidneys within 24 h) based on a synthetic 970-Da organic molecule (CH1055). The fluorophore outperformed indocyanine green (ICG)-a clinically approved NIR-I dye-in resolving mouse lymphatic vasculature and sentinel lymphatic mapping near a tumour. High levels of uptake of PEGylated-CH1055 dye were observed in brain tumours in mice, suggesting that the dye was detected at a depth of similar to 4 mm. The CH1055 dye also allowed targeted molecular imaging of tumours in vivo when conjugated with anti-EGFR Affibody. Moreover, a superior tumour-to-background signal ratio allowed precise image-guided tumour-removal surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,"The synthesis, crystal growth, and structural and optoelectronic characterization has been carried out for the perovsldte compound CsPbBr3. This compound is a direct band gap semiconductor which meets most of the requirements for successful detection of X- and gamma-ray radiation, such as high attenuation, high resistivity, and significant photoconductivity response, with detector resolution comparable to that of commercial, state-of-the-art materials. A structural phase transition which occurs during crystal growth at higher temperature does not seem to affect its crystal quality. Its mu tau product for both hole and electron carriers is approximately equal. The mu tau product for electrons is comparable to cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) and that for holes is 10 times higher than CZT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"In the preceding paper, Paper I [Phys. Rev. B 62, 10 958 (2000)], we studied the formation and diffusion of excitons in several phosphorescent guest-host molecular organic systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the observed decrease in electrophosphorescent intensity in organic light-emitting devices at high current densities [M. A. Baldo et al., Nature 395, 151 (1998)] is principally due to triplet-triplet annihilation. Using parameters extracted from transient phosphorescent decays, we model the quantum efficiency versus current characteristics of electrophosphorescent devices. It is found that the increase in luminance observed for phosphors with short excited-state lifetimes is due primarily to reduced triplet-triplet annihilation. We also derive an expression for a limiting current density (J(0)) above which triplet-triplet annihilation dominates. The expression for J(0) allows us to establish the criteria for identifying useful phosphors and to assist in the optimized design of electrophosphorescent molecules and device structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"Development of advanced energy-storage systems for portable devices, electric vehicles, and grid storage must fulfill several requirements: low-cost, long life, acceptable safety, high energy, high power, and environmental benignity. With these requirements, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries promise great potential to be the next-generation high-energy system. However, the practicality of Li-S technology is hindered by technical obstacles, such as short shelf and cycle life and low sulfur content/loading, arising from the shuttling of polysulfide intermediates between the cathode and anode and the poor electronic conductivity of S and the discharge product Li2S. Much progress has been made during the past five years to circumvent these problems by employing sulfur-carbon or sulfur-polymer composite cathodes, novel cell configurations, and lithium-metal anode stabilization. This Progress Report highlights recent developments with special attention toward innovation in sulfur-encapsulation techniques, development of novel materials, and cell-component design. The scientific understanding and engineering concerns are discussed at the end in every developmental stage. The critical research directions needed and the remaining challenges to be addressed are summarized in the Conclusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,"The development of reliable, eco-friendly processes for the synthesis of nanomaterials is an important aspect of nanotechnology today. One approach that shows immense potential is based on the biosynthesis of nanoparticles using biological micro-organisms such as bacteria. In this laboratory, we have concentrated on the use of fungi in the intracellular production of metal nanoparticles. As part of our investigation, we have observed that aqueous silver ions when exposed to the fungus Fusarium oxysporum are reduced in solution, thereby leading to the formation of an extremely stable silver hydrosol. The silver nanoparticles are in the range of 5-15 nm in dimensions and are stabilized in solution by proteins secreted by the fungus. It is believed that the reduction of the metal ions occurs by an enzymatic process, thus creating the possibility of developing a rational, fungal-based method for the synthesis of nanomaterials over a range of chemical compositions, which is currently not possible by other microbe-based methods.

54,"Owing to its high carrier mobility, conductivity, flexibility and optical transparency, graphene is a versatile material in micro- and macroelectronics. However, the low density of electrochemically active defects in graphene synthesized by chemical vapour deposition limits its application in biosensing. Here, we show that graphene doped with gold and combined with a gold mesh has improved electrochemical activity over bare graphene, sufficient to form a wearable patch for sweat-based diabetes monitoring and feedback therapy. The stretchable device features a serpentine bilayer of gold mesh and gold-doped graphene that forms an efficient electrochemical interface for the stable transfer of electrical signals. The patch consists of a heater, temperature, humidity, glucose and pH sensors and polymeric microneedles that can be thermally activated to deliver drugs transcutaneously. We show that the patch can be thermally actuated to deliver Metformin and reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic mice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,"A single-molecule method for sequencing DNA that does not require fluorescent labelling could reduce costs and increase sequencing speeds. An exonuclease enzyme might be used to cleave individual nucleotide molecules from the DNA, and when coupled to an appropriate detection system, these nucleotides could be identified in the correct order. Here, we show that a protein nanopore with a covalently attached adapter molecule can continuously identify unlabelled nucleoside W-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8%. Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice. This highly accurate tool is suitable for integration into a system for sequencing nucleic acids and for analysing epigenetic modifications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,"High resolution XPS analysis of chemical functionalised multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) was done with ESCA300 (overall instrument resolution of 0.35eV). Information to the degree of functionalisation was ascertained by argon ion bombardment of the samples followed by XPS analysis to detect the functional groups, the percentage atomic concentration of various elements present and whether or not the detected functional groups imposed a chemical shift on the CNT atoms. The results show that true chemical functionalisation was achieved and by argon ion bombardment these functional groups can be altered relative to the C Is carbon atoms of the CNT. The choice of chemicals used for functionalisation, the techniques employed and the types of nanotubes treated are important factors in chemical characterisation. The carbon atom on the nanotube ring to which the functional group (atom) is bonded, the chirality of the CNT, the electronegativity of the functional group, the bond type and whether the CNT is single-wall or multi-wall, or cut (short) could play a role in determining the chemical shift on the CNTs atoms. These investigations are relevant to chemical functionalisation of carbon nanotubes for various applications for example DNA sensors and other biomedical sensors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

57,"Nanoscale materials are currently being exploited as active components in a wide range of technological applications in various fields, such as composite materials(1,2), chemical sensing(3), biomedicine(4-6), optoelectronics(7-9) and nanoelectronics(10-12). Colloidal nanocrystals are promising candidates in these fields, due to their ease of fabrication and processibility. Even more applications and new functional materials might emerge if nanocrystals could be synthesized in shapes of higher complexity than the ones produced by current methods (spheres, rods, discs)(13-19). Here, we demonstrate that polytypism, or the existence of two or more crystal structures in different domains of the same crystal, coupled with the manipulation of surface energy at the nanoscale, can be exploited to produce branched inorganic nanostructures controllably. For the case of CdTe, we designed a high yield, reproducible synthesis of soluble, tetrapod-shaped nanocrystals through which we can independently control the width and length of the four arms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,"Silicon is a promising candidate for the anode material in lithium-ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity. However, volume changes during cycling cause pulverization and capacity fade, and improving cycle life is a major research challenge.

We achieved the high initial discharge capacity of 2725 mAh g(-1) with less than 8% capacity degradation every hundred cycles for 700 total cycles. Si hollow sphere electrodes also show a Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% in later cycles.

59,"Equilibrium concentrations of dissolved platinum species from a Pt/C electrocatalyst sample in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 80 degrees C were found to increase with applied potential from 0.9 to 1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. In addition, platinum surface area loss for a short-stack of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) operated at open-circuit voltage (similar to 0.95 V) was shown to be higher than another operated under load (similar to 0.75 V). Both findings suggest that the formation of soluble platinum species (such as Pt2+) plays an important role in platinum surface loss in PEMFC electrodes. As accelerated platinum surface area loss in the cathode (from 63 to 23 m(2)/g(Pt) in similar to 100 h) was observed upon potential cycling, a cycled membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cathode was examined in detail by incidence angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to reveal processes responsible for observed platinum loss. In this study, TEM data and analyses of Pt/C catalyst and cross-sectional MEA cathode samples unambiguously confirmed that coarsening of platinum particles occurred via two different processes: (i) Ostwald ripening on carbon at the nanometer scale, which is responsible for platinum particle coarsening from similar to 3 to similar to 6 nm on carbon, and (ii) migration of soluble platinum species in the ionomer phase at the micrometer scale, chemical reduction of these species by crossover H-2 molecules, and precipitation of platinum particles in the cathode ionomer phase, which reduces the weight of platinum on carbon. It was estimated that each process contributed to similar to 50% of the overall platinum area loss of the potential cycled electrode.

60,"Layered lithium nickel-rich oxides, Li[Ni1-xMx]O-2 (M = metal), have attracted significant interest as the cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries owing to their high capacity, excellent rate capability and low cost(1-7). However, their low thermal-abuse tolerance and poor cycle life, especially at elevated temperature, prohibit their use in practical batteries(4-6). Here, we report on a concentration-gradient cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries based on a layered lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide. In this material, each particle has a central bulk that is rich in Ni and a Mn-rich outer layer with decreasing Ni concentration and increasing Mn and Co concentrations as the surface is approached. The former provides high capacity, whereas the latter improves the thermal stability. A half cell using our concentration-gradient cathode material achieved a high capacity of 209m Ah g 1 and retained 96% of this capacity after 50 charge-discharge cycles under an aggressive test profile (55 degrees C between 3.0 and 4.4V). Our concentration-gradient material also showed superior performance in thermal-abuse tests compared with the bulk composition Li[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O-2 used as reference. These results suggest that our cathode material could enable production of batteries that meet the demanding performance and safety requirements of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,"The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a crucial step in electro-chemical water splitting and demands an efficient, durable and cheap catalyst if it is to succeed in real applications(1-3). For an energy-efficient HER, a catalyst must be able to trigger proton reduction with minimal overpotential(4) and have fast kinetics(5-9). The most efficient catalysts in acidic media are platinum-based, as the strength of the Pt-H bond(10) is associated with the fastest reaction rate for the HER11,12. The use of platinum, however, raises issues linked to cost and stability in non-acidic media. Recently, non-precious-metal-based catalysts have been reported, but these are susceptible to acid corrosion and are typically much inferior to Pt-based catalysts, exhibiting higher overpotentials and lower stability(13-15). As a cheaper alternative to platinum, ruthenium possesses a similar bond strength with hydrogen (similar to 65 kcal mol(-1))(16), but has never been studied as a viable alternative for a HER catalyst. Here, we report a Ru-based catalyst for the HER that can operate both in acidic and alkaline media. Our catalyst is made of Ru nanoparticles dispersed within a nitrogenated holey two-dimensional carbon structure (Ru@C2N). The Ru@C2N electrocatalyst exhibits high turnover frequencies at 25 mV (0.67 H-2 s(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution; 0.75 H-2 s(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution) and small overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) (13.5 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution; 17.0 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution) as well as superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media. These performances are comparable to, or even better than, the Pt/C catalyst for the HER.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,"To document the marketing and distribution of nano-enabled products into the commercial marketplace, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies created the Nanotechnology Consumer Products Inventory (CPI) in 2005. The objective of this present work is to redevelop the CPI by leading a research effort to increase the usefulness and reliability of this inventory. We created eight new descriptors for consumer products, including information pertaining to the nanomaterials contained in each product. The project was motivated by the recognition that a diverse group of stakeholders from academia, industry, and state/ federal government had become highly dependent on the inventory as an important resource and bellweather of the pervasiveness of nanotechnology in society. We interviewed 68 nanotechnology experts to assess key information needs. Their answers guided inventory modifications by providing a clear conceptual framework best suited for user expectations. The revised inventory was released in October 2013. It currently lists 1814 consumer products from 622 companies in 32 countries. The Health and Fitness category contains the most products (762, or 42% of the total). Silver is the most frequently used nanomaterial (435 products, or 24%); however, 49% of the products (889) included in the CPI do not provide the composition of the nanomaterial used in them. About 29% of the CPI (528 products) contain nanomaterials suspended in a variety of liquid media and dermal contact is the most likely exposure scenario from their use. The majority (1288 products, or 71%) of the products do not present enough supporting information to corroborate the claim that nanomaterials are used. The modified CPI has enabled crowdsourcing capabilities, which allow users to suggest edits to any entry and permits researchers to upload new findings ranging from human and environmental exposure data to complete life cycle assessments. There are inherent limitations to this type of database, but these modifications to the inventory addressed the majority of criticisms raised in published literature and in surveys of nanotechnology stakeholders and experts. The development of standardized methods and metrics for nanomaterial characterization and labelling in consumer products can lead to greater understanding between the key stakeholders in nanotechnology, especially consumers, researchers, regulators, and industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

64,"Classical metal plasticity theory assumes that the hydrostatic pressure has no or negligible effect on the material strain hardening, and that the flow stress is independent of the third deviatoric stress invariant (or Lode angle parameter). However, recent experiments on metals have shown that both the pressure effect and the effect of the third deviatoric stress invariant should be included in the constitutive description of the material. A general form of asymmetric metal plasticity, considering both the pressure sensitivity and the Lode dependence, is postulated. The calibration method for the new metal plasticity is discussed. Experimental results on aluminum 2024-T351 are shown to validate the new material model. From the similarity between yielding surface and fracture locus, a new 3D asymmetric fracture locus, in the space of equivalent fracture strain, stress triaxiality and the Lode angle parameter, is postulated. Two methods of calibration of the fracture locus are discussed. One is based oil classical round specimens and flat specimens in uniaxial tests, and the other one uses the newly designed butterfly specimen under biaxial testing.

67,"Magnetic skyrmions(1,2) are topologically protected spin textures that exhibit fascinating physical behaviours(1-6) and large potential in highly energy-efficient spintronic device applications(7-13). The main obstacles so far are that skyrmions have been observed in only a few exotic materials and at low temperatures(1-4,6-8), and fast current-driven motion of individual skyrmions has not yet been achieved. Here, we report the observation of stable magnetic skyrmions at room temperature in ultrathin transition metal ferromagnets with magnetic transmission soft X-ray microscopy. We demonstrate the ability to generate stable skyrmion lattices and drive trains of individual skyrmions by short current pulses along a magnetic racetrack at speeds exceeding 100m s(-1) as required for applications. Our findings provide experimental evidence of recent predictions(10-13) and open the door to room-temperature skyrmion spintronics in robust thin-film heterostructures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"Unencapsulated, exfoliated black phosphorus (BP) flakes are found to chemically degrade upon exposure to ambient conditions. Atomic force microscopy, electrostatic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to characterize the structure and chemistry of the degradation process, suggesting that O-2 saturated H2O irreversibly reacts with BP to form oxidized phosphorus species. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that BP degradation occurs more rapidly on hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayers and on H-Si(111) versus hydrophilic SiO2. For unencapsulated BP field-effect transistors, the ambient degradation causes large increases in threshold voltage after 6 h in ambient, followed by a similar to 10(3) decrease in FET current on/off ratio and mobility after 48 h. Atomic layer deposited AlOx overlayers effectively suppress ambient degradation, allowing encapsulated BP FETs to maintain high on/off ratios of similar to 103 and mobilities of similar to 100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for over 2 weeks in ambient conditions. This work shows that the ambient degradation of BP can be managed effectively when the flakes are sufficiently passivated. In turn, our strategy for enhancing BP environmental stability will accelerate efforts to implement BP in electronic and optoelectronic applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"Vehicle-to-grid power (V2G) uses electric-drive vehicles (battery, fuel cell, or hybrid) to provide power for specific electric markets. This article examines the systems and processes needed to tap energy in vehicles and implement V2G. It quantitatively compares today's light vehicle fleet with the electric power system. The vehicle fleet has 20 times the power capacity, less than one-tenth the utilization, and one-tenth the capital cost per prime mover M Conversely, utility generators have 10-50 times longer operating life and lower operating costs per kWh. To tap V2G is to synergistically use these complementary strengths and to reconcile the complementary needs of the driver and grid manager. This article suggests strategies and, business models for doing so, and the steps necessary for the implementation of V2G. After the initial high-value, V2G markets saturate and production costs drop, V2G can provide storage for renewable energy generation. Our calculations suggest that V2G could stabilize large-scale (one-half of US electricity) wind power with 3% of the fleet dedicated to regulation for wind, plus 8-38% of the fleet providing operating reserves or storage for wind. Jurisdictions more likely to take the lead in adopting V2G are identified. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"Graphene, a single layer of graphite, has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its remarkable electronic and structural properties and its possible applications in many emerging areas such as graphene-based electronic devices(1). The charge carriers in graphene behave like massless Dirac fermions, and graphene shows ballistic charge transport, turning it into an ideal material for circuit fabrication(2,3). However, graphene lacks a bandgap around the Fermi level, which is the defining concept for semiconductor materials and essential for controlling the conductivity by electronic means. Theory predicts that a tunable bandgap may be engineered by periodic modulations of the graphene lattice(4-6), but experimental evidence for this is so far lacking. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a bandgap opening in graphene, induced by the patterned adsorption of atomic hydrogen onto the Moire superlattice positions of graphene grown on an Ir(111) substrate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"Oxygen vacancies in crystal have important impacts on the electronic properties of ZnO. With ZnO2 as precursors, we introduce a high concentration of oxygen vacancies into ZnO successfully. The obtained ZnO exhibits a yellow color, and the absorption edge shifts to longer wavelength. Raman and XPS spectra reveal that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO decreased when the samples are annealed at higher temperature in air. It is consistent with the theory calculation. The increasing of oxygen vacancies results in a narrowing bandgap and increases the visible light absorption of the ZnO. The narrowing bandgap can be confirmed by the enhancement of the photocurrent response when the ZnO was irradiated with visible light. The ZnO with oxygen vacancies are found to be efficient for photodecomposition of 2,4-dichlorophenol under visible light irradiation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"Despite the recent developments in graphene oxide due to its importance as a host precursor of graphene, the detailed electronic structure and its evolution during the thermal reduction remain largely unknown, hindering its potential applications. We show that a combination of high-resolution in situ X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption spectroscopies offer a powerful approach to monitor the deoxygenation process and comprehensively evaluate the electronic structure of graphene oxide thin films at different stages of the thermal reduction process. It is established that the edge plane carboxyl groups are highly unstable, whereas carbonyl groups are more difficult to remove. The results consistently support the formation of phenol groups through reaction of basal plane epoxide groups with adjacent hydroxyl groups at moderate degrees of thermal activation (similar to 400 degrees C). The phenol groups are predominant over carbonyl groups and survive even at a temperature of 1000 degrees C. For the first time, a drastic increase in the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level at 600 degrees C is observed, suggesting a progressive restoration of aromatic structure in the thermally reduced graphene oxide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"Graphene-based sp(2)-carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and nanofibers can fail near their ideal strengths due to their exceedingly small dimensions. We have calculated the phonon spectra of graphene as a function of uniaxial tension by density functional perturbation theory to assess the first occurrence of phonon instability on the strain path, which controls the strength of a defect-free crystal at 0 K. Uniaxial tensile strain is applied in the x (nearest-neighbor) and y (second nearest-neighbor) directions, related to tensile deformation of zigzag and armchair nanotubes, respectively. The Young's modulus E=1050 GPa and Poisson's ratio nu=0.186 from our small-strain results are in good agreement with previous calculations. We find that in both x and y uniaxial tensions, phonon instabilities occur near the center of the Brillouin zone, at (epsilon(xx)=0.194, sigma(xx)=110 GPa, epsilon(yy)=-0.016) and (epsilon(yy)=0.266, sigma(yy)=121 GPa, epsilon(xx)=-0.027), respectively. Both soft phonons are longitudinal elastic waves in the pulling direction, suggesting that brittle cleavage fracture may be an inherent behavior of graphene and carbon nanotubes at low temperatures. We also predict that a phonon band gap will appear in highly stretched graphene, which could be a useful spectroscopic signature for highly stressed carbon nanotubes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbons and alcohols would allow renewable energy sources to be converted into fuels and chemicals. However, no electrode catalysts have been developed that can perform this transformation with a low overpotential at reasonable current densities. In this work, we compare trends in binding energies for the intermediates in CO2 electrochemical reduction and present an activity ""volcano"" based on this analysis. This analysis describes the experimentally observed variations in transition-metal catalysts, including why copper is the best-known metal electrocatalyst. The protonation of adsorbed CO is singled out as the most important step dictating the overpotential. New strategies are presented for the discovery of catalysts that can operate with a reduced overpotential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"We examine the effects of the substrate on the determination of mechanical properties of thin films by nanoindentation. The properties of aluminum and tungsten films on the following substrates have been studied: aluminum, glass, silicon and sapphire. By studying both soft films on hard substrates and hard films on soft substrates we are able to assess the effects of elastic and plastic inhomogeneity, as well as material pile-up, on the nanoindentation response. The data set includes Al/glass and W/sapphire, with the film and substrate having nearly the same elastic properties. These systems permit the true contact area and true hardness of the film to be determined from the measured contact stiffness, irrespective of the effects of pile-up or sink-in. Knowledge of the true hardness of the film permits a study of the effects of the elastic modulus mismatch on the nanoindentation properties. using the measured contact stiffness as a function of depth of indentation.

76,"The strong interest in graphene has motivated the scalable production of high-quality graphene and graphene devices. As the large-scale graphene films synthesized so far are typically polycrystalline, it is important to characterize and control grain boundaries, generally believed to degrade graphene quality. Here we study single-crystal graphene grains synthesized by ambient chemical vapour deposition on polycrystalline Cu, and show how individual boundaries between coalescing grains affect graphene's electronic properties. The graphene grains show no definite epitaxial relationship with the Cu substrate, and can cross Cu grain boundaries. The edges of these grains are found to be predominantly parallel to zigzag directions. We show that grain boundaries give a significant Raman 'D' peak, impede electrical transport, and induce prominent weak localization indicative of intervalley scattering in graphene. Finally, we demonstrate an approach using pre-patterned growth seeds to control graphene nucleation, opening a route towards scalable fabrication of single-crystal graphene devices without grain boundaries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"Can carbon nanotubes be efficient structural reinforcements for high-strength polymer composites? Here it is shown that, during loading, individual single-walled nanotubes pull out of their bundles (see Figure), making load transfer difficult. It is thus concluded that the effectiveness of reinforcement is determined by the stability and collective behavior of the bundles rather than the strength of individual nanotube components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"The adsorption of 12 different metal adatoms on graphene is studied using first-principles density-functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation. The adsorption energy, geometry, density of states (DOS), dipole moment, and work function of each adatom-graphene system are calculated. For the adatoms studied from groups I-III of the Periodic Table, the results are consistent with ionic bonding, and the adsorption is characterized by minimal change in the graphene electronic states and large charge transfer. For transition, noble, and group IV metals, the calculations are consistent with covalent bonding, and the adsorption is characterized by strong hybridization between adatom and graphene electronic states. For ionically bonded adatoms, the charge transfer is calculated quantitatively using two methods, one based on the DOS and the other based on the real-space-charge density. A variation in dipole moments and work-function shifts across the different adatoms is observed. In particular, the work-function shift shows a general correlation with the induced interfacial dipole of the adatom-graphene system and the ionization potential of the isolated atom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,"The sensing ability of individual SnO2 nanowires and nanobelts configured as gas sensors was measured before and after functionalization with Pd catalyst particles. In situ deposition of Pd in the same reaction chamber in which the sensing measurements were carried out ensured that the observed modification in behavior was due to the Pd functionalization rather than the variation in properties from one nanowire to another. Changes in the conductance in the early stages of metal deposition (i.e., before metal percolation) indicated that the Pd nanoparticles on the nanowire surface created Schottky barrier-type junctions resulting in the formation of electron depletion regions within the nanowire, constricting the effective conduction channel and reducing the conductance. Pd-functionalized nanostructures exhibited a dramatic improvement in sensitivity toward oxygen and hydrogen due to the enhanced catalytic dissociation of the molecular adsorbate on the Pd nanoparticle surfaces and the subsequent diffusion of the resultant atomic species to the oxide surface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,"Nanoindentation is now commonly used for the study of mechanical properties of materials on the nanoscale. One of the significant improvements in nanoindentation testing is the continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) technique. It offers a direct measure of dynamic contact stiffness during the loading portion of an indentation test and, being somewhat insensitive to thermal drift, allows an accurate observation of small volume deformation. Nanoscale damage caused by fatigue is of critical importance to the reliability of ultrathin protective overcoats and micro/nanostructures. The cyclic loading used in the CSM makes the technique useful for the evaluation of nanofatigue. Methodologies of the CSM technique used for the characterization of layered materials and nonhomogeneous composites are reviewed and discussed. Applications of the CSM technique to the measurement of contact stiffness, elastic modulus, hardness, creep resistance, and fatigue properties of the materials used in magnetic storage devices are presented. The nanoindentation CSM technique, in conjunction with nanoscratch and friction and wear tests, can be satisfactorily used for the materials characterization of magnetic storage and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and should find more application.

81,"MXene, a new series of 2D material, has been steadily advancing its applications to a variety of fields, such as catalysis, supercapacitor, molecular separation, electromagnetic wave interference shielding. This work reports a carefully designed aqueous droplet light heating system along with a thorough mathematical procedure, which combined leads to a precise determination of internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency of a variety of nanomaterials. The internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency of MXene, more specifically Ti3C2, was measured to be 100%, indicating a perfect energy conversion. Furthermore, a self-floating MXene thin membrane was prepared by simple vacuum filtration and the membrane, in the presence of a rationally chosen heat barrier, produced a light-to-water evaporation efficiency of 84% under one sun irradiation, which is among the state of art energy efficiency for similar photothermal evaporation system. The outstanding internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency and great light-to-water evaporation efficiency reported in this work suggest that MXene is a very promising light-to-heat conversion material and thus deserves more research attention toward practical applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"Although power conversion efficiency (PCE) of state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells has already exceeded 20%, photo- and/or moisture instability of organolead halide perovskite have prevented further commercialization. In particular, the underlying weak interaction of organic cations with surrounding iodides due to eight equivalent orientations of the organic cation along the body diagonals in unit cell and chemically non-inertness of organic cation result in photo- and moisture instability of organometal halide perovskite. Here, a perovskite light absorber incorporating organic-inorganic hybrid cation in the A-site of 3D APbI(3) structure with enhanced photo- and moisture stability is reported. A partial substitution of Cs+ for HC(NH2)(2)(+) in HC(NH2)(2)PbI3 perovskite is found to substantially improve photo- and moisture stability along with photovoltaic performance. When 10% of HC(NH2)(2)(+) is replaced by Cs+, photo- and moisture stability of perovskite film are significantly improved, which is attributed to the enhanced interaction between HC(NH2)(2)(+) and iodide due to contraction of cubo-octahedral volume. Moreover, trap density is reduced by one order of magnitude upon incorporation of Cs+, which is responsible for the increased open-circuit voltage and fill factor, eventually leading to enhancement of average PCE from 14.9% to 16.5%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"To identify the influence of microstructural variation on the X-ray diffraction intensities, X-ray diffraction patterns of hexagonal graphite (h-graphite) and turbostratic carbon (t-carbon) were simulated by using the general Debye equation. The numeric density of interatomic distance (NDID) is sensitive to the size and microstructure of a crystallite, so that it is used to characterize the structures of h-graphite and t-carbon. The dependence of the diffraction angles and full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of diffraction lines on the crystallite size and distortion factors is examined by computer simulation. The distortion factors for t-carbon, including rotation, translation, curvature, local positive fluctuation of interlayer spacing of graphene layers and fluctuation of atomic positions, have different influence on the NDIDs, hence on the X-ray diffraction patterns. The simulation results indicate that the diffraction angles and FWHMs of diffraction lines cannot be simply used to characterize the lattice parameters and crystallite sizes of t-carbon.

84,"Magnetic cooling could be a radically different energy solution substituting conventional vapour compression refrigeration in the future. For the largest cooling effects of most potential refrigerants we need to fully exploit the different degrees of freedom such as magnetism and crystal structure. We report now for Heusler-type Ni-Mn-In-(Co) magnetic shape-memory alloys, the adiabatic temperature change Delta T-ad = 3.6 to -6.2 K under a moderate field of 2 T. Here it is the structural transition that plays the dominant role towards the net cooling effect. A phenomenological model is established that reveals the parameters essential for such a large Delta T-ad. We also demonstrate that obstacles to the application of Heusler alloys, namely the usually large hysteresis and limited operating temperature window, can be overcome by using the multi-response to different external stimuli and/or fine-tuning the lattice parameters, and by stacking a series of alloys with tailored magnetostructural transitions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"Microscale supercapacitors provide an important complement to batteries in a variety of applications, including portable electronics.

Here, we demonstrate the scalable fabrication of a new type of all-carbon, monolithic supercapacitor by laser reduction and patterning of graphite oxide films. We pattern both in-plane and conventional electrodes consisting of reduced graphite oxide with micrometre resolution, between which graphite oxide serves as a solid electrolyte(4-9). The substantial amounts of trapped water in the graphite oxide makes it simultaneously a good ionic conductor and an electrical insulator, allowing it to serve as both an electrolyte and an electrode separator with ion transport characteristics similar to that observed for Nafion membranes(10,11). The resulting micro-supercapacitor devices show good cyclic stability, and energy storage capacities comparable to existing thin-film supercapacitors(1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,"Lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery system is endowed with tremendous energy density, resulting from the complex sulfur electrochemistry involving multielectron redox reactions and phase transformations. Originated from the slow redox kinetics of polysulfide intermediates, the flood of polysulfides in the batteries during cycling induced low sulfur utilization, severe polarization, low energy efficiency, deteriorated polysulfide shuttle, and short cycling life. Herein, sulfiphilic cobalt disulfide (CoS2) was incorporated into carbon/sulfur cathodes, introducing strong interaction between lithium polysulfides and CoS2 under working conditions. The interfaces between CoS2 and electrolyte served as strong adsorption and activation sites for polar polysulfides and therefore accelerated redox reactions of polysulfides. The high polysulfide reactivity not only guaranteed effective polarization mitigation and promoted energy efficiency by 10% but also promised high discharge capacity and stable cycling performance during 2000 cycles. A slow capacity decay rate of 0.034%/cycle at 2.0 C and a high initial capacity of 1368 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C were achieved. Since the propelling redox reaction is not limited to Li-S system, we foresee the reported strategy herein can be applied in other high-power devices through the systems with controllable redox reactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) material with over 100-fold anisotropy of heat flow between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. High in-plane thermal conductivity is due to covalent sp(2) bonding between carbon atoms, whereas out-of-plane heat flow is limited by weak van der Waals coupling. Herein, we review the thermal properties of graphene, including its specific heat and thermal conductivity (from diffusive to ballistic limits) and the influence of substrates, defects, and other atomic modifications. We also highlight practical applications in which the thermal properties of graphene play a role. For instance, graphene transistors and interconnects benefit from the high in-plane thermal conductivity, up to a certain channel length. However, weak thermal coupling with substrates implies that interfaces and contacts remain significant dissipation bottlenecks. Heat flow in graphene or graphene composites could also be tunable through a variety of means, including phonon scattering by substrates, edges, or interfaces. Ultimately, the unusual thermal properties of graphene stem from its 2D nature, forming a rich playground for new discoveries of heat-flow physics and potentially leading to novel thermal management applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Temporal evolution of rod shape had also been followed by UV-visible spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy and indicates that the nanorods briefly increase in length, then increase slightly in width, as they grow. The effect of the synthetic parameters on the rod dimension and yield was explored to find out suitable conditions to produce short nanorods; short nanorods have both plasmon bands in the visible region of the spectrum, which is a valuable property for sensor applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

91,"In this paper, we developed a green and facile approach to the synthesis of chemically converted graphene nanosheets (GNS) based on reducing sugars, such as glucose, fructose and sucrose using exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) as precursor. The obtained GM is characterized with atomic force microscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and so on. The merit of this method is that both the reducing agents themselves and the oxidized Products are environmentally friendly. It should be noted that, besides the mild reduction capability to GO, the oxidized products of reducing sugars could also play an important role as a capping reagent in stabilizing as-prepared GNS simultaneously, which exhibited good stability in water. This approach can open up the new possibility for preparing GNS in large-scale production alternatively. Moreover, it is found that GNS-based materials could be of great value for applications in various fields, such as good electrocatalytic activity toward catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"A lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient energy management strategy is needed for flexible energy-storage devices to meet a rapidly growing demand. Graphene-based flexible supercapacitors are one of the most promising candidates because of their intriguing features. In this report, we describe the use of freestanding, lightweight (0.75 mg/cm(2)), ultrathin (<200 mu m), highly conductive (55 S/cm), and flexible three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks, loaded with MnO2 by electrodeposition, as the electrodes of a flexible supercapacitor. It was found that the 3D graphene networks showed an ideal supporter for active materials and permitted a large MnO2 mass loading of 9.8 mg/cm(2) (similar to 92.9% of the mass of the entire electrode), leading to a high area capacitance of 1.42 F/cm(2) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. With a view to practical applications, we have further optimized the MnO2 content with respect to the entire electrode and achieved a maximum specific capacitance of 130 F/g. In addition, we have also explored the excellent electrochemical performance of a symmetrical supercapacitor (of weight less than 10 mg and thickness similar to 0.8 mm) consisting of a sandwich structure of two pieces of 3D graphene/MnO2 composite network separated by a membrane and encapsulated in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes.

93,"Past theories of electrode stability assume that the surface tension resists the amplification of surface roughness at cathodes and show that instability at lithium/liquid interfaces cannot be Prevented by surface forces alone [Electrochim. Acta, 40, 599 (1995)]. This work treats interfacial stability in lithium/polymer systems where the electrolyte is solid. Linear elasticity theory is employed to compute the additional effect of bulk mechanical forces on electrode stability. The lithium and polymer are treated as Hookean elastic materials, characterized by their shear moduli and Poisson's ratios. Two-dimensional displacement distributions that satisfy force balances across a periodically deforming interface are derived; these allow computation of the stress and surface-tension forces. The incorporation of elastic effects into a kinetic model demonstrates regimes of electrolyte mechanical properties where amplification of surface roughness can be inhibited. For a polymer material with Poisson's ratio similar to poly(ethylene oxide), interfacial roughening is mechanically suppressed when the separator shear modulus is about twice that of lithium.

94,"SBA-15 ordered mesoporous silicas were synthesized using the method reported by Zhao et al, The structures of these materials were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and nitrogen adsorption. The samples were found to exhibit structural properties similar to those reported earlier. Our study confirmed that the size of primary mesopores of SBA-15 can be tailored by the choice of synthesis temperature and that SBA-15 exhibits a significant amount of disordered micropores and small mesopores, The volume and size of these complementary pores were found to be dependent to some extent on the synthesis/aging temperature. It was shown that the washing of as-synthesized SBA-15 in water or ethanol was accompanied by an appreciable structural shrinkage and led to the removal of a significant part of the polymeric template. Therefore, washing needs to be avoided if one wants to isolate SBA-15 without appreciable loss of the template. It was confirmed that water-washed SBA-15 samples have fully accessible primary mesopores. Ethanol-washed samples also were found to exhibit accessible porosity. Despite an appreciable content of the template in the water- and ethanol-washed samples, their pore sizes were usually larger than those of the calcined materials. The observed structural properties of SBA-15 and their dependence on the synthesis temperature and washing were attributed to the changes in the degree of penetration of the poly(ethylene oxide) chains of the triblock copolymer template within the siliceous walls of SBA-15.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

96,"We present a Raman scattering study of wurtzite ZnO over a temperature range from 80 to 750 K. Second-order Raman features are interpreted in the light of recent ab initio phonon density of states calculations. The temperature dependence of the Raman intensities allows the assignment of difference modes to be made unambiguously. Some weak, sharp Raman peaks are detected whose temperature dependence suggests they may be due to impurity modes. High-resolution spectra of the E-2(high), A(1)(LO), and E-1(LO) modes were recorded, and an analysis of the anharmonicity and lifetimes of these phonons is carried out. The E-2(high) mode displays a visibly asymmetric line shape. This can be attributed to anharmonic interaction with transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonon combinations in the vicinity of the K point, where the two-phonon density of states displays a sharp edge around the E-2(high) frequency. The temperature dependence of the linewidth and frequency of the E-2(high) mode is well described by a perturbation-theory renormalization of the harmonic E-2(high) frequency resulting from the interaction with the acoustic two-phonon density of states. In contrast, the A(1)(LO) and E-1(LO) frequencies lie in a region of nearly flat two-phonon density of states, and they exhibit a nearly symmetric Lorentzian line shape with a temperature dependence that is well accounted for by a dominating asymmetric decay channel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"Room-temperature ferromagnetism has been observed in nanoparticles (7-30 nm diam) of nonmagnetic oxides such as CeO2, Al2O3, ZnO, In2O3, and SnO2. The saturated magnetic moments in CeO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles are comparable to those observed in transition-metal-doped wideband semiconducting oxides. The other oxide nanoparticles show somewhat lower values of magnetization but with a clear hysteretic behavior. Conversely, the bulk samples obtained by sintering the nanoparticles at high temperatures in air or oxygen became diamagnetic. As there were no magnetic impurities present, we assume that the origin of ferromagnetism may be the exchange interactions between localized electron spin moments resulting from oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of nanoparticles. We suggest that ferromagnetism may be a universal characteristic of nanoparticles of metal oxides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the most important antibacterial mechanisms of engineered nanoparticles (NPs). To elucidate the ROS generation mechanisms, we investigated the ROS production kinetics of seven selected metal-oxide NPs and their bulk counterparts under UV irradiation (365 nm). The results show that different metal oxides had distinct photogenerated ROS kinetics. Particularly, TiO2 nanoparticles and ZnO nanoparticles generated three types of ROS (superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen), whereas other metal oxides generated only one or two types or did not generate any type of ROS. Moreover, NPs yielded more ROS than their bulk counterparts likely due to larger surface areas of NPs providing more absorption sites for UV irradiation. The ROS generation mechanism was elucidated by comparing the electronic structures (i.e., band edge energy levels) of the metal oxides with the redox potentials of various ROS generation, which correctly interpreted the ROS generation of most metal oxides. To develop a quantitative relationship between oxidative stress and antibacterial activity of NPs, we examined the viability of E. coli cells in aqueous suspensions of NPs under UV irradiation, and a linear correlation was found between the average concentration of total ROS and the bacterial survival rates (R-2 = 0.84). Although some NPs (i.e., ZnO and CuO nanoparticles) released toxic ions that partially contributed to their antibacterial activity, this correlation quantitatively linked ROS production capability of NPs to their antibacterial activity as well as shed light on the applications of metal-oxide NPs as potential antibacterial agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here a graphene oxide (GO)-based multicolor fluorescent DNA nanoprobe that allows rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of DNA targets in homogeneous solution by exploiting interactions between GO and DNA molecules is reported. Because of the extraordinarily high quenching efficiency of GO, the fluorescent ssDNA probe exhibits minimal background fluorescence, while strong emission is observed when it forms a double helix with the specific targets, leading to a high signal-to-background ratio. Importantly, the large planar surface of GO allows simultaneous quenching of multiple DNA probes labeled with different dyes, leading to a multicolor sensor for the detection of multiple DNA targets in the same solution. It is also demonstrated that this GO-based sensing platform is suitable for the detection of a range of analytes when complemented with the use of functional DNA structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
