J,"Zhang, M; Li, BK; Wei, J; Zhang, L; Qu, JL",Enhanced Conduction Characteristics in SiC IGBT with Floating p-Grid Shielded Thick Current Storage Layer,"A silicon carbide insulated-gate bipolar transistor (SiC IGBT) structure is proposed and investigated with TCAD simulations. The proposed SiC IGBT features a deep current storage layer and a floating p-grid. Compared to the conventional SiC IGBT, the current storage layer significantly improves conductivity modulation in the device, and results in improved conduction characteristics (i.e. lower V-ON). However, a mere deep CSL leads to an appreciable degradation in the device breakdown voltage (BV). The floating p-grid in the proposed IGBT effectively clamps this rise of electrical field, and thus achieves an uncompromised BV. Detailed study reveals that the alignment of the p-grid to the top structure does not have obvious influence on the device performance, which makes the structure easy to implement. Switching characteristics of the IGBTs are also studied, and the E-OFF-V-ON trade-off of the proposed SiC IGBT is much better than the conventional IGBT.

J,"Bourke, JD",Exchange corrections for inelastic electron scattering rates in condensed matter,"A method is presented for quantifying quantum-mechanical exchange effects within the dielectric theory of electron scattering, the prevailing model for electron energy losses in condensed-matter systems. The approach utilizes a uniquely symmetric view of direct and exchange scattering events along with a generalized interference phase to account physically for the reduced scattering rates required by the Pauli exclusion of final-state fermions with corresponding spin, energy, and momentum. It is found that existing implementations either neglect or substantially overestimate the impact of exchange interference for condensed materials with broad optical loss spectra due to mathematical approximations or physical assumptions which are largely avoidable. The results suggest that the impact of exchange may alter inelastic scattering cross sections by between 10% and 20% for incident energies below 200 eV, a critical energy range for current investigations in electron and photoelectron spectroscopies.",10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184311,1,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes
J,"Yang, CL; Huang, YK; Golden, MS; Schwarzacher, W",Electrochemical Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Study of Bismuth Chalcogenide Single Crystals,We use electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) to image single-crystal surfaces of the layered bismuth chalcogenide Sn0.01Bi1.99Te2Se in situ under electrochemical control for the first time. The Bi chalcogenides are of interest for their thermoelectric properties and as model topological insulators (TIs). We show that oxidative dissolution takes place via the progressive nucleation of pits in the initially smooth surface terraces rather than at their edges. Nanometer-resolution EC-STM images show that the pit depth is generally equal to the thickness of a complete chalcogenide quintuple layer. The preferential redeposition of dissolved components at step and defect edges on application of a more negative potential after oxidation is observed. Our work demonstrates the ability to control and characterize the surface morphology of single-crystal TIs in an electrochemical environment.,10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b03062,2,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

Al3+ doping suppresses the ferromagnetic metal phase of La0.6Ca0.4MnO3-delta by weakening the double-exchange interaction of Mn3+-O2--Mn4+, leading to a phase separation state. Al3+ doping dependent irreversible metamagnetic transitions are observed at lower temperatures, especially a martensitic-like transition appears in x = 0.125 and 0.15 system below 4.2 K. Phase diagrams of La0.6Ca0.4Mn1-xAlxO3-delta (0.1 <= x <= 0.15) in the B-T plane are presented, in which the antiferromagnetic insulator and ferromagnetic metal phases boundary is figured out. The antiferromagnetic matrix and magnetic disorders caused by the random distribution of Al3+ ions and the spontaneous oxygen vacancies grow into a pinning center to pin the Mn moments. As magnetic field is increased to the critical field, the localized magnetic moments rotate to parallel to the magnetic field direction, leading to a martensitic-like transition.

The rheological properties of 35 and 40 vol% slips were studied. The densification, microstructure as well as hardness and fracture toughness were investigated as a function of CaPSi glass content at 1300 degrees C-1500 degrees C. The optimum NH(4)PA concentration of 35 vol% AY-TZP5 and AY-TZP10 slips at pH similar to 9 was found to be about 43% and 67% greater than that of AY-TZP slips; this behavior was related to the greater amounts of Ca2+ ions leached out from the CaPSi glass surface. The viscosity of stabilized 40 vol% slips with NH(4)PA attained a minimum value at 5.4 vol% CaPSi glass addition, and resulted in a more dense packing of cast samples. AY-TZP5 can be sintered at a lower temperature (1300 degrees C) compared to that of AY-TZP. AY-TZP5 exhibited a fine microstructure of tetragonal ZrO2 (grain sizes below 0.3 mu m), and ZrSiO4-Ca2P2O7 particles homogeneously distributed within the zirconia matrix.

J,"Park, BJ; Jin, YH; Park, NR; Kim, JT; Kim, MK",Nanolayer-embedded pseudo-photonic crystals,"In recent years, novel high-performance nanophotonic devices have been realized by applying ultrathin two-dimensional nanolayer materials to nanophotonics. In this paper, we propose nanolayer-embedded compact pseudo-photonic crystals (PPCs) that enable strong interaction between ultrathin nanolayers and photonic crystal modes. In typical two-dimensional slab photonic crystals, the transverse-magnetic (TM) photonic crystal bandgap is not well formed, making it difficult to operate the TM photonic crystal waveguide modes. However, by utilizing the low-frequency TM PPC bands, a long propagation TM waveguide mode, a slow TM waveguide mode, and a TM photonic bandgap are all readily available. In particular, the insertion of a nanometer-thick low-refractive-index layer in the vertical center of TM PPC waveguide can localize the electric fields tightly in nanometer space, causing strong field interaction with the inserted nanolayer material. Using the TM slow light near PPC band edges, field interaction with the nanolayer is significantly enhanced. We can also realize nanolayer-embedded high-quality-factor (Q-factor > 10(4)) PPC cavities using the TM PPC bandgap. We believe that the proposed TM PPCs will play an important role in the strong interaction of ultrathin nanolayer materials with photonic crystal modes.",10.1088/1361-6528/ab3d74,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Fang, JS; Yu, KY; Chen, ST; Cheng, YL; Wang, YS; Chen, GS",Reliability Enhancement of Copper/Porous SiOCH Metallization Systems Using Nitrogen Stuffing and Bias-Filter Sputter Deposited Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Barrier,"A robust ultrathin barrier to retard Cu diffusion is needed for fabricating state-of-the-art Cu interconnects associated with porous dielectric materials. Gas stuffing of grain boundaries is widely used to strengthen conventional polycrystalline TiN and TaN barriers. Alternatively, a self-formed MnOx layer derived typically from sputter-deposited Cu(Mn) alloy film is a viable barrier. However, vacuum plasma generated during Cu(Mn) deposition tends to damage porous dielectric materials. Thus, this study combines the two approaches, proposing a strategy to enhance reliability of copper/porous carbon-doped organosilica (p-SiOCH) metallization systems using nitrogen stuffed p-SiOCH and bias-filter sputter deposited Mn2O3. An ultrathin (1-4 nm) Mn2O3 film, deposited by reactive sputtering with a biased-filter mechanism on nitrogen-stuffed p-SiOCH (p-SiOCH(N)), was proposed as a barrier layer to prevent Cu from diffusion. Electrical properties of the samples were evaluated by capacitance-voltage and current density-electric field measurements. The bias-filter mechanism eliminated plasma damage of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. Furthermore, stabilization annealing converted Mn2O3 to Mn2O3-x(N) (manganese sub-oxynitride), giving the highest barrier performance for the Cu metallization layer, while maintaining the pristine dielectric properties of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. The Cu/Mn2O3-x(N)/p-SiOCH(N) structure also exhibited extremely low leakage currents after reliability tests, indicting their applicability to Cu metallization.

A zwitterionic polymer that consists of both cationic and anionic functionalities have been reported as an effective material to achieve these goals, likely resulted from the strongly-adsorbed hydration layer after being immersed in the physiological environment. In this investigation, a novel beta-thiopropionate-based zwitterionic monomer, 2-ammonio-3-((3-(2-hydroxy-3-(methacryloyloxy)propoxy)-3-oxopropyl)thio)-3-methylbutanoate (DPAMA), was synthesized through a facial process. And then the hydrophobic polypropylene was surface modified with this novel zwitterionic polymer through the surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization technique. Surface characterization analyses have been employed to investigate the modified surface properties in each reaction stage. In vitro protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and platelet compatibility evaluations have shown the polyDPAMA-modified polypropylene surface has significantly reduced fouling characteristics and good hemocompatibility.

J,"Firsova, NE; Ktitorov, SA",Extraction of the short-range defect potential parameters from available experimental data on the graphene resistance,"We consider a problem of obtaining information about the scattering potentials of the monolayer graphene sample using available experimental data on its resistance. For this purpose, we study theoretically the dependence of graphene resistance on Fermi energy having in mind to compare it with experimental data where super-high mobility electrons in suspended graphene samples without chemical doping were investigated. As far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the Coulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering potentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The empty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical shortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage of the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We consider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit formulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution of this scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function of the Fermi energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results are consistent with experiment, where the resistance was measured as a function of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene. This fact gives a possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the basis of the available experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with the gate voltage controlled Fermi level position. It is clear to be very important for applications.",10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686624,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown that there is a continuous series of disordered solid solutions with a structure of the MgCu2 type. In all alloys, cobalt atoms have a magnetic moment mu(Co) = 0.5 mu(B). The ground magnetic state of the alloys depends on the composition. In the range 0 <= x <= 0.2, alloys are paramagnetic at a temperature T = 2 K, in the alloys with 0.4 <= x <= 0.8, ferromagnetic order occurs in clusters of cobalt atoms due to the exchange interaction of Co - Co. Their magnetization in small magnetic fields is realized via turnabout, by 180 degrees, of the magnetic moments of individual clusters. In the alloys with 1.0 <= x <= 2.0, the long-range ferromagnetic order is established. The processes of technical magnetization reversal in them are effected via the motion of domain walls and rotation of the vectors of spontaneous magnetization. In all alloys, magnetic saturation is not achieved at T = 5 K even in a magnetic field of 200 kOe, which is associated with a large splitting of the ground J multiple of Pr3+ ions by the crystal field. Numerical calculations of the magnetization curves are performed.

Traditionally, the separation process employs a grinding stone having particles embedded in a softer matrix. The position and distribution of the particles have been random, causing their interaction with the wood to also be random. This makes studies of the mechanisms during the separation process difficult. Knowledge of the mechanisms in the separation process helps when designing future tools aimed at energy efficiency or tailored fibre properties. Recently, grinding surfaces having diamond particles brazed to a steel backing at fixed positions have been developed and commercialised. In this work, individual particles are not positioned at the tool surfaces. Instead, well-defined structured diamond films, soldered to a backing, are used as grinding tools. The grinding asperities of such films can be tailored to shapes that are not possible to achieve by using particles. Using this kind of tool in a lab scale grinding equipment, confirms the well-known fact that increased load or increased temperature both lead to lower energy consumption for fibre separation and longer, less damaged fibres.",10.1016/j.wear.2019.203051,29,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

The present work explores the method of decoupling the anisotropic MPs directly for bulk soft FSMs. The small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were performed on the [1 0 0]-oriented alloys Fe1-xGax (Galfenol) under a series of magnetic fields. Those two-dimensional (2D) SANS patterns were decomposed and reconstructed by the spherical harmonic approaches. The scattering intensities, which are respectively decomposed into isotropic and anisotropic components, show clearly the pathway of three types of magnetic domains. The 90 degrees domain process is thus quantified directly in the bulk Galfenol. The evolution trend for the domain process is consistent with that for the lattice strain and magnetization responses, which has been respectively evidenced by the in-situ neutron diffraction and initial magnetization measurement. Meanwhile, the quantitatively addressed domain process agrees well with the simulated results by the energy-based domain rotation modelling. These observations indicate that the anisotropic magnetization processes correlate tightly with the lattice strain response, which are of significant importance for the understanding and design of large magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS). The present approach provides a quantitative method for decoupling the magnetization processes, which would be also applicable to other ferromagnetic systems besides Galfenol.

Gelation of PVC is complex because of a narrow processing window. At low temperature, gelation is incomplete and leads to poor mechanical properties, while at high temperature, degradation may occur.

Gelation in various conditions of temperature and shear was firstly studied in a capillary device that ensures both pre-shearing and extrusion through a circular die. This provided a reference basis for comparison with gelation state obtained in the co-kneader. Samples were collected in the co-kneader by means of opening the barrel. The gelation state was particularly examined in connection with the measured temperature at a fixed position along the screw at which a temperature sensor was positioned.

In order to reduce amount of platinum group metals and obtain high CO tolerance, electrochemical atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Pd and Pt on porous Au was proposed for the catalyst formation. The electrochemical ALD was realized by surface limited redox replacement (SLRR) process of underpotentially deposited hydrogen (H-UPD-SLRR). The amount of the deposit and catalytic activity of Au-Pd-Pt structures were tested and optimized on Au wire. A performance of a miniature fuel cell prototype with a porous Au layer formed on a Si chip with several Pd monolayers and Pt sub-monolayer coverage was examined. Pd and Pt loadings were estimated to be 101 mu g/cm(2) and 10 mu g/cm(2), respectively.

J,"Hart, O; Haroche, M; Castelnovo, C",Long-range Coulomb interactions and nonhydrodynamic behavior in thermal quenches in spin ice,"When spin ice systems undergo a sudden thermal quench, they have been shown to enter long-lived metastable states where the monopole excitations form so-called noncontractible pairs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 107201 (2010)]. While the nature of these states is well understood, the dynamical mechanisms underpinning their formation remain largely unexplored and are the subject of this study. We find that the long-range tail of the Coulomb interactions between monopoles plays a central role by suppressing the monopole-assisted decay of noncontractible pairs with respect to monopole-antimonopole annihilation. In conjunction with low final quench temperatures, where the system enters a nonhydrodynamic regime in which the monopoles effectively move at terminal velocity in the direction of the local force acting on them, the interactions lead to a metastable plateau that persists in the thermodynamic limit. This is a remarkable phenomenon, reminiscent of jamming and some instances of glassiness: A transient modification of the short-time dynamics of the system allows it to enter a metastable state whose lifetime can easily be astronomically large at (experimentally relevant) low temperatures. We demonstrate this using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field population dynamics theory, and we provide an analytical understanding of the mechanisms at play. When the interactions between monopoles are truncated to finite range, the metastable plateau reduces to a finite size effect. We derive the finite size scaling behavior of the density of noncontractible pairs in the metastable plateau for both short- and long-range interactions and discuss the experimental implications of our results.",10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184411,50,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Basically, such structures suffer from their low wave impedance due to inclusion of high-epsilon materials. To reduce effective permittivity of the composite structures, we propose to insert additional inductance into the metallic mesh. For the insertion of lumped inductors along the wires, dispersion diagram and the Bloch-impedance are numerically estimated, and converted to effective permittivity and permeability. The numerical simulation results clearly show almost 3-D isotropic propagation characteristics in a specific frequency region and enhancement of the Bloch-impedance close to free space in the left-handed region.

Mainly over the last three decades, exemplary research efforts and clinical trials have been aimed at achieving the best formulation and treatment regimens for mass eradication of H. pylori. Reflecting on these efforts, we would like to pose the following questions: Is it mandatory to aim for eradication of all H. pylori strains or only specific strains thereof? What populations should be selected for antibiotic therapy? Until now, the screen-and-treat strategy has been the best recommendation by the guidelines for clinicians caring for patients from high-risk populations, but targeting the virulent strains of H. pylori had not been considered.

The thin films of the Schottky contact with double barriers were observed as increments of the capacitance. The oxygen vacancy increased at the film with the crystal structure and decreased at the film with the amorphous structure. It was confirmed that the current-voltage characteristics differ when observed in the low current area because the formation of potential barrier varies depending on the condition of the interfacing even in thin films with similar amorphous characteristics. Because the size of the potential barrier is mostly small, current is not observed in areas high at mu A level, but at nA level, the electrical properties of the potential barrier could be observed more closely by the effect of relatively large potential barriers.

Ascorbic acid is essential for tenocytes culture and collagen secretion and can alleviate the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone.

Our study aimed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the CAD/CAM-based template for maxillary orthognathic surgery using dry skulls. After reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual skull model, a surface-based surgical template for Le Fort I osteotomy was designed and fabricated using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology. To determine accuracy, the deviation of the template between the planned and the actual position and the fitness of the template were evaluated. The mean deviation was 0.41 +/- 0.30 mm in the medio-lateral direction, 0.55 +/- 0.59 mm in the antero-posterior direction, and 0.69 +/- 0.59 mm in the supero-inferior direction. The root mean square deviation between the planned and the actual position of the template was 1.21 +/- 0.54 mm. With respect to the fitness of the template, the mean distance between the inner surface of the template and the underlying bone surface was 0.76 +/- 0.24 mm.

J,"Kajiya, D",An agar sandwich method for patterning transparent conducting oxides,"Transparent electrodes are frequently used to drive opto-electronic devices, and the patterning of these electrodes is essential. The present work demonstrates a facile means of removing transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) from a glass substrate in selected areas. When agarose gel (agar), a material typically used in desserts, is sandwiched between two TCO-coated glass substrates and connected to a dry cell, the TCO is removed from the glass at the agar stamping area within 2 min. This method allows etching of TCOs using acid-free, inexpensive, and readily available starting materials. Analyses by optical microscopy, transmission spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that this etching occurs as a result of reduction of the TCO in conjunction with the electrolysis of water at the interface between the TCO and agar surfaces. Using this technique, high-throughput patterning of TCOs with an edge resolution of several micrometres was achieved. Furthermore, the shape of the agar template can be readily changed simply by cutting the agar using scissors. Therefore, this method provides a useful means for both researchers and students to easily fabricate patterned substrates for use in electronics and related technologies.",10.1007/s10854-019-02440-4,82,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Conventional word-level error resilience techniques such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC) suffer from high physical overhead and inability to correct increasingly reported multiple bit flip errors. On the other hands, state-of-the-art applications such as image processing and machine learning loosen the requirement on the levels of data protection, which result in dedicated techniques of approximated fault tolerance. In this work, we introduce a novel error protection scheme for memory, based on feature extraction through Principal Component Analysis and the modular-wise technique to segment the data before PCA. The extracted features can be protected by replacing the fault vector with the averaged confinement vectors. This approach confines the errors with either single or multi-bit flips for generic data blocks, whilst achieving significant savings on execution time and memory usage compared to traditional ECC techniques.

The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction.

The objective is to minimize the trial and ' error AM build and replace costly, time consuming X-rays and CT scans by performing real-time quantitative Non-destructive Evaluation (NDE) using integrated sensors, advanced Integrated Computational and Material Engineering (ICME) tools, and machine learning algorithms. This will improve quality, reduce cost and allow quicker qualification of AM parts.",,94,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes
J,"Acharyya, A",Impact Ionization Rate of Electrons in Bilayer Graphene Nanoribbons,"An analytical model is developed for calculating the electric field-dependent electron ionization rate in bilayer graphene nanoribbons. All probable arrangements of optical phonon and inter-electron scattering phenomena before the occurrence of an ionizing collision event have been considered in this model, which is viewed as the multistage scattering model of impact ionization. This model considers both lucky ballistic and lucky drift electrons moving under an applied electric field. The numerical results calculated by using this model are compared with the results obtained from an earlier developed analytical model.",10.1007/s11664-019-07528-5,95,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no
J,"Ahmad, S; Arshad, MJ",Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP: Rapid Bandwidth Utilization after Fast-Recovery Phase,"The purpose of this study is to enhance the performance of Multistream Fast Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keeping in view the recent web-based applications that are being deployed on long-range, high-speed, and high-bandwidth networks. To achieve the objective of the research study, a congestion control after fast-recovery module for congestion control scheme of Multistream Fast TCP is proposed. The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Consequently, Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP consumes the available network bandwidth in lesser time and increases the throughput and goodput. The proposed module enhanced the performance of the transport layer protocol. Our findings demonstrate the performance impact in the form of a decrease in the convergence time to consume the available network bandwidth and the increase in the throughput and the goodput.",10.3390/app9214698,96,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
J,"Aljaafari, A; Ibrahim, SS",Electromagnetic interference shielding and mechanical properties of multi-layered polyvinyl chloride/multiwall carbon nanotubes nanocomposite,"Electromagnetic shielding is one of the promising research areas that attract the interest of many researchers, especially researchers interested in polymer nanocomposite. In this work, the shielding efficiency and dynamic mechanical analysis for multi-layered samples are reviewed and analyzed. The multi-layered samples were prepared using two sheets of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymer loaded with multiwall carbon nanotubes over the electrical percolation threshold, and a MWCNTs buckypaper (MWCNTs BP) sheet between them. The three sheets were collected together by hot-press technique to form a multi-layered nanocomposite sample. The shielding efficiency of single and double layers of PVC/MWCNTs sheets loaded by 5 wt.% MWCNTs, was very weak. The new structured (3 layered/multilayered) nanocomposite samples were prepared with different weight percent of MWCNTs BP sheet (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 wt.%). The SE values over all the frequency range (450 MHz to about 2.0 GHz) are strongly depends on the weight percent of the MWCNTs BP. Shielding efficiency increased as the MWCNTs BP weight percent increased. Decreases the elastic modulus, storage modulus and the coefficient of complex viscosity were found for a new set of samples contains 0.14, 0.27, 0.28 and 0.44 wt.% MWCNTs BP layers. This is due to the diffused MWCNTs from the mesh to polymer layers making the composite more brittle. The glass transition temperature determined from tan delta(f) increased as MWCNTs BP content increases.",10.1166/mex.2019.1568,97,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no
J,"Alshahrie, A; Al-Ghamdi, AA; Bronstein, LM",Synthesis and characterization of Zn<sub>1-x</sub>Ac<sub>x</sub>S (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) nanocrystalline quantum dots prepared via soft mechanochemical approach,"Here, we report a first example of nanocrystalline Zn1-xAcxS (0 <= x <= 0.1) quantum dots prepared via soft mechanochemical approach. The incorporation of up to 10 at.% of Ac ions into the ZnS quantum dots (QDs) allows preservation of the cubic crystal structure as was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and the selected area electron diffraction. The transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the increase of the Ac ion doping give rise to the increase of the particle size from 4.8 +/- 0.3 nm to 17.9 +/- 0.3 nm. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements indicated that the Zn1-xAcxS powders are stoichiometric at all Ac ion substitutions. The substitution of Zn ions by Ac ions in the Zn1-xAcxS nanocrystals was also verified by the Raman and FTIR spectroscopy measurements. The incorporation of the Ac ions into the ZnS QDs showed a red shift of the optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. An enhancement of the PL intensity and a decrease of the PL spectrum width were observed due to the partial substitution by the Ac ions in the Zn sites of the ZnS nanocrystals. These properties make the Zn1-xAcxS QDs promising candidates for both light emitting and laser diodes applications.",10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.07.082,98,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Anand, K; Rajan, AJ; Bapu, BR",Development of a Method to Compute the Overall Key Performance Index for a Spinning Mill to Aid Supply Chain Management,"This paper aims to provide a convenient measure of evaluating the performance of spinning mills using the overall Key Performance Index. Although many authors have advocated the concept of the key performance index, their studies were confined to departments other than spinning. The methodology followed in this paper is based on providing weightages to machine utilisation, spindle production, end breaks, HOK (number of operative hours required to produce 100 kg of yarn), roving production, yarn realisation, CSP (count strength product), units/kg of yarn and to compute the overall Key Performance Index in a logical manner: It has come to light that some mills have achieved an overall Key Performance Index (OKPI) of more than 100 and less than 100 in certain other mills. Also the important factors which are significant for supply chain management have been highlighted. A very useful source of information and advice for various spinning mills to develop their own supply chain strategies is provided. Especially with the introduction of technical textiles, supply chain management has become a critical area.",10.5604/01.3001.0013.2363,99,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
