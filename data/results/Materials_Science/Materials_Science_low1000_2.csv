This device adopts the single cell design that with lower cost, and utilizes the optical properties of electrically tilted LC to achieve the function of NVA display. An issue has received less attention in the past and been indeed found in the production process. It is that the off-axis color shift will appear in NVA mode. We put forward one method to improve this issue here, which is combined with the concepts of Gray Frame Insertion (GFI) and Impulse-type driving.

This type of product, however, can suffer from syneresis: densification due to the expulsion of fluid. Gaining insight into the physical principles governing syneresis in such soft hybrid dispersions remains a challenge from a theoretical perspective, as experimental data are needed to establish a basis. We record non-accelerated syneresis in a model system for low-fat mayonnaise: a colloid polymer mixture, consisting of oil in water emulsion with starch in the aqueous phase. We find the flow rate of expelled fluid to be proportional to the difference in hydrostatic pressure over the system. The osmotic pressure of the added starch, while being higher than the hydrostatic pressure, does not prevent syneresis because the soluble starch is lost to the expelled fluid. From these findings, we conclude that forced syneresis in these systems can be described as a gravity-driven porous flow through the densely packed emulsion, explainable with a model based on Darcy's law.",10.1039/c9sm01097a,1,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

However, the Li2S full cell suffers from rapid capacity degradation due to the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. Herein, a Li2S/Si full cell is designed with a Li2S cathode incorporated by titanium nitride (TiN) polysulfide immobilizer within parallel hollow carbon (PHC). This full cell delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(Li2S)(-1) (1007 mAh g(sulfur)(-1)) at 0.5 C rate and excellent cyclability with only 0.4% capacity fade per cycle over 200 cycles. The long cycle stability is ascribed to the strong polysulfide anchor effect of TiN and highly efficient electron/ion transport within the interconnected weblike architecture of PHC. Theoretical calculations, self-discharge measurements, and anode stability experiments further confirm the strong adsorption of polysulfides on the TiN surface. The present work demonstrates that the flexible Li2S cathode and paired Si anode can be used to achieve highly efficient Li-S full cells.",,2,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

Here, we observe a strain-driven stripe-like morphology of two supertetragonal (monoclinic Cc and Cm) phases in the strained BiFeO3/LaAlO3 thin films. The two supertetragonal phases have a similar giant axial ratio but differences in oxygen pyramid tilting mode. Especially, the competition between polar instability and oxygen pyramid tilting is identified using atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the polarization rotation across the phase boundary. In addition, microtwins are observed in the Cc phase.

J,"Sharma, B; Hu, LY; Raghavendra, A; Gregory, W; Podila, R",Silver Nanodiscs for Enhanced Fluorescence Emission,"Here, we used a novel method to deform silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) into nanodiscs through the application of a transverse mechanical force using a homebuilt Teflon puncher. The application of different forces (16, 33, and 50 N) resulted in the formation of Ag nanodiscs with different heights (106, 99, and 88 nm) from polyhedral Ag NPs (similar to 114 nm). We observed a clear red-shift in the plasmonic resonance for completely deformed Ag nanodiscs produced using 50 N force. We show that the fluorescence emission from Rhodamine B (RhB) is enhanced by >30 fold (with respect to RhB on bare glass) in the presence of Ag nanodiscs due to a simultaneous increase in the excitation intensity and photonic mode density. The observed increase in RhB emission on Ag nanodiscs is explained in terms of the nanodisc's scattering spectrum red-shifting toward the RhB emission wavelength, which results in an increased local electric field and higher photonic mode density for Ag nanodiscs.",10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b04642,4,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

The two levels correspond to the splitting between vacancy impurity states F, F+, and V- color centers, whereas correlations are due to narrow bands in transition-metal oxides with ABO(3) perovskite structures. For these systems, we put forward a mechanism to control light emission in which micrometer-size vacancy-rich regions play the role of cavity resonators for the emitted radiation with normal frequencies mode volumes, and emission linewidths determined by their size and material properties. We argue that a physical scenario in which the emitter's natural frequency and linewidth can be fine-tuned via electronic correlations or temperature explains unusual features in the experimental photoluminescence spectra of Ar-irradiated SrTiO3.

J,"Song, DT; Xie, Z; Zhang, XG; Qu, W; Wang, QP",A Mathematical Model of a Molten Carbonate Direct Carbon Fuel Cell,"A one-dimensional (1D) homogeneous unit cell model was developed to study the performance of the molten carbonate direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC), which uses solid carbon as fuel and molten carbonate as electrolyte. It is the first unit cell model for the molten carbonate DCFC in which both 4-electron carbon oxidation and 2-electron CO oxidation reactions, as well as the reverse Boudouard reaction, are considered. The simulation results verify that, besides the relatively sluggish kinetics of the anodic reactions, cell performance is mainly limited by ohmic losses in the anode. Further modeling exploration reveals that a minimum effective electronic conductivity of around 0.56 S/cm is required to facilitate proper electrical conduction in the cathode to attain high DCFC performance. It was found that there are optimal volume fractions for the carbon fuel and liquid electrolyte in the anode. If the effective electronic conductivity of the cathode falls to 0.56 S/cm, optimal volume fractions also exist for the solid material and liquid electrolyte in the cathode. The detailed modeling analysis showed that performance improvement at high operating temperature was mainly attributed to improvement of anodic kinetics and reduction of ohmic loss in the electrolyte of electrodes and electrolyte-matrix.

In this work, temperature-dependent synaptic plasticity behaviors, which are mimicked by the indium-gallium-zinc oxide thin-film transistors gated with sputtered SiO2 electrolytes, have been studied. With the temperature increasing from 303 to 323 K, the electrolyte capacitance decreases from 0.42 to 0.11 mu F cm(-2). The mobility increases from 1.4 to 3.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), and the threshold voltage negatively shifts from -0.23 to -0.51 V. Synaptic behaviors under both a single pulse and multiple pulses are employed to study the temperature dependence. With the temperature increasing from 303 to 323 K, the post-synaptic current (PSC) at the resting state increases from 1.8 to 7.3 mu A. Under a single gate pulse of 1 V and 1 s, the PSC signal altitude and the PSC retention time decrease from 2.0 to 0.7 mu A and 5.1 x 10(2) to 2.5 ms, respectively. A physical model based on the electric field-induced ion drifting, ionic-electronic coupling, and gradient-coordinated ion diffusion is proposed to understand these temperature-dependent synaptic behaviors. Based on the experimental data on individual transistors, temperature-modulated pattern learning and memorizing behaviors are conceptually demonstrated. The in-depth investigation of the temperature dependence helps pave the way for further electrolyte-gated transistor-based neuromorphic applications.",,8,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

Here, we report on the configuration of horizontally aligned ZnO-nanowires-based metallic cavity ensemble with a light to dark current ratio of similar to 1000. An enhanced polarization photodetection ratio of transverse electric (TE) to transverse magnetic (TM) was experimentally observed compared to the single ZnO nanowire photodetector. Finite difference time domain simulation was performed on the metallic cavities, showing the distinct resonance behaviors under TE and TM light. The confinement by the multi-reflection and optical resonances between the metallic claddings contribute to the high anisotropy ratio. Furthermore, the polarized light absorption in the metallic cavity was studied as well as in the naked nanowire, which reveal a significant dependence on the cavity diameter and wavelength. For the metallic cavities, the absorption ratio of TE to TM show an enhanced value in the range of 300-500 nm wavelength and 85-150 diameter and a reversed value in the range of 400-500 nm wavelength and 17-50 diameter.

Using 3D particle physics, rain, snow and freezing rain buildup on flat and cylindrical surfaces was assessed. The numerically simulated moisture accumulations were subsequently successfully verified experimentally through a series of outdoor and indoor moisture accumulation experiments. We also conducted molecular dynamics simulations to assess how hydrogen bonds influence snow and rain adhesion on high and low energy substrates. The simulations supported the experimental observations, namely that freezing rain results in increased moisture adhesion and accumulation due to the spreading of the water droplets, resulting in more hydrogen bonds between water droplets and substrates than snow.

J,"Trapezon, AG",Residual Stress Effect on the Strength Estimate of Base-Coating Systems,"The effect of manufacturing-induced residual stresses in layered isotropic composites of basecoating type on the latter strength is studied. The conventional method, based on the principle of additivity of the initial properties of layers of a symmetric composite, is applicable to uniaxial tension or compression, but not to bending, where the latter principle is not valid. Therefore, in the latter case, stress calculation has to be based on the method of equivalent bending stiffness linking the derived strength characteristic with operating stresses in the composite layers. Residual stresses in strength assessment are taken into account by substituting their analytical expressions into respective calculation models. The reliability of mostly used relationships for determining residual stresses is analyzed. To this purpose, an independent derivation of engineering formulas for axial residual stresses was carried out, varying elastic parameters, thickness, and number of layers of the composite. The substitution of the above formulas into the additivity relation for an isotropic symmetric system under uniaxial loading does not change the latter form, due to self-balancing of residual stresses and, therefore, residual stresses do not affect the strength estimate. As an example, the axial tensile strength of an aluminum alloy clad with corrosion-resistant steel was calculated for various ratios of cladding layer-to-steel layer thickness. The results on the composite hardening are presented. It is shown that, in contrast to the uniaxial tension of a composite, residual stresses in bending loading, significantly affect the strength assessment results. Numerical results on such an assessment are presented for a case study. A scheme for determining the endurance limit under cyclic bending was elaborated based on the Goodman hypothesis and experimentally verified.

The multiple regression equation is developed that depends on the relative blade spacing and stagger angle of the straight cascade of blade airfoils, coefficient of the flexural-torsional coupling of the blade, and angle of attack with the correlation factor of the studied parameters in the range of 0.92-0.98. Using the obtained equation, the numerical program has been developed for the determination of the dynamic stability limit against subsonic flutter for the first flexural mode of the blade vibrations. The program allows one to find the numerical values of critical reduced frequencies as the characteristics of its dynamic stability and determine their dependence on the angle of attack. The results of practical application of the developed program are presented using the assessment of the dynamic stability of the flexural mode of axial compressors in four modern aircraft gas-turbine engines. It is shown that at the design engine stage it is possible to select the reduced vibration frequencies of the blade assembly for the specified geometry of its peripheral sections and angle of attack of the inflow upon the condition of the occurrence of subsonic flutter.",10.1007/s11223-019-00117-1,23,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

The method permits of measuring the ballistic coefficient of a bullet without a specialized measuring laboratory, i.e., under unequipped shooting-ground conditions. The only metrological equipment is a mobile unit for evaluating the muzzle velocity. The relation is derived based on the experimental design by the central alternate that describes the range of point values for an examined process since the range of nonexistent ones does not permit of employing the uniform alternate. The range of initial bullet velocities is divided into the three subranges to include all points of the central alternate into the range of existent values. The above ballistic coefficient-based approach can be used to compute the bullet velocity at an arbitrary distance in the tests of armored targets under field conditions without bulky equipment. The reliability of describing the examined process is provided by the approved mathematical model of the bullet flight in air as the motion of a solid body based on the system of four differential equations of first order.

J,"Al-Naddaf, M; Tannoury, GA; Han, J; Parsons, RL; Zhang, C",Development of Laboratory Procedure for Evaluating Microcracking Technology on Cement-Modified Soil Subgrade,"Cement modification of soils has been widely practiced for the last few decades. Recently, cement has become a more economical binder to modify in situ subgrade soil because other binders, such as fly ash, have become less available and therefore their prices have gone up significantly. In addition, a much higher percentage of fly ash needs be used when compared with cement to achieve the same subgrade strength and stiffness. However, cement-modified subgrade may have an issue with shrinkage cracking, which can eventually reflect through the asphalt pavement layers to the surface after construction. For some subgrade soils, a high cement content is needed to meet the unconfined compressive strength requirement without jeopardizing durability. A higher cement content will result in higher shrinkage cracking potential. To overcome this problem, microcracking technology has been developed and adopted in the field. This technology involves recompaction of cement-modified soil (CMS) with a roller 24-48 h after initial compaction to induce microcracks in the CMS and minimize the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Microcracking of CMS is not expected to significantly reduce the strength and stiffness of CMS, but it is expected to increase its permeability and reduce the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Unfortunately, the procedure to simulate microcracking of CMS in the laboratory and evaluate its effect on properties of CMS has not been established yet. This note documents the development of such a procedure and discusses the effect of microcracking on the properties (strength and modulus) of CMS specimens.",10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002982,46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was, therefore, conducted as a result of the need to add leather as supplementary material to the traditional materials such as clay, metal, wood and half-gourd used for producing vessels in Ghana. The purpose of the study was to find out how Ghanaian indigenous leather could be used in the production of leather vessels. The qualitative study employed three key techniques, namely: 'Cuir bouilli' leather hardening methods, the sand pounding technique, and assemblage and construction technique. Based on the results, the baking and hot wax methods adversely affected the indigenous leather positively in the hardening of the leather. The results also show that using only one part of the leather (the back, belly or butt) affected the quality of the leather vessels, but incorporating the various parts of the hide helped improve the quality and durability of the leather vessels.

The output force of the traditional asymmetric microgripper is stable. However, its output displacement is small, typically half the output displacement of the symmetric microgripper. To solve these problems, in this study, we designed a large-displacement asymmetric microgripper. First, we calculated the relationship between the theoretical input and output variables based on their geometric relationship. Then, we analyzed the performance of the microgripper using finite element software. Lastly, we used a piezoelectric actuator as the input driver of the microgripper. The errors associated with the theoretical and simulated output displacements were 7.05% and 924%, respectively. At 150 V of driving voltage, the maximum output displacement was 224 pm, and the actual magnification was 11.2 times.

Rails under stress conditions undergo microstructural changes, and these cause degradations of the structural integrity and lifetime of rails. In this study, three different rails (newly-manufactured rail, newly-manufactured head-hardened rail, and worn (used) rail) were compared to examine the effects of heat treatment and repeated wheel-rail contact stress on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of continuous welded rail. The crystal structure, constituent phase distribution, tensile property, and hardness were investigated at various locations along a cross section of the rails. All three rails consisted of a mixture of BCC and FCC crystal structures as a majority phase with a very small amount of cementite (Fe3C) as a minor phase. Rietveld analysis revealed that the weighted fractions of the BCC crystal structure were approximately 74%, 64%, and 85% for the new rail, head-hardened rail, and worn rail, respectively. While the web and foot areas of the three rails showed no significant differences in mechanical properties, the railheads of the three rails revealed much higher yield strength, tensile strength, and hardness. The highest tensile strength and hardness were measured at the railhead in the head-hardened rail, and were attributed to the evolution of the bainite phase, generated by additional heat treatment. The higher mechanical strength of the railhead of the worn rail is thought to have resulted from a combination of work hardening and smaller lamellar spacing of the pearlite phase, induced by repeated wear processes during train operation.",10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.12.755,62,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

We reveal that depending on the sign of the static propagation constant mismatch (detuning) between two waveguides, the launched light can be completely switched to either of waveguides. Additionally, we numerically examine the performances of light switching for general inputs and modulation amplitudes, and show that the localization of output light is robust against small to moderate variations in the final modulation amplitude, phase difference and intensity distribution of input field between two waveguides.

Sn?Mg alloys arise as promising alternatives due to characteristics such as low melting point, low coefficient of thermal expansion, suitable mechanical properties, electrical resistivity and low cost of Mg as an alloying element. However, the literature is scarce on studies relating the microstructure features of unsteady state cooling conditions during solidification to the resulting properties of Sn?Mg alloys. It is of the utmost importance to know the influence of the solidification cooling rate on the representative length scale of the alloy microstructure, since it varies from about 0.4 to 8 ;C s(?1) in the soldering process. In the present study the Sn 2.1 wt%Mg eutectic alloy is solidified under unsteady state conditions over a nickel substrate for a range of solidification cooling rates from 0.5 to 12 ;C s(?1). The microstructure is shown to be formed by a mixture of ??Sn and fibrous Mg2Sn intermetallics (IMC) and an experimental growth law is proposed relating the interphase spacing between Mg2Sn fibers (?(F)) and the cooling rate. With the decrease in the cooling rate a pronounced decrease in the Mg2Sn IMC fraction is shown to occur; from about 46% to 23%.

J,"Das, RS; Singh, B",Insight on nano-platinum-catalyzed dehydrogenation of quercetin in presence of peroxide,"Quercetin (Qu), a noted polyphenolic flavonol molecule, exhibits remarkable antioxidant properties against bioenzymes like peroxidase and tyrosinase. However, it was found that under pH = 3.5-5.5 and room temperature, Qu cannot reduce hydrogen peroxide (HP) which is a well-perceived reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for oxidative stress. We found that in presence of noble-metal nano-particles, such redox interactions can be accomplished. We thus synthesized homogenous PVP-coated nano-platinum particles (PNP) to catalyze the oxidation of Qu by HP. On reaction, Qu is oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone (QQ) following the first-order kinetics. The observed rate constant, k(o), gradually increases and tends to saturate with increasing [HP](T) where T represents the analytical concentrations of the reactant. The saturation kinetics indicates that the activities of PNP resemble to that of bioenzymes and similarly, the nano-particles host the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The estimated value of the k(cat) reveals that the extent of catalysis of even 10(-10) M PNP is nearly comparable with the rate constants of oxidation of Qu in presence of enzymes like horseradish peroxidase and tyrosinase. Graphical abstract Quercetin (Qu) is a ubiquitous natural antioxidant. However, in acidic buffer media (pH = 3.5-5.5), hydrogen peroxide (HP) cannot oxidize Qu. Strikingly, in presence of nano-platinum particles (PNP), Qu is promptly oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone following the first-order kinetics. PNP hosts the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The saturation kinetics with respect to HP resembles to enzyme-like activities of PNP, and indeed, the calculated value of the rate constant, k(cat), is comparable with those of the rate constants of enzyme-mediated oxidation of Qu.",10.1007/s11051-019-4712-1,67,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The precursors with bithiazole were successfully prepared, their inorganic and organic parts were connected on molecular level. The DSC results indicated they would all exist in liquid phase at temperature ranging from 180 K to 280 K. The UV-VIS showed that a red shift of the main electronic transitions from 254 to 268 nm of PBSIBTHM to PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 14 (from 249 to 266 nm of PBSIBTMeM to PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 17). This verified the formation of a more extensive pi -> pi* conjugating system due to coordination interaction between Ni2+ and PBSIBTHM or PBSIBTMeM. The magnetic measurement results of PBSIBTHM-Ni2+ and PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+ reflected they both exhibited ferromagnetic properties at low temperature. For PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+, it had a transition temperature (T-tran) at 160 K, and became an anti-ferromagnet above T-tran. For PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, it had a very high Curie-Weiss temperature (T-c = 253 K).

One can protect the steel electrode from aggressive media with an aluminum coating. A thin Al film on an Fe substrate has been studied by the molecular dynamics method at a heating temperature from 300 K to 1500 K. A significant horizontal displacement of individual Al atoms on the edges of the film is observed during the simulation. The film begins to ""spread"" slightly near the edges. This ""spreading"" creates the conditions for the beginning of diffusion of iron atoms into aluminum. Some Al atoms were found to penetrate the Fe matrix at a temperature of 873 K. The total energy curve of the system shows both the melting transition in aluminum and phase transition from the body-centered cubic lattice to the face-centered cubic one at 1173 K. The binding energy for the Al atom in the lattice of the Fe crystal is smaller than that for Fe atoms. The calculated diffusion coefficients for Al and Fe have a significantly slower growth with a temperature in the range of 673 K <= T <= 1500 K. To describe the diffusion in a crystal using the molecular dynamics model, a temperature-dependent correction to the activation energy is calculated.

The calculations were performed in the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation. It was established that the structures of the polycyclobutane phases can be formed on the basis of layer precursors made of hexagonal L-6 graphene and tetragonal L4-8 graphene. Tetragonal LA3 phase can be obtained from hexagonal L-6 graphite with AA packing at pressures from 59 to 67 GPa. Another way to obtain this phase is compression of tetragonal L4-8 graphite AB in the pressure range from 50 to 52 GPa. Orthorhombic LA5 phase can be obtained from orthorhombic L-6 graphite AB and hexagonal L 6 graphite AA in the pressure ranges from 64 to 71 GPa and from 59 to 67 GPa, respectively. Also, this phase can be formed under compression of tetragonal L4-8 graphite AB when the pressure reaches 46 - 50 GPa. The minimum values of the energy barriers separating the structural states corresponding to diamond LA3 and LA5 polymorphs from the states corresponding to different types of graphite are in the range from 0.09 to 0.29 eV/atom, which indicates the stability of these phases under normal conditions.

The maximum removal efficiency recorded was 51% for the largest chloride concentration of 7091 mg/l and 37% for the lowest chloride concentration of 1536 mg/l. The mass transfer coefficient was hence correlated with the hydrodynamic parameters, including chloride reduction rate, bubble surface area, and gas and liquid phase concentration.

Novel NTI-based acceptors with a spirobifluorene (SF) unit (SF-NTIs) were designed and synthesized. Their absorption range (400-600 nm) were clearly different from that of previously reported acceptor with a NTI-indacenodithiophene-NTI structure (IDT-NTI, 650-800 nm). Although, the SF-NTI with the same solubilizing groups as IDT-NTI (2-ethylhexyl groups) is not soluble enough for solution processes and favorable molecular orientation properties for OSC devices, the 1-hexylheptyl substituted SF-NTI showed a good solubility and favorable ""face-on"" orientation in the active layer films. The fabricated OSCs showed power conversion efficiency as high as 5.2%, and excellent thermal stability. These results indicate that the absorption of the NTI-triads can be tuned by modifying the central pi-unit and that their orientation nature and solubility can be controlled by altering the alkyl groups on the imide moieties.

Activation barriers of the reverse transformation from rutile to critobalite decrease with decreasing pressure. If only a fraction of cations follows the collective movement we find even lower activation barriers. The final states are still tetrahedrally or octahedrally coordinated structures, albeit not the high-symmetry variants of cristobalite or rutile, respectively.

Extensive physicochemical characterization of the resulting materials shows that solvothermally treated oxides present lower crystallite size and larger surface area, although without previous calcination these samples appear to have a higher degree of structural disorder. These differences are sharply reflected in the changes in photocatalytic activity for the removal of methylcyclohexane (MCH) and toluene vapours at relatively high concentrations. Thus, the best performance for MCH elimination is obtained with the photocatalysts prepared by calcination and subsequent solvothermal treatment. Following this procedure, the resulting Ti1-xZrxO2 material presents larger surface area and high Zr surface concentration with minimal disturbance of the anatase structure.

Perceived comfort can be related to the delay in the user experiencing the ambient conditions and the manner in which the fabric manages liquid water. A multitude of material characteristics, ranging from the surface chemistry of the fibers, yarn packing and knit geometry, affect perceived comfort. Standard measures of thermal and evaporative resistance characterize the fabric response at steady state and do not provide insight into the thermal/vapor balance kinetics under dynamic conditions. While investigating an existing dynamic test, International Organization for Standardization 13029:2012, for relating fabric properties to comfort, we observed that the fabric drying kinetics exhibited bimodal behavior. Here, we describe the mechanism that leads to the observed bimodal drying kinetics. While the standard measures the time taken to reach steady state, we use the power profile of the modes to derive quantitative metrics to characterize fabric properties. The derived metrics are based on the observation that the heat of wetting is nearly a constant for a given relative humidity for a material, and that the heat of sorption per unit of absorbed water is identical for a wide range of fabrics. The derived metrics distinguish different fiber types and fabric geometries. The proposed metrics are easily calculated from experimental observations without requiring any modification to the standard test.",10.1177/0040517519848160,93,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes
J,"Iglisch, B; Jetter, S; Bertsche, B",Optimized random sampling for the load level method in Wohler tests,"For the optimal planning of Wohler tests, DIN 50100 offers tables with different methods, such as the load level method, the pearl-string method and staircase method, to identify the required minimum sample size. Based on this norm, the sampling planning by means of the load level method was optimized in this work. Analytical formulas were developed with statistical methods. These formulas enable a fast estimation of the sample size for arbitrary use cases. Another optimization was the implementation of varying standard deviation within the area of fatigue strength in the load level method corresponding to DIN 50100. This optimization decreases the sample size compared to a constant standard deviation. Both optimizations were implemented via a MATLAB (R) based tool which also contains the methods of DIN 50100.",10.3139/120.111433,94,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Iric, S; Demir, O; Ayhan, AO",Applicability of compact tension specimens for evaluation of the plane-strain fracture toughness of steel,"The plane-strain fracture toughness test method enables the determination of the plane-strain fracture toughness (K-IC) of metallic materials by tests using a variety of precracked specimens, such as bend, compact tension (CT), arc-shaped, disk-shaped specimens. In this study, to determine the effect of the heat treatment process on the specimen thickness required for a valid plane-strain test in accordance with the ASTM standard, fracture tests are performed by using CT specimens made of AISI 1040 carbon steel. Furthermore, by taking into consideration the effect of residual stress caused by heat treatment in the vicinity of the notch, additional fracture tests are also performed. The specimens are machined from rolled plates in the L-T rolling direction (crack plane is perpendicular to the rolling direction). Having performed experimental analyses, the applicability of the plane-strain fracture toughness tests using CT specimen made of AISI 1040 steel is investigated.",10.3139/120.111436,95,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Ito, M; Watanabe, T",Effects of the addition of surfactants on the direct fabrication of a CuFeO<sub>2</sub>/Fe photocathode by hydrothermal method,"CuFeO2 is a prospective photocathode material for water or CO2 reduction, but satisfactory performance has not been achieved yet. This has been ascribed to the large size of the CuFeO2 particles obtained by growing a CuFeO2 film on an Fe substrate when using hydrothermal method for enhanced adhesion between film and substrate. This study evaluates the effect of adding oleic acid or acetic acid as surfactants in the hydrothermal fabrication process with the expectation of controlling the crystal growth. The investigation of the shape and the size of the obtained CuFeO2 particles by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction and the evaluation of the photoelectrochemical performance of the CuFeO2 photoelectrodes by electrical conductivity and photoelectrochemical measurements demonstrate that, although an increase in the particle surface area can be achieved, the performance is highly affected by the grain boundary resistance.

J,"Jiang, GB; Chen, Y; Zhang, DW; Zhou, Y",The suppression of pump-to-signal phase distortion transformation for optical parametric amplifiers in both temporal and spatial domains,"During the OPA (optical parametric amplifier) processes pumped by a high-energy laser, the phase distortion of pump light will transmit to the signal light inevitably. As a result, the beam quality of amplified signal will become poor. In this article, a hybrid seeding scheme with a paired two-stage OPA system is used, where the first and second stages used the signal and the idler as seed sources, respectively. The numerical results show that the hybrid seeding OPA scheme can suppress the phase distortion transformation from pump to signal in both spatial and temporal domains. Consequently, the phase of output signal is well restored to its input state. Because of the restriction removal of beam quality for pump light under the conventional birefringent phase-matching method, this scheme had a good application prospect in high-energy OPA or optical parametric chirped pulse amplification systems.",10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102728,98,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no

Recently, a closed-form derivative-based approach for calculating the X-parameters ' sensitivity with respect to linear circuit elements has been developed for a given input amplitude level. In this article, we build on those results and present an efficient and accurate moment-based method for the sensitivity analysis with respect to both linear and nonlinear circuit parameters, parameterized with respect to the input amplitude. The proposed method allows for the accurate and efficient computation of X-parameter sensitivity terms without the need for CPU expensive sweeps or brute force perturbation.",10.1109/TCPMT.2019.2947588,99,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,
