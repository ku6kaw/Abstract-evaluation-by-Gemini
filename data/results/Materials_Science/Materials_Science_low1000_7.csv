0,"In this paper, the evolution of solidification microstructure of Cu-40 wt.% Pb monotectic alloy of the third element Ni pair under deep undercooling conditions was studied. By comparing the phenomena of liquid phase separation during deep undercooling and rapid solidification of Cu-40 wt.% Pb monotectic alloy, the melt of the alloy increases with the undercooling, and the solidification structure appears uneven or even stratified. With the addition of the third element Ni, the liquid phase separation can be effectively inhibited by the change of interfacial energy. The solidified structure undergoes the transformation from coarse dendrite to the first kind of granular and refined dendrite in a wide undercooling range. When the undercooling reaches 143 K, the structure begins to show an inhomogeneous trend.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

2,"Microfabrication, electrical characterisation, and mathematical modelling of a non-spiral planar microcoil useful for wireless power transfer applications in biomedical devices are presented in this work. The fabrication method using the existing very-large-scale integration manufacturing process requires a single mask level, and a single metal level without any via enables direct integration with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensing circuitry. An analytical model of magnetic field distribution in a non-spiral microcoil is developed for the first time in this work, which satisfies the form of a Bessel function of the first kind. An electrical model of the non-spiral planar microcoil is also developed and compared with experimental results. Experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical model. Based on the experimental results, using optimised coil geometry, a wireless power transfer link suitable for biomedical wireless power transfer applications is studied. The maximum possible value of coupling factor of the wireless link is found to be 60% for a small separation between the coil and the magnet whereas the minimum value of coupling factor is found to be below 10% for large separations. It is found that introducing Neodymium magnetic shield layer at the receiving coil enhances the coupling factor significantly.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
3,"A reduced surface field (RESURF) AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) with graded doping buffer (GDB) and slant back electrode (SBE) is proposed. In the GDB, the p-dopant density increases linearly both from top to bottom and right to left. The concentrated negative space charges in the lower-left corner of GDB attract the electric field lines from the channel and barrier towards the gate under OFF-state, which flats the electric field and enhances the breakdown voltage (V-br). Additionally, the low p-dopant density near the top of GDB achieves the device with low ON-state resistance (R-ON). The SBE flats the electric field along the channel above it and introduces a peak electric field near its edge. Simulation results show a V-br of 2150 V and R-ON of 7.05 Omega mm for the proposed device, compared with 1701 V and 7.73 Omega mm for the conventional back electrode RESURF HEMT (BE-RESURF HEMT) with the same gate -drain spacing. Moreover, due to the reduced depletion of 2DEG from the GDB, the proposed device shows slight increases in f(T) and f(max) (8.76 and 14.80 GHz), comparing with the conventional BE-RESURF HEMT (8.24 and 13.84 GHz).",no,no,no,no,no,no,no,happy,happy,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,happy,happy,yes,no,yes,yes,no

The two-section DBR lasers, consisting of a gain section and an unpumped Bragg reflector, display an output power above 0.6 W in continuous wave (CW) mode at room temperature. The anomalous spectral data is defined as a longitudinal mode which moves toward shorter wavelengths with increasing temperature or injection current, which is unexpected. Although the longer wavelength modes are expected to start lasing when raising device temperature or injection current, occasional mode hops to a shorter wavelength are seen. These anomalous mode transitions are explained by means of modal analysis.

It is noted that a change in the shape of the pushing shutter equipped with two trapezoidal side sections makes it possible to optimize by means of an additional pivot turn of the pusher arm around its axis the distribution of the batch over the molten-glass surface in a sealed doghouse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"In this work, the effects of Cr on the microstructure, physical, and AC magnetic properties of the Ni49Fe51 alloy was studied. In this respect, three series of thin sheets of (Ni49Fe51)(100-x)Cr-x (x = 0, 3, and 7 at. pct) alloys with a final thickness of 120 mu m were prepared by means of severe cold rolling and an 1150 degrees C annealing process at H-2 atmosphere. Optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), (200) X-ray pole figure, and magnetic force microscopy (MFM) were employed to study microstructure, texture, and magnetic domain structure of the alloys. The magnetic characteristics of the samples were evaluated using BH-hysteresis loop tracer at a frequency range of 0.5 to 300 Hz. Based on the results obtained, it was shown that the mean magnetic domain width was increased from 1.006 to 1.398 mu m for 0 Cr and 7 Cr samples, respectively. Furthermore, the magnitude of the static hysteresis loss increased and the excess and classical eddy current loss decreased for the Cr-added thin sheets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Spontaneous adsorption of poly(lysine)-g-poly-(ethylene glycol) comb-like copolymers (PLL-g-PEG) is a versatile mean to coat substrates with polymer layers that resist cell adhesion. We prepared redox cleavable PLL-g-PEG to switch adhesion on demand. Redox sensitivity was obtained by introducing disulfide linkers between the PLL backbone and PEG strands. This modification was done alone or in combination with an azide end on the PEG strands that enabled in situ conjugations of adhesion peptides or fluorescent labels (by a simple application of commercially available molecules for copper-free click chemistry compatible with cell survival). To balance the functional (adhesion-promoting) vs cell-repellent copolymers, mixed layers of adjusted compositions were obtained by coadsorption from mixed solutions of the cleavable copolymer with noncleavable and repellant PLL-g-PEG. The deposition of copolymers and quantitative cleavage as triggered by reductive conditions (application of solutions of tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine, dithiothreitol, or glutathione) were characterized by QCM-D, XPS, and fluorescence microscopy. In cell culture conditions, redox-triggered cleavage was obtained by a nontoxic application of TCEP for a few minutes, enabling either to release cell attachment points (i.e., cleavage of RGD-presenting areas) or to ""open"" nonspecific adherent areas (i.e., transition from PEG-presenting areas to adherent PLL-like coatings).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,Statistical quality control of laminated windshields during bending was performed. Parameter deviations of the articles from technical specifications were uncovered. A logistic regression model was constructed to determine the probability of obtaining high-quality laminated automobile glass as a function of the bending regime. It was shown that logistic regression is effective for on-line inspection of laminated windshields and in making decisions concerning bending regime adjustments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"In the search for advanced materials active particles could offer unique structural and functional properties, with tunable time-dependent characteristics. We demonstrate here that the direction of self-propulsion, relative to the particle orientation, may be as influential for the phase behavior as the pair interactions are for passive particles, and enable dynamic properties that are not available to passive systems. We perform simulations on ensembles of self-propelled squares, and find that squares that self-propel in the direction perpendicular to a side rapidly reach a steady state with a characteristic cluster distribution, positional order, and well-defined diffusion constant. After tuning the direction towards a corner, the particles form large and dense clusters that show a transient collective motion, and display remarkable fluctuations over long time scales, with a distinct periodicity. Clusters of these particles appear unstable beyond a critical size, and susceptible to a catastrophic disintegration. Directionality is found to effect equally sharp transitions in the mixing properties of active squares and passive squares, and the behavior of the passive ensemble. We relate directionality to the collision dynamics and the resulting reaction network of clusters, evolved by a Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, to correlate propulsion direction to the observed phase behavior. Understanding this behavior could offer new design rules for programmable materials, and grant further insights in the dynamic processes that nature employs for self-assembly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"A detection and degradation platform was developed to optically quantify the 6-enolate, 8-keto-dG, an important tautomer of mitochondrial mutated DNA 8-oxo-dG. We first found that 6-enolate, 8-keto-dG offers particular fluorescence emission under the conditions between pH similar to 7 and similar to 11. Thus, a mitochondria-targeting photosensitizer NV-12P was prepared to offer simultaneously photoinduced electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with 6-enolate, 8-keto-dG. Furthermore, NV-12P can also generate a reactive oxygen species to degrade 6-enolate, 8-keto-dG under irradiation conditions. This is the first publication about optical characterization, concentration detection and photodegradation of 6-enolate, 8-keto-dG, either in biological or in vitro applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"In present work, the microwave dielectric properties of CaTiO3-added Li2Zn3Ti4O12 ceramics prepared by the conventional solid-state method have been investigated. The phase composition, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of (1 - x) Li2Zn3Ti4O12-x CaTiO3 (x = 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 wt%) ceramics were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDS and network analyzer. The XRD and EDS results indicated that the ceramics involved Li2Zn3Ti4O12 and CaTiO3 phases. The SEM micrographs shown that as the CaTiO3 contents increased, the average grain size of the composition ceramics decreased. The microwave dielectric properties of the composition ceramics can be effectively controlled by varying the CaTiO3 contents. The values of dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and tau(f) of the composition ceramics were increased, and the quality factor (Q x f) was decreased with increasing the CaTiO3 contents. Typically, a new temperature stable microwave dielectric material of 0.94 Li2Zn3Ti4O12-0.06 CaTiO3 with excellent microwave dielectric properties of epsilon(r) = 21.7, Q x f = 61,490 GHz, and tau(f) = + 2.68 ppm/degrees C was attained when sintered at 1175 degrees C for 4 h.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"The protective layer at the crack tip of an alloy component can be damaged, and the resistance to crack propagation can be reduced by the combined effects of stress and a corrosive environment. Therefore, the measurement of crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) can be applied to characterize the crack propagation rate (da/dt) during stress corrosion cracking (SCC) experiments. In the present work, CTOD of a T-type wedge opening loaded (T-WOL) specimen with a built-in loading bolt was initially determined using three-dimensional elastic-plastic finite element analysis (FEA). The influence of stress concentration from side groove on CTOD was clearly evaluated, i.e., the fluctuation of CTOD occurred near the groove-tip plane. However, CTOD became stable on >90% of thickness of T-WOL specimen. Therefore, CTOD at mid-thickness plane of T-WOL specimen could be applied for SCC experiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Ferrites with the formula Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4, where x ranges from 0.0 to 0.8 with a step of 0.4, were prepared via the auto combustion method. The structure and chemical composition of the ferrites were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The presence of peaks in the XRD patterns was confirmed by the formation of a cubic spinel structure, because the main peaks of the patterns were related to the single-phase cubic spinel structure with PDF-number of 008-0234. The XRD patterns showed a slight shifting in peaks position due to unstable spacing values with increasing Mg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ contents in all ferrites. The mean crystallite size and lattice constant were determined from the Scherer's formula and XRD data. They were found to have been increased by the increase of x concentration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images were used to analyze the ferrites' structures. In addition, room temperature magnetization and coercivity of ferrites were determined from the hysteresis loops in a magnetic field of 9 kOe by alternative gradient force magnetometer. It was found that the magnetization and coercivity of ferrites with increasing x contents were increased, which is discussed according to the site's occupation of the substituted cations on the sub-lattices. Among all synthesized ferrites, Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.8 showed the highest magnetization and coercively, whereas Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.0 displayed the lowest corresponding values. The initial permeability of ferrites as a function of frequency were measured over a frequency range of 10 kHz to 10 MHz. In all curves, the initial permeability remained almost constant during increasing frequency until similar to 1 MH,z and then it fell rapidly. This constant trend of the initial permeability shows the high operating frequency of the ferrites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Impact of SiO2 capping layer on the quality of poly-GeSn film and characteristics of bottom-gate junctionless (JL) p-channel thin films transistors (P-TFTs) were studied. From the analysis results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Hall-effect measurement, the amorphous GeSn film starts to crystallize at 450 degrees C while the crystallinity enhances at 500 degrees C by employing rapid thermal annealing (RTA) as the film crystallization process. With capping layer on the whole region, the hole concentration becomes too high to turn the JL P-TFTs off. However, by limiting capping layer on source/drain region to increase hole concentration, total series resistance is reduced due to lower sheet resistance and contact resistance, which consequently improves the drive current, I-ON/I-OFF ratio and field-effect mobility. Based on the best process conditions and structure to form the poly-GeSn JL P-TFTs, I-ON/I-OFF ratio up to 5.6 x 10(2) are achieved while peak field-effect mobility of 20.8 cm(2)/Vs is obtained. Moreover, the low thermal budget process of 500 degrees C for 30 sec enables next-generation monolithic 3D-ICs. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"A novel actuation method, called electrostatic formation (ESF), for MEMS and other applications, is introduced. The ESF mechanism uses a droplet of liquid material that is electrostatically deformed. ESF differs from Electrowetting and Electrowetting on Dielectric as the electrode used to apply the voltage is of a smaller diameter than the droplet being manipulated, and the electrode is located above the manipulated fluid. Modeling this movement requires adherence to the Lippmann and Young-Laplace equations simultaneously. In order to understand how the surface tension is specifically manipulated, as is required for the development of a model of representation of the phenomenon, a force-based interpretation of the Lippmann equation is outlined, with focus on how it compares to the force response provided by hydrostatic pressure under the influence of gravitational field forces. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a differential surface charge must be present of which the formulation is complex in nature, likely stemming from the combination of the internal pressure and a localized skin effect caused by an electric double layer that is present at the surface of the transformed liquid. In this study, a target liquid of gallium is manipulated under electrostatic charge in a physical experiment and compared against the geometry suggested by the developed model. By utilizing the assumptions highlighted in this article, a coefficient of variance (R-2) of 0.907 was calculated between the measurements and model. This coefficient of variance was improved to 0.915 through the introduction of varied electrostatic and internal pressure terms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"To study the melting transition of a vortex crystal (or cluster) consisting of a small number of vortices confined in a mesoscopic-scale superconductor, c-axis magnetoresistance in the highly anisotropic high-T-c superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+y (Bi2212) has been measured using a triangle-shaped stack of intrinsic Josephson junctions, which was trimmed out from a single-crystal flake of Bi2212 via a double-sided etching process using a focused ion beam. We observed oscillations of the melting transition line, in which the oscillating part of the melting temperature has sharp peaks when the number of vortices N exactly coincides with the triangular number n(n + 1)/2 (n is an integer number), at least for N < 50. This is in contrast to the case of square shapes where the enhancements appeared as broad peaks around N = n(2). Furthermore, the field ranges of the N-vortex state expand at the triangular numbers of N, suggesting that the triangular number of vortices has a more stable configuration than the others. Numerical studies on the configuration of vortices in a triangle shape show that geometrical matching with no defect structures is realized at the triangular numbers, whereas an edge dislocation often appears in the other nonmatching cases. The degree of suppression of the melting temperatures at nonmatching numbers is reasonably consistent with the value estimated from the increase in free energy with the introduction of an edge dislocation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"The static behaviour of an elastoplastic axial lattice is studied in this paper through both discrete and nonlocal continuum analyses. The elastoplastic lattice system is composed of piecewise linear hardening-softening elastoplastic springs connected between each other via nodes, loaded by concentrated tension forces. This inelastic lattice evolution problem is ruled by some difference equations, which are shown to be equivalent to the finite difference formulation of a continuous elastoplastic bar problem under distributed tension load. Exact solutions of this inelastic discrete problem are obtained from the resolution of this piecewise linear difference equations system. Localization of plastic strain in the first elastoplastic spring, connected to the fixed end, is observed in the softening range. A continuous nonlocal elastoplastic theory is then built from the lattice difference equations using a continualization process, based on a rational asymptotic expansion of the associated pseudo-differential operators. The continualized lattice-based model is equivalent to a distributed nonlocal continuous elastoplastic theory coupled to a cohesive elastoplastic model, which is shown to capture efficiently the scale effects of the reference axial lattice. The hardening-softening localization process of the nonlocal elastoplastic continuous model strongly depends on the lattice spacing, which controls the size of the nonlocal length scales. An analogy with the one-dimensional lattice system in bending is also shown. The considered microstructured elastoplastic beam is a Hencky bar-chain connected by elastoplastic rotational springs. It is shown that the length scale calibration of the nonlocal model strongly depends on the degree of the difference equations of each lattice model (namely axial or bending lattice). These preliminary results valid for one-dimensional systems allow possible future developments of new nonlocal elastoplastic models, including two- or even three-dimensional elastoplastic interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"TMIn is used as a metal organic precursor for MOCVD to grow InGaN or InN, which form the basis of solar cells or green LEDs. However, TMIn has a residual amount of about 10% in a used TMIn canister. This study aims to recover the residual amount of TMIn and to re-use it as a precursor after purification. Analysis of the inorganic impurities after refining TMIn shows that the total impurity is lower than 530 mu g/L by ICP-AES. In the FT-NMR of detective organic chemical bonding of ""(CH3)(3)In"" peak is observed with no defective organic structure of bonding.

21,"A thin dielectric layer plays a significant role to extend the electronic and optical properties of graphene-based field effect transistors. This study investigates the interaction between graphene and aluminum oxide layer (Al2O3) and the influence of Al2O3 on the properties of graphene. The electrical characterization demonstrates the tunability in the resistivity of Al2O3/Gr devices by applying V-g. Al2O3 deposition introduced n-doping in graphene and is affirmed by shifting of charge neutrality point towards negative V-g. The selective coverage of channel, results in the formation of p-n junction within graphene FET which becomes more pronounced upon DUV treatment. Moreover, the study validates the modulation in interface properties of pristine GFET and Al2O3/Gr at different V-g and temperatures. An enhancement in the intervalley and phase coherence scattering rates is observed for Al2O3/Gr device. Therefore, the effect of dielectric layer on graphene based field effect transistors would be of great interest to tune the properties the device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Aluminate glasses have excellent optical and mechanical properties, in addition to high thermal and chemical stability. However, aluminate glasses require high melting temperatures and exhibit poor glass forming ability, causing difficulties while preparation by the melt-quench method. Therefore, it is necessary to establish novel methods to improve melting conditions and glass forming tendencies for aluminate glasses. 40La(2)O(3)-10Nb(2)O(5)-(50-x)Al2O3-xBaO (x = 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10) glasses were prepared by the aerodynamic levitation method. XRD, DTA, and Raman and NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to investigate the effects of BaO on the structure and thermal properties-including crystallization behavior-of lanthanum aluminate glass. The results show that the addition of BaO increases the glass transition temperature (T-g) and stability Delta T of the baseline glass, as Al-Ba-7.5 (40Al(2)O(3)-10Nb(2)O(5)-42.5Al(2)O(3)-7.5BaO) glass has the highest AT value (151 degrees C). The 27 Al MAS NMR spectrum of a high BaO-content glass (Al-Ba-10) shows that about 80% of Al-[IV] and 15% of Al-[V] are present in the glass network. Raman scattering spectra indicate that a peak shown around 790 cm(-1) canbe assigned to the internal stretching vibrations of the Al-non-bridging oxygen (NBO) bonds in depolymerized [AlO4/2] tetrahedrons. The crystallization activation energies were calculated to be 1157.1 kJ/mol and 891.7 kJ/mol (Kissinger method) for Al-Ba-x (x = 0, 7.5) glasses, respectively, which progresses as a diffusion-controlled three-dimensional growth process.

The lead free piezoceramics are gaining importance as there is an urgent demand for replacing the highly toxic PZT family piezoceramics. Ba0.9Ca0.1Zr0.07Ti0.93O3 (BCZT) is one such system. It shows some high electrical properties but suffers with a low Curie temperature, which restricts its usage in low temperature range only. In the present study, the Curie temperature has been improved by 9 degrees C. A polymorphic phase transition (PPT) has also been observed around x = 0.015, consisting of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, which provides the polarization vector more number of favorable directions. As a result the remnant polarization (P-r), piezoelectric charge coefficient (d(33)) and electromechanical coupling coefficient (k(p)) attain their maximum values of 5.21 mu C/cm(2), 200 pC/N and 24.78% respectively for x = 0.015.

25,"Low-temperature (<= 250 degrees C) formation of Sn-doped Ge (GeSn) (substitutional Sn concentration: 2-3%) on insulator is desired to realize flexible electronics, where high-speed thin-film transistors are integrated on flexible plastic-substrates (softening temperature: similar to 300 degrees C). To achieve this, gold-induced lateral crystallization of amorphous GeSn (a-GeSn) is investigated. Here, a-GeSn (Sn concentration: 0%-20%) on insulator structures, having Au-island patterns, were annealed. For initial Sn concentrations of 0%-5%, high-speed lateral crystallization proceeds around Au-patterns, and large grown regions (similar to 5-20 mu m) are obtained by low-temperature short-time annealing (150 degrees C-250 degrees C, 10 min). However, bottom regions of GeSn are not crystallized at 150 degrees C-200 degrees C, while the whole films including bottom regions are crystallized at 250 degrees C. These phenomena are caused by the following temperature-dependent growth mechanisms. At 150 degrees C-200 degrees C, Au atoms are supplied into surface-regions of a-GeSn films from Au-islands by surface-diffusion, resulting in crystallization of only surface-regions. On the other hand, at 250 degrees C, layer-exchange of Au/GeSn occurs, which increases supply channel of Au for diffusion. This results in complete crystallization of GeSn to the bottom. Substitutional Sn concentrations in grown layers are increased with increasing annealing temperature. As a result, GeSn films (substitutional Sn concentration: similar to 3%) are obtained at similar to 250 degrees C. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"We report a method to fabricate surfactant-free eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) sessile nanodroplets out of liquid metal.

Here we have prepared EGaIn nanodroplets on the surface of transferred Ga2O3 ultrathin films. Surface morphology measured by atomic force microscope shows the vast majority of nanodroplets are isolated and randomly distributed, with mean radius below 100 nm.

Here, the researched X2Te3 (X = Sb, Bi) single layer materials and their thermodynamical stabilities are proved through our calculations. The indirect band gaps pulse with the high carrier mobilities are also discussed based on first-principle calculations. On basis of the calculation, the low cleavage energies are about 0.34 Jm(-2) that is comparable with that of graphite, which imply a high possibility to obtain the single layer from exfoliating bulk counterpart. Band gaps are simulated as between 0.65 and 1.31 eV using different functionals, moreover, the band structures with and without SOC effect are all considered. The SOC effect results certify that X2Te3 monolayers are different from their bulk counterparts, they are not topological insulators. The largest electron mobility selected in their impressive carrier mobilites is 27.91 x 10(3) cm(2)V(-1)S(-1) that bears comparison to that of silicene. Moreover, the mechanical properties include Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio are studied too. Meanwhile, the biaxial strain can effectively modify the band gaps.

28,"The head check is one of the most famous cracks generated on the railway rail. Generally, the head check is generated at the gauge corner of the rail surface of the high rail in the curved section. The initiation factors of the head check are thought to be a plastic deformation of the rail surface caused by the severe contact between the wheel and the rail. Hence, the occurrence situation and the initiation factor of the head check is widely known. On the other hand, occurrence of some head check was confirmed on the low rail in the curved section. However, the occurrence situation of the head check on the low rail is not clarified. Furthermore, the initiation factors of this typed head check is not also clarified. In this research, we conducted the on-site investigation and the analysis of the rail which had the head check on its surface, in order to clarify the occurrence situation of the head check on the low rail. In addition, we conducted the wheel and the rail contact analysis by use of multi-body dynamics and the measurement of the wheel and the rail contact forces on the service line to investigate the initiation factors of the head check. The results showed that the head check of the low rail is generated in the curved section with a radius of about 400-800m on the line where the tilting trains are operated. Furthermore, it is thought that the initiation factor of the head check seems to be the longitudinal creep force caused by the large differences between the diameter of the wheel on the high rail and that on the low rail in case of the tilting train running in the curved section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,"Surface engineering of battery-electrode materials is one of the hottest topics in both academic research and industry application fields. Up to now, however, there is still lack of a widely applicable strategy to achieve this goal. Herein, we demonstrate a universal method to accomplish electrode surface engineering via graphene oxide (GO) by spraying technology. In our study, a reduced graphene (rGO) layer can be fabricated on the surface of Li metal through the redox reaction of Li metal and GO. Notably, the protective layer on Li-metal anode can be capable of inhibiting the growth of Li dendrite and the symmetrical Li-rGO-Li cell can maintain 500 cycles without short circuits. What is pleasantly surprised, the GO layer can be uniformly coated on the surface of cathode (eg. LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 or NCM). Thanks to the simultaneous improvement of the anode and cathode, the NCM-GO-Li battery exhibits superb long-term cycles and excellent rate capability at high temperature of 60 degrees C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"A water-cooled jacket enclosing a silicon rod could reduce the fines formation during silane pyrolysis in Komatsu reactor. However, it would result in energy loss. Especially, as the diameter of the silicon rod increases, the free space between the jacket and the silicon rod will vary, and the jacket's effect would be complicated. This work presents a numerical study of the polysilicon chemical vapor deposition (CVD), fines formation, and thermal loss during silane pyrolysis in a Komatsu reactor. The CFD software FLUENT with detailed chemical reaction model of silane decomposition was applied to predict the silicon deposition rates, fines formation and thermal loss produced by a water-cooled jacket. The effects of water-cooled jacket temperature, rod wall temperature, and the distance between water-cooled jacket and rod surface on the polysilicon deposition rate and the fines formation have been investigated. The model was verified by comparing the model predictions with the experimental measurements in the literature. The results show that the jacket wall temperature and rod diameter have a complex influence on the fines formation, CVD growth rate, and thermal loss. The jacket wall temperature should be adjusted as the rod diameter enlarges. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"A flexible fiber pad conditioner, which conforms well to the pad surface, has been developed. Conventional disc-type conditioners have a potential concern of uniform conditioning across the entire pad surface in terms of intermittent contact by face-to-face contact. In the flexible fiber conditioner, each fiber tip functions independently with constant contact force on the pad, by utilizing the bending effect of the flexible fiber. Therefore, the conditioner performs uniform and fine conditioning, following the height variation in the pad surface. Uniform conditioning was verified by a unique method using surface coloration on a pad with height variation. In addition, it was shown that, using the developed conditioner, the chips generated by pad conditioning were very small, and the pad surface was finely scraped and roughened. It was further demonstrated that the developed flexible fiber conditioner shortened the pad break-in process. Moreover, compared with the conventional disk-type conditioner, the developed flexible fiber conditioner resulted in a uniform polishing profile even in the midst of the break-in process. The results indicate that it is important for the break-in of the polishing pad, to uniformly scrape and roughen the entire area of the pad while following the pad surface, rather than planarizing the surface.

32,"The dislocation properties of intermetallic compound (IMC) B2-AlPr in {110} plane is studied in detail based on the truncated approximation method in this paper. The results suggest that the core width of screw dislocation and edge dislocation of Burgers vector < 100 > is wider than that of < 110 >. Meanwhile, their unstable-stacking-fault energy (gamma(us)) of gamma(us) < 110 > > gamma(us) < 001 > indicates that the unstable-stacking-fault energy performs very important function on the core width of screw dislocation. The easiest slip system of B2-AlPr is < 111 > {110}. The lattice misfit energy is always less than elastic strain energy except the dislocation angle with 54.7 degrees. The phase position of misfit energy and elastic strain energy is always showing opposite phases. However, the misfit energy is greater than elastic strain energy for 54.7 degrees dislocation, and shows the same phase.

33,"We investigate the discrete diffraction phenomenon in a Polymer-Liquid Crystal-Polymer Slices (POLICRYPS) overlaying a random distribution of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, plasmonic elements). We study the propagation of a CW green laser beam through the waveguide structure as a function of beam polarization, laser intensity and sample temperature. It turns out that the plasmonic field created at the interface between AuNPs and POLICRYPS waveguides enables and stabilizes the optical field propagation within the responsive nematic liquid crystal channels. The active role of the liquid crystal is pointed out by a polarization, temperature and beam divergence experimental analysis and evidenced by a peculiar trumpet-shaped discrete diffraction pattern. Theoretical simulations confirm that the observed optical behavior is governed by the interaction of the nematic liquid crystal with optical and plasmonic fields.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile fatigue tests of concrete members with higher load cycles were carried out and S-N-Curve (Wohlercurve) of lattice girders acting as shear reinforcement was determined.

36,"Nanofluidic devices have channel dimensions which come to within one order of magnitude of the Debye length of common aqueous solutions. Conventionally, external driving is used to create concentration polarization of ions and biomolecules in nanofluidic devices. Here we show that long-range ionic strength gradients intrinsic to all nanofluidic devices, even at equilibrium, also drive a drift of macromolecules. To demonstrate the effect, we confine long DNA to straight nanochannels of constant, rectangular cross-section (100 x 100 nm(2)) which are connected to large microfluidic reservoirs. The motion of DNA is observed in absence of any driving. We find that at low ionic strengths, molecules in nanochannels migrate toward the nano-micro interface, while they are undergoing purely diffusive motion in high salt. Using numerical models, we demonstrate that the motion is consistent with the ionic strength gradient at the micro-nano interface even at equilibrium, and that the dominant cause of the drift is diffusophoresis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article presents a technique for deriving the actual circumferential stress according to the circumferential geometric condition, the Drucker-Prager criterion and incremental theory. Based on the actual circumferential stress, a new characteristics method for determining the axisymmetric active earth pressure in plastic flow is developed in this article. In this new method, the inclined angle of boundaries, interface friction of contact interface, dilatation effect and flow velocity of soil are considered at the same time. The validity of the new method is confirmed using several sets of experimental data from the literature.

39,"We study charge transport through N-lead junctions (N >= 3) of spinless Luttinger-liquid wires with bias voltages applied to Fermi-liquid reservoirs. In particular, we consider a Y junction, which is a setup characteristic of the tunneling experiment. In this setup, the strength of electron-electron interactions in one of the arms (""tunneling tip"") is different from that in the other two arms (which form together the ""main wire""). For a generic single-particle S matrix of the junction, we find that the bias voltage V applied, even symmetrically, to the main wire generates a current proportional to vertical bar V vertical bar in the tip wire. We identify two mechanisms of this nonequilibrium-induced ""emergent chirality"" in a setup characterized by the time-reversal- and parity-symmetric Hamiltonian of the junction. These are (i) the emergence of an effective magnetic flux, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and (ii) the emergence of parity-breaking asymmetry of the setup, both proportional to the interaction strength and the sign of the voltage. The current in the tip wire generated by mechanism (i) is reminiscent of the Hall current in the linear response of a system the Hamiltonian of which breaks time-reversal symmetry; however, in the absence of any magnetic field or a local magnetic moment. Similarly, mechanism (ii) can be thought of as an emergent ""photogalvanic effect,"" however, in the presence of inversion symmetry within the main wire. The nonequilibrium chirality implies a rectification of the current in the tip when the main wire is biased by ac voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

41,"A new material, named Hyposand, is proposed. Its fabrication by means of sand and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate salt is presented, and the results of some characterization tests are discussed. Three families of samples were produced using different types of sands. The samples were tested to identify their mechanical properties and to understand how these properties are affected by the microstructure, the mixing proportions and the temperature of salt when mixing. Furthermore, information on the effects of exposure to humidity was sought. For these purposes, the following experimental campaigns were run and are presented here: (i) sieve tests and X-ray tomography analyzes, (ii) compression tests, and (iii) flexural tests. The results indicated an average strength of 25 MPa in compression and 8 MPa in flexion, with values depending on the above mentioned conditions.

42,"Low-cost spray deposition is employed to investigate the suitability of spray-deposited Al2O3 for rear passivation and optical trapping in passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) Si solar cells. Structural, optical, and electrical properties of spray-deposited Al2O3 films are investigated. Capacitance-voltage measurements indicate that spray-deposited Al2O3 has a negative charge density of 3.19 x 10(12) cm(-2) for an 80-nm film, suggesting that it can serve as the passivation layer. Optical properties of spray-deposited Al2O3 are identical to the Al2O3/SiNx stack prepared by atomic layer deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, indicating that it can also serve as the optical trapping layer. Atomic force microscopy studies show that spray-deposited Al2O3 is crack and pore free, and its surface roughness has a root-mean-square value of 0.52 nm for an 80-nm film. Spray-deposited Al2O3 is amorphous as determined by X-ray diffraction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that spray-deposited Al2O3 is slightly Al-rich. The resistivity and breakdown field of an 80-nm Al2O3 film are 5.46 x 10(14) Omega-cm and 3.28 MV/cm, respectively, which are stable after 800 degrees C firing.

To describe the curved incoming and outgoing trajectories, we introduce a general recipe based on an abstraction of the actual impurity scattering process to define the scattering parameters such as the incoming and outgoing momentum and coordinate jump. In this picture, we can conveniently describe the skew scattering and coordinate jump, which will eventually modify the Boltzmann equation. We find an anomalous Hall resistivity different from the conventional Boltzmann-Drude result and a negative magnetoresistivity as a parabolic function of magnetic field. The origin of these results is analyzed. The relevance between our theory and recent simulation and experimental works is also discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"Extracellular matrix dynamics mediates many important biological activities including tissue repairing process. Acellular scaffolds would be involved in the extracellular matrix dynamics of the host tissue after in vivo implantation. The remodeling process of acellular scaffold is also the reestablishment of extracellular matrix dynamics in acellular scaffold. In order to study the role of extracellular matrix dynamics on the remodeling process of acellular scaffold, acellular bovine pericardium (S1) and acellular bovine dermis (S2) were prepared. The in vitro characteristics and in vivo performance for dura defect repairing were tested. The results indicated that extracellular matrix dynamics played an important role after surgical implantation of the acellular scaffold. The extracellular matrix dynamics of the acellular scaffold restarted along with the infiltration of the host cells. The thoroughly degradation of S2 showed that an equilibrium extracellular matrix dynamics in the acellular scaffold should be established and successful integration between acellular scaffold and auto-dura could not guarantee tissue regeneration. In addition, there was a close relationship between the in vitro characteristics and the in vivo performance of the acellular scaffold. The in vitro characteristics had big influence on the restoration of extracellular matrix dynamics. Acellular scaffold could actively take part in the extracellular matrix dynamics and remodeling itself subsequently. Therefore, acellular scaffold showed great advantages to other scaffold materials for tissue regeneration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

46,"Using the method of step heating thermography, this study seeks to detect and characterize the existence of stress in a beam sample of carbon epoxy composite with the stacking sequence of [0(8)] aided by empirical and simulation approaches. The applied stress in the longitudinal direction of sample, while considering the Poisson's ratio, changes the lateral dimensions of sample. Furthermore, it is shown that the thermal conductivity along the sample thickness varies as a result of stress existence. Accordingly, to obtain a relation between transverse thermal conductivity and longitudinal tensile stress, one should calculate and eliminate the effect of lateral deformation caused by stress. To this end, by combining the experimental and simulation results of composite sample under the action of different tensile loads, an equation describing the variation of thermal conductivity along the sample thickness with respect to applied stress is developed. Using the relation of transverse thermal conductivity variation in terms of applied stress, the finite element modeling is again carried out by rectifying the values of thermal conductivity. Simulation results are compared with experimental ones, indicating very good agreement between the two approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

51,"In (Ga,Mn)As, a model dilute magnetic semiconductor, the electric and magnetic properties are strongly influenced by the lattice sites occupied by the Mn atoms. In particular, the highest Curie temperatures are achieved upon thermal annealing in a narrow temperature window around 200 degrees C, by promoting the diffusion of interstitial Mn towards the surface. In this work, we determined the thermal stability of both interstitial and substitutional Mn in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As thin films, using the emission channeling technique. At a higher Mn concentration, the temperatures at which substitutional and interstitial Mn become mobile not only decrease, but also become closer to each other. These findings advance our understanding of self-compensation in (Ga,Mn)As by showing that the strong dependence of the Curie temperature on annealing temperature around 200 degrees C is a consequence of balance between diffusion of interstitial Mn and segregation of substitutional Mn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"As the conductive channel, undoped channel hole polysilicon (poly-Si) plays a significant role in 3DNAND. Two important properties i.e. grain size and step coverage (S/C) of undoped channel hole poly-Si have attracted great attentions in practical manufacturing. The grain size affects the mobility of conductive poly-Si film and large grain size usually leads to high mobility. The step coverage influences the subthreshold swing (SS) and improved step coverage leads to small SS. In this paper, during the growth of poly-Si, the influence of different deposition conditions, such as temperature and gas source ratio between Si2H6 and SiH4, on the grain size and step coverage is investigated comprehensively. Grain size and step coverage are characterized using by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Precession Electron Diffraction (PED). It is found that as the decrease of deposition temperature, both the grain size and step coverage are improved. Compared to gas source SiH4, the employment of Si2H6 is beneficial in achieving large grain size to some degree and no further improvement can be obtained when the flow of Si2H6 is increased to a certain value. However, as-deposited poly-Si exhibits poorer step coverage using Si2H6 in contrast to SiH4. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

54,"Two magnets in relative motion interact through their dipolar fields, making individual magnetic moments dynamically adapt to the changes in the energy landscape and bringing about collective magnetization dynamics. Some of the energy of the system is irrevocably lost through various coupling mechanisms between the spin degrees of freedom and those of the underlying lattice, resulting in magnetic friction. In this work, we use micromagnetic simulations to study magnetic friction in a system of two thin ferromagnetic films containing quenched disorder mimicking a polycrystalline structure. We observe bursts of magnetic activity resulting from repeated domain wall pinning due to the disorder and subsequent depinning triggered by the dipolar interaction between the moving films. These domain wall jumps result in strong energy dissipation peaks.

65,"In this article, an exact solution is obtained to the time-dependent problem of a laminated orthotropic elastic cylindrical shell bonded to piezoelectric actuator and sensor incorporating interfacial diffusion and sliding subjected to electromechanical loadings. The state-space method is employed to solve this problem. Both the direct and the inverse piezoelectric effects of the piezoelectric material are investigated. The relaxation times and the transient electroelastic fields of displacements, stresses, and electric potential are calculated for three-layered and five-layered smart cylindrical shells. It is found that interfacial diffusion and sliding can effectively reduce the initial high stress concentrations as the evolution time is long enough. The derived solution can be used as benchmark results for various approximate shell theories and numerical methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"The evolving microstructural model of inelasticity (EMMI) previously developed as an improvement over the Bammann-Chiesa-Johnson (BCJ) material model is well known to describe the macroscopic nonlinear behavior of polycrystalline metals subjected to rapid external loads such as those encountered during high-rate events possibly near shock regime. The improved model accounts for deformation mechanisms such as thermally activated dislocation motion, generation, annihilation, and drag. It also accounts for the effects of material texture, recrystallization and grain growth and void nucleation, growth, and coalescence. The material incompatibilities, previously disregard in the aforementioned model, manifest themselves as structural misorientation where ductile failure often initiates are currently being considered. To proceed, the representation of material incompatibility is introduced into the EMMI model by incorporating the distribution of the geometrically necessary defects such as dislocations and disclination. To assess the newly proposed formulation, classical elastic solutions of benchmarks problems including far-field stress applied to the boundary of body containing a defect, e.g., voids, cracks, and dislocations, are used to compute the plastic velocity gradient for various states of the material in terms of assumed values of the internal state variables. The full-field state of the inelastic flow is then computed, and the spatial dependence of the dislocations and disclination density is determined. The predicted results shows good agreement with finding of dislocation theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,"In this paper, a systematic study of interdiffusion in (112)B oriented HgTe/CdTe superlattice (SL) structures has been undertaken in order to investigate the viability of employing SL as the absorber layer for very long wavelength infrared (VLWIR, 15 mu m and longer) applications in imaging focal plane arrays. Using numerical analysis, the optimal superlattice parameters and annealing time at the growth temperature (similar to 180 degrees C) are found, which result in better control of the cut-off wavelength in superlattice absorbers compared to the corresponding HgCdTe alloy absorber. Simulations show that, by appropriate adjustment of annealing time, it is possible to achieve the same cut-off wavelength with a larger HgTe well width while the sensitivity of the SL to well width variations remains at 15 meV/nm. Furthermore, the electron effective mass in a SL absorber is larger than a HgCdTe alloy absorber, which results in lower tunneling dark current. This work focuses on optimization of the superlattice absorber using the stationary Schrodinger equation. A complete photodetector device design based on a SL absorber structure will require a comprehensive numerical modeling using a Schrodinger-Poisson solver and drift-diffusion solver, or a combination of both approaches, which will be undertaken in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of the doublets was made on the basis of calculations of quadrupole splitting within the point charges model and taking possible polarization of oxygen ions into account. In two temperature ranges: T approximate to 370-510 K, corresponding to the structural phase transition, and at T approximate to 140-230 K, where strong anomalies of the magnetic and electrical properties were observed, the sharp changes in the hyperfine quadrupole splitting were observed.

73,"The expansion behavior and partitioning behavior of alloying elements in alpha+beta ->beta phase transformation of TC21 titanium alloy during continuous heating were investigated by dilatometer, optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The results show that the change in the length of the TC21 alloy during the continuous heating process results from the transformation of alpha phase with hexagonal close-packed to fl phase with body-centered cubic and macro volume variation which originates from redistribution of alpha-stabilizers and beta-stabilizers in the alloy during the continuous dissolution of a phase. It is found that the content of Al element decreases in the a phase with the dissolution of a phase, but it increases in the beta phase. Additionally, the increasing content of Al element leads to the decrease in volume of beta phase, which is also the main reason for shrinking of the alloy during alpha+beta ->beta phase transformation. However, Mo, Cr and Nb element diffuse to the alpha phase during alpha+beta ->beta phase transformation, so that the composition imbalance is found at the alpha/beta interface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,"In this study, the phase transformations and mechanical properties of a Cu-bearing high-strength low-carbon (HSLC) steel microalloyed with Nb were investigated. The phase transformations were studied by dilatometry and then the microstructures were evaluated. Mechanical properties were measured after various cycles of heat treatment. The results showed that the microstructure of this steel, at the cooling rates studied here, includes a mixture of bainite and martensite. The relatively high amounts of the substitutional elements such as Ni, as well as the low carbon content, resulted in the proximity of the bainite and martensite start temperatures. The B-s and M-s temperatures were determined to be 325 and 315 degrees C, respectively. This led to the formation of coalesced bainite in the microstructure. The maximum hardness of the alloy was obtained at the aging temperature of 450 degrees C. Additionally, the optimal combination of yield strength and impact energy was obtained by a single-stage aging treatment at 575 degrees C for 1 h. The reason for the toughness improvement can be attributed to the formation of the precipitated austenite between the martensitic lathes during the aging process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"While the light transmission of photonic crystals is characterized by the photonic band gap, the one of disordered photonic structures is typified by a multiplicity of transmission depths. The total transmission over a range of wavelengths is related to the width of such range, but also to the type of disorder. Less homogeneous disordered structures transmit more light than the ordered counterpart regardless of the wavelengths range width. More homogeneous disordered structures transmit more light than the ordered counterpart only above a certain value of the width. We studied this behaviour with a statistical analysis over 5000 permutations of structures for six wavelength widths and for two different homogeneity degrees (Shannon-Wiener index).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The evolution of macro-defects through their critical stages: as-received CdZnTe substrate, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) prep etch, Te/oxide desorption and stabilization at deposition temp in MBE chamber, thin (200 nm) HgCdTe deposition, and thick (> 4 mu m) MBE HgCdTe deposition, is analyzed. As-received CdZnTe wafers have small and large agglomerations of residual SiO2 and Al2O3 polishing grit. Additionally, macro-defects composed of organic residue, Cd(Zn)Te particulates, and additional impurities are also observed. The MBE preparation etch does not significantly alter the types of defects found on the wafer. The Te/oxide desorption process adds a small number of defects due to colloidal graphite particles. HgCdTe deposition introduces MBE spit defects and Hg droplet residue. There is significant movement of polishing grit and organic macro-defects during the various processing steps. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of MBE spit defects shows they are Cd rich with some of the spit defects containing high concentrations of impurities. The vertical gradient in Te concentration associated with the overgrowth on a metal rich MBE spit defect acts as an impurity pipe for Cu to travel toward the surface to become a 'hot spot' defect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is reported about optimisation of making three layer hybrids consisted of a steel plate, an adhesion layer based of uretdione powder coating material and a flexible component polyurethane in model experiments. Hybrid formation is performed in a compression moulding process. The adhesion layer and the polyurethane are modified to increase the hybrid bond strength. Peel test are conducted to quantitatively characterize the bond strength and an apparent energy release rate is calculated based on the peel force. For hybrids with widths of 2 mm polyurethane stripes it is possible to increase the apparent energy release rate for about 30 % to 16 N/mm in comparison with a hybrid with unmodified components. These hybrids have the same high bond strength level as the strongest hybrids reported in literature. Concluding the optimisation results are discussed related to their relevancy for the interpretation of the adhesion mechanisms in the interface between adhesion layer and polyurethane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AbstractJatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceaefamily) is a multipurpose plant with considerable potential in biodiesel production, and in cosmetic and medicinal uses. The part of J. curcas usually used is the oil obtained from its seeds, whereas the leaves generally represent the waste material. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and to preliminary investigate the biological activity of J. curcas leaves obtained from plants by a breeding program. To describe genomic structure, molecular markers were applied. For biological study, two genotypes (JA and JB) that are genetically divergent were selected by cluster analysis. A phytochemical analysis was carried out to characterize the chemical composition of the extracts, which resulted rich in biologically active compounds, whereas toxic phorbol esters were absent. Biological assays showed an antiproliferative effect on the Buffalo normal rat liver cell line (BRL-3A), with genotype B being more potent than that of the counterpart (JA). The purified compounds isolated did not show antiproliferative activity, suggesting that the effect observed was due to the phytocomplex and should involve several secondary metabolites.

The XRD, Raman, XPS, HRTEM, SEM and EDS mapping were used to characterize the composites and the results indicate that the Fe, C, O and N elements disperse uniformly in N-doped carbon/ amorphous iron oxide composite. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared composite was studied by the photodegradation of MB under solar light, indicated that the composites with nitrogen doped and amorphous structure significantly improved the photocatalytic activity. The amorphous structure of iron oxide played a key role in the improvement of photocatalytic activity. Based on photodegradaiton and photoluminescence spectra results, they were implied that the enhanced performance should be attributed to higher separation efficiency and a longer life time of photoproduced electron and hole pairs by the existence of amorphous structure.

In the case of the ZrB2-TiB2 binary system, a plot of log pO2vs. 1/T in the temperature range of 500-2000 K and another plot of pO2 (x1014) vs.xTiB2 for T=2000 K are made taking into account the two-extreme possibilities of no solubility and 100% solid solubility between ZrB2 and TiB2, respectively. A plot of log pCOvs. log pO2 is made for 1773 K for the systems ZrB2-SiC and ZrB2-B4C. It was found that the ZrB2-TiB2 ceramics does not have sufficient oxidation resistance in the temperature range of 500-2000 K. ZrB2 of ZrB2-SiC ceramics can be protected under 1 atmosphere oxygen or in air if the liquid borosilicate (with the chosen composition, 70% B2O3-30% SiO2), which is an intermediate product, provides a kinetic barrier to the continuation of oxidation by forming an impervious layer on the exposed surfaces. In contrast, the ZrB2-B4C ceramics does not produce the borosilicate upon oxidation. In view of the volatility of pure liquid B2O3, it is recommended that the ZrB2-B4C ceramics can be used at a lower temperature, perhaps below 1373 K, when the vapour pressure of B2O3 is significantly small.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

89,"Hermeticity is one of the most critical issues for infrared (IR) sensor packages, since any leakage will impair the functionality of the device. The issues associated with the premature failure of hermetic sealants were studied in detail, both by simulation as well as by experimentation. Alternate prospective hermetic sealant candidates for transistor outline IR sensor packages were identified and evaluated. Hermetic sealant options for wafer-level IR sensor packaging were also investigated, which involves wafer-level hermetic cum vacuum packaging. Metallic hermetic sealant is preferred for this approach, since it facilitates integration with the getter material. However, the primary challenge encountered here is the requirement of high processing temperature for the getter activation. An activated getter adsorbs active gases inside the volume of the packages, resulting in lower internal pressure. It was determined that appropriate micro-alloying of the getter is required to minimize the getter activation temperature. This is achieved by selective micro-alloying of the getter material, which induces more grain boundaries and thereby promotes in-depth diffusion even at lower activation temperature. Integration of getter material with all three different types of metallic wafer-level bonding mechanisms was investigated. This includes eutectic, diffusion and transient liquid-phase bonding mechanisms. Selection of an appropriate bonding mechanism and integration scheme depends on the corresponding structure, layout and temperature rating of the specific IR sensor devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed 1T-DRAM is made up of a silicon germanium storage region surrounding a silicon fin. When the two materials form a heterojunction, a potential well is formed by the band discontinuity which carriers can be stored. During the program operation, band-to-band tunneling and gate-induced drain leakage occur simultaneously due to the gate and drain bias. Because of these phenomena, the electron-hole pair occurs, and generated holes are stored in the storage region by potential well. The holes formed are positively charged within the storage region, which mitigates the depletion of the channel and improves the operating current. The proposed device realizes the memory operation by the difference of the operating current depending on the presence or absence of the stored holes. In this work, the device is analyzed and optimized in detail.

93,"Optimal user experience or flow is a theory with great impact on user experience. Promoting flow has become a competitive advantage for interactive systems, including rehabilitation. This can be achieved through an engaging interface that provides a rewarding experience and motivates the user to use the system again. This theory sustains that promoting a state of flow and improving task performance depends heavily on the balance between the challenges posed by the system and the skills deployed by the user. We further claim that balanced mental and motor skills demanded by the task improve flow and task performance. This paper presents an experiment supporting these claims. For this, we built two movement-interaction rehabilitation systems called SIBMER and Macoli (arm in Nahuatl). Both systems have two versions, one with a balanced load of mental and motor skills, and the other with an unbalanced one. Both versions are compared in terms of their potential to promote the state of flow and to improve task performance. Results show that a balance demand of mental and motor skills promotes flow, independently of the task complexity. Likewise, the experiment shows a correlation between flow and performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, calculations of the interface adhesion energy and Mulliken mean populations show that the aGNR/unilaminar NiO interface has good interface stability. Second, the current-voltage characteristics and the micro formation process of conducting filaments of graphene/NiO/graphene resistive random access memory with resistance layers of different widths are studied. The comprehensive performance of the device is fully exploited, and its storage window can satisfy the requirement of data storage when the width of the resistance layer is 17.6 angstrom. Finally, an increase in the concentration of excess oxygen causes an increase in power consumption and a decline in the current drive capacity, while the stability of the device is improved; moreover, the size of the storage window decreases but still meets the requirement of data storage. In summary, the storage performance is effectively improved by excess oxygen concentration of 3.82%.

97,"Nano-crystalline CrB2 and Cr-B-O-N films with various nitrogen flow ratios were deposited using a pulsed direct current (PDC) magnetron sputtering technique. By means of electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and atomic force microscopy, the influences of the nitrogen flow ratio on the phase constituents and microstructures of CrB2/Cr-B-O-N films were systematically investigated. Mechanical properties including the hardness and elastic modulus were explored by a nano-indentation tester. On increasing the nitrogen flow ratio, the N and O contents in films increased linearly and tended to become saturated, whereas the Cr and B contents decreased. With an increasing nitrogen flow ratio, the microstructure changed from a dense columnar structure to a bulky columnar structure, and then to a fine and stacked dense structure. Meanwhile, the deposition rate also changed with increasing nitrogen flow ratio, owing to the changes in structure. Crystalline phases were observed by the XRD and HRTEM analyses, consisting of several nanometer-size crystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix. The dramatically decreased hardness was attributed to the large fractional volume of the softer amorphous phase BN in films.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"It is known that application areas of plastics can be enlarged by imparting special features such as higher electrical and thermal conductivity by surface metallization of these materials. Still, there are very limited studies on the metal deposition on polymeric substrates by thermal spray process due to various limitations and problems associated with this aspect, although some reports are available on the fabrication and characterization of bonding layers using low melt temperature materials. With this background, this study was taken up with the objectives of deposition of 309L stainless steel on some polymeric substrates (PP, Nylon 66 and PVC) by electric arc thermal spray process through a prior development of a bond coating. This bond coating was based on epoxy resin/micro silica with scattered and packed metal particles anchored over it, which changed the nature of the substrate surface creating a favorable topology for adhesion and scattering of the sprayed particles. Coatings having an average thickness of 129.06 mu m of stainless steel and 259.06 mu m of bonding layer (epoxy/micro silica) were obtained over a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) substrate, which had the smaller difference of coefficient of thermal expansion with the bond coat. Obtained coating showed good electrical conductivity value. This kind of favorable metallization of plastics could expand its application areas and might be potential candidate to replace expensive metallic or ceramic materials in special applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"Structured materials can be a progressive alternative to commonly used flat sheets. There is an enormous range of possibilities for using structured sheet metals due to their better stability. However, the effective use of these materials as well as their implementation in production requires precise knowledge about specific properties of structured sheet metals. The aim of this work is to obtain new knowledge about stiffness and stability during the deformation of this material. The structured sheet metals were investigated by means of buckling tests. The steel type investigated is a commonly used deep-drawing steel DC04. Six types of structure arrangements were compared to non-structured (flat) specimens as a reference. The influence of the type of structure arrangement as well as the deformation speed on the mechanical properties was investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
