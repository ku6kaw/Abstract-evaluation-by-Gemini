This bulk carbon-nanotube material retains the intrinsic properties of individual SWNTs, such as high surface area flexibility and electrical conductivity. By controlling the fabrication process, it is possible to fabricate a wide range of solids in numerous shapes and structures. This dense SWNT material is advantageous for numerous applications, and here we demonstrate its use as flexible heaters as well as supercapacitor electrodes for compact energy-storage devices.",10.1038/nmat1782,0,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Salahuddin, S; Dattat, S",Use of negative capacitance to provide voltage amplification for low power nanoscale devices,"It is well-known that conventional field effect transistors (FETs) require a change in the channel potential of at least 60 mV at 300 K to effect a change in the current by a factor of 10, and this minimum subthreshold slope S puts a fundamental lower limit on the operating voltage and hence the power dissipation in standard FET-based switches. Here, we suggest that by replacing the standard insulator with a ferroelectric insulator of the right thickness it should be possible to implement a step-up voltage transformer that will amplify the gate voltage thus leading to values of S lower than 60 mV/decade and enabling low voltage/low power operation. The voltage transformer action can be understood intuitively as the result of an effective negative capacitance provided by the ferroelectric capacitor that arises from an internal positive feedback that in principle could be obtained from other microscopic mechanisms as well. Unlike other proposals to reduce S, this involves no change in the basic physics of the FET and thus does not affect its current drive or impose other restrictions.",10.1021/nl071804g,1,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

To emulate this fundamental process in electronic devices, we developed diffusive Ag-in-oxide memristors with a temporal response during and after stimulation similar to that of the synaptic Ca2+ dynamics. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle dynamics simulations both demonstrate that Ag atoms disperse under electrical bias and regroup spontaneously under zero bias because of interfacial energy minimization, closely resembling synaptic influx and extrusion of Ca2+, respectively.

J,"Xiu, ZM; Zhang, QB; Puppala, HL; Colvin, VL; Alvarez, PJJ",Negligible Particle-Specific Antibacterial Activity of Silver Nanoparticles,"For nearly a decade, researchers have debated the mechanisms by which AgNPs exert toxicity to bacteria and other organisms. The most elusive question has been whether the AgNPs exert direct ""particle-specific"" effects beyond the known antimicrobial activity of released silver ions (Ag+). Here, we infer that Ag+ is the definitive molecular toxicant. We rule out direct particle-specific biological effects by showing the lack of toxicity of AgNPs when synthesized and tested under strictly anaerobic conditions that preclude Ag(0) oxidation and Ag+ release. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the toxicity of various AgNPs (PEG- or PVP- coated, of three different sizes each) accurately follows the dose response pattern of E. coli exposed to Ag+ (added as AgNO3). Surprisingly, E. coli survival was stimulated by relatively low (sublethal) concentration of all tested AgNPs and AgNO3 (at 3-8 mu g/L Ag+, or 12-31% of the minimum lethal concentration (MLC)), suggesting a hormetic response that would be counterproductive to antimicrobial applications. Overall, this work suggests that AgNP morphological properties known to affect antimicrobial activity are indirect effectors that primarily influence Ag+ release. Accordingly, antibacterial activity could be controlled (and environmental impacts could be mitigated) by modulating Ag+ release, possibly through manipulation of oxygen availability, particle size, shape, and/or type of coating.",10.1021/nl301934w,4,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Crystalline silicon becomes amorphous during lithium insertion, confirming previous studies. Highly lithiated amorphous silicon suddenly crystallizes at 50 mV to form a new lithium-silicon phase, identified as Li15Si4. This phase is the fully lithiated phase for silicon at room temperature, not Li21Si5 as is widely believed. Delithiation of the Li15Si4 phase results in the formation of amorphous silicon.

J,"Kannan, N; Sundaram, MM",Kinetics and mechanism of removal of methylene blue by adsorption on various carbons - a comparative study,"The kinetics and mechanism of methylene blue adsorption on commercial activated carbon (CAC) and indigenously prepared activated carbons from bamboo dust, coconut shell, groundnut shell, rice husk, and straw, have been studied. The effects of various experimental parameters have been investigated using a batch adsorption technique to obtain information on treating effluents from the dye industry. The extent of dye removal increased with decrease in the initial concentration of the dye and particle size of the adsorbent and also increased with increase in contact time, amount of adsorbent used and the initial pH of the solution. Adsorption data were modeled using the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms and first order kinetic equations. The kinetics of adsorption were found to be first order with regard to intra-particle diffusion rate. The adsorption capacities of indigenous activated carbons have been compared with that of the commercial activated carbon. The results indicate that such carbons could be employed as low cost alternatives to commercial activated carbon in wastewater treatment for the removal of colour and dyes.

One limitation of electrochemical capacitors is their low energy density and for this reason, there is widespread interest in pseudocapacitive materials that use Faradaic reactions to store charge. One candidate pseudocapacitive material is orthorhombic MoO3 (alpha-MoO3), a layered compound with a high theoretical capacity for lithium (279 mA h g(-1) or 1,005 C g(-1)). Here, we report on the properties of reduced alpha-MoO3-x(R-MoO3-x) and compare it with fully oxidized alpha-MoO3 (F-MoO3). The introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a larger interlayer spacing that promotes faster charge storage kinetics and enables the alpha-MoO3 structure to be retained during the insertion and removal of Li ions. The higher specific capacity of the R-MoO3-x is attributed to the reversible formation of a significant amount of Mo4+ following lithiation. This study underscores the potential importance of incorporating oxygen vacancies into transition metal oxides as a strategy for increasing the charge storage kinetics of redox-active materials.",10.1038/NMAT4810,7,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Among zwitterionic materials, pCB is unique due to its abundant functional groups for the convenient immobilization of biomolecules. pCB can also be prepared in a hydrolyzable form as cationic pCB esters, which can kill bacteria or condense DNA. The hydrolysis of cationic pCB esters into nonfouling zwitterionic groups will lead to the release of killed microbes or the irreversible unpackaging of DNA.

We find that the doubly degenerate E-2g optical mode splits in two components: one polarized along the strain and the other perpendicular. This splits the G peak into two bands, which we call G(+) and G(-), by analogy with the effect of curvature on the nanotube G peak. Both peaks redshift with increasing strain and their splitting increases, in excellent agreement with first-principles calculations. Their relative intensities are found to depend on light polarization, which provides a useful tool to probe the graphene crystallographic orientation with respect to the strain. The 2D and 2D(') bands also redshift but do not split for small strains. We study the Gruneisen parameters for the phonons responsible for the G, D, and D-' peaks.

Although visually transparent, graphene is an excellent sunlight absorber, achieving 2.3% visible light absorbance in just 3.3 angstrom thickness. TMD monolayers also hold potential as sunlight absorbers, and may enable ultrathin photovoltaic (PV) devices due to their semi-conducting character. In this work, we show that the three TMD monolayers MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2 can absorb up to 5-10% incident sunlight in a thickness of less than 1 nm, thus achieving 1 order of magnitude higher sunlight absorption than GaAs and Si. We further study PV devices based on just two stacked monolayers: (1) a Schottky barrier solar cell between MoS2 and graphene and (2) an excitonic solar cell based on a MoS2/WS2 bilayer.

The composite was prepared by conventional ceramic processing. The real part of the permittivity increases with increasing temperature, which is attributed to the shortened relaxation time of electron polarization, and the imaginary part also increases which is ascribed to the increasing electrical conductivity of the carbon fibers. The effect of frequency is found in reflection coefficient and absorption coefficient, and the corresponding mechanisms for the effect are proposed. Results indicate that the composite has good electromagnetic interference shielding property.

Using a simple and inexpensive technique, we recorded surface plasmon resonance (SPR) scattering images and SPR absorption spectra from both colloidal gold nanoparticles and from gold nanoparticles conjugated to monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies after incubation in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCaT) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). Colloidal gold nanoparticles are found in dispersed and aggregated forms within the cell cytoplasm and provide anatomic labeling information, but their uptake is nonspecific for malignant cells. The anti-EGFR antibody conjugated nanoparticles specifically and homogeneously bind to the surface of the cancer type cells with 600% greater affinity than to the noncancerous cells. This specific and homogeneous binding is found to give a relatively sharper SPR absorption band with a red shifted maximum compared to that observed when added to the noncancerous cells.

A t value between 0.8 and 1.0 is favorable for cubic perovskite structure, and larger (>1) or smaller (<0.8) values of tolerance factor usually result in nonperovskite structures. CH(NH2)(2)PbI3 (FAPbI(3)) can exist in the perovskite a-phase (black phase) with good photovoltaic properties. However, it has a large tolerance factor and is more stable in the hexagonal delta(H)-phase (yellow phase), with delta(H)-to-alpha phase-transition temperature higher than room temperature. On the other hand, CsPbI3 is stabilized to an orthorhombic structure (delta(o)-phase) at room temperature due to its small tolerance factor. We find that, by alloying FAPbI(3) with CsPbI3, the effective tolerance factor can be tuned, and the stability of the photo active a-phase of the mixed solid-state perovskite alloys FA(1-x)C(sx)bI(3) is enhanced, which is in agreement with our first-principles calculations. Thin films of the FA(0.85)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) perovskite alloy demonstrate much improved stability in a high-humidity environment; this contrasts significantly with the pure FAPbI(3) film for which the alpha-to-delta(H) phase transition (associated with yellowing appearance) is accelerated by humidity environment. Due to phase stabilization, the FA(0.86)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) solid-state alloy showed better solar cell performance and device stability than its FAPbI(3) counterparts.

Here, we report that polyampholytes, polymers bearing randomly dispersed cationic and anionic repeat groups, form tough and viscoelastic hydrogels with multiple mechanical properties. The randomness makes ionic bonds of a wide distribution of strength. The strong bonds serve as permanent crosslinks, imparting elasticity, whereas the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. These physical hydrogels of supramolecular structure can be tuned to change multiple mechanical properties over wide ranges by using diverse ionic combinations. This polyampholyte approach is synthetically simple and dramatically increases the choice of tough hydrogels for applications.",10.1038/NMAT3713,25,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Janotti, A; Van de Walle, CG",Native point defects in ZnO,"We have performed a comprehensive first-principles investigation of native point defects in ZnO based on density functional theory within the local density approximation (LDA) as well as the LDA+U approach for overcoming the band-gap problem. Oxygen deficiency, manifested in the form of oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials, has long been invoked as the source of the commonly observed unintentional n-type conductivity in ZnO. However, contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find that native point defects are very unlikely to be the cause of unintentional n-type conductivity. Oxygen vacancies, which have most often been cited as the cause of unintentional doping, are deep rather than shallow donors and have high formation energies in n-type ZnO (and are therefore unlikely to form). Zinc interstitials are shallow donors, but they also have high formation energies in n-type ZnO and are fast diffusers with migration barriers as low as 0.57 eV; they are therefore unlikely to be stable. Zinc antisites are also shallow donors but their high formation energies (even in Zn-rich conditions) render them unlikely to be stable under equilibrium conditions. We have, however, identified a different low-energy atomic configuration for zinc antisites that may play a role under nonequilibrium conditions such as irradiation. Zinc vacancies are deep acceptors and probably related to the frequently observed green luminescence; they act as compensating centers in n-type ZnO. Oxygen interstitials have high formation energies; they can occur as electrically neutral split interstitials in semi-insulating and p-type materials or as deep acceptors at octahedral interstitial sites in n-type ZnO. Oxygen antisites have very high formation energies and are unlikely to exist in measurable concentrations under equilibrium conditions. Based on our results for migration energy barriers, we calculate activation energies for self-diffusion and estimate defect-annealing temperatures. Our results provide a guide to more refined experimental studies of point defects in ZnO and their influence on the control of p-type doping.",10.1103/PhysRevB.76.165202,26,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

Solvent effects can be treated using continuum models or by combining quantum chemical calculations with molecular dynamics or Monte-Carlo simulations. MOLCAS is especially adapted to treat systems with a complex electronic structure, where the simplest quantum chemical models do not work. These features together with the inclusion of relativistic effects makes it possible to treat with good accuracy systems including atoms from the entire periodic system.

In this work, the scientific and technical impact of these materials is contrasted with the various families of ""soft"" and ""hard"" PZTs. On the scientific front, the intrinsic nature of the dielectric and piezoelectric properties are presented in relation to their respective Curie temperatures (T-C) and the existence of a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Analogous to PZT, enhanced properties are noted for MPB compositions in the (Na,Bi)TiO3-BaTiO3 and ternary system with (K,Bi)TiO3, but offer properties significantly lower. The consequences of a ferroelectric to antiferroelectric transition well below T (C) further limits their usefulness. Though comparable with respect to T (C), the high levels of piezoelectricity reported in the (K,Na)NbO3 family are the result of enhanced polarizability associated with the orthorhombic-tetragonal polymorphic phase transition being compositionally shifted downward. As expected, the properties are strongly temperature dependent, while degradation occurs through the thermal cycling between the two distinct ferroelectric domain states. Extrinsic contributions arising from domains and domain wall mobility were determined using high field strain and polarization measurements. The concept of ""soft"" and ""hard"" lead-free piezoelectrics were discussed in relation to donor and acceptor modified PZTs, respectively.

Hydrocarbon, siloxane, and fluorocarbon surfaces were prepared. The surfaces contain posts of different sizes, shapes, and separations. Surfaces containing square posts with X-Y dimensions of 32 mu m and less exhibited ultrahydrophobic behavior with high advancing and receding water contact angles. Water droplets moved very easily on these surfaces and rolled off of slightly tilted surfaces. Contact angles were independent of the post height from 20 to 140 mu m and independent of surface chemistry. Water droplets were pinned on surfaces containing square posts with larger dimensions. Increasing the distance between posts and changing the shape of the posts from square to staggered rhombus, star, or indented square caused increases in receding contact angles. We ascribe these contact angle increases to decreases in the contact length and increases in tortuosity of the three-phase contact line.

Stratasys Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a typical RP process that can fabricate prototypes out of ABS plastic. To predict the mechanical behavior of FDM parts, it is critical to understand the material properties of the raw FDM process material, and the effect that FDM build parameters have on anisotropic material properties. This paper characterizes the properties of ABS parts fabricated by the FDM 1650. Using a Design of Experiment (DOE) approach, the process parameters of FDM, such as raster orientation, air gap, bead width, color, and model temperature were examined. Tensile strengths and compressive strengths of directionally fabricated specimens were measured and compared with injection molded FDM ABS P400 material, For the FDM parts made with a 0.003 inch overlap between roads, the typical tensile strength ranged between 65 and 72 percent of the strength of injection molded ABS P400.

J,"Kokubo, T; Kim, HM; Kawashita, M",Novel bioactive materials with different mechanical properties,"Some ceramics, such as Bioglass((R)), sintered hydroxyapatite, and glass-ceramic A-W, spontaneously bond to living bone. They are called bioactive materials and are already clinically used as important bone substitutes. However, compared with human cortical bone, they have lower fracture toughness and higher elastic moduli. Therefore, it is desirable to develop bioactive materials with improved mechanical properties. All the bioactive materials mentioned above form a bone-like apatite layer on their surfaces in the living body, and bond to bone through this apatite layer. The formation of bone-like apatite on artificial material is induced by functional groups, such as Si-OH, Ti-OH, Zr-OH, Nb-OH, Ta-OH, -COOH, and PO4H2. These groups have specific structures revealing negatively charge, and induce apatite formation via formations of an amorphous calcium compound, e.g., calcium silicate, calcium titanate, and amorphous calcium phosphate. These fundamental findings provide methods for preparing new bioactive materials with different mechanical properties. Tough bioactive materials can be prepared by the chemical treatment of metals and ceramics that have high fracture toughness, e.g., by the NaOH and heat treatments of titanium metal, titanium alloys, and tantalum metal, and by H3PO4 treatment of tetragonal zirconia. Soft bioactive materials can be synthesized by the sol-gel process, in which the bioactive silica or titania is polymerized with a flexible polymer, such as polydimethylsiloxane or polytetramethyloxide, at the molecular level to form an inorganic-organic nano-hybrid. The biomimetic process has been used to deposit nano-sized bone-like apatite on fine polymer fibers, which were textured into a three-dimensional knit framework. This strategy is expected to ultimately lead to bioactive composites that have a bone-like structure and, hence, bone-like mechanical properties. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A sharp resonance of nearly perfect transmission can arise within a broad absorption profile. These features show remarkable potential for slow light, novel sensors and low-loss metamaterials. In nanophotonics, plasmonic structures enable large field strengths within small mode volumes. Therefore, combining EIT with nanoplasmonics would pave the way towards ultracompact sensors with extremely high sensitivity.

A dipole antenna with a large radiatively broadened linewidth is coupled to an underlying quadrupole antenna, of which the narrow linewidth is solely limited by the fundamental non-radiative Drude damping.

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to breaking the in-plane symmetry of graphene with electric fields on AB-stacked bilayers(1,2) or stacked van der Waals heterostructures(3,4). In contrast, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers are semiconductors with intrinsic in-plane asymmetry, leading to direct electronic bandgaps, distinctive optical properties and great potential in optoelectronics(5,6). Apart from their in-plane inversion asymmetry, an additional degree of freedom allowing spin manipulation can be induced by breaking the out-of-plane mirror symmetry with external electric fields(7,8) or, as theoretically proposed, with an asymmetric out-of-plane structural configuration(9). Here, we report a synthetic strategy to grow Janus monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides breaking the out-of-plane structural symmetry.

J,"Tsai, KY; Tsai, MH; Yeh, JW",Sluggish diffusion in Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni high-entropy alloys,"Sluggish diffusion kinetics is an important contributor to the outstanding properties of high-entropy alloys. However, the diffusion kinetics in high-entropy alloys has never been probed directly. Here, the diffusion couple method was used to measure the diffusion parameters of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni in ideal-solution-like Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni alloys. These parameters were compared with those in various conventional face-centered cubic metals. The results show that the diffusion coefficients in the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni alloys are indeed lower than those in the reference metals. Correspondingly, the activation energies in the high-entropy alloys are higher than those in the reference metals. Moreover, the trend of the normalized activation energy is positively related to the number of composing elements in the matrix. A quasi-chemical model is proposed to analyze the fluctuation of lattice potential energy in different matrices and to explain the observed trend in activation energies. Greater fluctuation of lattice potential energy produces more significant atomic traps and blocks, leading to higher activation energies, and thus accounts for the sluggish diffusion in high-entropy alloys.

The important length scale in the problem is identified to be the ratio of the surface elastic modulus to the elastic modulus of the bulk. In general, the non-dimensional difference in the elastic properties from continuum predictions (D - D-c)/D-c is found to scale as alpha S/Eh, where alpha is a constant which depends on the geometry of the structural element considered, S is a surface elastic constant, E is a bulk elastic modulus and h a length defining the size of the structural element. Thus, the quantity S/E is identified as a material length scale for elasticity of nanosized structures.

For this reason surface roughness has been the subject of experimental and theoretical investigations for many decades. The real surface geometry is so complicated that a finite number of parameters cannot provide a full description. If the number of parameters used is increased, a more accurate description can be obtained. This is one of the reasons for introducing new parameters for surface evaluation. Surface roughness parameters are normally categorised into three groups according to its functionality. These groups are defined as amplitude parameters, spacing parameters, and hybrid parameters. This paper illustrates the definitions and the mathematical formulae for about 59 of the roughness parameters. This collection of surface roughness parameter was used in a new software computer vision package called Surf Vision developed by the authors. In the package, these definitions were extended to calculate the 3D surface topography of different specimens. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study set out to investigate the effect of mean pore size, in a series of collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffolds with mean pore sizes ranging from 85 mu m to 325 mu m, on osteoblast adhesion and early stage proliferation up to 7 days post-seeding. The results show that cell number was highest in scaffolds with the largest pore size of 325 mu m. However, an early additional peak in cell number was also seen in scaffolds with a mean pore size of 120 mu m at time points up to 48 h post-seeding. This is consistent with previous studies from our laboratory which suggest that scaffold specific surface area plays an important role on initial cell adhesion. This early peak disappears following cell proliferation indicating that while specific surface area may be important for initial cell adhesion, improved cell migration provided by scaffolds with pores above 300 mu m overcomes this effect. An added advantage of the larger pores is a reduction in cell aggregations that develop along the edges of the scaffolds. Ultimately scaffolds with a mean pore size of 325 mu m were deemed optimal for bone tissue engineering. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors.

This was enabled by the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids with a controlled size via a two-step spin-coating procedure. Spin-coating of a solution of CH3NH3I with different concentrations follows the spin-coating of PbI2, and the cuboid size of CH3NH3PbI3 is found to strongly depend on the concentration of CH3NH3I. Light-harvesting efficiency and charge-carrier extraction are significantly affected by the cuboid size. Under simulated one-sun illumination, average efficiencies of 16.4% (s.d. +/- 0.35), 16.3% (s.d. +/- 0.44) and 13.5% (s.d. +/- 0.34) are obtained from solutions of CH3NH3I with concentrations of 0.038 M, 0.050 M and 0.063 M, respectively. By controlling the size of the cuboids of CH3NH3PbI3 during their growth, we achieved the best efficiency of 17.01% with a photocurrent density of 21.64 mA cm(-2), open-circuit photovoltage of 1.056 V and fill factor of 0.741.",10.1038/NNANO.2014.181,70,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

Mixed SAMs presenting different functional groups were prepared for screening using a synthetic protocol based on the reaction of organic amines with a SAM terminated by interchain carboxylic anhydride groups. Surfaces that presented derivatives of oligo(sarcosine), N-acetylpiperazine, and permethylated sorbitol groups were particularly effective in resisting the adsorption of proteins. Incorporation of these groups into single-component SAMs resulted in surfaces that are comparable to (but slightly less good than) single-component SAMs that present oligo(ethylene glycol) in their ability to resist the adsorption of proteins. In the group of surfaces examined, those that resisted the adsorption of proteins had the following properties: they were hydrophilic; they contained groups that were hydrogen-bond acceptors but not hydrogen-bond donors; and they were overall electrically neutral.",10.1021/la010384m,71,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

However, to date, there has been little success in the development of high-performance solid-state batteries using these exceptional materials, the major challenge being the high solid-solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and electrode materials. In this work, we effectively address the large interfacial impedance between a lithium metal anode and the garnet electrolyte using ultrathin aluminium oxide (Al2O3) by atomic layer deposition. Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLCZN) is the garnet composition of choice in this work due to its reduced sintering temperature and increased lithium ion conductivity. A significant decrease of interfacial impedance, from 1,710 Omega cm(2) to 1 Omega cm(2), was observed at room temperature, effectively negating the lithium metal/garnet interfacial impedance. Experimental and computational results reveal that the oxide coating enables wetting of metallic lithium in contact with the garnet electrolyte surface and the lithiated-alumina interface allows effective lithium ion transport between the lithium metal anode and garnet electrolyte.

Some ZnO nanoparticles exhibit very strong blue emissions, the intensity of which first increase and then decrease with annealing. These visible emissions exhibit strong and interesting excitation dependences: 1) the optimal excitation energy for blue emissions is near the bandgap energy, but the effective excitation can obviously be lower, even 420 nm (2.95 eV < E-g = 3.26 eV); in contrast, green emissions can be excited only by energies larger than the bandgap energy; and, 2) there are several fixed emitting wavelengths at 415, 440, 455 and 488 nm in the blue wave band, which exhibit considerable stability in different excitation and annealing conditions. Mechanisms for blue emissions from ZnO are proposed with interstitial-zinc-related defect levels as initial states.

The formation of different types of oxygen containing functional groups in GO, and their influences on its structure were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), zeta potential analysis and Raman spectroscopy. XRD studies showed a disruption of the graphitic AS stacking order during the increase in oxidation levels. XPS analysis revealed the formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at lower oxidation levels and epoxide groups at higher oxidation levels. The influence of the oxidation degree on the properties of GO was evaluated by zeta potential analysis, which showed a linear increase in the zeta potential with increasing oxidation levels. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed that increasing oxidation levels results in a transition from a crystalline to an amorphous structure. The electrochemical properties of GO is highly influenced by the variation in degree of oxidation. Our results suggest that the properties of GO can be tuned by varying the oxidation degree, which may pave the way to new developments in the GO-based applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The steel with higher martensite fraction has a lower elastic limit, a higher yield strength and a higher tensile strength. These effects are attributed to the higher second phase fraction and the inhomogeneous transformation strain accommodation in ferrite. The latter assumption is analyzed using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). We quantify orientation gradients, pattern quality and GND density variations at ferrite-ferrite and ferrite-martensite interfaces. Using 3D EBSD, additional information is obtained about the effect of grain volume and of martensite distribution on strain accommodation. Two methods are demonstrated to calculate the GND density from the EBSD data based on the kernel average misorientation measure and on the dislocation density tensor, respectively.

In this article, we review the main processing routes that can be used for the fabrication of macroporous ceramics with tailored microstructure and chemical composition. Emphasis is given to versatile and simple approaches that allow one to control the microstructural features that ultimately determine the properties of the macroporous material. Replica, sacrificial template, and direct foaming techniques are described and compared in terms of microstructures and mechanical properties that can be achieved. Finally, directions to future investigations on the processing of macroporous ceramics are proposed.",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2006.01044.x,95,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes
J,"Sevilla, M; Fuertes, AB",The production of carbon materials by hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose,"Highly functionalized carbonaceous materials were produced by means of the hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose at temperatures in the 220-250 degrees C range. The formation of this material follows essentially the path of a dehydration process, similar to that previously observed for the hydrothermal transformation of saccharides such as glucose, sucrose or starch. The materials so formed are composed of agglomerates of carbonaceous microspheres (size similar to 2-5 mu m), as evidenced by SEM. The combination of the results of the elemental analysis with that obtained by different spectroscopic techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and XPS) has allowed us to inferred that, from a chemical point of view, the solid product consists of small clusters of condensed benzene rings that form stable groups with oxygen in the core (i.e. ether, quinone, pyrone), whereas the shell possesses more reactive/hydrophilic oxygen functionalities (i.e. hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic, ester).

New metallurgical processing might offer the possibility of overcoming this. Here we report that austenitic 316L stainless steels additively manufactured via a laser powder-bed-fusion technique exhibit a combination of yield strength and tensile ductility that surpasses that of conventional 316L steels. High strength is attributed to solidification-enabled cellular structures, low-angle grain boundaries, and dislocations formed during manufacturing, while high uniform elongation correlates to a steady and progressive work-hardening mechanism regulated by a hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure, with length scales spanning nearly six orders of magnitude. In addition, solute segregation along cellular walls and low-angle grain boundaries can enhance dislocation pinning and promote twinning. This work demonstrates the potential of additive manufacturing to create alloys with unique microstructures and high performance for structural applications.",10.1038/NMAT5021,97,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The sensor responses are linear for concentrations of sub ppm to hundreds of ppm with detection limits of 44 ppb for NO2 and 262 ppb for nitrotoluene. The time is on the order of seconds for the detection response and minutes for the recovery. The variation of the sensitivity is less than 6% for all of the tested devices, comparable with commercial metal oxide or polymer microfilm sensors while retaining the room-temperature high sensitivity of the SWNT transistor sensors and manufacturability of the commercial sensors. The extended detection capability from gas to organic vapors is attributed to direct charge transfer on individual semiconducting SWNT conductivity with additional electron hopping effects on intertube conductivity through physically adsorbed molecules between SWNTs.",10.1021/nl034220x,99,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no
