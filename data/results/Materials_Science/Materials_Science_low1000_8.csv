J,"Eun, J; McCartney, JS; Znidarcic, D",Assessment of approaches to obtain ebullition pressures for organophilic clay blankets,"The objective of this study is to compare two experimental approaches to characterize the ebullition pressure (or air-entry suction) of initially water-saturated organophilic clay blankets. The first is an indirect approach using the water-retention curve (WRC) and the second is a direct approach using ebullition experiments. TheWRC along with the hydraulic conductivity of organophilic clay blankets in saturated and unsaturated conditions were measured using a flexible-wall permeameter with suction-saturation control. This device was also adapted to measure the ebullition pressure and the air permeability. The comparison of the experimental approaches was performed on organophilic clay blanket specimens in different initial conditions (unrinsed and rinsed to remove loose fines) under high and low effective confining stresses (20 and 5 kPa). The indirect estimates of air-entry suction from the WRC were similar to those obtained from the ebullition tests. This good agreement between the two approaches may add flexibility to the development of design specifications for capping systems. The hydraulic properties were found to be sensitive to rinsing and effective stress, with greater hydraulic conductivity and air permeability for the rinsed specimen due to the removal of fines, and greater air-entry suctions for specimens under higher effective stress.",10.1680/jgein.19.00042,0,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no

A linear Gm-cell is proposed and used as a key building block in design of the filter. The linear Gm-cell employs a circuit technique to reduce the nonlinearity of the source follower (SF) stage resulting from unmatched signal swings at the gate and source terminals of the input transistor. The Gm-cell was used to build a biquad bloc, which was utilized to construct a 3rd-order Butterworth low pass filter. The proposed filter consists of a buffer and a biquad stage to form the 3rd-order transfer function. The simulation results of the filter for bandwidth of 10MHz show that the IIP3 of the filter was equal to 29.5 dBm.

A simple, noninvasive, in situ acoustic technique was developed to monitor wall loss due to corrosion in a model molten-salt vessel, operating at 500 degrees C to 600 degrees C. This work demonstrated the feasibility of high-temperature corrosion monitoring experimentally, and validated the concept with physical and microstructural analysis, modeling, and numerical simulations. The results of this work could form the basis for the development of a general-purpose, extended-range acoustic monitoring and inspection technique for corrosion at high temperatures (with expected upper range of approximately 900 degrees C), which does not currently exist.

J,"Gallion, JR; Case, AG; Zoughi, R",Millimeter Wave Detection of Surface-Breaking Cracks in Steel and Aluminum under Severe Corrosion and Paint,"Many components of critical and heavily utilized infrastructure, such as ships, planes, bridges, and so on, are operating at or beyond their designed lifetime. Replacement is no longer an option, and ""retirement for cause"" is the current approach to maintenance and replacement. Consequently, there is an ever-increasing demand for efficient and robust nondestructive testing (NDT) methods and techniques that can determine the physical health of these structures. Large structures, which are primarily made of metals, either steel or aluminum, are susceptible to in-service corrosion and stress-induced cracking. Stress-induced cracks, particularly in heavily corroded steel members used in bridges, railroads, storage tanks, and similar structures, are difficult to detect using many of the standard NDT methods, increasing the risk of not being able to detect an existing crack. Microwave signals readily penetrate through dielectric materials such as paint and corrosion byproducts (such as rust) and can interact with the underlying metal, rendering cracks detectable. In this paper, the implementation of a microwave imaging system that utilizes the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) approach to detect surface-breaking cracks (in the form of manufactured narrow notches) in steel and aluminum samples under heavy corrosion and corrosion-preventive paints is investigated. In addition, the influence of signal polarization direction relative to crack direction and the cyclical severity of corrosion inducement are investigated. The resulting SAR images are analyzed and compared to numerical simulations to identify the real-world capabilities and theoretical limitations of the technique.",,5,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

B0901) - an important bridge connection in the city of Vienna, Austria - was built between 1962 and 1964. Around 68,000 vehicles a day are crossing the link over the Danube channel every day. The bridge chain was last rebuilt in the course of the extension of the subway line U6 in the early 1990s. In recent decades, due to the importance of traffic and to avoid traffic delays caused by construction work only punctual, absolutely necessary repair work was carried out. However, the extensive loading and the associated state of preservation required, after 50 years of use, a comprehensive bridge repair with partial upgrading. Due to the large number of different bridge systems and building materials of the bridge chain, extensive structural and traffic measures were required to maintain this essential connection. The construction work on the Gurtelbridge, which began in the fall of 2012, was completed on schedule in the fall of 2015 despite the most adverse circumstances surrounding the construction work.

Thanks to technological advances, today's educators and learners have ubiquitous and on-demand access to information. Technology has made it possible for us to communicate and share information effortlessly from anywhere in the world. However, the availability of vast amounts of heterogeneous educational content will not be useful unless we search, retrieve and integrate it, creating interoperable educational environments. The current challenges to integrating educational content arise from its distribution over several repositories. This research proposes AIREH (architecture for intelligent retrieval of educational content from heterogeneous environments), for the retrieval of digital content through agent-based virtual organizations. This flexible architecture facilitates the search for and integration of heterogeneous content through an information retrieval model that involves both case-based reasoning and federated search. Moreover, AIREH is based on an adaptive organization model for distributed planning, thanks to which, it manages open systems flexibly, dynamically, and effectively. The conducted case study gives very promising results and demonstrates the advantages of using agent-based virtual organizations in the retrieval of labeled digital content.

NBIT is compared with an implicit non-linear finite element (FE) model using LS-DYNA. A split FE model was compared with a quarter FE model to determine the split interface that causes an average difference of 9.0% on the residual von Mises strain field from a 588.6 N indentation. The homogeneous FE quarter model was then compared with the experimental split model using 588.6, 981.0, and 1471.5 N indentation forces. An average displacement difference of 3.92 mu m was found when comparing the experimental split and FE homogeneous samples from a 588.6 N indentation. The internal residual major and minor principal strains from the split experimental sample and homogeneous FE model were compared for each indentation force. The minor principal strain results show the 588.6, 981.0, and 1471.5 N indentation forces resulted in a difference between the experimental split and homogeneous FE model of 28.5%, 34.8%, and 26.0%, respectively. The difference between the comparisons was explained by the inability of the FE model to simulate local non-homogeneous material properties such as grain composition and orientation whereas NBIT does.

J,"Gou, JN; Zhai, PP; Dong, HY",Sparse and limited-angle CT image reconstruction using dictionary learning constrained by L1 norm,"Reconstructed images from computed tomography (CT) using the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and simultaneous ART (SART) algorithms often suffer from obvious artefacts when only sparse and limited-angle projection data are available. Using the ability of dictionary learning (DL) in image feature extraction and sparse signal representation, a new iterative reconstruction algorithm, ART-DL-L1, is proposed to overcome the aforementioned limitations. This new algorithm is based on DL and an L1 norm constraint, combined with ART. An alternate iterative solving strategy based on an approach of 'ART first, then adaptive dictionary learning' is suggested and is explicitly described in a flowchart depicting the ART-DL-L1 algorithm. For both a noisy projection of 360 degrees sparse data and limited- angle data of 120 degrees, simulation reconstruction results from the classic Shepp-Logan image obtained using ART-DL-L1 appear to be better than those obtained using SART and total variation (TV) algorithms and also better than the cutting-edge ART-DL-L2 algorithm. Five evaluation metrics corresponding to the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the residuals and the structural similarity (SSIM) index are adopted to estimate the reconstruction effect. The results suggest that the five metrics obtained using ART-DL-L1 outperform those obtained using the other three algorithms. The impact of using patches of various sizes played by the DL part in ART-DL-L1 is considered in the simulations and the patch size achieving the best reconstructed image quality is identified in this case as 25 (5 x 5). Overall, the proposed ART-DL-L1 algorithm may reduce artefacts and suppress noise from incomplete noisy projection CT imaging to some degree.",10.1784/insi.2019.61.10.584,10,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Gu, ZD; Zhao, ZY; Zhao, H; Peng, W; Zhang, JB; Zhao, HW; Ako, RT; Sriram, S",Terahertz multiple modes defined by fractal symmetry in complementary meta-atoms,"Low quality (Q) factors of the intrinsic inductive-capacitive (LC) mode as well as the parasitic dipole oscillation mode restrict high-resolution sensing using split-ring resonators (SRR). Although the trapped Fano-mode of the high-Q factor is found in asymmetric SRR, the conventional design limits the scaling down of resonators. As such, excitation and manipulation of multiple trapped modes of SRR is significant for driving innovative designs of terahertz metamaterials and metasurfaces. In this work, we present a novel approach to manipulating multiple terahertz modes by increasing the fractal levels as well as the geometric symmetry of complementary SRR. It is found that the multiple trapped modes become achievable only in the case that the gap of adjacent fractal SRR opposes each other. By increasing the fractal level, the intrinsic resonance modes change slightly, and more trapped modes appear in between the frequency range of the two major intrinsic modes. The map of surface currents and magnetic field distribution reveal that intrinsic LC resonance in the first or second level SRR dominates the intrinsic modes. By contrast, the trapped mode arises from the hybridization of high-order localized dipole oscillation as well as the multiple localized LC resonances. These findings create new design opportunities for scalable metasurfaces across the terahertz spectrum and beyond, with ability to create high-resolution sensors.

The results show that the creep strain of Mg-5Y-2Nd-3Sm-0.5Zr alloy increases with the increase of temperature and stress. The steady-state creep rates at 523 K/70 MPa and 523 K/90 MPa are only 2.3611 x 10(-8)s(-1) and 3.9194 x 10(-8)s(-1), the creep strain after 100 h is only 0.735% and 1.751%, Mg-5Y-2Nd-3Sm-0.5Zr alloy has excellent creep resistance under 523 K. When the stretching temperature is the same, the grain size of the alloy increases with the increase of tensile strength. Under the same tensile strength, with the increase of temperature, the grain size of the alloy increases obviously with the increase of temperature. The creep stress exponents (n) are 0.84 at 473 K, 2.58 at 498 K and 5.13 at 523 K under the creep conditions of 70 MPa-110 MPa.

When the Al-Ni precursor is foamed in a hollow pipe, if the temperature distribution inside the precursor is uneven, the pore shape distribution becomes uneven. In free foaming, no anisotropy is observed in the foaming direction and the pore shape is isotropic. However, in the hollow pipe, the pipe expands in the pipe axis direction and fills the pipe. The interfacial adhesion between Al3Ni foam and steel pipe is excellent, and interfacial pore and reaction layer are not observed by SEM. In free foaming, the porosity is 90 %, but it decreases to about 80 % in the foam in the pipe. In the pipe foaming, most of the pore shape appears elongated in the pipe direction in the vicinity of the pipe, and this tendency is more remarkable when the inside pipe diameter is small. It can be seen that the pore size of the foam sample in the pipe is larger than that of free foam, because coarse pores remain after solidification of the foam because the shape of the foam is supported by the pipe. The vertical/horizontal length ratio expands along the pipe axis direction by foaming in the pipe, and therefore circularity is reduced.",10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.617,15,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no

The relationships between the thrust and rotation speed of a screw mixed-flow pump, drag and submerged speed of water-jet propulsion were obtained from flume experiments and numerical calculations, based on which a dynamic model of pump-jet propulsion was established in this paper. As an initial condition, the numerical solution of the submerged speed with respect to time was inputted to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for unsteady calculation based on a user-defined function (UDF). Thus, the relationships between the acceleration, drag, net thrust, propulsion torque and efficiency with respect to time were revealed. The results indicate that the relationship between the thrust and rotational speed of a water-jet propeller is a quadratic function, which agrees well with the experimental values. The variation of submerged speed with respect to time satisfies a hyperbolic tangent function distribution. The acceleration increases sharply at the beginning and then decreases gradually to zero, especially at high rotation speeds of the water-jet pump. The variations in drag and propulsion efficiency with respect to time coincide with the step response of a second-order system with critical damping. The method and results of this study can give a better understanding of the changes in dynamic parameters such as velocity, acceleration, thrust, and drag during the acceleration of a pump-jet submersible and helped to estimate the effects of pump performance on water-jet propulsion kinetic parameters.",10.3390/app9194194,16,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

In this study, strain foils (SFs) are utilized to measure longitudinal strains at the bottom of a hot mixed asphalt (HMA) layer in an indoor inverted pavement. The validity and reliability of SF-measured strain are investigated through three tests using a heavy vehicle simulator (HVS). The three tests focus on the consistency and stability of strain measured by individual SFs and various SFs installed at similar positions, as well as the consistency of strain measured by SF and an asphalt strain gauge (ASG) at different test speeds, load levels, and loading cycles in an accelerated pavement test (APT). Fast Fourier transform is utilized to filter out interference in the raw SF strain data. Filtered SF-measured strains were converted into ASG-measured strain based on effective gauge lengths. Research results show that converted SF-measured strains did not reveal a significant statistical difference compared with strains simultaneously collected by ASG under different test loads and speeds throughout the APT at 300,000 repetitions. Moreover, individual SF can provide consistent results with the coefficient of variation (CV) less than 3.3 % under different speeds and load levels, and SFs installed at similar positions showed similar average maximum strain variations (MSVs) with a maximum difference of 5.8%. Moreover, the linear correlations between the average MSV and the test load, as well as the speed further verified the validity of SF-measured strain.

J,"Hayes, WW; Manson, JR",Calculations of Ar scattering from graphite,"Two recent experiments on the scattering of hyperthermal Ar atoms from clean and ordered graphite have been carried out in the classical regime, which is characterized by excitations of large numbers of phonons. The measured data, which consist primarily of angular distribution spectra, are shown here to be well explained by straight-forward classical scattering theory. The calculations confirm that the Ar-graphite scattering at energies of up to 14 eV is a single-hit collision process involving a large number of carbon atoms in the outermost graphene layers. This number is estimated here to be close to 9 carbon atoms. All of the measured angular distributions down to energies of 0.3 eV are supraspecular, but the present calculations predict that the angular distributions will become subspecular at lower energies. Calculations are also presented predicting the expected results of energy-resolved measurements under similar initial conditions. (c) 2019 Author(s).

Their structure and morphology can be controlled by tuning the precursor concentration. Microstructural analysis reveals that all the samples have distinct core/shell structure without impurities, and the NiO shells are built of many irregular nanosheets which enclose the surface of gamma-Fe2O3 core. As the precursor concentration decreases (i.e., more NiO content), the NiO grain grows significantly, and the thickness of NiO shells increases. Magnetic experiments are performed to analyze the influences of different microstructures on magnetic properties of samples and we have the following two results. First, at 5 K, along with increasing thickness of NiO shell, the saturation magnetization increases, while the residual magnetization decreases slightly. Second, the hysteresis loops under cooling field demonstrate that the value of exchange bias effect fluctuates between 13 Oe and 17 Oe.

J,"Hidalgo, JP; Torero, JL; Welch, S",Fire performance of closed-cell charring insulation materials in plasterboard-insulation assemblies,"This paper presents an experimental study on the fire performance of two types of plastic charring insulation materials when covered by a plasterboard lining. The specific insulation materials correspond to rigid closed-cell plastic foams, a type of polyisocyanurate (foam A) and a type of phenolic foam (foam B), whose thermal decomposition and flammability were characterised in previous studies. The assemblies were instrumented with thermocouples. The plasterboard facing was subjected to constant levels of irradiation of 15, 25, and 65 kW m(-2) using the heat-transfer rate inducing system. These experiments serve as (1) an assessment of the fire behaviour of these materials studied at the assembly scale and (2) an identification of the fire hazards that these systems pose in building construction. The manifestation of the hazards occurred via initial pyrolysis reactions and release of volatiles followed by various complex behaviours including char oxidation (smouldering), cracking, and expansion of the foam. Gas-phase conditions may support ignition of the volatiles, sustained burning, and ultimately spread of the flame through the unexposed insulation face. The results presented herein are used to validate the insulation ""critical temperature"" concept used for a performance-based methodology focused on the selection of suitable thermal barriers for flammable insulation.",10.1002/fam.2697,22,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

Furthermore, VD could be sustainably released from fibrin for more than 96 hours. Most importantly, fibrin containing high-dose VD increased gastric cancer cells apoptosis in contrast to VD alone of the same concentration, which might be due to the synergistic effects of sustained release of VD and D-dimer, the degradation products of fibrin.

Few works have studied the influence of the geometrical properties including annulus area, anterior / posterior disc height, and over the range of motion, but in general these properties have not been reported in the finite element models. This paper presents a probabilistic finite element analyses (Abaqus 6.14.2) intended to assess the effects of the average disc height (h(p)) and the area (A) of the annulus fibrosus on the biomechanics of the lumbar spine. The annulus model was loaded under flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation and analyzed for different combinations of h(p) and A in order to obtain their effects over the range of motion. A set of 50 combinations of h(p) (mean = 18.1 mm, SD = 3.5 mm) and A (mean = 49.8%, SD = 4.6%) were determined randomly according to a normal distribution. A Yeoh energy function was used for the matrix and an exponential function for the fibers. The range of motion was more sensitive to h(p) than to A. With regard to the range of motion the segment was more sensitive in the following order: flexion, axial rotation, extension, and lateral bending. An increase of the h(p) produces an increase of the range of motion, but this decreases when A increases. Comparing the range of motion with the experimental data, on average, 56.0% and 73.0% of the total of data were within the experimental range for the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, respectively. Further, an analytic equation was derived to obtain the range of motion as a function of the h(p) and A.

The major factors affecting tensile strength measurements include the size of the specimen, tensile displacement pulling rate, and the shape of the tensile apparatus mold. The effect of the tensile displacement pulling rate and the behavior of crack propagation due to the shapes of the direct tension mold were investigated.

In addition, tests were conducted to measure the tensile strength of soils with different specimen depths and cross-sectional areas. The results show that there was no significant influence of the displacement rate associated with tensile force, crack propagation, and maximum tensile force. Triangular wedges are the best pick for direct tension tests.

J,"Jyegal, J",Generalized Einstein relation for nonparabolic multiple energy-band degenerate semiconductors,"A generalized Einstein relation for electron gases of degenerate semiconductors with a system of typically two nonparabolic conduction band structures is derived and formulated in near-equilibrium condition based on using the semiclassical drift-diffusion equation. The result of this derivation shows that the Einstein relation for carrier gases in multiple energy bands generally depends on their mobilities unless the energy band structures are parabolic. The formulated results (a full formula and an approximate single-carrier-gas formula) are typically applied to GaAs and GaSb to calculate the values of the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to mobility for carriers in the lowest and upper conduction bands, and an in-depth investigation is made for the Einstein relation for conduction electrons in these semiconductors. It is shown, in particular, that highly degenerate GaAs exhibits the uncommon, peculiar property of the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to mobility for conduction electrons saturating in two different electron concentration, or Fermi energy, conditions, with increasing electron concentration or Fermi energy. It is also shown that for GaSb, the effect of the upper conduction band is so large that the use of any formula obtained for carriers in a single conduction band is generally unsuitable for describing the Einstein relation for conduction electrons in this semiconductor. In addition, a more generalized Einstein relation extended to a system of three nonparabolic energy band structures is also formulated and proposed in the paper, so as to be used to more accurately describe the Einstein relation for hole gases in degenerate semiconductors.

DBTT was found to be linearly correlated with the amount of metalloid on the GB (X-gb) for both dynamic and static displacement rates (d delta/dt) in high and medium hardness steels. Recent first-principles calculations have determined the GB embrittling potency (Delta e(p)) of segregated Sb, Sn and P. In both high and medium hardness steels, the slope (alpha) of DBTT vs. X-gb was found to be linearly dependent on Delta e(p) regardless of the segregated solutes. In high hardness steels, the slope is independent of d delta/dt, while in medium hardness steels the a is dependent on d delta/dt. An Arrhenius plot of d delta/dt vs. the reciprocal DBTT was used to drive the thermal activation energy (E-act), which represents a barrier to plasticity.

J,"Kang, B; Kang, S",Nanometer-Scale Surface Structure and Sterilization Characteristics of Na/Ag Ion-Exchanged Glass for Anti-Biofouling Application,"Most objects and structures exposed to a marine environment for more than a month undergo biofouling of the surface. Biofouling is a phenomenon in which micro-organisms attach to marine structures and may result in deterioration of the structure or breakage of the structure due to weight gain. In this study, glass, which can inhibit biofouling of marine structures, was prepared and its germicidal properties were analyzed. For this purpose, Ag ions were implanted into soda-lime-silicate glass by the ion-exchange method. For the glass immersed in seawater, the bactericidal effect of the glass specimen was than evaluated by inoculating the strain and counting the number of viable cells after 12 or 24 h. Experimental variables were ion exchange conditions, time immersed in seawater, and time spent inoculating the strain. In particular, the surface state of the ion exchange glass before and after immersion in seawater was observed at the nanometer level, and the elution amount of Ag ions with time was measured by the ICP mass analysis method. As the ion exchange time increased, the amount of ion exchange increased. The amount of ions was consistent with Fick's first law, which is proportional to the square root of time. When ion-exchanged specimens were immersed in seawater, the amount of Ag ions eluted was on the order of ppm. Si and Na ions were also eluted from the glass. As the ion exchange time increased, crystals of 60 similar to 80 nm, which are presumed to be Na2CO3 phase, formed densely on the surface of the specimen. However, when the glass specimens were immersed in seawater, crystals formed on the surface dissolved and disappeared. Cracks subsequently formed on the surface and finally the surface collapsed. After 30 days, a fresh glass surface appeared again. This is a very interesting result because it shows that the reaction between glass and seawater is very similar to that between aqueous solutions. When the glass implanted with Ag ions is immersed in seawater, the surface dissolves and the glass-network-structure collapses, resulting in considerable Ag ion elution, which enhances bactericidal action in seawater. For example, when a specimen immersed in seawater for 30 days was inoculated with the strain for 24 hours, the number of strains decreased from 2.1x10(6) cells/ml to 0 cell/ml, indicating 100% disinfection ability. In this study, soda-lime-silicate glass with Ag ion implantation by the Na/Ag ion exchange method showed an excellent germicidal effect when in contact with sea water. From this result, it can be expected that long-term marine biological pollution can be suppressed by applying the glass developed in this research to marine structures.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17041,46,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

To this goal, laminated composite samples with a distinct number of layers were bonded using ultrasonic consolidation. Then, tensile and biaxial hydraulic bulge tests at different strain rates and temperature conditions were conducted. The effect of the sample orientation on the mechanical response was also examined. Tensile and hydraulic bulge tests results were compared to observe differences in ultimate tensile strength and strain levels under uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. The effects of loading condition, strain rate, and temperature on the material response were analyzed and discussed on the basis of test results. In general, it was concluded that the maximum elongation values attained were higher for the samples subtracted along the sonotrode movement direction compared to those obtained from the normal to sonotrode movement direction. The elongation was obtained as high as 46% for seven bi-layered samples at high-temperature ranges of 200-300 degrees C.

J,"Khademi, V; Ikeda, M; Hernández-Escobar, D; Boehlert, CJ",The Elevated-Temperature Strength Enhancement of a Low-Cost β Titanium Alloy Through Thermomechanically-Induced Phase Transformation,"The effects of temperature and thermomechanical loading on the tensile strength and hardness were studied for a rolled, low-cost metastable beta titanium alloy, Ti-13Cr-1Fe-3Al (wt.%). Tensile tests were performed at temperatures between room temperature (RT) and 410 degrees C. The results indicated that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) decreased with increasing temperatures up to 300 degrees C. However, the UTS was 1400 MPa at 410 degrees C, which was approximately 150% higher than the RT UTS. It is believed that the formation of nanoscale omega and alpha precipitates, identified using transmission electron microscopy, hindered the dislocation motion, which resulted in the exceptionally high UTS at 410 degrees C. However, ductility was maintained, as the elongation-to-failure (epsilon(f)) was similar to 10% at 410 degrees C. Dynamic mechanical analysis suggested that phase transformations occurred between 370 degrees C-475 degrees C. To evaluate the effect of the phase transformations on the hardness, the as-received material was heat treated at 400 degrees C, 450 degrees C, and 500 degrees C for 2 h, which resulted in hardness values of approximately 340 Hv, 380 Hv, and 470 Hv, respectively. However, the greatest hardness value (500 Hv) was exhibited by the as-received material after it was tensile tested at 410 degrees C. This suggested that both temperature and loading history affected the phase transformations. As all the samples exhibited a ductile fracture mode, this work indicates that it is possible to maintain both high strength and adequate epsilon(f) for Ti-13Cr-1Fe-3Al (wt.%).",10.1007/s11837-019-03598-2,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A good combination of dopants would improve the optical response in visible regime and remove the isolated states from the band gap while keeping minimum structural distortion. Enhanced visible light absorption and effective utilization of photo-generated carriers would improve the photoactivity of TiO2 under solar irradiations. Mono-doped, co-doped and tri-doped models of molybdenum (Mo), carbon (c), and nitrogen (N) are developed in the structure of anatase TiO2 and the corresponding change in the geometrical structure, band structure, and optical response is noted. The Mo and C co-doping produced least structure modification when compared to a reference TiO2 system. The Mo 3d states are mixed with Ti 3d states reducing the band gap of Mo-doped TiO2. While shifting the Fermi level to the middle of the band gap, the C 2p states are introduced around the middle of the gap of C doped TiO2. The impurity states are occupied and maximum reduction in the band gap is found in Mo, C codoped TiO2. The addition of N in the Mo, C codoped TiO2 modified the band structure by creating isolated states in the band gap. The photo-response of Mo, C, N tri-doped TiO2 is prominent among the simulated models attributed to the step wise transition of electrons by the C 2p and N 2p states. The improved optical response allows more visible photons for absorptions but the isolated states may annihilate it.

However, because implementing these identical fields of view is difficult in practical applications, in this paper, we propose a HSR method that is applicable when an HSI and a target RGB image have different spatial information. The proposed HSR method first creates a low-resolution RGB image from a given HSI. Next, a histogram matching is performed on a high-resolution RGB image and a low-resolution RGB image obtained from an HSI. Finally, the proposed method optimizes endmember abundance of the high-resolution HSI towards the histogram-matched high-resolution RGB image. The entire procedure is evaluated using an open HSI dataset, the Harvard dataset, by adding spatial mismatch to the dataset. The spatial mismatch is implemented by shear transformation and cutting off the upper and left sides of the target RGB image.

The transistors' electrostatic was analyzed using a 3D TCAD simulation. We firstly optimized physical parameters such as channel radius and thickness. The NP-FETs for 3.5 nm node had better gate controllability due to smaller channel thickness and therefore showed an advantage in subthreshold swing (S.S.). However, parasitic resistance and capacitance, and low bias condition of scaled device lowered on-current level. These problems of smaller device were also related to limitation of RC-delay performance. Accordingly, the scaled device with optimized physical parameters showed similar to 1% decrease in delay performance compared to 5 nm node device. In order to improve RC-delay performance, trenched contact method and channel strain engineering method were separately applied for the same device.

Unlike an above-ground pipe, buried piping is exposed to a corrosion environment because of the water chemistry condition inside the pipe, and to mechanical damage, chemical damage, and heavy-load fatigue caused by the soil outside the pipe. If leakage occurs in buried piping, it is very difficult to find its cause and to repair it in a timely manner. In Korea, after the leakage has been identified, follow-up measures are implemented, such as temporary repair or maintenance. Therefore, the identification of potential damage, which is part of the integrity management of buried piping in soil and concrete, is fairly limited. Therefore, an effective buried-pipe aging management program that is applicable to Korean nuclear power plants and that includes the preventive management of damage is necessary. In this study, US regulation trends were identified through the regulatory requirements and the management documents of licensees to develop regulatory guidelines.

When the level of gate voltage is low, the tunneling width of the TFETs is large. Thus, electrons move via the trap instead of tunneling directly. On the other hand, when the level of gate voltage is high, the tunneling width of the TFETs becomes narrow. Thus, when the gate voltage is low, the noise level of TFETs is high because electrons pass through the trap. However, when the gate voltage is high, electrons pass directly from valence band of source to conduction band of drain, so the noise level is low.

The switching-off process of SF6 arc discharges occurs at the region between the contacts during the opening sequence to interrupt the flow of excessive current in a faulty network. The arc is tolerated in a controlled manner until a natural current zero when the arc discharge is rapidly quenched to restrict the thermal and dielectric reignition to the interruption. An SF6 self-blast switching chamber combines two advantages of blowing by heat expansion of the SF6 and arc rotation by electromagnetic effect of coil to improve the switching performance on thermal and dielectric reignition. The thermal and aerodynamic behaviors of an SF6 rotating switching arc in the chamber physically are complex and difficult to understand only by measurement due to their three-dimensional effects. Since the late nineteen-eighties, significant progress has been made in the method of computational fluid dynamics describing the physical processes occurring in the switching arc. The final goal of computer simulation technology on the arc switching is to predict the switching phenomena on the thermal and dielectric reignition from an engineering point of view. In this paper, we have conducted quasi-three dimensional computations to predict the thermal and dielectric reignition of SF6 rotating arcs occurring after a current zero in the self-blast switching chamber.

The effect of Al on the morphology and luminescence properties of ZnO crystals was investigated. The spherical shaped ZnO nanocrystals with the sizes of 150-230 nm were formed at 800 degrees C. As the growth temperature increased from 800 to 900 and 1000 degrees C, the morphology of ZnO micro/nanocrystals was changed to belt and plate shape, which indicated that the vertical growth of the crystals was suppressed with the growth temperature. The belt-like crystals had widths of 80-500 nm and lengths of several to several tens of micrometers. The plate-like crystals had widths ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 mu m.

RTA, which is widely used in highly integrated short-channel silicon device manufacturing processes, deteriorates the electrical characteristics of SOI pseudo metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOS-FET) by affecting the interfacial properties between the top silicon and buried oxide layers. In order to replenish these interfacial properties, microwave annealing (MWA) was performed on the device under various conditions. Because MWA utilizes the direct energy transfer (DET) method, the RTA-induced thermal damage on the back interface was effectively removed despite a short processing time. The improvement was comparable to that of conventional thermal annealing at a higher temperature for a long period of time. Therefore, MWA is expected to be a very effective post-RTA heat-treatment technology for fabricating ultrathin-body SOI MOSFETs because of its low thermal budget.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17014,71,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

Thiol compounds encapsulated inside nanotubes in vacuum drastically change the electric properties of SWNTs by a charge transfer between the two species. The simplicity of the synthetic process offers a viable route for large-scale production of SWNTs with controlled doping states by using mat-type SWNTs. Optical characterization (Raman and near-infrared spectrum) and electric property (conductivity) reveals that a charge transfer between the SWNTs and compounds occurs through the difference in the ionization energy and electron affinity. We confirm an electron density change in SWNTs through optical spectroscopy and conductivity measurement in vacuum.

The results showed that the copper grains and ferrite grains of steel in CCS wires are elongated along the drawing direction and transformed to fiber microstructure. The microstructure of copper and steel in CCS wires experiences recovery, recrystallization and grain growth after annealing treatment. The elongated copper grains and ferrite grains of steel gradually transformed to equiaxed grains and the grain sizes increased with annealing temperature increasing. With the increase of deformation amounts, the misorientation angle of copper and steel changes from large angle to small angle and the texture variation of copper is not obvious, which is inconsistent with the texture change of pure copper wire. However, the texture variation of steel is consistent with that of a single steel wire, mainly the fiber texture in the direction of <110>. With the annealing temperatures increase, the misorientation angle of copper and steel changes from small angle to large angle. The variation of texture with annealing temperature is similar to that of single copper and steel wires. For copper, when annealing temperature is less than 850 degrees C, the intensity fluctuation of texture is not very obvious. The <111>-<211> texture becomes diffused. However, when annealing temperature is more than 850 degrees C, the texture included a number of strong <111> annealing texture and a few of weak <110>. annealing texture. For steel core, the <110> fiber texture doesn't disappear and only the fiber texture transforms to the annealing texture.

The foam material obtained at 30% to 50% amylopectin content featured a 'reinforced concrete structure' with NFC and amylopectin. With the increase of amylopectin content, the pore wall of the foam material gradually formed due to the NFC wrapped by amylopectin, and the pore size increased whereas the number of pores decreased. However, when the amylopectin content reached a high level, the pore size of the foam dwindled, thus the compressive strength and thermal conductivity of the foam were enhanced.

In most clinical studies, bone density is used as a gold standard in predicting insertion torque. By contrast, trabecular microstructure is ignored. In this study, a microstructure-based numerical computational method with high accuracy and efficiency for the insertion torque of dental implant was proposed by introducing two microscopic variables, namely, volume fraction and fabric tensor. First, two kinds of 3D microstructural solid models with same volume fraction and fabric tensor were established on the basis of the microstructural topology of six reference specimens. Second, a new numerical simulation method based on homogenous theory was used to explore the material models of these 3D microstructural solid models at the microscopic scale. Then, the anisotropic material models of specimens were developed on the basis of the mixture rule.

The results show that the post-yield softening is observed due to the disentanglement of molecular chains, after the stress approaches the yield peak, and a localized temperature rise is induced by the friction between molecular chains; with the progressive increasing of load, the strain hardening occurs due to the preferred orientation of molecular chains in the direction of stretching, which induces the stress and temperature rise increase. In the meantime, it is found that both the yield peak and localized temperature rise are increased significantly with the increase of strain rates; however, the competition exists between the strain softening induced by the dissipation heat generation and the strain hardening, making the sensitivity of localized plastic flow on the strain rate decreased. Based on the finite element software ABAQUS, the finite element model of a plate specimen was established to study the thermo-mechanically coupled behavior on the tensile deformation of SMPU. By comparing the contours of plastic strain field with that of temperature field at different moments, it is found that the forming of the localized plastic flow and temperature rise start from the initial defect and gradually move towards the middle and the expand to the entire sample, simultaneously. Furthermore, the simulated average temperature rise curves at different loading rates are in good agreement with the experimental ones.",10.11868/j.issn.1001-4381.2018.001334,91,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no
J,"Lim, C; Lim, D; Ku, B; Shim, SE; Baeck, SH",Optimization of Electrochemical Variables of Pulse-Reverse Electroplating in Trivalent Chromium Bath to Enhance the Corrosion Resistance of Chromium Film,"Electroplating chromium films in a trivalent chromium bath has been extensively investigated as a replacement for the conventional hexavalent chromium bath. However, commercialization of the trivalent chromium method has been hindered because the resulting chromium films exhibit inferior mechanical properties compared to hexavalent chromium coated film. In this study, we enhanced the properties of trivalent chromium electroplated film using a pulse-reverse (PR) method. Firstly, the cathodic current density needed to produce a shiny surface was optimized using direct current (DC) electroplating. After optimizing the cathodic current density, the appropriate anodic current density for PR electroplating needed to achieve optimum crack density and corrosion resistance was investigated. The chromium coating prepared using PR electroplating exhibited higher corrosion resistance than that prepared by DC electroplating, because it suppressed crack formation. Concerning the electrochemical corrosion behavior in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, the optimized sample (PR2) electroplated at an anodic current density of 0.04 A cm(-2) showed a corrosion potential shift of 129.9 mV to the anodic direction, and an increase in electrochemical corrosion resistance which was bigger than the chromium film prepared using DC electroplating. This optimization of electrochemical variables opens a new way to obtain improved electrodeposited film with low crack density and high corrosion resistance.",10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.10.641,92,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
J,"Lim, SH; Shin, EJ; Lee, HS; Han, SK; Le, DD; Hong, SK",Effects of Growth Rate and III/V Ratio on Properties of AlN Films Grown on c-Plane Sapphire Substrates by Plasma-Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy,"In this study, we investigate the effect of Al/N source ratios and growth rates on the growth and structural properties of AlN films on c-plane sapphires by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Both growth rates and Al/N ratios affect crystal qualities of AlN films. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of (10 (1) over bar5) X-ray rocking curves (XRCs) change from 0.22 to 0.31 degrees with changing of the Al/N ratios, but the curves of (0002) XRCs change from 0.04 to 0.45 degrees with changing of the Al/N ratios. This means that structural deformation due to dislocations is slightly affected by the Al/N ratio in the (10 (1) over bar5) XRCs but affected strongly for the (0002) XRCs. From the viewpoint of growth rate, the AlN films with high growth rate (HGR) show better crystal quality than the low growth rate (LGR) films overall, as shown by the FWHM values of the (0002) and (10 (1) over bar5) XRCs. Based on cross-sectional transmission electron microscope observation, the HGR sample with an Al/N ratio of 3.1 shows more edge dislocations than there are screw and mixed dislocations in the LGR sample with Al/N ratio of 3.5.",10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.579,93,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

Substitutions of (SiO4)(4-) ions with (GeO4)(4-) in Ca-4(La4Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 ceramic increased its densification temperature and thus led to a significant grain growth; however, replacement of Ca2+ and (PO4)(3-) ions by Mg2+ ions and (VO4)(3-) ions, respectively, decreased its densification temperature and resulted in grain refinement. Various rare-earth-metal and (WO4)(2-) ion substitutions on La3+ and Pr3+ and (PO4)(3-) sites, respectively, of Ca-4(La4Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 ceramic had no impact on the sintering temperature. In the case of Ca-4(La4Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 apatite with Mg2+ and (WO4)(2-) ion substitutions, second phases were observed in the x-ray diffraction patterns; however, only the pure hexagonal apatite phase with space group P6(3)/m was visible in all the other systems. Overall, Ca-4(La2Nd2Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 ceramic has the best microwave dielectric properties including epsilon(r) = 14.2, Q x f = 28,745 GHz and tau(f) = 0.9 ppm/degrees C. The densification temperatures of Ba-4(La4Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 ceramics decreased as the SiO4 (4-) and PO4 (3-) ions were substituted by WO4 (2-) ions. The formation of the secondary phases BaWO4 and Ba2SiO4 decreased their dielectric constant and increased their Q x f values.",10.1007/s11664-019-07406-0,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Liu, CY; Yousif, M; Hu, SQ; Han, K; Yao, W; Liu, Y",Design of protected circuit models for nonlinear dielectric conductivity measurement system under high-energy impulse breakdown conditions,"During high voltage tests for nonlinear dielectric samples, accidental breakdown may occur due to the influence of some objective factors (such as material defectiveness, ambient temperature, air humidity, etc.). Under the high voltage conditions, a high energy impulse causes breakdown discharge resulting in test equipment failure. In this article, several unique types of LC and RC filtering circuit models are proposed to protect the nonlinear dielectric conductivity measurement system. Simulation of the proposed design models are carried out using ""MATLAB Simulink"". The simulation results revealed that all LC and RC filtering circuit models have a protective function for the test equipment, and can buffer the voltage-raising amplitude. By comparison, it is observed that the LC filtering circuit model has a better buffer-function than RC filtering circuit model. The LC filtering circuit can make the voltage-output curve more lenitive, and significantly increase the safety of measurement system. In addition, the comparison of single LC/RC and pi LC/RC filtering circuit models show that the pi LC/RC filtering circuit model has a better buffer function. Furthermore, in the high electric-field breakdown the pi LC/RC model can make a less steeper voltage-output curve. The filtering principles of these kinds of filtering circuit models were discussed, and the correctness of simulation results were validated by experiments. (c) 2019 Author(s).

A unique process has been used to prepare high-performance transition metal oxide (nickel oxide) coupled carbon fiber mat flexible electrode, which can be directly applied for lithium-ion battery assembly. Due to the high theoretical specific capacitance of nickel oxide, unique low dimensional characteristics and large draw ratios for internal stress dispersion of carbon fiber mat, NiO carbon nanofiber (NiO-CNF) delivers excellent cyclic characteristic and better rate electrochemical performance, which is simultaneously much higher than NiO nanofiber (NiO NF) without carbon. NiO-CNF and NiO NF have reversible capacities of 418 mAh.g(-1) and 242 mA.g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C, respectively.
