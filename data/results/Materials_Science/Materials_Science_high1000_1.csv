0,"Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,happy,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,happy,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,happy,happy,no,yes,no,yes,no
1,"Two-dimensional materials are attractive for use in next-generation nanoelectronic devices because, compared to one-dimensional materials, it is relatively easy to fabricate complex structures from them. The most widely studied two-dimensional material is graphene(1,2), both because of its rich physics(3-5) and its high mobility(6). However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including transistors(7). Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon films(8-13) or requires high voltages(14,15). Although single layers of MoS2 have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8 eV (ref. 16), previously reported mobilities in the 0.5-3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) range(17) are too low for practical devices. Here, we use a halfnium oxide gate dielectric to demonstrate a room-temperature single-layer MoS2 mobility of at least 200 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), similar to that of graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate transistors with room-temperature current on/off ratios of 1 x 10(8) and ultralow standby power dissipation. Because monolayer MoS2 has a direct bandgap(16,18), it can be used to construct interband tunnel FETs19, which offer lower power consumption than classical transistors. Monolayer MoS2 could also complement graphene in applications that require thin transparent semiconductors, such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

3,"The model and theoretical understanding of the Raman spectra in disordered and amorphous carbon are given. The nature of the G and D vibration modes in graphite is analyzed in terms of the resonant excitation of pi states and the long-range polarizability of pi bonding. Visible Raman data on disordered, amorphous, and diamond like carbon are classified in a three-stage model to show the factors that control the position, intensity, and widths of the G and D peaks. It is shown that the visible Raman spectra depend formally on the configuration of the sp(2) sites in sp(2)-bonded clusters. In cases where the sp(2) clustering is controlled by the sp(3) fraction, such as in as-deposited tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) or hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films, the visible Raman parameters can be used to derive the sp(3) fraction.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,

The room temperature values of the thermal conductivity in the range similar to(4.84 +/- 0.44) x 10(3) to (5.30 +/- 0.48) x 10(3) W/mK were extracted for a single-layer graphene from the dependence of the Raman G peak frequency on the excitation laser power and independently measured G peak temperature coefficient. The extremely high value of the thermal conductivity suggests that graphene can outperform carbon nanotubes in heat conduction. The superb thermal conduction property of graphene is beneficial for the proposed electronic applications and establishes graphene as an excellent material for thermal management.,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,happy,happy,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,happy,happy,no,no,no,yes,yes,

6,"Hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductors feature complex lattice dynamics due to the ionic character of the crystal and the softness arising from non-covalent bonds between molecular moieties and the inorganic network. Here we establish that such dynamic structural complexity in a prototypical two-dimensional lead iodide perovskite gives rise to the coexistence of diverse excitonic resonances, each with a distinct degree of polaronic character. By means of high-resolution resonant impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy, we identify vibrational wavepacket dynamics that evolve along different configurational coordinates for distinct excitons and photocarriers. Employing density functional theory calculations, we assign the observed coherent vibrational modes to various low-frequency (less than or similar to 50 cm(-1)) optical phonons involving motion in the lead iodide layers. We thus conclude that different excitons induce specific lattice reorganizations, which are signatures of polaronic binding. This insight into the energetic/configurational landscape involving globally neutral primary photoexcitations may be relevant to a broader class of emerging hybrid semiconductor materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"The production of hydrogen from water using a catalyst and solar energy is an ideal future energy source, independent of fossil reserves. For an economical use of water and solar energy, catalysts that are sufficiently efficient, stable, inexpensive and capable of harvesting light are required. Here, we show that an abundant material, polymeric carbon nitride, can produce hydrogen from water under visible-light irradiation in the presence of a sacrificial donor. Contrary to other conducting polymer semiconductors, carbon nitride is chemically and thermally stable and does not rely on complicated device manufacturing. The results represent an important first step towards photosynthesis in general where artificial conjugated polymer semiconductors can be used as energy transducers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"An improved method for the preparation of graphene oxide (GO) is described. Currently, Hummers' method (KMnO4, NaNO3, H2SO4) is the most common method used for preparing graphene oxide. We have found that excluding the NaNO3, increasing the amount of KMnO4, and performing the reaction in a 9:1 mixture of H2SO4/H3PO4 improves the efficiency of the oxidation process. This improved method provides a greater amount of hydrophilic oxidized graphene material as compared to Hummers' method or Hummers' method with additional KMnO4. Moreover, even though the GO produced by our method is more oxidized than that prepared by Hummers' method, when both are reduced in the same chamber with hydrazine, chemically converted graphene (CCG) produced from this new method is equivalent in its electrical conductivity. In contrast to Hummers' method, the new method does not generate toxic gas and the temperature is easily controlled. This improved synthesis of GO may be important for large-scale production of GO as well as the construction of devices composed of the subsequent CCG.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,"Graphene sheets offer extraordinary electronic, thermal and mechanical properties and are expected to find a variety of applications. A prerequisite for exploiting most proposed applications for graphene is the availability of processable graphene sheets in large quantities. The direct dispersion of hydrophobic graphite or graphene sheets in water without the assistance of dispersing agents has generally been considered to be an insurmountable challenge. Here we report that chemically converted graphene sheets obtained from graphite can readily form stable aqueous colloids through electrostatic stabilization. This discovery has enabled us to develop a facile approach to large-scale production of aqueous graphene dispersions without the need for polymeric or surfactant stabilizers. Our findings make it possible to process graphene materials using low-cost solution processing techniques, opening up enormous opportunities to use this unique carbon nanostructure for many technological applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,"An algorithm is presented for carrying out decomposition of electronic charge density into atomic contributions. As suggested by Bader [R. Bader, Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory, Oxford University Press, New York, 1990], space is divided up into atomic regions where the dividing surfaces are at a minimum in the charge density, i.e. the gradient of the charge density is zero along the surface normal. Instead of explicitly finding and representing the dividing surfaces, which is a challenging task, our algorithm assigns each point on a regular (x, y, z) grid to one of the regions by following a steepest ascent path on the grid. The computational work required to analyze a given charge density grid is approximately 50 arithmetic operations per grid point. The work scales linearly with the number of grid points and is essentially independent of the number of atoms in the system. The algorithm is robust and insensitive to the topology of molecular bonding. In addition to two test problems involving a water molecule and NaCl crystal, the algorithm has been used to estimate the electrical activity of a cluster of boron atoms in a silicon crystal. The highly stable three-atom boron cluster, B3I is found to have a charge of -1.5 e, which suggests approximately 50% reduction in electrical activity as compared with three substitutional boron atoms.

13,"Novel physical phenomena can emerge in low-dimensional nanomaterials. Bulk MoS2, a prototypical metal dichalcogenide, is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with negligible photoluminescence. When the MoS2 crystal is thinned to monolayer, however, a strong photoluminescence emerges, indicating an indirect to direct bandgap transition in this d-electron system. This observation shows that quantum confinement in layered d-electron materials like MoS2 provides new opportunities for engineering the electronic structure of matter at the nanoscale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

15,"The bone-bonding ability of a material is often evaluated by examining the ability of apatite to form on its surface in a simulated body fluid (SBF) with ion concentrations nearly equal to those of human blood plasma. However, the validity of this method for evaluating bone-bonding ability has not been assessed systematically. Here, the history of SBF, correlation of the ability of apatite to form oil various materials in SBF with their in vivo bone bioactivities, and some examples of the development of novel bioactive materials based on apatite formation in SBF are reviewed. It was concluded that examination of apatite formation on a material in SBF is useful for predicting the in vivo bone bioactivity of a material, and the number of animals used in and the duration of animal experiments call be reduced remarkably by using this method.

16,"The surface area of a single graphene sheet is 2630 m(2)/g, substantially higher than values derived from BET surface area measurements of activated carbons used in current electrochemical double layer capacitors. Our group has pioneered a new carbon material that we call chemically modified graphene (CMG). CMG materials are made from 1-atom thick sheets of carbon, functionalized as needed, and here we demonstrate in an ultracapacitor cell their performance, Specific capacitances of 135 and 99 F/g in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively, have been measured. In addition, high electrical conductivity gives these materials consistently good performance over a wide range of voltage scan rates. These encouraging results illustrate the exciting potential for high performance, electrical energy storage devices based on this new class of carbon material.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"Two-dimensional crystals have emerged as a class of materials that may impact future electronic technologies. Experimentally identifying and characterizing new functional two-dimensional materials is challenging, but also potentially rewarding. Here, we fabricate field-effect transistors based on few-layer black phosphorus crystals with thickness down to a few nanometres. Reliable transistor performance is achieved at room temperature in samples thinner than 7.5 nm, with drain current modulation on the order of 10(5) and well-developed current saturation in the I-V characteristics. The charge-carrier mobility is found to be thickness-dependent, with the highest values up to similar to 1,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) obtained for a thickness of similar to 10nm. Our results demonstrate the potential of black phosphorus thin crystals as a new two-dimensional material for applications in nanoelectronic devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"The ultimate aim of any detection method is to achieve such a level of sensitivity that individual quanta of a measured entity can be resolved. In the case of chemical sensors, the quantum is one atom or molecule. Such resolution has so far been beyond the reach of any detection technique, including solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity(1-4). The fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due to thermal motion of charges and defects(5), which lead to intrinsic noise exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many orders of magnitude. Here, we show that micrometre-size sensors made from graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene's surface. The adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic field or mechanical strain are required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"Metal halides perovskites, such as hybrid organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbI3, are newcomer optoelectronic materials that have attracted enormous attention as solution-deposited absorbing layers in solar cells with power conversion efficiencies reaching 20%. Herein we demonstrate a new avenue for halide perovskites by designing highly luminescent perovskite-based colloidal quantum dot materials. We have synthesized monodisperse colloidal nanocubes (4-15 nm edge lengths) of fully inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I or mixed halide systems Cl/Br and Br/I) using inexpensive commercial precursors. Through compositional modulations and quantum size-effects, the bandgap energies and emission spectra are readily tunable over the entire visible spectral region of 410-700 nm. The photoluminescence of CsPbX3 nanocrystals is characterized by narrow emission line-widths of 12-42 nm, wide color gamut covering up to 140% of the NTSC color standard, high quantum yields of up to 90%, and radiative lifetimes in the range of 1-29 ns. The compelling combination of enhanced optical properties and chemical robustness makes CsPbX3 nanocrystals appealing for optoelectronic applications, particularly for blue and green spectral regions (410-530 nm), where typical metal chalcogenide-based quantum dots suffer from photodegradation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"The outstanding electrical(1), mechanical(2,3) and chemical(4,5) properties of graphene make it attractive for applications in flexible electronics(6-8). However, efforts to make transparent conducting films from graphene have been hampered by the lack of efficient methods for the synthesis, transfer and doping of graphene at the scale and quality required for applications. Here, we report the roll-to-roll production and wet-chemical doping of predominantly monolayer 30-inch graphene films grown by chemical vapour deposition onto flexible copper substrates. The films have sheet resistances as low as similar to 125 Omega square(-1) with 97.4% optical transmittance, and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, indicating their high quality. We further use layer-by-layer stacking to fabricate a doped four-layer film and measure its sheet resistance at values as low as similar to 30 Omega square(-1) at similar to 90% transparency, which is superior to commercial transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxides. Graphene electrodes were incorporated into a fully functional touch-screen panel device capable of withstanding high strain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"Multicomponent alloys containing several components in equal atomic proportions have been manufactured by casting and melt spinning, and their microstructures and properties have been investigated by a combination of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffractrometry and microhardness measurements. Alloys containing 16 and 20 components in equal proportions are multiphase, crystalline and brittle both as-cast and after melt spinning. A five component Fe20Cr20Mn20Ni20Co20 alloy forms a single fcc solid solution which solidifies dendritically. A wide range of other six to nine component late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys exhibit the same majority fcc primary dendritic phase, which can dissolve substantial amounts of other transition metals such as Nb, Ti and V More electronegative elements such as Cu and Ge are less stable in the fcc dendrites and are rejected into the interdendritic regions. The total number of phases is always well below the maximum equilibrium number allowed by the Gibbs phase rule, and even further below the maximum number allowed under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. Glassy structures are not formed by casting or melt spinning of late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys, indicating that the confusion principle does not apply, and other factors are more important in promoting glass formation.

22,"Chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of first row transition metals and their oxides and hydroxides is challenging due to the complexity of their 2p spectra resulting from peak asymmetries, complex multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structure, and uncertain, overlapping binding energies. Our previous paper [M. C. Biesinger et al., Appl. Surf. Sci. 257 (2010) 887-898.] in which we examined Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn species, has shown that all the values of the spectral fitting parameters for each specific species, i.e. binding energy (eV), full wide at half maximum (FWHM) value (eV) for each pass energy, spin-orbit splitting values and asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, are not all normally provided in the literature and data bases, and are necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis. A more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve fitting was developed based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of literature references and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. This paper extends this approach to the chemical states of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni metals, and various oxides and hydroxides where intense, complex multiplet splitting in many of the chemical states of these elements poses unique difficulties for chemical state analysis. The curve fitting procedures proposed use the same criteria as proposed previously but with the additional complexity of fitting of multiplet split spectra which has been done based on spectra of numerous reference materials and theoretical XPS modeling of these transition metal species. Binding energies, FWHM values, asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, multiplet peak separation and peak area percentages are presented. The procedures developed can be utilized to remove uncertainties in the analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

23,"There is great interest in developing rechargeable lithium batteries with higher energy capacity and longer cycle life for applications in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles and implantable medical devices(1). Silicon is an attractive anode material for lithium batteries because it has a low discharge potential and the highest known theoretical charge capacity (4,200 mAh g(-1); ref. 2). Although this is more than ten times higher than existing graphite anodes and much larger than various nitride and oxide materials(3,4), silicon anodes have limited applications(5) because silicon's volume changes by 400% upon insertion and extraction of lithium, which results in pulverization and capacity fading(2). Here, we show that silicon nanowire battery electrodes circumvent these issues as they can accommodate large strain without pulverization, provide good electronic contact and conduction, and display short lithium insertion distances. We achieved the theoretical charge capacity for silicon anodes and maintained a discharge capacity close to 75% of this maximum, with little fading during cycling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"Graphene devices on standard SiO2 substrates are highly disordered, exhibiting characteristics that are far inferior to the expected intrinsic properties of graphene(1-12). Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality(13,14), this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2. These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity. The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics(15) and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"We introduce the 2D counterpart of layered black phosphorus, which we call phosphorene, as an unexplored p-type semiconducting material. Same as graphene and MoS2, single-layer phosphorene is flexible and can be mechanically exfoliated. We find phosphorene to be stable and, unlike graphene, to have an inherent, direct, and appreciable band gap. Our ab initio calculations indicate that the band gap is direct, depends on the number of layers and the in-layer strain, and is significantly larger than the bulk value of 0.31-036 eV. The observed photoluminescence peak of single-layer phosphorene in the visible optical range confirms that the band gap is larger than that of the bulk system. Our transport studies indicate a hole mobility that reflects the structural anisotropy of phosphorene and complements n-type MoS2. At room temperature, our few-layer phosphorene field-effect transistors with 1.0 mu m channel length display a high on-current of 194 mA/mm, a high hole field-effect mobility of 286 cm(2) N.s, and an on/off ratio of up to 10(4). We demonstrate the possibility of phosphorene integration by constructing a 2D CMOS inverter consisting of phosphorene PMOS and MoS2 NMOS transistors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"Bulk metallic materials have ordinarily been produced:by melting and solidification processes for the last several thousand years. However, metallic liquid is unstable at temperatures below the melting temperature and solidifies immediately into crystalline phases. Consequently, all bulk engineering alloys are composed of a crystalline structure. Recently, this common concept was exploded by the findings of the stabilization phenomenon of the supercooled liquid for a number of alloys in the Mg-, lanthanide-, Zr-, Ti-, Fe-, Co-, Pd-Cu- and Ni-based systems. The alloys with the stabilized, supercooled liquid state have three features in their alloy components, i.e. multicomponent systems, significant atomic size ratios above 12%, and negative heats of mixing. The stabilization mechanism has also been investigated from experimental data of structure analyses and fundamental physical properties. The stabilization has enabled the production of bulk amorphous alloys in the thickness range of 1-100 mm by using various casting processes. Bulk amorphous Zr-based alloys exhibit high mechanical strength, high fracture toughness and good corrosion resistance and have been used for sporting goods materials. The stabilization also leads to the appearance of a large supercooled liquid region before crystallization and enables high-strain rate super-plasticity through Newtonian flow. The new Fe- and Go-based amorphous alloys exhibit a large super-cooled liquid region and good soft magnetic properties which are characterized by low coercive force and high permeability. Furthermore, homogeneous dispersion of nanoscale -particles into Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys was found to cause an improvement of tensile strength without detriment to good ductility. The discovery of the stabilization phenomenon, followed by the clarification of the stabilization criteria of the supercooled liquid, will promise the future definite development of bulk amorphous alloys as new basic science and engineering materials.

27,"Nanoparticles containing magnetic materials, such as magnetite ( Fe3O4), are particularly useful for imaging and separation techniques. As these nanoparticles are generally considered to be biologically and chemically inert, they are typically coated with metal catalysts, antibodies or enzymes to increase their functionality as separation agents. Here, we report that magnetite nanoparticles in fact possess an intrinsic enzyme mimetic activity similar to that found in natural peroxidases, which are widely used to oxidize organic substrates in the treatment of wastewater or as detection tools. Based on this finding, we have developed a novel immunoassay in which antibody-modified magnetite nanoparticles provide three functions: capture, separation and detection.

29,"Fully exploiting the properties of graphene will require a method for the mass production of this remarkable material. Two main routes are possible: large-scale growth or large-scale exfoliation. Here, we demonstrate graphene dispersions with concentrations up to similar to 0.01 mg ml(-1), produced by dispersion and exfoliation of graphite in organic solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone. This is possible because the energy required to exfoliate graphene is balanced by the solvent-graphene interaction for solvents whose surface energies match that of graphene. We confirm the presence of individual graphene sheets by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. Our method results in a monolayer yield of similar to 1 wt%, which could potentially be improved to 7-12 wt% with further processing. The absence of defects or oxides is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron, infrared and Raman spectroscopies. We are able to produce semi-transparent conducting films and conducting composites.

30,"The Li-S battery has been under intense scrutiny for over two decades, as it offers the possibility of high gravimetric capacities and theoretical energy densities ranging up to a factor of five beyond conventional Li-ion systems. Herein, we report the feasibility to approach such capacities by creating highly ordered interwoven composites. The conductive mesoporous carbon framework precisely constrains sulphur nanofiller growth within its channels and generates essential electrical contact to the insulating sulphur. The structure provides access to Li+ ingress/egress for reactivity with the sulphur, and we speculate that the kinetic inhibition to diffusion within the framework and the sorption properties of the carbon aid in trapping the polysulphides formed during redox. Polymer modification of the carbon surface further provides a chemical gradient that retards diffusion of these large anions out of the electrode, thus facilitating more complete reaction. Reversible capacities up to 1,320m Ah g(-1) are attained. The assembly process is simple and broadly applicable, conceptually providing new opportunities for materials scientists for tailored design that can be extended to many different electrode materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"Excitonic solar cells(1)-including organic, hybrid organic inorganic and dye-sensitized cells (DSCs)-are promising devices for inexpensive, large-scale solar energy conversion. The DSC is currently the most efficient(2) and stable(3) excitonic photocell. Central to this device is a thick nanoparticle film that provides a large surface area for the adsorption of light-harvesting molecules. However, nanoparticle DSCs rely on trap-limited diffusion for electron transport, a slow mechanism that can limit device efficiency, especially at longer wavelengths. Here we introduce a version of the dye-sensitized cell in which the traditional nanoparticle film is replaced by a dense array of oriented, crystalline ZnO nanowires. The nanowire anode is synthesized by mild aqueous chemistry and features a surface area up to one-fifth as large as a nanoparticle cell. The direct electrical pathways provided by the nanowires ensure the rapid collection of carriers generated throughout the device, and a full Sun efficiency of 1.5% is demonstrated, limited primarily by the surface area of the nanowire array.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"Converting solar energy into electricity provides a much-needed solution to the energy crisis the world is facing today. Polymer solar cells have shown potential to harness solar energy in a cost-effective way. Significant efforts are underway to improve their efficiency to the level of practical applications. Here, we report highly efficient polymer solar cells based on a bulk heterojunction of polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) and methanofullerene. Controlling the active layer growth rate results in an increased hole mobility and balanced charge transport. Together with increased absorption in the active layer, this results in much-improved device performance, particularly in external quantum efficiency. The power-conversion efficiency of 4.4% achieved here is the highest published so far for polymer-based solar cells. The solution process involved ensures that the fabrication cost remains low and the processing is simple. The high efficiency achieved in this work brings these devices one step closer to commercialization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"The paper presents a revolutionary framework for the modeling, detection, characterization, identification, and machine-learning of anomalous behavior in observed phenomena arising from a large class of unknown and uncertain dynamical systems. An evolved behavior would in general be very difficult to correct unless the specific anomalous event that caused such behavior can be detected early, and any consequence attributed to the specific anomaly following its detection. Substantial investigative time and effort is required to back-track the cause for abnormal behavior and to recreate the event sequence leading to such abnormal behavior. The need to automatically detect anomalous behavior is therefore critical using principles of state motion, and to do so with a human operator in the loop. Human-machine interaction results in a capability for machine self-learning and in producing a robust decision-support mechanism. This is the fundamental concept of intelligent control wherein machine-learning is enhanced by interaction with human operators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Samples of the iron oxides Fe0.94O, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, and Fe2SiO4 were prepared by high temperature equilibration in controlled gas atmospheres. The samples were fractured in vacuum and high resolution XPS spectra of the fractured surfaces were measured. The peak positions and peak shape parameters of Fe 3p for Fe2+ and Fe3+ were derived from the Fe 3p XPS spectra of the standard samples of 2FeO center dot SiO2 and Fe2O3, respectively. Using these parameters, the Fe 3p peaks of Fe3O4 and Fe1-yO are analysed. The results indicate that high resolution XPS techniques can be used to determine the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios in metal oxides. The technique has the potential for application to other transition metal oxide systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"Nanotechnology is expected to open new avenues to fight and prevent disease using atomic scale tailoring of materials. Among the most promising nanomaterials with antibacterial properties are metallic nanoparticles, which exhibit increased chemical activity due to their large surface to volume ratios and crystallographic surface structure. The study of bactericidal nanomaterials is particularly timely considering the recent increase of new resistant strains of bacteria to the most potent antibiotics. This has promoted research in the well known activity of silver ions and silver-based compounds, including silver nanoparticles. The present work studies the effect of silver nanoparticles in the range of 1-100 nm on Gram-negative bacteria using high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Our results indicate that the bactericidal properties of the nanoparticles are size dependent, since the only nanoparticles that present a direct interaction with the bacteria preferentially have a diameter of similar to 1-10 nm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"In this work we present a low cost and scalable technique, via ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on polycrystalline Ni films, to fabricate large area (similar to cm(2)) films of single- to few-layer graphene and to transfer the films to nonspecific substrates. These films consist of regions of 1 to similar to 12 graphene layers. Single- or bilayer regions can be up to 20 mu m in lateral size. The films are continuous over the entire area and can be patterned lithographically or by prepatterning the underlying Ni film. The transparency, conductivity, and ambipolar transfer characteristics of the films suggest their potential as another materials candidate for electronics and opto-electronic applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"Catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are at the heart of key renewable-energy technologies including fuel cells and water splitting. Despite tremendous efforts, developing oxygen electrode catalysts with high activity at low cost remains a great challenge. Here, we report a hybrid material consisting of Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on reduced graphene oxide as a high-performance bi-functional catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although Co3O4 or graphene oxide alone has little catalytic activity, their hybrid exhibits an unexpected, surprisingly high ORR activity that is further enhanced by nitrogen doping of graphene. The Co3O4/N-doped graphene hybrid exhibits similar catalytic activity but superior stability to Pt in alkaline solutions. The same hybrid is also highly active for OER, making it a high-performance non-precious metal-based bi-catalyst for both ORR and OER. The unusual catalytic activity arises from synergetic chemical coupling effects between Co3O4 and graphene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"We describe an ab initio method for calculating the electronic structure, electronic transport, and forces acting on the atoms, for atomic scale systems connected to semi-infinite electrodes and with an applied voltage bias. Our method is based on the density-functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the well tested SIESTA approach (which uses nonlocal norm-conserving pseudopotentials to describe the effect of the core electrons, and linear combination of finite-range numerical atomic orbitals to describe the valence states). We fully deal with the atomistic structure of the whole system, treating both the contact and the electrodes on the same footing. The effect of the finite bias (including self-consistency and the solution of the electrostatic problem) is taken into account using nonequilibrium Green's functions. We relate the nonequilibrium Green's function expressions to the more transparent scheme involving the scattering states. As an illustration, the method is applied to three systems where we are able to compare our results to earlier ab initio DFT calculations or experiments, and we point out differences between this method and existing schemes. The systems considered are: (i) single atom carbon wires connected to aluminum electrodes with extended or finite cross section, (ii) single atom gold wires, and finally (iii) large carbon nanotube systems with point defects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"Recently a new, large family of two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides and carbonitrides, called MXenes, was discovered. MXenes are produced by selective etching of the A element from the MAX phases, which are metallically conductive, layered solids connected by strong metallic, ionic, and covalent bonds, such as Ti2AlC, Ti3AlC2, and Ta4AlC3. MXenes combine the metallic conductivity of transition metal carbides with the hydrophilic nature of their hydroxyl or oxygen terminated surfaces. In essence, they behave as conductive clays. This article reviews progressboth experimental and theoreticalon their synthesis, structure, properties, intercalation, delamination, and potential applications. MXenes are expected to be good candidates for a host of applications. They have already shown promising performance in electrochemical energy storage systems. A detailed outlook for future research on MXenes is also presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The measurements were carried out using either nanocrystals purified with monitored purification procedures or nanocrystals prepared through controlled etching methods. The nature of the surface ligands, the refractive index of the solvents, the PL quantum yield of the nanocrystals, the methods used for the synthesis of the nanocrystals, and the temperature for the measurements all did not show detectable influence on the extinction coefficient for a given sized nanocrystal within experimental error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"Charges induced in triboelectric process are usually referred as a negative effect either in scientific research or technological applications, and they are wasted energy in many cases. Here, we demonstrate a simple, low cost and effective approach of using the charging process in friction to convert mechanical energy into electric power for driving small electronics. The triboelectric generator (TEG) is fabricated by stacking two polymer sheets made of materials having distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with metal films deposited on the top and bottom of the assembled structure. Once subjected to mechanical deformation, a friction between the two films, owing to the nano-scale surface roughness, generates equal amount but opposite signs of charges at two sides. Thus, a triboelectric potential layer is formed at the interface region, which serves as a charge ""pump"" for driving the flow of electrons in the external toad if there is a variation in the capacitance of the system. Such a flexible polymer TEG gives an output voltage of up to 3.3 V at a power density of similar to 10.4 mW/cm(3). TEGs have the potential of harvesting energy from human activities, rotating tires, ocean waves, mechanical vibration and more, with great applications in self-powered systems for personal electronics, environmental monitoring, medical science and even large-scale power.

43,"Recently, non-fullerene n-type organic semiconductors have attracted significant attention as acceptors in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) due to their great potential to realize high-power conversion efficiencies. The rational design of the central fused ring unit of these acceptor molecules is crucial to maximize device performance. Here, we report a new class of non-fullerene acceptor, Y6, that employs a ladder-type electron-deficient-core-based central fused ring (dithienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole) with a benzothiadiazole (BT) core to fine-tune its absorption and electron affinity. OPVs made from Y6 in conventional and inverted architectures each exhibited a high efficiency of 15.7%, measured in two separate labs. Inverted device structures were certified at Enli Tech Laboratory demonstrated an efficiency of 14.9%. We further observed that the Y6-based devices maintain a high efficiency of 13.6% with an active layer thickness of 300 nm. The electron-deficient-core-based fused ring reported in this work opens a new door in the molecular design of high-performance acceptors for OPVs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"A method is used for preparing gold NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 10 for which the surface plasmon absorption maxima are between 600 and 1300 nm. This method has been adapted from a previously published seed-mediated growth method (Jana et al. Adv. Mater. 2001, 13, 1389). The disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e., formation of noncylindrical NRs, phi-shaped particles, and formation of a large fraction of spherical particles) have been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one. In a single-component surfactant system, the silver content of the growth solution was used to grow NRs to a desired length. This results in reproducible formation of NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. To grow longer NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown in this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs. Effects of the silver ion and the cosurfactant along with the growth mechanism of NRs are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"By applying the specific fabrication conditions summarized in the Experimental section and post-production annealing at 150 degrees C, polymer solar cells with power-conversion efficiency approaching 5 % are demonstrated. These devices exhibit remarkable thermal stability. We attribute the improved performance to changes in the bulk heterojunction material induced by thermal annealing. The improved nanoscale morphology, the increased crystallinity of the semiconducting polymer, and the improved contact to the electron-collecting electrode facilitate charge generation, charge transport to, and charge collection at the electrodes, thereby enhancing the device efficiency by lowering the series resistance of the polymer solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"Two-dimensional materials are an emerging class of new materials with a wide range of electrical properties and potential practical applications. Although graphene(1) is the most well-studied two-dimensional material, single layers of other materials, such as insulating BN (ref. 2) and semiconducting MoS2 (refs 3,4) or WSe2 (refs 5,6), are gaining increasing attention as promising gate insulators and channel materials for field-effect transistors. Because monolayer MoS2 is a direct-bandgap semiconductor(7,8) due to quantum-mechanical confinement(7,9,10), it could be suitable for applications in optoelectronic devices where the direct bandgap would allow a high absorption coefficient and efficient electron-hole pair generation under photo-excitation. Here, we demonstrate ultrasensitive monolayer MoS2 phototransistors with improved device mobility and ON current. Our devices show a maximum external photoresponsivity of 880 AW(-1) at a wavelength of 561 nm and a photoresponse in the 400-680 nm range. With recent developments in large-scale production techniques such as liquid-scale exfoliation(11-13) and chemical vapour deposition-like growth(14,15), MoS2 shows important potential for applications in MoS2-based integrated optoelectronic circuits, light sensing, biomedical imaging, video recording and spectroscopy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"Pseudocapacitance is commonly associated with surface or near-surface reversible redox reactions, as observed with RuO2 center dot xH(2)O in an acidic electrolyte. However, we recently demonstrated that a pseudocapacitive mechanism occurs when lithium ions are inserted into mesoporous and nanocrystal films of orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T-Nb2O5; refs 1,2). Here, we quantify the kinetics of charge storage in T-Nb2O5: currents that vary inversely with time, charge-storage capacity that is mostly independent of rate, and redox peaks that exhibit small voltage offsets even at high rates. We also define the structural characteristics necessary for this process, termed intercalation pseudocapacitance, which are a crystalline network that offers two-dimensional transport pathways and little structural change on intercalation. The principal benefit realized from intercalation pseudocapacitance is that high levels of charge storage are achieved within short periods of time because there are no limitations from solid-state diffusion. Thick electrodes (up to 40 mu m thick) prepared with T-Nb2O5 offer the promise of exploiting intercalation pseudocapacitance to obtain high-rate charge-storage devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene. Different reduction processes result in different properties of reduced GO (rGO), which in turn affect the final performance of materials or devices composed of rGO. In this contribution, we review the state-of-art status of the reduction of GO on both techniques and mechanisms. The development in this field will speed the applications of graphene.

51,"The advantages in using nanostructured materials for electrochemical energy storage have largely focused on the benefits associated with short path lengths. In this paper, we consider another contribution, that of the capacitive effects, which become increasingly important at nanoscale dimensions. Nanocrystalline TiO2 (anatase) was studied over a dimensional regime where both capacitive and lithium intercalation processes contribute to the total stored charge. An analysis of the voltammetric sweep data was used to distinguish between the amount of charge stored by these two processes. At particle sizes below 10 nm, capacitive contributions became increasingly important, leading to greater amounts of total stored charge (gravimetrically normalized) with decreasing TiO2 particle size. The area normalized capacitance was determined to be well above 100,mu F/cm(2), confirming that the capacitive contribution was pseudocapacitive in nature. Moreover, reducing the particle size to the nanoscale regime led to faster charge/discharge rates because the diffusion-controlled lithium ion intercalation process was replaced by faradaic reactions which occur at the surface of the material. The charge storage and kinetics benefits derived from using nanoscale metal oxides provide an interesting direction for the design of materials that offer both power density and energy density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) of single- and few-layer thickness was exfoliated on SiO2/Si substrate and characterized by Raman spectroscopy. The number of S-Mo-S layers of the samples was independently determined by contact-mode atomic force microscopy. Two Raman modes, E-2g(1) and A(1g), exhibited sensitive thickness dependence, with the frequency of the former decreasing and that of the latter increasing with thickness. The results provide a convenient and reliable means for determining layer thickness with atomic-level precision. The opposite direction of the frequency shifts, which cannot be explained solely by van der Waals interlayer coupling, is attributed to Coulombic interactions and possible stacking-induced changes of the intralayer bonding. This work exemplifies the evolution of structural parameters in layered materials in changing from the three-dimensional to the two-dimensional regime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance.

We used CH3NH3 Pb(I1-xBrx)(3) (x = 0.1-0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of gamma-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis.

57,"We investigate novel phases that emerge from the interplay of electron correlations and strong spin-orbit interactions. We focus on describing the topological semimetal, a three-dimensional phase of a magnetic solid, and argue that it may be realized in a class of pyrochlore iridates (such as Y(2)Ir(2)O(7)) based on calculations using the LDA + U method. This state is a three-dimensional analog of graphene with linearly dispersing excitations and provides a condensed-matter realization of Weyl fermions that obeys a two-component Dirac equation. It also exhibits remarkable topological properties manifested by surface states in the form of Fermi arcs, which are impossible to realize in purely two-dimensional band structures. For intermediate correlation strengths, we find this to be the ground state of the pyrochlore iridates, coexisting with noncollinear magnetic order.

60,"The status of ambient temperature sodium ion batteries is reviewed in light of recent developments in anode, electrolyte and cathode materials. These devices, although early in their stage of development, are promising for large-scale grid storage applications due to the abundance and very low cost of sodium-containing precursors used to make the components. The engineering knowledge developed recently for highly successful Li ion batteries can be leveraged to ensure rapid progress in this area, although different electrode materials and electrolytes will be required for dual intercalation systems based on sodium. In particular, new anode materials need to be identified, since the graphite anode, commonly used in lithium systems, does not intercalate sodium to any appreciable extent. A wider array of choices is available for cathodes, including high performance layered transition metal oxides and polyanionic compounds. Recent developments in electrodes are encouraging, but a great deal of research is necessary, particularly in new electrolytes, and the understanding of the SEI films. The engineering modeling calculations of Na-ion battery energy density indicate that 210 Wh kg1 in gravimetric energy is possible for Na-ion batteries compared to existing Li-ion technology if a cathode capacity of 200 mAh g1 and a 500 mAh g1 anode can be discovered with an average cell potential of 3.3 V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

62,"Recent developments in conjugated-polymer-based photovoltaic elements are reviewed. The photophysics of such photoactive devices is based on the photo-induced charge transfer from donor-type semiconducting conjugated polymers to acceptor-type conjugated polymers or acceptor molecules such as Buckminsterfullerene, C-60. This photo-induced charge transfer is reversible, ultrafast (within 100 fs) with a quantum efficiency approaching unity, and the charge-separated state is metastable (up to milliseconds at 80 K). Being similar to the first steps in natural photosynthesis, this photo-induced electron transfer leads To a number of potentially interesting applications, which include sensitization of the photoconductivity and photovoltaic phenomena.

63,"The van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of M. Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] is a promising approach for including dispersion in approximate density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals. Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature. However, despite many applications, standard general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional ""hard"" matter such asmetals, ionic compounds, and insulators are lacking. Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and molecules on the surfaces of solids. Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring. We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers. However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs. Although the tests reported here are for hard solids, not normally materials for which dispersion forces are thought to be important, we find a systematic improvement in cohesive properties for the alkali metals and alkali halides when nonlocal correlations are accounted for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"Batteries are a key technology in modern society(1,2). They are used to power electric and hybrid electric vehicles and to store wind and solar energy in smart grids. Electrochemical devices with high energy and power densities can currently be powered only by batteries with organic liquid electrolytes. However, such batteries require relatively stringent safety precautions, making large-scale systems very complicated and expensive. The application of solid electrolytes is currently limited because they attain practically useful conductivities (10(-2) S cm(-1)) only at 50-80 degrees C, which is one order of magnitude lower than those of organic liquid electrolytes(3-8). Here, we report a lithium superionic conductor, Li(10)GeP(2)S(12) that has a new three-dimensional framework structure. It exhibits an extremely high lithium ionic conductivity of 12 mS cm(-1) at room temperature. This represents the highest conductivity achieved in a solid electrolyte, exceeding even those of liquid organic electrolytes. This new solid-state battery electrolyte has many advantages in terms of device fabrication (facile shaping, patterning and integration), stability (non-volatile), safety (non-explosive) and excellent electrochemical properties (high conductivity and wide potential window)(9-11).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"Targeting nanoparticles to malignant tissues for improved diagnosis and therapy is a popular concept. However, after surveying the literature from the past 10 years, only 0.7% (median) of the administered nanoparticle dose is found to be delivered to a solid tumour. This has negative consequences on the translation of nanotechnology for human use with respect to manufacturing, cost, toxicity, and imaging and therapeutic efficacy. In this article, we conduct a multivariate analysis on the compiled data to reveal the contributions of nanoparticle physicochemical parameters, tumour models and cancer types on the low delivery efficiency. We explore the potential causes of the poor delivery efficiency from the perspectives of tumour biology (intercellular versus transcellular transport, enhanced permeability and retention effect, and physicochemical-dependent nanoparticle transport through the tumour stroma) as well as competing organs (mononuclear phagocytic and renal systems) and present a 30-year research strategy to overcome this fundamental limitation.

66,"In the domain of health, one important challenge is the efficient delivery of drugs in the body using non-toxic nanocarriers. Most of the existing carrier materials show poor drug loading (usually less than 5 wt% of the transported drug versus the carrier material) and/or rapid release of the proportion of the drug that is simply adsorbed (or anchored) at the external surface of the nanocarrier. In this context, porous hybrid solids, with the ability to tune their structures and porosities for better drug interactions and high loadings, are well suited to serve as nanocarriers for delivery and imaging applications. Here we show that specific non-toxic porous iron(III)-based metal-organic frameworks with engineered cores and surfaces, as well as imaging properties, function as superior nanocarriers for efficient controlled delivery of challenging antitumoural and retroviral drugs (that is, busulfan, azidothymidine triphosphate, doxorubicin or cidofovir) against cancer and AIDS. In addition to their high loadings, they also potentially associate therapeutics and diagnostics, thus opening the way for theranostics, or personalized patient treatments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several band combinations for spectral analysis have been tested, and a combination of four Lorentzian-shaped bands (G, D1, D2, D4) at about 1580, 1350, 1620, and 1200 cm(-1), respectively, with a Gaussian-shaped band (W) at similar to 1500 cm(-1) was best suited for the first-order spectra. The second-order spectra were best fitted with Lorentzian-shaped bands at about 2450, 2700, 2900, and 3100 cm(-1). Spectral parameters (band positions, full widths at half maximum, and intensity ratios) are reported for several types of industrial carbon black (Degussa Printex, Cabot Monarch), diesel soot (particulate matter from modern heavy duty vehicle and passenger car engine exhaust, NIST SRM1650), spark-discharge soot (Palas GfG100), and graphite. Several parameters, in particular the width of the D1 band at similar to 1350 cm(-1), provide structural information and allow to discriminate the sample materials, but the characterisation and distinction of different types of soot is limited by the experimental reproducibility of the spectra and the statistical uncertainties of curve fitting. The results are discussed and compared with X-ray diffraction measurements and earlier Raman spectroscopic studies of comparable materials, where different measurement and fitting procedures had been applied.

71,"Nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) was synthesized by chemical vapor deposition of methane in the presence of ammonia. The resultant N-graphene was demonstrated to act as a metal-free electrode with a much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than platinum for oxygen reduction via a four-electron pathway in alkaline fuel cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of graphene and its derivatives as metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction. The important role of N-doping to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) can be applied to various carbon materials for the development of other metal-free efficient ORR catalysts for fuel cell applications, even new catalytic materials for applications beyond fuel cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,A density functional theory database of hydrogen chemisorption energies on close packed surfaces of a number of transition and noble metals is presented. The bond energies are used to understand the trends in the exchange current for hydrogen evolution. A volcano curve is obtained when measured exchange currents are plotted as a function of the calculated hydrogen adsorption energies and a simple kinetic model is developed to understand the origin of the volcano. The volcano curve is also consistent with Pt being the most efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. (c) 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

73,"Herein we report on the synthesis of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and carbonitrides by immersing select MAX phase powders in hydrofluoric acid, HF. The MAX phases represent a large (>60 members) family of ternary, layered, machinable transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides. Herein we present evidence for the exfoliation of the following MAX phases: Ti2AlC, Ta4AlC3, (Ti-0.5,Nb-0.5)(2)AlC, (V-0.5,Cr-0.5)(3)AlC2, and Ti3AlCN by the simple immersion of their powders, at room temperature, in HF of varying concentrations for times varying between 10 and 72 h followed by sonication. The removal of the ""A"" group layer from the MAX phases results in 2-D layers that we are labeling MXenes to denote the loss of the A element and emphasize their structural similarities with graphene. The sheet resistances of the MXenes were found to be comparable to multilayer graphene. Contact angle measurements with water on pressed MXene surfaces showed hydrophilic behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

75,"Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is systematically studied using Raman spectroscopy with ultraviolet and visible laser lines. It is shown that only the Raman frequencies of E-2g(1) and A(1g) peaks vary monotonously with the layer number of ultrathin MoS2 flakes, while intensities or widths of the peaks vary arbitrarily. The coupling between electronic transitions and phonons are found to become weaker when the layer number of MoS2 decreases, attributed to the increased electronic transition energies or elongated intralayer atomic bonds in ultrathin MoS2. The asymmetric Raman peak at 454 cm-1, which has been regarded as the overtone of longitudinal optical M phonons in bulk MoS2, is actually a combinational band involving a longitudinal acoustic mode (LA(M)) and an optical mode (A(2u)). Our findings suggest a clear evolution of the coupling between electronic transition and phonon when MoS2 is scaled down from three- to two-dimensional geometry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,"Solid-state light-emitting devices based on direct-bandgap semiconductors have, over the past two decades, been utilized as energy-efficient sources of lighting. However, fabrication of these devices typically relies on expensive high-temperature and high-vacuum processes, rendering them uneconomical for use in large-area displays(1,2). Here, we report high-brightness light-emitting diodes based on solution-processed organometal halide perovskites. We demonstrate electroluminescence in the near-infrared, green and red by tuning the halide compositions in the perovskite. In our infrared device, a thin 15 nm layer of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite emitter is sandwiched between larger-bandgap titanium dioxide (TiO2) and poly(9,9'-dioctyl-fluorene) (F8) layers, effectively confining electrons and holes in the perovskite layer for radiative recombination. We report an infrared radiance of 13.2 W sr(-1) m(-2) at a current density of 363 mA cm(-2), with highest external and internal quantum efficiencies of 0.76% and 3.4%, respectively. In our green light-emitting device with an ITO/PEDOT: PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/F8/Ca/Ag structure, we achieved a luminance of 364 cd m(-2) at a current density of 123 mA cm(-2), giving external and internal quantum efficiencies of 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. We show, using photoluminescence studies, that radiative bimolecular recombination is dominant at higher excitation densities. Hence, the quantum efficiencies of the perovskite light-emitting diodes increase at higher current densities. This demonstration of effective perovskite electroluminescence offers scope for developing this unique class of materials into efficient and colour-tunable light emitters for low-cost display, lighting and optical communication applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"Chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of first row transition metals and their oxides and hydroxides is challenging due to the complexity of the 2p spectra resulting from peak asymmetries, complex multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structure, and uncertain, overlapping binding energies. A review of current literature shows that all values necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis are usually not provided. This paper reports a more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve-fitting the various chemical states in a variety of Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn metals, oxides and hydroxides. The curve-fitting procedures proposed are based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of the literature references, and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. Binding energies, full-width at half maximum (FWHM) values, spin-orbit splitting values, asymmetric peak-shape fitting parameters, and, for Cu and Zn, Auger parameters values are presented. The quantification procedure for Cu species details the use of the shake-up satellites for Cu(II)-containing compounds and the exact binding energies of the Cu(0) and Cu(I) peaks. The use of the modified Auger parameter for Cu and Zn species allows for corroborating evidence when there is uncertainty in the binding energy assignment. These procedures can remove uncertainties in analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78,"Integration of individual two-dimensional graphene sheets(1-3) into macroscopic structures is essential for the application of graphene. A series of graphene-based composites(4-6) and macroscopic structures(7-11) have been recently fabricated using chemically derived graphene sheets. However, these composites and structures suffer from poor electrical conductivity because of the low quality and/or high inter-sheet junction contact resistance of the chemically derived graphene sheets. Here we report the direct synthesis of three-dimensional foam-like graphene macrostructures, which we call graphene foams (GFs), by template-directed chemical vapour deposition. A GF consists of an interconnected flexible network of graphene as the fast transport channel of charge carriers for high electrical conductivity. Even with a GF loading as low as similar to 0.5 wt%, GF/poly(dimethyl siloxane) composites show a very high electrical conductivity of similar to 10 S cm(-1), which is similar to 6 orders of magnitude higher than chemically derived graphene-based composites(4). Using this unique network structure and the outstanding electrical and mechanical properties of GFs, as an example, we demonstrate the great potential of GF/poly(dimethyl siloxane) composites for flexible, foldable and stretchable conductors(12).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

80,"To investigate the mechanism of inhibition of silver ions on microorganisms, two strains of bacteria, namely Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), were treated with AgNO3 and studied using combined electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis. Similar morphological changes occurred in both E.coli and S. aureus cells after Ag+ treatment. The cytoplasm membrane detached from the cell wall. A remarkable electron-light region appeared in the center of the cells, which contained condensed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. There are many small electron-dense granules either surrounding the cell wall or depositing inside the cells. The existence of elements of silver and sulfur in the electron-dense granules and cytoplasm detected by X-ray microanalysis suggested the antibacterial mechanism of silver: DNA lost its replication ability and the protein became inactivated after Ag+ treatment. The slighter morphological changes of S. aureus compared with E. coli recommended a defense system of S. aureus against the inhibitory effects of Ag+ ions.

81,"A two-dimensional crystal of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayer is a photoluminescent direct gap semiconductor in striking contrast to its bulk counterpart. Exfoliation of bulk MoS2 via Li intercalation is an attractive route to large-scale synthesis of monolayer crystals. However, this method results in loss of pristine semiconducting properties of MoS2 due to structural changes that occur during Li intercalation. Here, we report structural and electronic properties of chemically exfoliated MoS2. The metastable metallic phase that emerges from Li intercalation was found to dominate the properties of as-exfoliated material, but mild annealing leads to gradual restoration of the semiconducting phase. Above an annealing temperature of 300 degrees C, chemically exfoliated MoS2 exhibit prominent band gap photoluminescence, similar to mechanically exfoliated monolayers, indicating that their semiconducting properties are largely restored.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that these physical behaviors at the transition are well described using the Landau free-energy expansion parametrized by the first-principles calculations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have been classified according to the atomic size difference. heat of mixing (Delta H-mix) and period of the constituent elements in the periodic table. The BMGs discovered to date are classified into seven groups on the basis of a previous result by Inoue. The seven groups are as follows: (G-I) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM-Al/Ga, (G-II) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM-Metalloid (G-III) Al/Ga-LTM/BM-Metalloid, (G-IV) IIA-ETM/Ln-LTM/BM, (G-V) LTM/BM-Metalloid, (G-VI) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM and (G-VII) IIA-LTM/BM. where ETM. Ln, LTM, BM and IIA refer to early transition, lantlianide, late transition, group IIIB-IVB and group IIA-group metals, respectively. The main alloying element of ternary G-I, G-V and G-VII, ternary G-II and G-IV, and tertiary G-VI BMGs is the largest, intermediate and smallest atomic radius compared to the other alloying elements, respectively. The main alloying element of tertiary BMGs belonging to G-I. G-V. G-VI and G-VII is an element in the atomic pair with the largest and negative value of Delta H-mix (<(Delta H)under bar >(mix)(LN)). while the main element of ternary BMGs belonging to G-II and G-IV is independent of the atomic pair with <(Delta H)under bar >(mix)(LN). The characteristics of the main element derived for the ternary BMGs are directly applicable to multicomponent BMGs belonging to G-I. G-II, G-IV (Mg-based BMGs), G-V and G-VII. The main element can be the larger-sized element in the atomic pair with <(Delta H)under bar >(mix)(LN) or in the same group as the other elements for multicomponent BMGs belonging to G-III. G-IV (Be-containing Zr-based BMG) and G-VI. The main element of BMGs belonging to G-VI tends to change from the element with the smallest atomic radius in a ternary system to an element with a relatively large atomic size in a in multicomponent system. The change is due to an increase in glass-forming ability through multicomponent alloying of BMGs belonging to G-VI. The results of the classification of BMGs obtained in the present study are important for further development of BMGs, with the results providing a road map for the development of new BMG compositions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"Software for calculation of phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties have been developed since the 1970's. Software and computers have now developed to a level where such calculations can be used as tools for material and process development. In the present paper some of the latest software developments at Thermo-Calc Software are presented together with application examples. It is shown how advanced thermodynamic calculations have become more accessible since: - A more user-friendly windows version of Thermo-Calc, TCW, has been developed. - There is an increasing amount of thermodynamic databases for different materials available. - Thermo-Calc can be accessed from user-written software through several different programming interfaces are available which enables access to the thermodynamic software from a user-written software. Accurate data for thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria can then easily be incorporated into software written in e.g. C++, Matlab and FORTRAN. Thermo-Calc Software also produces DICTRA, a software for simulation of diffusion controlled phase transformations. Using DICTRA it is possible to simulate processes such as homogenization, carburising, microsegregation and coarsening in multicomponent alloys.

85,"Topological insulators are materials with a bulk excitation gap generated by the spin-orbit interaction that are different from conventional insulators. This distinction is characterized by Z(2) topological invariants, which characterize the ground state. In two dimensions, there is a single Z(2) invariant that distinguishes the ordinary insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase. In three dimensions, there are four Z(2) invariants that distinguish the ordinary insulator from ""weak"" and ""strong"" topological insulators. These phases are characterized by the presence of gapless surface (or edge) states. In the two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall phase and the three-dimensional strong topological insulator, these states are robust and are insensitive to weak disorder and interactions. In this paper, we show that the presence of inversion symmetry greatly simplifies the problem of evaluating the Z(2) invariants. We show that the invariants can be determined from the knowledge of the parity of the occupied Bloch wave functions at the time-reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone. Using this approach, we predict a number of specific materials that are strong topological insulators, including the semiconducting alloy Bi1-xSbx as well as alpha-Sn and HgTe under uniaxial strain. This paper also includes an expanded discussion of our formulation of the topological insulators in both two and three dimensions, as well as implications for experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,"Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides (MXenes) were discovered in 2011. Since the original discovery, more than 20 different compositions have been synthesized by the selective etching of MAX phase and other precursors and many more theoretically predicted. They offer a variety of different properties, making the family promising candidates in a wide range of applications, such as energy storage, electromagnetic interference shielding, water purification, electrocatalysis, and medicine. These solution-processable materials have the potential to be highly scalable, deposited by spin, spray, or dip coating, painted or printed, or fabricated in a variety of ways. Due to this promise, the amount of research on MXenes has been increasing, and methods of synthesis and processing are expanding quickly. The fast evolution, of the material can also be noticed in the wide range of synthesis and processing protocols that determine the yield of delamination, as well as the quality of the 2D flakes produced. Here we describe the experimental methods and best practices we use to synthesize the most studied MXene, titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), using different etchants and delamination methods. We also explain effects of synthesis parameters on the size and quality of Ti3C2Tx and suggest the optimal processes for the desired application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"The pace of materials discovery for heterogeneous catalysts and electrocatalysts could, in principle, be accelerated by the development of efficient computational screening methods. This would require an integrated approach, where the catalytic activity and stability of new materials are evaluated and where predictions are benchmarked by careful synthesis and experimental tests. In this contribution, we present a density functional theory-based, high-throughput screening scheme that successfully uses these strategies to identify a new electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER). The activity of over 700 binary surface alloys is evaluated theoretically; the stability of each alloy in electrochemical environments is also estimated. BiPt is found to have a predicted activity comparable to, or even better than, pure Pt, the archetypical HER catalyst. This alloy is synthesized and tested experimentally and shows improved HER performance compared with pure Pt, in agreement with the computational screening results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,"Electronic and spintronic devices rely on the fact that free charge carriers in solids carry electric charge and spin. There are, however, other properties of charge carriers that might be exploited in new families of devices. In particular, if there are two or more minima in the conduction band (or maxima in the valence band) in momentum space, and if it is possible to confine charge carriers in one of these valleys, then it should be possible to make a valleytronic device(1-4). Valley polarization, as the selective population of one valley is designated, has been demonstrated using strain(5,6) and magnetic fields(7-10), but neither of these approaches allows dynamic control. Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve complete dynamic valley polarization in monolayer MoS2 (refs 11,12), a two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric crystal with direct energy gaps at two valleys(13-16). Moreover, this polarization is retained for longer than 1 ns. Our results, and similar results by Zeng et al.(17), demonstrate the viability of optical valley control and suggest the possibility of valley-based electronic and optoelectronic applications in MoS2 monolayers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using memristors as synapses in neuromorphic circuits can potentially offer both high connectivity and high density required for efficient computing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,"A new phototransistor based on the mechanically exfoliated single-layer MoS2 nanosheet is fabricated, and Its light-induced electric properties are investigated in detail. Photocurrent generated from the phototransistor is solely determined by the illuminated optical power at a constant drain or gate voltage. The switching behavior of photocurrent generation and annihilation can be completely finished within ca. 50 ms, and it shows good stability. Especially, the single-layer MoS2 phototransistor exhibits a better photoresponsivity as compared with the graphene-based device. The unique characteristics of Incident-light control, prompt photoswitching, and good photoresponsivity from the MoS2 phototransistor pave an avenue to develop the single-layer semiconducting materials for multifunctional optoelectronic device applications in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"A detailed analysis of the thermal expansion mechanism of graphite oxide to produce functionalized graphene sheets is provided. Exfoliation takes place when the decomposition rate of the epoxy and hydroxyl sites of graphite oxide exceeds the diffusion rate of the evolved gases, thus yielding pressures that exceed the van der Waals forces holding the graphene sheets together. A comparison of the Arrhenius dependence of the reaction rate against the calculated diffusion coefficient based on Knudsen diffusion suggests a critical temperature of 550 degrees C which must be exceeded for exfoliation to occur. As a result of their wrinkled nature, the functionalized and defective graphene sheets do not collapse back to graphite oxide but are highly agglomerated. After dispersion by ultrasonication in appropriate solvents, statistical analysis by atomic force microscopy shows that 80% of the observed flakes are single sheets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"Most electronic devices exploit the electric charge of electrons, but it is also possible to build devices that rely on other properties of electrons. Spintronic devices, for example, make use of the spin of electrons(1,2). Valleytronics is a more recent development that relies on the fact that the conduction bands of some materials have two or more minima at equal energies but at different positions in momentum space(3-5). To make a valleytronic device it is necessary to control the number of electrons in these valleys, thereby producing a valley polarization(6-11). Single-layer MoS2 is a promising material for valleytronics because both the conduction and valence band edges have two energy-degenerate valleys at the corners of the first Brillouin zone(12). Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve a valley polarization of 30% in pristine monolayer MoS2. Our results, and similar results by Mak et al.(13), demonstrate the viability of optical valley control and valley-based electronic and optoelectronic applications in MoS2 monolayers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"Graphitic (g)-C3N4 with a layered structure has the potential of forming graphene-like nanosheets with unusual physicochemical properties due to weak van der Waals forces between layers. Herein is shown that g-C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness of around 2 nm can be easily obtained by a simple top-down strategy, namely, thermal oxidation etching of bulk g-C3N4 in air. Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, the highly anisotropic 2D-nanosheets possess a high specific surface area of 306 m2 g-1, a larger bandgap (by 0.2 eV), improved electron transport ability along the in-plane direction, and increased lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers because of the quantum confinement effect.

94,"The recent discovery of graphene(1-3) has led to many advances in two-dimensional physics and devices(4,5). The graphene devices fabricated so far have relied on SiO2 back gating(1-3). Electrochemical top gating is widely used for polymer transistors(6,7), and has also been successfully applied to carbon nanotubes(8,9). Here we demonstrate a top-gated graphene transistor that is able to reach doping levels of up to 5x10(13) cm(-2), which is much higher than those previously reported. Such high doping levels are possible because the nanometre-thick Debye layer(8,10) in the solid polymer electrolyte gate provides a much higher gate capacitance than the commonly used SiO2 back gate, which is usually about 300 nm thick(11). In situ Raman measurements monitor the doping. The G peak stiffens and sharpens for both electron and hole doping, but the 2D peak shows a different response to holes and electrons. The ratio of the intensities of the G and 2D peaks shows a strong dependence on doping, making it a sensitive parameter to monitor the doping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

96,"A paradigm shift is taking place in medicine from using synthetic implants and tissue grafts to a tissue engineering approach that uses degradable porous material scaffolds integrated with biological cells or molecules to regenerate tissues. This new paradigm requires scaffolds that balance temporary mechanical function with mass transport to aid biological delivery and tissue regeneration. Little is known quantitatively about this balance as early scaffolds were not fabricated with precise porous architecture. Recent advances in both computational topology design ( CTD) and solid free- form fabrication ( SFF) have made it possible to create scaffolds with controlled architecture. This paper reviews the integration of CTD with SFF to build designer tissue- engineering scaffolds.

97,"The activities of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on iridium-oxide- and ruthenium-oxide-based catalysts are among the highest known to date. However, the OER activities of thermodynamically stable rutile iridium oxide (r-IrO2) and rutile iridium oxide (r-RuO2), normalized to catalyst mass or true surface area are not well-defined. Here we report a synthesis of r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of similar to 6 nm, and examine their OER activities in acid and alkaline solutions. Both r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 NPs were highly active for OER, with r-RuO2 exhibiting up to 10 A/g(oxide) at 1.48 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. When comparing the two, r-RuO2 NPs were found to have slightly higher intrinsic and mass OER activities than r-IrO2 in both acid and basic solutions. Interestingly, these oxide NPs showed higher stability under OER conditions than commercial Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts. Our study shows that these r-RuO2 and r-IrO2 NPs can serve as a benchmark in the development of active OER catalysts for electrolyzers, metal-air batteries, and photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"Polymer-based composites were heralded in the 1960s as a new paradigm for materials. By dispersing strong, highly stiff fibres in a polymer matrix, high-performance lightweight composites could be developed and tailored to individual applications(1). Today we stand at a similar threshold in the realm of polymer nanocomposites with the promise of strong, durable, multifunctional materials with low nanofiller content(2-11). However, the cost of nanoparticles, their availability and the challenges that remain to achieve good dispersion pose significant obstacles to these goals. Here, we report the creation of polymer nanocomposites with functionalized graphene sheets, which overcome these obstacles and provide superb polymer-particle interactions. An unprecedented shift in glass transition temperature of over 40 degrees C is obtained for polyacrylonitrile) at 1 wt% functionalized graphene sheet, and with only 0.05 wt% functionalized graphene sheet in poly methyl methacrylate) there is an improvement of nearly 30 degrees C.

99,"With their bright, photostable fluorescence, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) show promise as alternatives to organic dyes for biological labeling. Questions about their potential cytotoxicity, however, remain unanswered. While cytotoxicity of bulk cadmium selenide (CdSe) is well documented, a number of groups have suggested that CdSe QDs are cytocompatible, at least with some immortalized cell lines. Using primary hepatocytes as a liver model, we found that CdSe-core QDs were indeed acutely toxic under certain conditions. Specifically, we found that the cytotoxicity of QDs was modulated by processing parameters during synthesis, exposure to ultraviolet light, and surface coatings. Our data further suggest that cytotoxicity correlates with the liberation of free Cd2+ ions due to deterioration of the CdSe lattice. When appropriately coated, CdSe-core QDs can be rendered nontoxic and used to track cell migration and reorganization in vitro. Our results provide information for design criteria for the use of QDs in vitro and especially in vivo, where deterioration over time may occur.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
