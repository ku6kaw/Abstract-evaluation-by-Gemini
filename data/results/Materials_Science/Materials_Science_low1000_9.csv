0,"Taguchi design was employed herein to design a series of Mg-Y-Zn-Al alloys and to obtain the composition of the alloy with the best mechanical properties. The alloys were prepared according to the 3-level L9 Taguchi orthogonal table. The signal-to-noise ratios and analysis of variance were used to determine the optimal composition. The microstructures of the Mg-Y-Zn-Al alloys were investigated using an optical microscope, an x-ray diffractometer, a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersion spectra. The optimal composition of theMg-Y-Zn-Al alloys is 1.2 at% Y content, 0.75 Y/Zn mole ratio and 0.9 wt% Al-5Ti-1B content which corresponds to Mg-4.1Y-4.1Zn-0.9(Al-5Ti-1B) (wt%) with the best mechanical properties. The ultimate tensile strength and elongation of Mg-4.1Y-4.1Zn-0.9(Al-5Ti-1B) (wt%) are 195.35 MPa and 9.45, respectively. The Y content had the largest impact on the ultimate tensile strength and the significant factor that influencing elongation is the Al-5Ti-1B content. Alloys were mainly composed of alpha-Mg, X phase, Mg4Y2ZnAl3, TiB2 and Al2Y. The TiB2 and Al2Y, which are formed by the addition of Al-5Ti-1B, can act as heterogeneous nucleation to refine alpha-Mg grains. The excellent properties of the alloy could be attributed to fine-grain strengthening and second phase strengthening caused by a large amount of X phase and Mg4Y2ZnAl3 discontinuously distributed at the grain boundaries.",no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
1,"Positive effects of retrofitting MBBR and IFAS systems into MBRs can be exploited by introducing chemical enhancement applying coagulants in the membrane separation step. The current study reports basic principles of chemical enhancement with aluminium sulphate coagulant in biofilm-MBR (Bf-MBR) based on results of total recycle tests performed at different dosages of the chemical enhancer and properties characterization of filtrates, supernatants and sediments. It demonstrates a possibility to achieve lower membrane fouling rates with dosing of aluminium sulphate coagulant into MBBR and IFAS mixed liquors by extending operational cycles by 20 and 80 time respectively as well as increasing operating permeability of membrane separation by 1.3 times for IFAS. It has been found that charge neutralization is the dominating mechanism of aluminium sulphate action as a chemical enhancer in Bf-MBR, however, properties of the membrane surface influencing charge repulsion of foulants should be considered together with the secondary ability of the coagulant to improve consolidation of sediments.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
2,"An experimental investigation of the mechanical and fracture characteristics of Portland limestone and Corsehill sandstone is undertaken, aiming at enhancing understanding of the structural behaviour of these natural building stones commonly used in both new and restoration projects in Edinburgh, Scotland. A series of three-point bending and four-point bending tests on appropriately cut prismatic samples, in the presence of U-shape notches, were performed and results were interpreted following the concepts of crack mouth opening displacement and fracture energy. The critical crack opening displacement could be further investigated as a fracture criterion, independently of the method used for its determination. At a second stage, the effect of specimen shape and size on flexural strength, deflection at mid-span, crack mouth opening displacement and fracture energy was studied for Portland limestone. Despite the scattering of results, trends observed comprise (a) the negative correlation between the flexural strength of Portland limestone and the specimen span length and (b) the positive correlation between fracture energy and specimen size. Conclusions drawn are in good agreement with similar ones for other quasi-brittle materials and contribute to the assessment of the fracture behaviour of full size structural members that are often beyond the range of possible failure testing.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

6,"In the hemp industry, retting is considered as an upstream processing treatment that facilitates the decortication of fibres in the central woody part of the stem. This treatment is currently carried out empirically in the fields, and leads to variability in the color, (micro)structure and intrinsic properties (thermal properties) of hemp fibers. The present study aims to compare unretted and retted hemp fibres harvested at the end of flowering. The results show that retting induces a change in the color of fibres from light green to dark gray due to the activity of the microbial community at the stem surface. A separation of the fibre bundles into elementary fibres occurs with the degradation of the cementing compounds present in the middle lamella. The cellulose and its crystallinity degree increased from 68 to 75 % and 85 to 89 %, respectively, with a removal of non-cellulosic materials, which leads to an improvement of the thermal stability for the retted fibres.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes
7,"Non-traditional photovoltaic (PV) modules, such as solar shingles, facades and skins, are expected to increase in market share as the solar industry matures and moves to fill building integrated photovoltaics niches. The advent of building integration and the application of photovoltaics to multiple surfaces come with fabrication challenges and inherent geometrical, optical and thermal constraints. In this paper, we investigate the curved lamination process and the integration of a dichroic polymeric film within the laminate for the particular case of a large-scale optical collector called a ""PVMirror"". PVMirror is a concentrating solar power (CSP)/PV hybrid design that combines the high efficiency of PV and storage capability of CSP using a dichroic film. The film does not degrade upon lamination and exhibits good adhesion to encapsulants. Multiple lamination approaches, such as tuning the thickness of the encapsulant, are shown to significantly reduce the impact of the lamination process on the shape error of PVMirror modules, which could also be applied to the fabrication of other non-traditional PV modules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"In this study, non-foamed and foamed geopolymers based on IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) slag were prepared and their water resistance properties were examined in an immersion test in order to assess their suitability for water applications such as bridge pier, seawall, tetrapod. Particularly, the immersion characteristics were investigated according to the aging time at room temperature during the production process of the geopolymer. The pH changes of the immersion liquid were analyzed considering the immersion time, and the microstructural changes on the nanometer level of the surface of the geopolymer were observed before and after the immersion. Various shapes of crystals of the zeolite phase formed in the geopolymers prepared in this study, such as needle-like crystals with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 40 nm and lengths of 200 to 300 nm, and plate-shaped crystals overlapped with each other, which is thought to be due to the uneven composition of the slag used as a raw material or to local compositional changes of the alkali activator. By measuring the pH of immersion liquid, the following facts can be seen: foamed geopolymers synthesized from IGCC slag require a room-temperature curing period of at least 7 days, whereas non-foamed specimens require a room-temperature curing period of at least 28 days to consume alkaline activators. This is due to the increase in the specific surface area of the foamed specimen as the specimen is expanded, which thereby increases the contact area between the alkali activator and the slag. The foamed specimens, however, produced larger cracks and pores when immersed in water, while a smaller cracks and pores occurred in the non-foamed specimens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"The effects of Cu opening size on the mechanical properties of epoxy-contained Sn-58Bi solder joints were investigated by a low-speed shear test. Eight sample types were fabricated with various Cu opening sizes and solder pastes. The Cu opening sizes of the component and substrate were 200 mu m or 380 mu m, respectively, and the component formed a Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) solder bump which was placed on the Sn-58Bi solder paste or epoxy Sn-58Bi solder paste printed on the substrate and then reflowed. The microstructures of the solder joints were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the chemical compositions were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron probe X-ray micro-analyzer (EPMA). Epoxy was formed around the solder joints after the reflow process, improving the bonding strength of the epoxy-contained solder joints. Specifically, the bonding strength of the epoxy Sn-58Bi solder joints increased about 2.9 times in the 200 mu m (opening size of component)/380 mu m (opening size of substrate) sample. When the opening size of the component and substrate differed, a fracture occurred at the smaller opening size. On the other hand, a fracture occurred at the substrate side for the SAC305 (solder paste of component)/Sn-58Bi (solder paste of substrate) solder joints, while a fracture occurred at the interface between SAC305 and Sn-58Bi at the SAC305/epoxy Sn-58Bi solder joints for samples with the same opening size between the component and substrate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"The aim of this work is to describe the change of physical properties of the callus material with the use of the proposed mathematical model for callus remodeling. Callus tissue can be considered as a biomaterial where it's properties change over time due to the stimulated healing process. The proposed model is based on the mechanical stimulus theory. It is used to estimate the stress-stimulated change in the callus, Young's modulus, and the density in the case of a mandible fracture. Three healing loading programs are discussed and compared: optimal, intermittent, and intermittent with residual load. Here, the optimal loading program is understood as the in-time change of stimulating loads, which results in the shortest necessary healing time and, simultaneously, in the most uniform distribution of material density in the analyzed domain. The necessary healing time is a period after which the callus density (and hence the Young's modulus) reaches the desired value. The results of the study suggest a significant difference in the value of the callus maximal density between all three analyzed loading programs for a given healing time interval. The highest values of the density are obtained using the optimal loading program, however, all three programs provide satisfactory density distributions. The analytical results are compared with the callus density estimation based on the computer tomography (CT) medical data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Undoped and Dy3+-doped SrS nano-powders were synthesized by a solid-state diffusion method (SSDM). The nano-powders are then examined by the use of characterization tools as X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) including selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The emission spectra of SrS: Dy3+ powders are composed of a broadband and the characteristic emission of Dy3+ peaking at 482 nm (blue region), 581 nm (yellow region), 676 nm (light red region) and 750 nm (dark red region) bands corresponding to the transitions of F-4(9/2)- H-6(15/2), F-4(9/2)-H-6(13/2), F-4(9/2)-H-6(11/2) and F-4(9/2)-H-6(9/2), respectively. The resultant nano-powders can be used to fabricate thin films for the applications of efficient optoelectronic devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"The multiple effect evaporator (MEE) is an energy intensive step in the kraft pulping process. The exergetic analysis can be useful for locating irreversibilities in the process and pointing out which equipment is less efficient, and it could also be the object of optimization studies. In the present work, each evaporator of a real kraft system has been individually described using mass balance and thermodynamics principles (the first and the second laws). Real data from a kraft MEE were collected from a Brazilian plant and were used for the estimation of heat transfer coefficients in a nonlinear optimization problem, as well as for the validation of the model. An exergetic analysis was made for each effect individually, which resulted in effects 1A and 16 being the least efficient, and therefore having the greatest potential for improvement. A sensibility analysis was also performed, showing that steam temperature and liquor input flow rate are sensible parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Binary 1:1 Ni-Ti alloy has been the work horse for many industrial and of late biomedical applications amongst all shape memory alloys. Apart from being employed for endovascular applications like stents and filters, they are also used as orthodontic braces and in endodontic tools. Ni-Ti drills and files are used in a few procedures with sterilization between uses. However, the effect of these sterilizing heat-treatments on the properties of the tools is not clearly investigated. In addition to this, satisfactory metallurgical explanations for the wear resistance of these alloys in absent in the literature. Therefore, this paper attempts to define the transformational temperatures for the Ni-Ti as-received and low temperature heat-treated conditions have been investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Attempts are made to justify their suitability for endodontic applications by evaluating their mechanical strength parameters using the Tensile and Wear tests. It was found that the samples showed did not show much variations in strength when subjected to tensile tests whereas the same was not observed for DSC tests. Ambient temperature x-ray diffraction studies indicate the presence of Austenitic and Martensitic phases in all the samples. DSC results are strongly affected by presence of internal stresses but stress-induced-martensitic forms in all the samples with equal facility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Observation of relevant phenomena related with dynamical redox process in a plasmonic heterogeneous-photocatalyst system composed by silver nanoparticles (NPs) around and in contact with amorphous silver chloride NPs are reported by in situ transmission electron microscopy. During this process, nanobubbles are initially produced inside the silver chloride NPs, which immediately begin to move within the amorphous phase. Besides, silver atoms inside the silver chloride NPs start to migrate out the occupied volume leaving a space behind, which is filled by crystalline regions of silver chloride located between the pre-existing silver NPs. During the observation time, fast-nucleation, movement, growth, and fast-dissolution of silver NPs take place. Specific space correlation with silver mass loss (or gain) when a new NP is formed (or dissolved), was detected in different regions during the reaction. This mass loss (or gain) takes place on certain places of pre-existing silver NPs. All these phenomena were observed for a configuration comprising at least two silver NPs separated few nanometers apart by a silver chloride NP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"This study describes the doping effect of Yb2O3 on microstructure, electrical and dielectric properties of ZnO-V2O5 MnO2-Nb2O5 (ZVMN) ceramic semiconductors sintered at a temperature as low as 900 degrees C. As the doping content of Yb2O3 increases, the ceramic density slightly increases from 5.50 to 5.54 g/cm(3); also, the average ZnO grain size is in the range of 5.3-5.6 pm. The switching voltage increases from 4,874 to 5,494 V/cm when the doping content of Yb2O3 is less than 0.1 mol%, whereas further doping decreases this value. The ZVMN ceramic semiconductors doped with 0.1 mol% Yb2O3 reveal an excellent nonohmic coefficient as high as 70. The donor density of ZnO gain increases in the range of 2.46-7.41x10(17) cm(-3) with increasing doping content of Yb2O3 and the potential barrier height and surface state density at the grain boundaries exhibits a maximum value (1.25 eV) at 0.1 mol%. The dielectric constant (at 1 kHz) decreases from 592.7 to 501.4 until the doping content of Yb2O3 reaches 0.1 mol%, whereas further doping increases it. The value of tans increases from 0.209 to 0.268 with the doping content of Yb2O3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"Two dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, known as MXenes, are a promising electrode material in energy storage due to their excellent electrical conductivity, outstanding electrochemical performance, and abundant functional groups on the surface. Use of Ti3C2 as electrode material has significantly enhanced electrochemical performance by providing more chemically active interfaces, short ion-diffusion lengths, and improved charge transport kinetics.

17,"Experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate static tensile and tension-tension fatigue response of unidirectional glass fiber non-crimp fabric composites subject to seven different stabilization patterns (two multiaxial and five uniaxial stabilizing yarns). The effect of stabilization patterns on non-crimp fabric is crucial as they produce different mesoscale bundle shapes and bundle volume fractions which may affect the static and fatigue properties of non-crimp fabric composites. The studies show that tensile modulus and fatigue life decline with increasing amount of uniaxial stabilizations. Different stabilizations with different bundle shapes influence the final composite properties through various factors than just the volume fraction. The multiaxial stabilizations with higher static tensile strength have shorter fatigue life as compared to uniaxial stabilizations with lower tensile strength. As the areal weight of stabilizing yarns increases, fatigue life decreases at all stress levels which show the deleterious effects of stabilizations on the fatigue behavior of composites. Areal weight and orientation of stabilizing yarns should be optimally selected for the anticipated performance of the non-crimp fabric composites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"Palmierite minerals were found in Mt.Vesuvius, Italy. It is a rare sulfate mineral. During the past, only the crystal structure of palmierite mineral was dealt with. In the present work, palmierite was synthesized by co-precipitation route and doped with cobalt at different molar concentrations. Powder x-Ray Diffraction studies were carried out to understand the crystalline nature and lattice distortion of the as-synthesized pure and doped samples. The materials were subjected to FTIR and Raman analysis to identify the functional groups present in it. The morphological studies were carried out. The room temperature PL spectra shows dominant emission peaks at 360 nm, 521 nm and 595 nm. The cobalt doped samples has high dielectric constant value of 12128 while the pure palmierite has the value of 10375 but both the samples have very low loss factor of 0.5 at low frequency region. The loss factor also shifted towards low frequency region on doping. The dielectric behaviour of palmierite has interesting outcome upon doping and the results were discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"Etanercept (ETA) has been used as a drug to neutralise tumour necrotic factor alpha (TNF-alpha) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet there are limitations concerning its low specific drug targeting and side effects. In this study, agarose-curdlan encapsulating etanercept (ACE) gel was successfully formulated and evenly distributed as nano-particles of 30-100 nm diameter, exhibiting an ETA encapsulation efficiency of 73.8% and an ETA-releasing efficiency of 50% after 52 h. The number of dectin-1-overexpressing macrophage cells, RAW264.7, exposed to ACE that migrated in the Boyden chamber assay was equal to that exposed to either agarose-curdlan or curdlan nanogels, but substantially higher than those exposed to agarose gel and water-soluble ETA by 67 and 141 fold, respectively (p < 0.05), suggesting the targeting effect of curdlan on dectin-1. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the ETA released from the ACE nanogel could neutralise TNF-alpha secreted by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7. Moreover, at 24 h and 72 h, the released ETA showed 1.3- to 4.4-fold greater effectiveness, respectively, than water-soluble ETA. This study demonstrates that the ACE nanogel can attract immune cells and slowly release ETA to efficiently neutralise the TNF-alpha produced by these cells and, thus, could be a promising ETA carrier for targeted RA treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"A quantum-chemical approach was carried out on a series of oligomers made up of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in view of their potential applications for use as the main component in the redox super-capacitor and organic light-emitting diodes. The density functional theory was performed in the B3LYP/6-311 + + G(d,p) level on the dimer up to the octamer chains of oligo(EDOT) in the neutral and both ionic states. The extent of pi-conjugation length, lower HOMO-LUMO band gap, charge delocalization along backbone, and bathochromic shift in the UV-visible spectra for oligo(EDOT) showed that the ethylenedioxy substitution remarkably improved the poly(EDOT) characteristics. The temperature dependency of electrical conductivity and thermodynamic stability for oligo (EDOT) was studied in the temperature range of 50-400 K. The calculated conductivity for poly(EDOT) was compared with the available experimental measurements. More satisfactory properties were obtained in both the p- and n-doped phases, reflecting the electron and hole transport facilities for conductivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"We propose a high efficiency flip chip-based ultraviolet (UV) emitter with aluminum (Al) reflector that includes indium tin oxide (ITO) nano grains for current injection between the Al and p-AlGaN layer. Al has attracted attention as a reflector for high efficiency UV emitters because of its high reflectance in the UV region. To improve the efficiency of UV emitter, we generated periodic microhole arrays on the p-AlGaN layer, which serve as a scattering center in the flip chip structure and enhance the light extraction efficiency. The light output power of the fabricated flip chip-based UV emitter with ITO nano grains/Al reflector and microhole arrays on the p-AlGaN layer is significantly improved by 72% and 45% at an injection current of 20 mA, compared to that of UV emitter with only Al reflector and ITO nano grains/Al reflector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"In the present work, it is proposed to use multilayer graphene (MLG) as a charge storage layer in the non-volatile memory based on the Si/ZrO2/MLG/SiO2/Si structure. The write/erase, retention characteristics and charge density kinetics in the MLG of the memory element are calculated. Due to the metallic properties of MLG and the blocking layer made of high-k dielectric, the voltage drop on them in the write/erase mode is decreased. At the same time, the increase in the voltage drop in the SiO2 tunneling layer grows, in its turn, the Fowler-Nordheim current, which leads to a higher memory element performance. The big work function for electrons (similar to 5 eV) in MLG contributes to a better charge storage in it. According to our calculations, for write/erase voltages of +/- 11 V, there is a 5V memory window, and the memory window value will be equal to 3 V in 10 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"In this work, findings of a numerical study performed to investigate the impact behavior of porous concrete, modeled as a four phase cementitious composite consisting of aggregates, cement paste, interfacial transition zones (ITZ) and air, are presented. The numerical analyses contributed to the process of designing a special type of concrete for safety purposes i.e. as a protective building material to be used in safety walls outside important buildings or munition magazines for storing explosives. In case of an explosion, large concrete fragments that are formed, cause a very important threat. Therefore, in the scope of a research project, designing a special type of concrete having sufficient strength, but fracturing into small fragments under impact loading was aimed. In the numerical analyses, model porous concretes, in which the amounts and properties of pores and aggregates could be varied individually, were used to see the sole effect of each parameter. According to the results, it was found that at constant total porosity, the impact strength increased with decreasing pore size while multiple fragmentation was observed. On the other hand, the impact strengths of porous concretes with different size aggregates (with constant total aggregate content and porosity) were approximately the same when no ITZ was defined. However, when ITZ was present, the impact strength was found to decrease as the aggregates were finer. This trend was also valid for the respective full concretes. Representative experimental results of porous concretes were also presented in order to support the numerical results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"Tightly and vertically attached graphene nanosheets (GNS) on the surface of FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O is extremely desirable to substantially accelerate electron transport, promoting rate capability of FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O. Based on present experiment and calculated surface energies, firstly, it has confirmed that F-terminated FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface (FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002)-F) is more stable than FeF-terminated FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface (FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002)FeF) when Delta mu F varies from -1.92 eV to -0.30 eV. Then, by analysis of the interfacial structure and adsorption energies, it was proposed that GNS is incline to stand vertically on the FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface via C-F bond. However, structural stability of FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O/GNS heterostructure is gradually weakened with increasing the number of GNS layers. Therefore, we further reported the important role of optimal doping element (Hf) in strengthening the vertical adsorption behavior of GNS on FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface via thorough doping element search. And it turns out interfacial structure with hexa-coordinate polyhedron consists of Hf, F and O atoms is formed by strong hybridization of atomic orbits, which induces the interaction between FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface and GNS to be profoundly strengthened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"The optimal conditions including the aeration rate and agitation speed of bioreactors for the production of carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) by a recombinant Escherichia coli KACC 91335P, expressing CMCase gene of B. velezensis A-68, were different from those for its cell growth. The enhanced production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P with the conventional multistage process needs at least two bioreactors. Shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of the bioreactor from the cell growth of E. coli KACC 91335P to those for its production of CMCase were investigated for development of the simple and economic process with the high productivity and low cost. The production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P with shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed from the cell growth to its production of CMCase in a 100 L pilot-scale bioreactor was 1.36 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for the production of CMCase and it was even 1.54 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for cell growth. The best time for the shift in the optimal conditions was found to be the mid-log phase of cell growth. Owing to the mixed-growth-associated production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P, shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of bioreactors from the cell growth to its production of CMCase seemed to result in relatively more cells for the participation in its production of CMCase, which in turn enhanced its production of CMCase. The process with a simple control for shifts in the aeration rate and agitation speed of a bioreactor for the enhanced production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P on the pilot-scale can be directly applied to the industrial-scaled production of cellulase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"Guided waves have been utilized for the effective non-destructive inspection and structural health monitoring of huge industrial structures for several reasons, such as the long propagation ability, and they have also been used in waveguide sensors for inspection or measurement under hostile conditions such as high temperature and highly radioactive environments. Waveguide sensors have used many different kinds of waveguide geometries, and a sensor using a finite-width plate has been reported recently. The waveguide sensor with a finite-width plate uses a Lamb wave, the guided wave formed in the plate, but it has different propagation characteristics from those in an infinitely wide plate, because of the narrow plate width. Therefore, for the design and performance improvement of the waveguide sensor, it is necessary to understand and study the propagation characteristics of the Lamb wave in the finite-width plate. In this study, theories about the Lamb wave in a finite-width plate were investigated, and the dispersion curves in a finite-width plate were numerically calculated. From the obtained dispersion curves, the existence of the width modes and the variations of dispersion characteristics depending on the plate width were identified. It was demonstrated experimentally that the theoretically predicted high-order width modes were generated at once and propagated together in the laser-scanning experiments on Lamb wave propagation measurements in a finite-width plate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"High dielectric constant (high-k) materials have been extensively investigated for low-voltage operating electronics. In recent years, solution-processed high-k dielectrics have been of technological interests in low fabrication cost, large area process and good film quality, compared to the vacuum-process technology. In this paper, we demonstrate solution-processed aluminum oxide (Al2O3) dielectrics for high performance solution-processed indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) operating at low voltage. The material and electrical properties of Al2O3 dielectrics fabricated at different post-annealing temperatures were analyzed by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and capacitance-voltage measurements. We also investigate the effect of crystalline Al2O3 dielectrics on the device performance of solution-processed IGZO TFTs. It is concluded that improved interfacial characteristics of crystalline Al2O3 dielectrics enhance the device performance of solution-processed IGZO TFTs operating at 3 V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"Oxide coatings are formed on die-cast AZ91D Mg alloy through an environmentally friendly plasma electrolytic oxidation(PEO) process using an electrolytic solution of NaAlO2, KOH, and KF. The effects of PEO condition with different duty cycles (10 %, 20 %, and 40 %) and frequencies(500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz) on the crystal phase, composition, microstructure, and micro-hardness properties of the oxide coatings are investigated. The oxide coatings on die-cast AZ91D Mg alloy mainly consist of MgO and MgAl2O4 phases. The proportion of each crystalline phase depends on various electrical parameters, such as duty cycle and frequency. The surfaces of oxide coatings exhibit as craters of pancake-shaped oxide melting and solidification particles. The pore size and surface roughness of the oxide coating increase considerably with increase in the number of duty cycles, while the densification and thickness of oxide coatings increase progressively. Differences in the growth mechanism may be attributed to differences in oxide growth during PEO treatment that occur because the applied operating voltage is insufficient to reach breakdown voltage at higher frequencies. PEO treatment also results in the oxide coating having strong adhesion properties on the Mg alloy. The micro-hardness at the cross-section of oxide coatings is much higher not only compared to that on the surface but also compared to that of the conventional anodizing oxide coatings. The oxide coatings are found to improve the micro-hardness with the increase in the number of duty cycles, which suggests that various electrical parameters, such as duty cycle and frequency, are among the key factors controlling the structural and physical properties of the oxide coating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,"Exploration of the bioinspired silicification of artificial scaffolds is crucial to understanding and engineering the hierarchically complex and elaborate three-dimensional (3D) frustules of diatoms, which have high porosity and mechanical stability with related gas diffusion and storage properties. Herein, we report on the bioinspired silicification of the nanostructured surfaces of hexagonally close-packed silica bead (hc-SB) arrays using a liquid-phase deposition (LPD) method. This process, governed by the kinetics of silicification, was controlled using the concentration of the reactants and the reaction temperature and monitored in real time using a quartz-crystal microbalance, which allowed the investigation of the silicification on the surface during the LPD reaction. These heterogeneous LPD reactions on hc-SB arrays were optimized to mimic natural 3D hierarchical structures. Anisotropic silicification of the nanostructures occurred owing to differences in the energy and local concentration of silicic acid on the nanostructured surface. A 3D hierarchical pore network was realized via a heterogeneous LPD reaction by controlling the size, location, and arrangement of the SBs. We believe that our silicification process on nanostructured surfaces can lead to great improvements in the bioinspired morphogenesis-based engineering of 3D hierarchical structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"In case of the conventional SiCOH films, a post-deposition process was used to make pores by vaporization of porogen (e.g., hydrocarbon) for decreasing the dielectric constant. However, the authors intended the deposition of the SiCOH films, which does not need the post-deposition process to form the pores by using the dual precursors having different structures. The octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) have different structures which were of the ring shape and the linear shape, respectively. The OMCTS and TEOS were used to fabricate the plasma polymerized low dielectric constant SiCOH film by using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system in this work. A ratio of OMCTS and TEOS was adjusted by controlling flow rates of precursor carrier gases into the process chamber. The SiCOH films, which were deposited with dual precursors, showed the very low dielectric constants (relative dielectric constant k similar to 2.06 and 2.09) at plasma power of 10 W. All the fabricated SiCOH films showed the proper leakage current densities below 10(-6) A/cm(-2) at 1 MV/cm as the intermetallic dielectric material. The SiCOH films were investigated to study the relations between dielectric constants and chemical structures by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The formation of pores inside the SiCOH films was studied through the relation between Si-O-Si peaks, including network, suboxide and cage peaks, and the dielectric constant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems use profiles to characterize expected behavior of network users. Most of these systems characterize the entire network traffic within a single profile. This work proposes a user-level anomaly-based intrusion detection methodology using only the user's network traffic. The proposed profile is a collection of TopK rankings of reached services by the user. To detect unexpected behaviors, the real-time traffic is organized into TopK rankings and compared to the profile using similarity measures. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed methodology was capable of detecting a particular kind of malware attack in all the users tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"The experience gathered during the implementation of long series of laboratory experimental protocols, aiming to study the mechanical response of restored structural elements, is summarized. Conclusions are drawn concerning the proper exploitation of the laboratory results in field applications in the frame of on-going restoration projects of ancient stone monuments. The need of continuous bidirectional interaction between the scientific personnel working in the site and the scientists working in the laboratory is emphasized. The role of the Digital Image Correlation technique in quantifying parasitic effects influencing the laboratory data is proven decisive. The need to use modem sensing techniques, providing data from the interior of loaded restored complexes (simulating restored structural elements), like the Pressure Stimulated Currents and the Acoustic Emissions ones, according to a combined manner is highlighted. The capability of these two techniques to monitor the damage evolution within the mass of the elements tested and to provide clear pre-failure indicators renders them flexible tools in the hands of engineers designing the restoration projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"By a semianalytical Bethe ansatz method and a T-matrix approach we study the scattering of a spinon, the elementary quantum many-body topological excitation in the one-dimensional (1D) Heisenberg model, by local and phonon potentials. In particular, we contrast the scattering of a spinon to that of a free spinless fermion in the XY model to highlight the effect of strong correlations. For the one-spinon scattering in an odd-site chain, we find regular behavior of the scattering coefficients. In contrast, in an even-site chain there is a transfer of transmission probability between the two spinon branches that grows exponentially with system size. We link the exponent of the exponential behavior to the dressed charge that characterizes the critical properties of the 1D Heisenberg model, an interplay of topological and critical properties. The aim of this study is a microscopic understanding of spinon scattering by impurities, barriers, or phonons, modeled as prototype potentials, an input in the analysis of quantum spin transport experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"We proved that the critical thickness for metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) of LaNiO3 could be controlled by substrate orientation. By means of density functional theory calculations, films grown on SrTiO3 substrates with (001), (110) and (111) orientations have different amount of charge transfer across the interface. Different charge transfer induces different interfacial conductivity behavior and at the same time modifies the carrier density of adjacent LaNiO3 films. The manipulation of MIT by substrate orientation can be achieved through interfacial charge transfer induced interfacial conductive layer with the modified conductivity of LNO layer.

35,"The paper deals with the interaction of a generalized screw dislocation and an elliptic inhomogeneity containing a confocal elliptic hole in a magneto-electro-elastic composite material. Exact solutions are derived for the case where the generalized screw dislocation is located in the matrix under a remote anti-plane shear stress field, an in-plane electric field, and a magnetic field. Based on the complex variable method, the complex potentials of both the matrix and the inhomogeneity are obtained in series, and analytic expressions for the generalized stress and strain field, the image force, the generalized stress intensity factor of the blunt crack tip, and the energy release rate are derived explicitly. The presented solutions include some previous solutions, such as pure elastic, piezoelectric, piezomagnetic, and circular inclusions. Typical numerical examples are presented and the influences of the dislocation position, the volume of inhomogeneity, and the elliptic hole on these physical quantities are discussed. The results show that the magneto-electro-elastic coupling effect has a great influence on the image force and the equilibrium position of dislocation, especially when the dislocation approaches the interface; the coupling effect makes the image force on the screw dislocation follow different variation laws in piezoelectric-piezomagnetic composite materials compared with elastic materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,The study of energy balance at crack tip could give comprehensive information for estimation of durability and reliability cracked construction under cyclic loading. The first step for estimation energy balance is monitoring of dissipated part of energy (heat generation). One of the most effective techniques for investigation of temperature evolution on the surface of deformed body is infrared thermography. The work is devoted to the experimental study of energy dissipation in cracked samples made of titanium Grade 2 under multiaxial cyclic loading. To explain the experimentally obtained correlation between fatigue crack rate and power of heat dissipation we developed a phenomenological model describing the evolution of plastic work at the crack tip under arbitrary loading. The theoretical and experimental data about heat dissipation exhibit a good quantitative agreement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"The electrochemical reduction of Bi(III), Sb(III) and Te(IV) with EDTA and tartaric acid complexing agents in sulfuric acid solution were studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) separately. The results reveal that the addition of EDTA makes the reduction potential of Bi(III) shift negatively, but does not affect the reduction potential of Sb(III) and Te(IV), which makes the deposition potential of Bi(III), Sb(III) and Te(IV) close to each other. The addition of tartaric acid makes the reduction potential of Bi(III) negatively shift a little and the reduction potential of Sb(III) shift negatively, but does not affect the reduction potential of Te(IV), which makes the deposition potential of Bi(III), Sb(III) and Te(IV) far away from each other. Meanwhile, the role of EDTA is to increase the solubility of Bi(III), and tartaric acid is expected to improve the solubility of Sb(III), EDTA and tartaric acid could enhance the stability of Bi(III)-Sb(III)-Te(IV) ternary mixture.

39,This work is based on the application of probabilistic fracture mechanics models to predict the reliability of pressure pipelines in nuclear power reactors. The simulation of cracking of stainless steel piping under the conditions of intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) is based on the improved modified piping reliability analysis including seismic events (PRUSE) code. The IGSCC is characterized by a unique damage parameter that depends on residual stresses and environmental conditions. Case studies: of IGSCC failures in nuclear power plants are presented and the contribution of environmental effects on crack initiation and leakage is discussed. For small damages we observed that the change in temperature or oxygen concentration does not affect the initiation process but their decrease contribute favourably to the decrease in the leakage probabilities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"Electrochromic (EC) smart pixel display was designed and fabricated using a novel monomer di-4-isopropyl benzyl substituted (3, 4-propylene dioxythiophene) (ProDOT-IPBz(2)). The polymer thin film showed absorption between 450 and 650 nm at a fully reduced state. The absorption peak narrowed down slightly towards longer wavelength region (850-900 nm) at the oxidation states. Siju et al has reported the coloration efficiency (CE) of the thin film as similar to 305 cm(2) C-1. The ProDot-IPBZ(2) thin film was used to fabricate EC pixel display of 2 x 2 pixel array on a patterned ITO coated glass. The optical color contrast of the EC pixel display is 40% at 600 nm, with a switching time of about 2 s and 2.5 s respectively. The CE of EC pixel was found to be 555 cm(2) C-1 at 600 nm in the fully doped state. This EC pixel switched for more than 1000 cycles with good color contrast (< 5% T).

41,"In this study, short alumina-silicate fiber reinforced AA2014 Al-alloy matrix composite was prepared through squeeze infiltration technique. Dry sliding wear behaviour of the synthesized composite was carried out using a pin on disc under the application of varying loads (20-60 N) and velocities (2-4 m s(-1)) and the obtained results were compared with that of squeeze cast and gravity cast Al-alloy. The wear response of the investigated materials has been explained on the basis of microstructure, wear surface heating and wear-mechanism. The wear mechanism in composite has been explained schematically with supporting wear surface and subsurface micrographs. It is noted that composite suffered from relatively higher coefficient of friction, wear rate and frictional heating as compared to the alloys, irrespective of applied load and sliding speeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"It is often assumed that solvent-basedI sealers give better performance than water-based formulations on concrete because the solvent-based sealers are thought to better penetrate into the concrete matrix. In practice, it can be difficult to measure actual penetration of a sealer into concrete, as dyes and colorants used to highlight the sealer may show different migration properties than the polymeric binder. Con focal Raman spectroscopy mapping has been used to map the depth of penetration of solvent-based, 100% solids, and water-based sealers that employ acrylic and epoxy binders. This mapping shows that neither solvent-based nor water-based formulations showed any significant penetration into the concrete substrate beyond the first few microns of the open surface. A study has also been carried out using a model waterborne acrylic sealer formulation to determine whether additives might influence the penetration of the sealer into the concrete or other factors that could affect the performance of the waterborne coating. This work has shown that the addition of anti-foaming, coalescing surfactants can improve the protective properties of the coating by improving air release and increasing film network formation at the concrete surface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"The limited number of independent beta-Sn grain orientations resulting from the difficulty in nucleating beta-Sn during solidification of Sn-based solders has a large effect on the resulting beta-Sn grain size and, hence, on overall solder joint performance and reliability. This study analyzes the efficacy of Ge as a heterogeneous nucleation agent for beta-Sn by observing the morphologies and orientation relationships of as-deposited, solid-state annealed, and liquid-state annealed pure Sn films on single crystal Ge (100), (110), and (111) substrates. Results from scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction showed that the as-deposited Sn films all deposited with a Sn (001)|| z-axis texture, regardless of the underlying Ge substrate orientation. Solid-state annealing at 150 degrees C for 5 min did not result in significant dewetting of the Sn films, and the films maintained their as-deposited texture of Sn (001)|| z-axis, regardless of the underlying Ge substrate orientation. Liquid-state annealing at 235 degrees C for 1 min resulted is large-scale dewetting of the Sn films and re-orientation of the Sn films on the various Ge substrates. After solidification, the Ge (100) and (110) single crystal substrates produced patches of dewetted grains of the same orientation but there were no consistent Sn grain textures after liquid-state annealing, suggesting no single orientation relationship. In contrast, solidification on Ge (111) single crystal substrates resulted in isolated grains with a single Sn film texture and an orientation relationship of. Density Functional Theory simulations of the experimentally observed Ge (111) sample orientation relationship and the Ge/Sn cube-on-cube orientation relationship suggest favorable relative interfacial binding energies for both interface orientations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"The control of hemp plant harvesting, in particular the retting process, represents the major step for the development of high-performance hemp biocomposites. In this study, the consequences of hemp retting on the ease of fibre extraction and tensile properties of elementary hemp fibres is explored. Stem peeling experiments are combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the influence of the retting degree in plants. After studying the evolution of fracture energy at the fibre/woody core interphase within the stem, this work investigates interphase fracture mechanisms during peeling experiments which aims to understand the evolution of fibre bundle cohesion during retting. A drastic drop of fracture energy reveals the impact of retting on the ease of peeling the outer tissue of the stem (containing fibre bundles). The positive impact of retting on various fibre defects combined together leads to a 33 % increase in the tangent modulus between non-retted and retted fibres, highlighting the importance of understanding the retting process to open up to new markets for biocomposites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to maximize system efficiency, the microsphere was spliced in the center of a taper. This work revealed that the variations of the wavelength where the maxima and minima of the spectrum are located varies linearly with the curvature of the system with a maximum sensitive of 580 +/- 20 (pm km). This is because the direction of the input beam in the microsphere depends on the system curvature, giving rise to interferometric variations within the microsphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigated samples were 30 and 100 nm in diameter. The magnetization process depends on the angle at which the external magnetic field is applied. Fe77.5Si7.5B15 amorphous nanowires with smaller diameters exhibit larger coercivity than (Co0.94Fe0.06)(72.5)Si12.5B15 ones, irrespective of the angle at which the external field is applied. Moreover, both types of nanowires have similar remanence values at 30 nm diameters. However, nanowires with larger diameters (100 nm), exhibit a more complex behavior, since the (Co0.94Fe0.06)(72.5)Si12.5B15 samples exhibit a slightly larger coercivity as compared to the Fe77.5Si7.5B15 ones. The magnetization reversal process is influenced by the interplay between the preponderant factors that affect the overall magnetic properties of amorphous nanowires with different compositions and dimensions. The results allow one to accurately tailor the magnetic behavior of rapidly solidified amorphous nanowires for various applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"Continuous wave laser radiation is used to heat up tumor tissue where the cells in this tissue are more sensitive to heating. Temperature distribution is connected to hyper thermal therapy.

In view to explore their possible utilization in opto-electronic devices, we have firstly performed calculations using one of the most accurate prescriptions, namely full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method. For a better accuracy, computations have been carried out using different exchange-correlation potentials including the most accurate modified Becke-Johnson potential with hybrid functional features. Computations have been performed for various electronic and optical properties such as energy bands, total and partial density of states, real and imaginary parts of dielectric tensors, absorption spectra, reflection, refraction and energy loss spectra for both chalcopyrite compounds. We have compared our data with the existing experimental and theoretical calculations for both compounds, which validates the accuracy of present computations. Both chalcopyrites are observed to have a direct band gap nature (Cu2InAlSe4: 1.14 eV and Cu2InGaSe4: 0.96 eV). Energy peaks recorded in the imaginary part of dielectric tensors are well interpreted by means of inter-band transitions. Significant intensities observed in absorption spectra within the energy range of solar spectra unambiguously depict feasibility of these compounds in optoelectronic devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"BiFeO3 (BFO) is the only room temperature multiferroic material that has been extensively studied due to its multifunctional properties. BFO with a canted G-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering exhibits strong exchange bias characteristics with NiFe which offers the potential to design and utilize devices working based on multiferroic features. In the past, it was known that the presence of 180 degrees domain walls of BFO hinders a plausible exchange bias interaction. To understand the role of the strain-induced effects on such 180 degrees domain walls and its effect on the exchange bias, NiFe, a soft ferromagnetic layer, was grown on the epitaxial BFO AFM layers. An approximately 80nm BFO layer was grown epitaxially in both the tetragonal (001) phase on the LaAlO3 (001) substrate and the rhombohedral (111) phase on the SrTiO3 (111) substrate, with a thin (10nm) layer of Ni80Fe20 on top of it. An exchange bias of 510 Oe was observed in the tetragonal phase of BFO with a c/a ratio of 1.22, which is comparable with the exchange bias shown by the (111) oriented rhombohedral phase (360 Oe). Both the tetragonal (001) and rhombohedral (111) layers possess ferroelectric polarization normal to the sample surface and so the domain walls are mostly 180 degrees oriented which is expected to have a minimum effect on the exchange bias. However, the weak strain-induced structural variants in the (111) oriented rhombohedral BFO and the monoclinic distortion present in the tetragonal BFO introduce non-180 degrees domain walls in the system. These variants arising due to the structural distortion are expected to play a key role in defining the ferroelectric domain wall nature, thereby exhibiting exchange bias characteristics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, the split-ring resonator array-based evanescent amplification in the microwave regime is implemented for strongly enhancing radiation from an electrically small radiator. The electrically small radiator considered here is a chip inductor loaded open coplanar waveguide antenna. This weakly radiating source when placed in the vicinity of split-ring resonator array, it is seen that the radiated power could be greatly enhanced. The split-ring resonator array working under the magnetic resonant excitation could amplify evanescent fields emitted by the source. Field probing reveals that the split-ring resonator array could convert the amplified evanescent waves into propagating ones resulting in significantly enhanced radiation from the source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"The paper suggests a disintegration mechanism of silicon particles in aluminum in the heat-impact zone of a low-energy high-current electron beam. This inclusion was modeled with a round plate (radius R and thickness h). Disintegration of silicon inclusion was assumed to be possible due to discrepancy of elasticity modulus and linear expansion thermal coefficient caused by the evolving dynamic instability. In conditions of high-speed cooling a silicon plate is subjected to compression stresses, since linear expansion coefficient of aluminum is above that of silicon. If these forces applied, instability and fracture of a plate are registered. Using methods of elasticity theory it was found out that the value of these stresses is around 1 GPa. The initial stage of this instability was analyzed by methods of Theory of Plates and Shells. In terms of this theory, a critical stress (similar to 10(7)-10(9) Pa) was determined close to the clamped ends of a plate and hinged plates. So, it was concluded, that a suggested mechanism of silicon particles disintegration in the heat-impact zone of an electron beam seems to be the most probable one. Relay-Taylor instability on the inclusion and matrix border is thought to be another mechanism of particles disintegration. According to the linear analysis of this instability, a wavelength with the maximal growth speed of disturbances is similar to 4 mu m, for inclusions similar to 1 mu m these findings exceed significantly the experimental data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,"Cuprous azide films were prepared using oblique angle deposition of Cu at 40 degrees and post-annealed with the flow of nitrogen at three different temperatures. This deposition angle provides the highest void fraction according to the published literature on the basis of rearrangement of atoms resulting from the diffusion or thermal vibration and the available crystallographic sites and surface energy on the substrate/growing film surface for relaxation of an adatom. Structural characteristics of the films were obtained using atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy while their crystallography was investigated by x-ray diffraction analysis. Optical spectra of the samples were measured from which optical constants were deduced. The direct band gap energies were obtained and compared with the reported theoretical calculations and experimental results. The band gap energies obtained from the process of plotting (alpha h upsilon)(2) versus h upsilon are in agreement with the reported values in the literature. Band gap energies obtained from dT/d lambda versus h upsilon eV method are in agreement with experimental values and with the theoretical band gap energy of 4.1 eV as well as those obtained from (alpha h upsilon)(2) versus h upsilon method, while those obtained from dR/d lambda versus h upsilon eV are in good agreement with theoretical band gap energy of 3.86 eV.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,"Magnetotransport properties of ultra-soft magnets were studied on both macroscopic and microscopic scales by performing bulk and point-contact measurements, respectively, in CoSiBFeNb ribbons prepared by melt spinning technique. While the bulk measurements did not show any variations in dc resistance as a function of applied magnetic field (zero magnetoresistance), the point-contact measurements revealed giant-magnetoresistance-like changes in the resistance of small volumes (10(6)-10(9)nm(3)) associated with the contacts. A high-density current applied to the contacts was found to affect the point-contact magnetoresistance - the magnetic field where resistive switching occurs was found to shift with the applied dc bias. The magnetotransport effects observed on the microscopic scale could be attributed to specific local configurations of magnetic domains in CoSiBFeNb and effects of spin-transfer torque on the domain configurations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

63,"As demand of light weight in the automotive industry has increased, the cowl cross member has been investigated using various methods to change the material. Conventionally, a cowl cross member has been made of steel and aluminum, but recently researchers tested multi-material such as aluminum and plastic. We studied a new model of the cowl cross member made of composite and non ferrous materials. For products with a high degree of freedom in design, generally, the method of topology optimization is advantageous and for the partial bracket part of the cowl cross member had a degree of freedom in the design, a topology optimization is appropriate. Considering the characteristics of the cowl cross members, we need research to minimize the weight while having the performance of noise, vibration and harshness(NVH). Taking the mounting status of the product into consideration, we used an assembly model to optimize the cowl cross member. But this method took too much time so we considered simple cowl cross member assemble conditions using the direct matrix input method(DMI) with the Craig-Bampton Nodal Method. This method is capable of considering the status of the assembly without assembling the model, which reduced the solving time and increased the accuracy comparison with a cowl cross member without DMI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, using the proposed synthetic method, it was also possible to prepare nanoparticles with varying particle sizes and copolymer ratios through a simple pre-emulsification stage and careful control of the monomer ratio employed. Upon mixing the resulting core-shell nanocapsules uniformly with the optical adhesive films, desorption was observed between layers following heat treatment. Furthermore, the high optical transmittance of the optical adhesive film was retained due to the small size of the core-shell nanoparticles. It was therefore apparent that the proposed method should be applicable for the preparation of future optical films where functional core-shell nanocapsules are required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"The positive bias temperature instability (PBTI) characteristics of fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) tunneling field effect transistor (TFET) are investigated in comparison with those of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) fabricated with the same technology process. Unlike some of the previously reported studies, in which the PBTI lifetime of TFET is much longer than that of MOSFET, in this study, the PBTI lifetime of TFET is found to be shorter than that of MOSFET. This result is very interesting, because degradation of electrical parameters of TFET is mainly affected by local traps near the source junction rather than global traps in the channel region. Large degradation of the electrical parameters of TFET due to PBTI stress would result from large fluctuation of the vertical electric field caused by traps near the source junction. This electric field fluctuation near the local region in TFET has more impact on electrical parameter degradation than channel conductivity fluctuation in MOSFET. Therefore, to improve the reliability characteristics of TFET, evaluation of PBTI characteristics and improvement of the quality of gate oxide near the source junction are essential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"The present study aims to develop a novel intelligent polymer-drug conjugate for the delivery of gambogic acid (GA). Specifically, the conjugate was composed of polyacrylic acid, GA and cystamine. GA-loaded nanoparticles (polyacrylic acid-cystamine-gambogic acid-nanoparticles, PAA-SS-GANPs) were simply and rapidly prepared using an ultrasonic-assisted direct dissolution method. Subsequently, we characterized the formulation by different methods, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV). Moreover, the in vitro release, cytotoxicity and cellular uptake were equally determined. The results showed that PAA-SS-GA-NPs had a small particle size (91.5 +/- 9.19 nm), had a high drug loading efficiency ((32.5 +/- 2.3) %) and greatly improved the water solubility of GA (over 9700-fold). Most importantly, they showed good response performance. The nanoparticles maintained the antitumor activity of GA but were less cytotoxic to normal cells than free GA. These results demonstrated that the nanoparticles may be a promising drug carrier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,"Zn1-xLixO (x = 0, 0.005, 0.010 and 0.015) thin films were grown on single-crystal sapphire (Al2O3) substrates (001) by pulsed laser deposition method. We prepared two sets of thin films. In set-1, the doping of Li was varied. A fractional Li-doping causes a systematic rise in the temperature-dependent resistivity of the films. Further, the ultraviolet (UV) light (365 nm) exposure on these films causes a variety of effects. We observed a UV light-induced metal-semiconductor transition in otherwise semiconducting films. The transition manifests in a temperature range above 200 K to 300 K. In set-2, thin films of maximum doping (1.5%) were prepared by varying the thickness. The structural study revealed that the films are crystalline and oriented towards c-axis of wurtzite ZnO. The temperature-dependent resistivity measurements show the increase in resistivity with an increase in the thickness of the films.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the preceding months an intensive inspection of the whole structure was conducted. Results showed that a considerable part of the reinforcement was irreparably affected by nitrate induced stress crack corrosion. Therefore, the elephant's house had to be closed and a temporary support was installed.

69,"Modification of the RCM test to optimize measurement precision, test duration and cost-effectiveness - Development of practice-oriented laboratory and construction site tests to prove the conformity and identity of concrete for chloride-exposed components As part of the publication of the new ""BAW-Merkblatt MDCC"" [1], a semiprobabilistic concept to ensure durability was introduced for the first time. It can be assumed that this development will also continue in national and international regulations. What is missing, however, are practical and at the same time economic tests of the material resistance, which can be carried out within the framework of initial type testing, conformity testing and identity testing. In this context, the present article summarizes the currently available tests for determining the material resistance to chloride penetration (rapid penetration test RCP-Test, rapid migration test RCM-Test, test of electrolytic resistance) and critically examines them with regard to test accuracy, time expenditure and suitability for practical use. On the basis of these findings, a new testing method is developed on the basis of the existing RCM test set-up, which can be used within the scope of initial type testing and is referred to as the Modified Chloride Migration Test MCM-Test. In this test, the charge flow is determined at a variable initial voltage during a specified test duration; the resulting material value is referred to as the SCFR (Specific Charge Flow Rate) value. In 32 test series with 17 different concretes it was shown that the correlation between SCFR value and chloride migration coefficient D-RCM was very good. For conformity and identity testing, a test based on electrolytic resistance measurement is proposed, which also shows a good correlation with the D-RCM value regardless of the binder combination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"In this study, the effects of the second phase, either in the form of particulate or of lamella, on the microwave dielectric properties are investigated. Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is considered to be a model system for this examination. Although SrTiO3 is an intermediate compound between SrO and TiO2, the solubilities of SrO and TiO2 in SrTiO3 are extremely low. Excess SrO and excess TiO2 lead to the formation of second phases as Sr3Ti2O7 and TiO2, respectively, within SrTiO3. TiO2 exists as particulates, and its presence marginally affects the microwave dielectric properties of SrTiO3. The Sr3Ti2O7 lamella is located on the long axis of the elongated SrTiO3 grain. With the formation of the Sr3Ti2O7 lamella, the permittivity decreases, and the product of quality factor and resonant frequency increases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

73,"Temporary bridge strengthening for heavy transports This paper presents a new approach for short-term bridge strengthening. With this method the bridge supporting structure is additionally strengthened by active temporary struts positioned over the length of the structure and therefore increasing the load capacity. Even though this strengthening method has been successfully implemented for decades, it is still unknown in many countries of EU. Most of the companies, which apply this strengthening method follow old simplified rules and models [1] (1980), which restrict its efficiency. The old model insufficiently describes the actual behavior of the strengthening with the results sometimes ending on the unsafe side. The introduced new approach for short-term bridge strengthening is based on the monitoring of real bridge structures and temporary support structures during the crossing of heavy transports. A mathematical model, which suitably represents the behavior of real structures, is introduced. Furthermore a safety hydraulic element invented at Brno University of Technology (VUT FAST), which can be used with the strengthening system is presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

75,We synthesized c-oriented epsilon-Fe2 similar to 3N films on c-GaN by magnetron sputtering. The saturation magnetization and Curie temperature of epsilon-Fe2 similar to 3N films are decreased due to the reducing of Fe-Fe ferromagnetic exchange coupling with increasing N participation. The state transitions of magnetization at low temperature are observed. The presented results on manipulable magnetic properties by Fe:N ratio show that epsilon-Fe2 similar to 3N/GaN structure provides an advanced platform both for studying basic properties of epsilon-Fe2 similar to 3N and for the design of spintronics devices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

77,"A hydrothermal method was employed to synthetise NaV6O15 nanobelts, then nanobelts were annealed in air, the nanorods (NRs) were obtained at 350 degrees C, which possess a length and diameter of 500nm and 100nm, respectively. NaV6O15 NRs as the electrode of supercapacitor exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance compared with the untreated NaV6O15 electrode, and yield a high specific capacitance (402. 8F/g at 300mA/g). Furthermore, the annealing treated nanorods show excellent cycling stability (80% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 100mV/s), this can be ascribed to that annealing turns the amorphous NaV6O15 into crystalline. These findings may further broaden the application of NaV6O15-based materials for high performance supercapacitors (SCs), aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries and Li-ion capacitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"Product design for safe performance and operation in harsh environments triggers the importance of understanding property degradation due to prolonged exposure of advanced composite materials to such environments. The effect of seawater immersion on monotonic tensile, stress relaxation, and cyclic bending fatigue response of polyamide 66 nanocomposites containing 0%, 1%, and 5% hectorite organoclay were investigated. Seawater equilibrated nanocomposites demonstrated less moisture absorption compared to their pure counterparts. The imbibed seawater significantly increased the ductility, and reduced the tensile modulus and strength of nanocomposites. A nine-parameter Prony series viscoelastic constitutive model was used to estimate the influence of seawater on the viscoelastic behavior based on stress relaxation data. The phenomenological model evaluated a drop of 82% in the instantaneous and the residual elastic moduli indicating a significant plasticizing effect of seawater. However, the amount of increase in the rubbery nature of polyamide is observed from the reduction in stress relaxation time of first Maxwell element by about 40%. Nanocomposites exhibited improved fatigue life with an increase in organoclay content even after equilibration in seawater. The fracture surface observation of seawater equilibrated bending fatigue specimen revealed rubbery behavior indicating the positive difference between cyclic steady-state temperature and material glass transition temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,"One of the most studied photoluminescence emission peaks of anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) is green, located at about 520 nm, which is assigned to the radiative recombination between a mobile electron in the conduction band and oxygen vacancy defect as a trapped hole in the bandgap. Composite materials of TiO2 with graphene are normally shown by the gradual quenching of photoluminescence intensity as a result of carrier lifetime extension, which is important to enhance photocatalytic activity. Herein we report an observation of the intensity enhancement of the green PL emission in a composite TiO2 nanotube (TNT) and graphene produced through facile hydrothermal synthesis. The heterojunction formation of graphene and TNT makes the excited photoelectrons easy to diffuse from TNT to graphene. Hence, the recombination rate of mobile electrons in graphene and trapped holes located on the nanotube surface is enhanced due to the high mobility of electrons in graphene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,"This paper presents an open-source and low-cost characterization device designed to investigate the behavior of active textiles, which are textiles having the ability to actuate (produce motion/force) and or act as a sensor. Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. (C) 2019 The Authors.

81,"The current work presents an experimental study on the use of the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) to evaluate its ability to characterise fatigue crack growth. A methodology is developed to measure and to analyse the CTOD from experimental data. The vertical displacements obtained by implementing digital image correlation (DIC) on growing fatigue cracks are used to measure the CTOD. Two fatigue tests at stress ratios of 0.1 and 0.6 were conducted on compact tension (CT) specimens manufactured from a 1 mm thick sheet of commercially pure titanium. A sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of the position selected behind the crack tip for the MOD measurement was performed. The analysis of a full loading cycle allowed identifying the elastic and plastic components of the CTOD. The plastic CTOD was found to be directly related to the nonlinear zone (i.e., plastic deformation) generated at the crack tip during fatigue propagation. Moreover, a linear relationship between da/dN and Delta CTODp independent of the stress ratio was found. Results show that the CTOD can be used as a viable alternative to the stress intensity factor range (Delta K) in characterising fatigue crack propagation since the parameter considers the fatigue threshold and crack shielding in an intrinsic way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

84,"This paper introduces a system to realize interactive and personalized erasure animations by using mobile terminals, a shared display terminal, and a database server for a large group of participants. In the system, participants shake their mobile terminals with their hands. Their shaking data are captured by the database server. Then there are immersive and somatosensory erasure animations on the shared display terminal according to the participants' shaking data in the database server. The system is implemented by a data preprocessing module and an interactive erasure animation module. The former is mainly responsible for the cleaning and semantic standardization of the personalized erasure shape data. The latter realizes the interactive erasure animation, which involves shaking the mobile terminal, visualizations of the erasure animation on the shared display terminal, and dynamic and personalized data editing. The experimental results show that the system can realize various styles of personalized erasure animation and can respond to more than 2000 shaking actions simultaneously and present the corresponding erasure animations on the shared display terminal in real time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"Optical Tamm plasmon (TP) can be excited at the boundary of photonic crystal and metal film. In this work, we propose a composite structure consisting of binary Au nanodisk arrays on top of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) of TiO2/SiO2 1D photonic crystal; the structure supports the confined dual hybrid TP modes that benefited from the excitation of a localized lattice collective resonance on the vicinity of the nanoparticles array. The hybrid TP modes possess enhanced confinement, controllable hybrid TP frequency, and broadened spectral width compared with that of TP mode within the gold film/DBR structure. Moreover, the hybrid TP mode that due to the in-phased localized lattice resonance is dominated when the nanodisk radius increases, while the hybrid TP mode resulted from weak coupling of in-phased and anti-phased localized lattice resonance is weakened, especially when the radii of binary arrays approach identical. Thus, the tunable dual confined TP states can be realized through adjusting the arrays radii rather than changing the properties of DBR. Importantly, the enhancement of confined hybrid TP modes with controllable resonant frequency has a potential application in perfect absorption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

88,"The effect of solution heating rate on quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties of Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloy in bake hardening state was investigated through mechanical properties, microstructure and fracture morphology characterization in the present study. The results show that solution heating rate has a strong influence on microstructure, quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties. As solution heating rate rises, the grain microstructure transforms from the elongated grains to equiaxed grains and the fraction of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) also decreases. Moreover, the equivalent average grain size first decreases, and then increases. The relationship between solution heating rate and mechanical property is monotonic, not depending on strain rate. As solution heating rate rises, the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation decrease. In contrast to quasi-static loading, dynamic loading always tends to improve strengths and elongation. In addition, compared with the quasi-static tensile specimens, the dynamic tensile specimens possess a larger number of dislocations. Regardless of strain rate and solution heating rate, all the tensile specimens exhibit the ductile fracture mode. As solution rate rises, the dimples decrease and become shallow gradually. The dimples in dynamic fracture zone are larger and deeper than those in the quasi-static fracture zone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"Ultrasonic inspection was used to detect regions of recrystallization (RX) within a single crystal of Ni. RX can produce polycrystalline regions within single-crystal (SX) materials. Because RX regions act as initiator sites for failure by fatigue-crack growth in otherwise SX Ni-based superalloys, RX is an issue of direct concern for the service life of high-performance turbine blades. Detection and discrimination of RX regions in single-crystal materials are significant challenges for current nondestructive inspection technologies. The present study leverages the elastic anisotropy of single crystals, which produces acoustic anisotropy, to ultrasonically detect and characterize RX regions produced within single-crystal specimens. Single crystals of pure Ni were processed to create controlled regions of RX. These specimens were ultrasonically examined in an immersion tank using a high-resolution, polyvinylidene fluoride transducer to detect acoustic impedance changes across the boundaries between different crystals (i.e., grains) within the RX region. Data from time-of-flight and absolute peak amplitude measurements were used to create acoustic images that were compared against electron microscope images of the RX regions. The ultrasonic inspection technique described here successfully detected not only the locations of RX regions, but also the approximate sizes and shapes of the RX regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research on the structure and properties of these alloys, such as density, freezing point, hardness, fractographic studies are presented. The developed alloys area very good alternative to current solutions in this area. The tested alloys were made on the basis of pure zinc with additions of aluminum, manganese, magnesium and antimony. The alloys solidify in the temperature range from 417 to 337 degrees C, and their hardness varies from 71 to 77 HB. The density of alloys ranges from 6.32 to 7.05 g/cm(3). The structure and mechanical properties of the tested alloys are determined mainly by the percentage of aluminum. The increase of this additive in the alloy from 0.5 to 5% by mass causes an increase of hardness and a change in structure to dendritic with eutectic 8-Al and a-Zn phases. All tested alloys exhibit brittle fracture character, regardless of the alloying additions amount (from 0.7 to 5.5% wt.). The addition of 5% aluminum and 0.5% magnesium to pure zinc reduces the solidification point of the material by more than 30 degrees C in comparison to pure zinc.

When examining the characteristics of NPFET and NCFET according to LExt and Lov, the NCFET exhibits gate capacitance (C-gg) tendency opposite to that of the NPFET.

92,"A new strategy with gradient cooling method was proposed for characterizing the rheological properties of CBT pure resin and CBT/catalyst mixture system under special molding conditions based on a digital high-temperature rotary viscometer. The results show that the apparent viscosity of CBT pure resin can be accurately obtained by using the gradient cooling method. The apparent viscosity of CBT pure resin is increased with the decrease of temperature, and is decreased with the increase of the rotating speed, and shows a significant shear thinning phenomenon at 170-180 degrees C. The reaction rate of the CBT/catalyst resin system is increased with the increase of the catalyst content, and the molding window time is shortened. Under the same concentration conditions, the CBT/T9 system with higher tin content has a faster reaction rate than the CBT500/DBTL system. With the increase of molding temperature, the reaction rate of CBT/catalyst system shows the trend of slowing down. This may be due to the increased volatilization of the catalyst and the decreased crystallization rate at higher molding temperature. Finally, the effects of different catalyst types, different concentrations and molding temperatures on the molding window time of CBT resin system were studied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

98,"The voltage- and the temperature-dependent electrical behavior of a gap-type Ag-Ag2S-Pt atomic switch is theoretically investigated. The electrical tunnel current passing through the switch is calculated and the growth of Ag nanowires between two electrodes is simulated. Our calculations show the switching time (the time that is required to decrease the resistance of switch below the resistance quantum R-Q approximate to 6.5 k ohm) exponentially decreases as the applied voltage increases that agrees very well with experimental findings. Furthermore, we assumed the Ag2S layer is a few atomic layer thick so the diffusion time of Ag+ ions within the Ag2S layer can be neglected compared to the formation of Ag nanowires. As a result, the switching time decreases exponentially as temperature increases. The switching time is calculated while different DC voltages are applied to the switch over temperature range of T = 300-350 K. The results imply both of the voltage- and the temperature-dependent behavior of the gap-type Ag-Ag2S-Pt atomic switch is dominated by the Coulomb blockade (CB) effect of Ag nanowires as electrons require energy to overcome the CB energy of Ag nanowires to sustain the growth of Ag nanowires.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated several characteristics of the focus after optimization to evaluate the enhancement effect of the wavefront shaping method, including the spot size, the intensity, and two types of enhancement factor. In addition, we studied the influences of various experimental parameters on these characteristics, including the number of controlled segments N, diameter of the irradiated area at the front of the scattering medium D, and distance between the expected focusing spot and scattering medium Z. A larger N and smaller Z provided a smaller focus spot. For a brighter focus spot, a larger N and smaller D and Z were required, while for a high-resolution focus spot, larger N, D, and Z were required. (c) 2019 Author(s).
