The existence of the magnetic skyrmion crystal (SkX) state was recently verified experimentally for MnSi and Fe0.5Co0.5Si by means of small-angle neutron scattering(7,8) and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy(9). However, to enable the application of such a SkX for spintronic function, materials problems such as a low crystallization temperature and low stability of SkX have to be overcome. Here we report the formation of SkX close to room temperature in thin-films of the helimagnet FeGe. In addition to the magnetic twin structure, we found a magnetic chirality inversion of the SkX across lattice twin boundaries. Furthermore, for thin crystal plates with thicknesses much smaller than the SkX lattice constant (a(s)) the two-dimensional SkX is quite stable over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields, whereas for quasi-three-dimensional films with thicknesses over a(s) the SkX is relatively unstable and observed only around the helical transition temperature. The room-temperature stable SkX state as promised by this study will pave a new path to designing quantum-effect devices based on the controllable skyrmion dynamics.",10.1038/nmat2916,0,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,,

The electrocatalytical mechanism of nitrogen doped graphene in acidic environment was studied by using density functional theory (DFT). The simulations demonstrate that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on N-doped graphene is a direct four-electron pathway, which is consistent with the experimental observations. The energy calculated for each ORR step shows that the ORR can spontaneously occur on the N-graphene. The active catalytical sites on single nitrogen doped graphene are identified, which have either high positive spin density or high positive atomic charge density. The nitrogen doping introduces asymmetry spin density and atomic charge density, making it possible for N-graphene to show high electroncatalytic activities for the ORR.",10.1021/jp201991j,1,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,

The electrode architecture takes advantage of the high electrochemical activity from both the CoO and PPy, the high electronic conductivity of PPy, and the short ion diffusion pathway in ordered mesoporous nanowires. These merits together with the elegant synergy between CoO and PPy lead to a high specific capacitance of 2223 F g(-1) approaching the theoretical value, good rate capability, and cycling stability (99.8% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles).

To achieve competitive conversion efficiencies, the wires must absorb sunlight over a broad range of wavelengths and incidence angles, despite occupying only a modest fraction of the array's volume. Here, we show that arrays having less than 5% areal fraction of wires can achieve up to 96% peak absorption, and that they can absorb up to 85% of day-integrated, above-bandgap direct sunlight. In fact, these arrays show enhanced near-infrared absorption, which allows their overall sunlight absorption to exceed the ray-optics light-trapping absorption limit(18) for an equivalent volume of randomly textured planar Si, over a broad range of incidence angles. We furthermore demonstrate that the light absorbed by Si wire arrays can be collected with a peak external quantum efficiency of 0.89, and that they show broadband, near-unity internal quantum efficiency for carrier collection through a radial semiconductor/liquid junction at the surface of each wire. The observed absorption enhancement and collection efficiency enable a cell geometry that not only uses 1/100th the material of traditional wafer-based devices, but also may offer increased photovoltaic efficiency owing to an effective optical concentration of up to 20 times.",10.1038/NMAT2635,4,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Classical positive electrodes for Li-ion technology operate mainly through an insertion-deinsertion redox process involving cationic species. However, this mechanism is insufficient to account for the high capacities exhibited by the new generation of Li-rich (Li1-xNiyCozMn(1-x- y- z)O2) layered oxides that present unusual Li reactivity.

Moreover, they present good cycling behaviour with no signs of voltage decay and a small irreversible capacity. We also unambiguously show, on the basis of an arsenal of characterization techniques, that the reactivity of these high-capacity materials towards Li entails cumulative cationic (Mn+ -> M(n+1)+) and anionic (O2- -> O-2(2-)) reversible redox processes, owing to the d-sp hybridization associated with a reductive coupling mechanism.

An important question is whether coherent manipulation can be performed on such valley pseudospins, analogous to that implemented using true spin, in the quest for quantum technologies(7,8). Here, we show that valley coherence can be generated and detected. Because excitons in a single valley emit circularly polarized photons, linear polarization can only be generated through recombination of an exciton in a coherent superposition of the two valley states. Using monolayer semiconductor WSe2 devices, we first establish the circularly polarized optical selection rules for addressing individual valley excitons and trions. We then demonstrate coherence between valley excitons through the observation of linearly polarized luminescence, whose orientation coincides with that of the linearly polarized excitation, for any given polarization angle. In contrast, the corresponding photoluminescence from trions is not observed to be linearly polarized, consistent with the expectation that the emitted photon polarization is entangled with valley pseudospin. The ability to address coherence(9,10), in addition to valley polarization(11-15), is a step forward towards achieving quantum manipulation of the valley index necessary for coherent valleytronics.",10.1038/NNANO.2013.151,13,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Lately, black phosphorus has emerged as a promising new two-dimensional material due to its widely tunable and direct bandgap, high carrier mobility and remarkable in-plane anisotropic electrical, optical and phonon properties(3-9). However, current progress is primarily limited to its thin-film form. Here, we reveal highly anisotropic and strongly bound excitons in monolayer black phosphorus using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements at room temperature. We show that, regardless of the excitation laser polarization, the emitted light from the monolayer is linearly polarized along the light effective mass direction and centres around 1.3 eV, a clear signature of emission from highly anisotropic bright excitons. Moreover, photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy suggests a quasiparticle bandgap of 2.2 eV, from which we estimate an exciton binding energy of similar to 0.9 eV, consistent with theoretical results based on first principles. The experimental observation of highly anisotropic, bright excitons with large binding energy not only opens avenues for the future explorations of many-electron physics in this unusual two-dimensional material, but also suggests its promising future in optoelectronic devices.",10.1038/NNANO.2015.71,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at the parts per billion (ppb) level is critical for the early diagnosis of diseases. To obtain high sensitivity, two requirements need to be simultaneously satisfied: (i) low electrical noise and (ii) strong signal, which existing sensor materials cannot meet.

Ti3C2Tx MXene gas sensors exhibited a very low limit of detection of 50-100 ppb for VOC gases at room temperature.

Such a crossover can be achieved by peeling off a multilayer sample to a single layer. For exploration of physical behavior and device applications, it is much desired to reversibly modulate such crossover in a multilayer sample. Here we demonstrate that, in a few-layer sample where the indirect bandgap and direct bandgap are nearly degenerate, the temperature rise can effectively drive the system toward the 2D limit by thermally decoupling neighboring layers via interlayer thermal expansion. Such a situation is realized in few-layer MoSe2, which shows stark contrast from the well-explored MoS2 where the indirect and direct bandgaps are far from degenerate. Photoluminescence of few-layer MoSe2 is much enhanced with the temperature rise, much like the way that the photoluminescence is enhanced due to the bandgap crossover going from the bulk to the quantum limit, offering potential applications involving external modulation of optical properties in 2D semiconductors.

With respect to the charge transport, it is demonstrated that the electron mobility dominates the transport of the cell, varying from 10(-8) m(2) V-1 S-1 in as-cast devices to approximate to 3 x 10(-7) m(2) V-1 s(-1) after thermal annealing. The hole mobility in the P3HT phase of the blend is dramatically affected by thermal annealing. It increases by more than three orders of magnitude, to reach a value of up to approximate to 2 x 10(4) m(2) V-1 s(-1) after the annealing process, as a result of an improved crystallinity of the film. Moreover, upon annealing the absorption spectrum of P3HT:PCBM blends undergo a strong red-shift, improving the spectral overlap with solar emission, which results in an increase of more than 60% in the rate of charge-carrier generation. Subsequently, the experimental electron and hole mobilities are used to study the photocurrent generation in P3HT:PCBM devices as a function of annealing temperature. The results indicate that the most important factor leading to a strong enhancement of the efficiency, compared with non-annealed devices, is the increase of the hole mobility in the P3HT phase of the blend. Furthermore, numerical simulations indicate that under short-circuit conditions the dissociation efficiency of bound electron-hole pairs at the donor/acceptor interface is close to 90%, which explains the large quantum efficiencies measured in P3HT:PCBM blends.",10.1002/adfm.200500420,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This would particularly be true if magnesium alloys with controlled in vivo corrosion rates could be developed. Since the magnesium corrosion process depends on its corrosive environment, the corrosion rates of magnesium alloys under standard in vitro environmental conditions were compared to corrosion rates in an in vivo animal model. Two gravity-cast magnesium alloys (AZ91D, LAE442) were used in these investigations. Standardized immersion and electrochemical tests according to ASTM norms were performed. The in vivo corrosion tests were carried out by intramedullar implantation of sample rods of the magnesium alloys in guinea pig femura. The reduction in implant volume was determined by synchrotron-radiation-based microtomography. We found that in vivo corrosion was about four orders of magnitude lower than in vitro corrosion of the tested alloys. Furthermore, the tendency of the corrosion rates obtained from in vitro corrosion tests were in the opposite direction as those obtained from the in vivo study. The results of this study suggest, that the conclusions drawn from current ASTM standard in vitro corrosion tests cannot be used to predict in vivo corrosion rates of magnesium alloys.

The guidance discusses the fire scenario with respect to applied heat flux, length scale, temperature, ventilation, anaerobic pyrolysis and set-up represented by the cone calorimeter. The fire properties measured in the cone calorimeter are discussed, including heat release rate and its peak, the mass loss and char yield, effective heat of combustion and combustion efficiency, time to ignition and CO and smoke production together with deduced quantities such as FIGRA and MARHE. Special comments are made on the use of the cone calorimeter relating to sample thickness, textiles, foams and intumescent materials, and the distance of the cone heater from the sample surface.

Our results show that FDM allows the design and fabrication of highly reproducible bioresorbable 3D scaffolds with a fully interconnected pore network. The mechanical properties and in vitro biocompatibility of polycaprolactone scaffolds with a porosity of 61 +/- 1% and two matrix architectures were studied. The honeycomblike pores had a size falling within the range of 360 x 430 x 620 mum. The scaffolds with a 0/60/120 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in air of 41.9 +/- 3.5 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degreesC) of 29.4 +/- 4.0 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively.

Statistical analysis confirmed that the five-angle scaffolds had significantly lower stiffness and 1% offset yield strengths under compression loading than those with a three-angle pattern under both testing conditions (p less than or equal to 0.05). The obtained stress-strain curves for both scaffold architectures demonstrate the typical behavior of a honeycomb structure undergoing deformation. In vitro studies were conducted with primary human fibroblasts and periosteal cells. Light, environmental scanning electron, and confocal laser microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry showed cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production on the polycaprolactone surface in the Ist culturing week.

The microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated scaffolds were assessed and compared to the designed porous architectures and computationally predicted properties. Scaffolds were then seeded with bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) transduced fibroblasts and implanted subcutaneously to evaluate biological properties and to demonstrate tissue in-growth. The work done illustrates the ability to design and fabricate PCL scaffolds with porous architecture that have sufficient mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering applications using SLS. Compressive modulus and yield strength values ranged from 52 to 67 MPa and 2.0 to 3.2 Mpa, respectively, lying within the lower range of properties reported for human trabecular bone. Finite element analysis (FEA) results showed that mechanical properties of scaffold designs and of fabricated scaffolds can be computationally predicted. Histological evaluation and micro-computed tomography (mu CT) analysis of implanted scaffolds showed that bone can be generated in vivo.

The high aspect ratio of the carbon nanofibers provides an ideal structure for trapping polysulfides, and the thin carbon wall allows rapid transport of lithium ions. The small dimension of these nanofibers provides a large surface area per unit mass for Li2S deposition during cycling and reduces pulverization of electrode materials due to volumetric expansion.

B,"Kim, H; Tadesse, Y; Priya, S",Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting,"This chapter provides the introductory information on piezoelectric energy harvesting covering various aspects such as modeling, selection of materials, vibration harvesting device design using bulk and MEMS approach, and energy harvesting circuits. All these characteristics are illustrated through selective examples. A simple step-by-step procedure is presented to design the cantilever beam based energy harvester by incorporating piezoelectric material at maximum stress points in first and second resonance modes. Suitable piezoelectric material for vibration energy harvesting is characterized by the large magnitude of product of the piezoelectric voltage constant (g) and the piezoelectric strain constant (d) given as (d . g). The condition for obtaining large magnitude of d.g has been shown to be as vertical bar d vertical bar = epsilon(n), where E is the permittivity of the material and n is a material parameter having, lower limit of 0.5. The material can be in the form of polycrystalline ceramics, textured ceramics, thin films, and polymers. A brief coverage of various material systems is provided in all these categories. Using these materials different transducer structures can be fabricated depending upon the desired frequency and vibration amplitude such as multilayer, MFC, bimorph, amplified piezoelectric actuator, QuickPack, rainbow, cymbal, and moonie. The concept of multi modal energy harvesting is introduced at the end of the chapter. This concept provides the opportunity for further enhancement of power density by combining two different energy-harvesting schemes in one system such that one assists the other.",10.1007/978-0-387-76464-1_1,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When an ethanol solution containing both poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, M-w approximate to 1300 000) and titanium tetraisopropoxide was injected through a needle under a strong electrical field, composite nanofibers made of PVP and amorphous TiO2 were formed (with lengths up to several centimeters) as a result of electrostatic jetting. These nanofibers could be subsequently converted into anatase without changing their morphology via calcination in air at 500 degreesC. The average diameter of these ceramic nanofibers could be controlled in the range from 20 to 200 nm by varying a number of parameters such as the ratio between PVP and titanium tetraisopropoxide, their concentrations in the alcohol solution, the strength of the electric field, and the feeding rate of the precursor solution.

The interrelationship between this new parameter and the critical cooling rate or critical section thickness is elaborated and discussed in comparison with two other representatives, i.e. reduced glass transition temperature T-rg (= T-g/T-l, where T-g and T-l are the glass transition temperature and liquidus temperature, respectively) and supercooled liquid range DeltaT(xg) (= T-x-T-g, where T-x is the onset crystallization temperature and T-g the glass transition temperature). Our results have shown that DeltaT(xg) alone cannot infer relative GFA for BMGs while the new parameter gamma, defined as T-x/(T-g + T-l), has a much better interrelationship with GFA than T-rg. An approximation of the critical cooling rate and critical section thickness for glass formation in bulk metallic glasses is also formulated and evaluated.

J,"Etxeberria, M; Vázquez, E; Marí, A; Barra, M",Influence of amount of recycled coarse aggregates and production process on properties of recycled aggregate concrete,"in this study recycled coarse aggregates obtained by crushed concrete were used for concrete production. Four different recycled aggregate concretes were produced; made with 0%, 25%, 50% and 100% of recycled coarse aggregates, respectively. The mix proportions of the four concretes were designed in order to achieve the same compressive strengths. Recycled aggregates were used in wet condition, but not saturated, to control their fresh concrete properties, effective w/c ratio and lower strength variability. The necessity to produce recycled aggregate concrete with low-medium compressive strength was verified due to the requirement of the volume of cement. The influence of the order of materials used in concrete production (made with recycled aggregates) with respect to improving its splitting tensile strength was analysed. The lower modulus of elasticity of recycled coarse aggregate concretes with respect to conventional concretes was measured verifying the numeral models proposed by several researchers.

This is enabled by engineering the corresponding optical properties of the designed parity-time metamaterial in the complex dielectric permittivity plane. Numerical simulations and experimental verification consistently exhibit asymmetric reflection with high contrast ratios around a wavelength of of 1,550 nm.

ABO assumes that the lighter electrons adjust adiabatically to the motion of the heavier nuclei, remaining at any time in their instantaneous ground state. ABO is well justified when the energy gap between ground and excited electronic states is larger than the energy scale of the nuclear motion. In metals, the gap is zero and phenomena beyond ABO (such as phonon-mediated superconductivity or phonon-induced renormalization of the electronic properties) occur(3). The use of ABO to describe lattice motion in metals is, therefore, questionable(4,5). In spite of this, ABO has proved effective for the accurate determination of chemical reactions(6), molecular dynamics(7,8) and phonon frequencies(9-11) in a wide range of metallic systems. Here, we show that ABO fails in graphene. Graphene, recently discovered in the free state(12,13), is a zero-bandgap semiconductor(14) that becomes a metal if the Fermi energy is tuned applying a gate voltage(13,15), V-g.

A combination of powder immersion, shelf stability, light diffraction, and microscopy measurements is used to characterize the systems. Emulsions stabilized by either very hydrophilic or very hydrophobic particles are large (>100 mum) and unstable to coalescence.

The stability of emulsions to gravity-induced separation passes through a sharp maximum upon increasing the particle hydrophobicity, alongside a minimum in the average drop diameter.

AM is versatile, flexible, highly customizable and, as such, can suite most sectors of industrial production. Materials to make these parts/objects can be of a widely varying type. These include metallic, ceramic and polymeric materials along with combinations in the form of composites, hybrid, or functionally graded materials (FGMs). The challenge remains, however, to transfer this 'making' shapes and structures into obtaining objects that are functional. A great deal of work is needed in AM in addressing the challenges related to its two key enabling technologies namely 'materials' and 'metrology' to achieve this functionality in a predictive and reproductive ways. The good news is that there is a significant interest in industry for taking up AM as one of the main production engineering route. Additive Manufacturing, in our opinion, is definitely at the cross-road from where this new, much-hyped but somewhat unproven manufacturing process must move towards a technology that can demonstrate the ability to produce real, innovative, complex and robust products.",10.1016/j.mattod.2017.07.001,68,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,

J,"Oksman, K; Skrifvars, M; Selin, JF",Natural fibres as reinforcement in polylactic acid (PLA) composites,"The focus in this work has been to study if natural fibres can be used as reinforcement in polymers based on renewable raw materials. The materials have been flax fibres and polylactic acid (PLA). PLA is a thermoplastic polymer made from lactic acid and has mainly been used for biodegradable products, such as plastic bags and planting cups, but in principle PLA can also be used as a matrix material in composites. Because of the brittle nature of PLA triacetin was tested as plasticizer for PLA and PLA/flax composites in order to improve the impact properties. The studied composite materials were manufactured with a twin-screw extruder having a flax fibre content of 30 and 40 wt.%. The extruded compound was compression moulded to test samples. The processing and material properties have been studied and compared to the more commonly used polypropylene flax fibre composites (PP/flax). Preliminary results show that the mechanical properties of PLA and flax fibre composites are promising. The composite strength is about 50% better compared to similar PP/flax fibre composites, which are used today in many automotive panels. The addition of plasticizer does not show any positive effect on the impact strength of the composites. The study of interfacial adhesion shows that adhesion needs to be improved to optimise the mechanical properties of the PLA/flax composites. The PLA/flax composites did not show any difficulties in the extrusion and compression moulding processes and they can be processed in a similar way as PP based composites.

Samples with grain sizes varying between 3 and 23 mum were prepared by altering the extrusion conditions. Compression testing of the extruded bar was carried out at temperatures between ambient and 200 degreesC. Twinning dominated the deformation at lower temperatures but this gave way to slip dominated flow when the temperature was raised. For tests carried out at intermediate temperatures, a similar transition was observed when the grain size was reduced. The transition was accompanied by a change in flow curve shape and Hall-Petch slope. The peak stresses achieved when twinning dominated the deformation were up to 100 MPa greater than those seen when slip dominated the flow. Critical grain sizes marking the twinning-slip transition were identified and these are described in terms of the deformation conditions. (C) 2004 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of particle size, concentration and the use of dispersants on the antibacterial behaviour are examined.

The antibacterial activity increases with increasing nanoparticle concentration and increases with decreasing particle size. Particle concentration is observed to be more important than particle size under the conditions of this work.

Increasing the Ni fraction in the cathode delivered a higher discharge capacity (192.9 mA h g(-1) for Li[Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2]O-2 versus 235.0 mA h g(-1) for Li[Ni0.95Co0.025Mn0.025]O-2); however, the cycling stability was substantially reduced.

The relatively inferior cycling stability of Li[NixCoyMn1-x-y]O-2 with x > 0.8 is attributed to the phase transition near the charge-end, causing an abrupt anisotropic shrinkage (or expansion during discharge), which was suppressed for compositions of x < 0.8. Residual stress stemming from the phase transition destabilized the internal microcracks and allowed the microcracks to propagate to the surface, providing channels for electrolyte penetration and subsequent degradation of the exposed internal surfaces formed by the microcracks. Further developments in particle morphology are required to dissipate the intrinsic lattice strain, stabilize the surface, and modify the composition to attain a satisfactory long-term cycling stability, and hence battery life.",10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b05269,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first is an internal, magnetoelectric coupling between antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in the BiFeO3 film that leads to electric-field control of the antiferromagnetic order. The second is based on exchange interactions at the interface between a ferromagnet (Co(0.9)Fe(0.1)) and the antiferromagnet.

The low-voltage process is quite reversible over the 0.02 to 1.8 V range with a sustained capacity of about 150 mAh/g over a few hundred cycles. Within such a range of potential the polymer/gel-like is barely evolving while it vanishes as the oxidation potential is increased above 2 V.

J,"Chevalier, J; Gremillard, L; Virkar, AV; Clarke, DR",The Tetragonal-Monoclinic Transformation in Zirconia: Lessons Learned and Future Trends,"Zirconia ceramics have found broad applications in a variety of energy and biomedical applications because of their unusual combination of strength, fracture toughness, ionic conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. These attractive characteristics are largely associated with the stabilization of the tetragonal and cubic phases through alloying with aliovalent ions. The large concentration of vacancies introduced to charge compensate of the aliovalent alloying is responsible for both the exceptionally high ionic conductivity and the unusually low, and temperature independent, thermal conductivity. The high fracture toughness exhibited by many of zirconia ceramics is attributed to the constraint of the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation and its release during crack propagation. In other zirconia ceramics containing the tetragonal phase, the high fracture toughness is associated with ferroelastic domain switching. However, many of these attractive features of zirconia, especially fracture toughness and strength, are compromised after prolonged exposure to water vapor at intermediate temperatures (similar to 30 degrees-300 degrees C) in a process referred to as low-temperature degradation (LTD), and initially identified over two decades ago. This is particularly so for zirconia in biomedical applications, such as hip implants and dental restorations. Less well substantiated is the possibility that the same process can also occur in zirconia used in other applications, for instance, zirconia thermal barrier coatings after long exposure at high temperature. Based on experience with the failure of zirconia femoral heads, as well as studies of LTD, it is shown that many of the problems of LTD can be mitigated by the appropriate choice of alloying and/or process control.",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03278.x,84,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,

An alternative way to induce a spin torque using an electric current has been proposed based on intrinsic spin-orbit magnetic fields(9,10) and recently realized in a strained low-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor(11). Here we demonstrate that strong magnetic fields can be induced in ferromagnetic metal films lacking structure inversion symmetry through the Rashba effect. Owing to the combination of spin-orbit and exchange interactions, we show that an electric current flowing in the plane of a Co layer with asymmetric Pt and AlO(x) interfaces produces an effective transverse magnetic field of 1 T per 10(8) Acm(-2). Besides its fundamental significance, the high efficiency of this process makes it a realistic candidate for room-temperature spintronic applications.",10.1038/NMAT2613,92,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Microstructural observation revealed that surface structures that can trap air are Important for the preparation of low-sliding-angle surfaces. We have also derived an equation that describes relationship between sliding angles and contact angles on superhydrophobic surfaces with roughness. The results calculated on the basis of this equation agreed well with the experimental ones. Moreover, we have successfully prepared a transparent superhydrophobic film whose sliding angle is similar to 1 degrees for a 7 mg water droplet. On this film, there was almost no resistance to the sliding of water droplets. The film obtained satisfies the requirements of superhydrophobicity, transparency, and a low water sliding angle.",10.1021/la991660o,93,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

J,"Ritter, KA; Lyding, JW",The influence of edge structure on the electronic properties of graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons,"Graphene shows promise as a future material for nanoelectronics owing to its compatibility with industry-standard lithographic processing, electron mobilities up to 150 times greater than Si and a thermal conductivity twice that of diamond. The electronic structure of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and quantum dots (GQDs) has been predicted to depend sensitively on the crystallographic orientation of their edges; however, the influence of edge structure has not been verified experimentally. Here, we use tunnelling spectroscopy to show that the electronic structure of GNRs and GQDs with 2-20nm lateral dimensions varies on the basis of the graphene edge lattice symmetry. Predominantly zigzag-edge GQDs with 7-8 nm average dimensions are metallic owing to the presence of zigzag edge states. GNRs with a higher fraction of zigzag edges exhibit a smaller energy gap than a predominantly armchair-edge ribbon of similar width, and the magnitudes of the measured GNR energy gaps agree with recent theoretical calculations.",10.1038/NMAT2378,95,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Erturk, A; Inman, DJ",An experimentally validated bimorph cantilever model for piezoelectric energy harvesting from base excitations,"Piezoelectric transduction has received great attention for vibration-to-electric energy conversion over the last five years. A typical piezoelectric energy harvester is a unimorph or a bimorph cantilever located on a vibrating host structure, to generate electrical energy from base excitations. Several authors have investigated modeling of cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvesters under base excitation. The existing mathematical modeling approaches range from elementary single-degree-of-freedom models to approximate distributed parameter solutions in the sense of Rayleigh-Ritz discretization as well as analytical solution attempts with certain simplifications. Recently, the authors have presented the closed-form analytical solution for a unimorph cantilever under base excitation based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumptions. In this paper, the analytical solution is applied to bimorph cantilever configurations with series and parallel connections of piezoceramic layers. The base excitation is assumed to be translation in the transverse direction with a superimposed small rotation. The closed-form steady state response expressions are obtained for harmonic excitations at arbitrary frequencies, which are then reduced to simple but accurate single-mode expressions for modal excitations. The electromechanical frequency response functions (FRFs) that relate the voltage output and vibration response to translational and rotational base accelerations are identified from the multi-mode and single-mode solutions. Experimental validation of the single-mode coupled voltage output and vibration response expressions is presented for a bimorph cantilever with a tip mass. It is observed that the closed-form single-mode FRFs obtained from the analytical solution can successfully predict the coupled system dynamics for a wide range of electrical load resistance. The performance of the bimorph device is analyzed extensively for the short circuit and open circuit resonance frequency excitations and the accuracy of the model is shown in all cases.",10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025009,96,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,
J,"Yang, S; Wang, Y; Liu, PR; Cheng, YB; Zhao, HJ; Yang, HG",Functionalization of perovskite thin films with moisture-tolerant molecules,"Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are particularly suited as light-harvesting materials in photovoltaic devices. The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has reached certified values of over 20% in just a few years. However, one of the major hindrances for application of these materials in real-world devices is the performance degradation in humid conditions, leading to a rapid loss of photovoltaic response. Here, we demonstrate that hydrophobic tertiary and quaternary alkyl ammonium cations can be successfully assembled on the perovskite surface as efficient water-resisting layers via a facile surface functionalization technique. Such layers can protect the perovskite film under high relative humidity ( 90 +/- 5%) over 30 days. More importantly, devices based on such films can retain the photovoltaic capacities of bulk perovskites, with power conversion efficiencies over 15%. Improving the humidity tolerance of perovskite materials is a necessary step towards large-scale production of high- performance perovskite-based devices under ambient humidity.",10.1038/NENERGY.2015.16,97,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

In a solid, phase transitions involve collective atomic displacements, but such atomic processes have so far only been investigated using macroscopic approaches. Here, we show that in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy can be used to follow the structural transformation between semiconducting (2H) and metallic (11) phases in single-layered MoS2, with atomic resolution. The 2H/1T phase transition involves gliding atomic planes of sulphur and/or molybdenum and requires an intermediate phase (a-phase) as a precursor. The migration of two kinds of boundaries (beta- and gamma-boundaries) is also found to be responsible for the growth of the second phase. Furthermore, we show that areas of the 1T phase can be controllably grown in a layer of the 2H phase using an electron beam.",10.1038/NNANO.2014.64,98,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The present work developed a facile in situ method to construct g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free isotype heterojunction with molecular composite precursors with the aim to greatly promote the charge separation. Considering the fact that g-C3N4 samples prepared from urea and thiourea separately have different band structure, the molecular composite precursors of urea and thiourea were treated simultaneously under the same thermal conditions, in situ creating a novel layered g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free heterojunction (g-g CN heterojunction). This synthesis method is facile, economic, and environmentally benign using easily available earth-abundant green precursors. The confirmation of isotype g-g CN heterojunction was based on XRD, HRTEM, valence band XPS, ns-level PL, photocurrent, and EIS measurement. Upon visible-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons transfer from g-C3N4 (thiourea) to g-C3N4 (urea) driven by the conduction band offset of 0.10 eV, whereas the photogenerated holes transfer from g-C3N4 (urea) to g-C3N4 (thiourea) driven by the valence band offset of 0.40 eV. The potential difference between the two g-C3N4 components in the heterojunction is the main driving force for efficient charge separation and transfer. For the removal of NO in air, the g-g CN heterojunction exhibited significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity over g-C3N4 alone and physical mixture of g-C3N4 samples. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of g-g CN isotype heterojunction can be directly ascribed to efficient charge separation and transfer across the heterojunction interface as well as prolonged lifetime of charge carriers. This work demonstrated that rational design and construction of isotype heterojunction could open up a new avenue for the development of new efficient visible-light photocatalysts.",10.1021/am403653a,99,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,
