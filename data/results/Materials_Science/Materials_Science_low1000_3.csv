0,"A highly stretchable small-size 5 GHz dipole antenna is presented for wearable and mobile applications. A stretchable dipole antenna was fabricated using conductive polymer composite material composed of Ag flake filler and polyester binder. The dipole antenna was printed on a stretchable polyurethane substrate using a simple and inexpensive screen-printing technique. The stretchability and durability of the dipole antenna were evaluated by the stretching and cyclic stretching tests. The stretchable dipole antenna showed excellent stretchability and RF performances up to a tensile strain of 25%. The stretchable dipole antenna also exhibited outstanding mechanical durability in the 10,000-cycle cyclic stretching endurance tests.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes
1,"Metastable hexagonal Mg-Si was synthesized by implanting Mg ion into Si. Single-crystalline Si(111) was irradiated with Mg ions at elevated temperature followed by thermal annealing under vacuum. Microstructural analysis with transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of precipitates with sizes of several 10 nm in the damaged crystalline Si matrix. Using electron diffraction, the precipitates were identified as Mg1.8Si, and the crystallographic orientation relationship between Mg1.8Si precipitates and Si was determined. The phase stability of Mg1.8Si in the Si matrix is discussed in terms of the internal stress generated during the precipitation process.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no
2,"Superplastic forming of thin sheet corrugated structures is of special interest in developing aircraft technologies of new generation. The manufacture of such structures includes pressure welding of a package of three sheet blanks, consisting of two outer skin sheets and one inner core blank. The stop-off coating is applied to the inner surfaces of the skin sheets before welding. During superplastic forming of the package, the skin sheets take the form of a die cavity, while the core sheet stretches between the skins to form stiffeners. One of the main problems in manufacturing three-layer structures is known to be the formation of folds on the outer surface of the skins. The paper reports on studies of the influence of the inclination angle of stiffeners on folding. The choice of skin sheets with a thickness exceeding the thickness of the core sheet by 2 - 3 times may prevent the formation of folds. However, when manufacturing the corrugated structures of variable cross-section, such as hollow fan blades of an aircraft engine, the recommended ratio may not always be implemented. Moreover, its performance is limited by the permissible weight of the blade. In the present study, finite element modeling of the process of superplastic forming of three-layer structures made of titanium sheet alloy VT6 (analog of Ti-6Al-4V) is done using ANSYS software. According to the simulation results, it was found that with an increase in the inclination angle of the ribs, the holding time under pressure should be increased.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no
3,"We show, both analytically and numerically, that the non-relativistic and relativistic quantum predictions for the dynamics of a prototypical driven electron - the periodically kicked rotor - do not always agree in the non-relativistic regime. The surprisingly different quantum predictions could be tested experimentally using ultra-cold fermionic atoms in a periodically-pulsed 1D optical lattice. Similar breakdown of agreement should occur for driven quantum systems in general. Since the relativistic theory should be empirically correct, it must be used instead of the approximate non-relativistic theory to correctly study the quantum dynamics of a driven system after the breakdown time, which could lead to important contributions in a wide range of fields from atomic to molecular, chemical and condensed-matter physics.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes
4,"The impact of chip size and hydrolysis temperature on changing chemical composition of hornbeam wood and following soda pulping is investigated. Three chip sizes, two temperatures (60 and 90 degrees C) and 120 minutes retention time in pre-hydrolysis step were selected. After pre-hydrolysis treatment, the sample was divided into two portions; one third was used for chemical analysis and the other two thirds for soda pulping. The reference soda pulping conditions were used on either treated or untreated chips. The influence of pre-hydrolysis was determined measuring cellulose and lignin content, residual alkali and the hemicelluloses removal. The lignin and cellulose content were marginally increased and the hemicellulose removal was higher at larger chip size. Total yield and rejects, kappa number and strength properties of the unbleached pulp were measured using corresponding Tappi standard test methods. The pulping total yield and rejects of the treated chips varied between 30.31 % and 48.14 % and 0.83 % to 7.31 %, respectively. The reject from soda pulping of untreated chips was 24.16.

5,"The stabilization of a perovskite structure in yet-unreported Pb(Zn1/2W1/2)O-3 (PZW) was attempted through compositional modification by multiple species of Mg and Fe for Zn. The attempt was accomplished through the substitutions by >= 20 mol% Pb(Mg1/2W1/2)O-3 (PMW) at the presence of additional 20 mol% Pb(Fe2/3W1/3)O-3 (PFW). The perovskite formation yields were 0% (0.8PZW-0.2PFW), 88.3% (0.6PZW-0.2PMW-0.2PFW), and >= 99.7% (virtually completed state) at higher levels of substituent PMW. Lattice parameters of the perovskite structure decreased nearly linearly with increasing fractions of Mg. Developed microstructures of the sintered ceramics mostly revealed well-developed perovskite grains with a multi-faceted polyhedral morphology. Their fracture modes were virtually intergranular. Frequency-dependent dielectric dispersion behaviors, with diffuse modes in the phase transition, were observed at the modified composition range. Values of the maximum dielectric constant increased sharply at an intermediate composition range, whereas corresponding temperatures were comparatively insensitive to the compositional change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"Tensile flow behaviors of the fine-grained ZK60 alloy sheet are investigated from 298 K to 523 K with strain rates from 10(?1) s(?1) to 10(?3) s(?1). The apparent activation energy tested at 523 K is estimated to be 103 kJ mol(?1), indicating that grain-boundary sliding (GBS) associated with grain boundary diffusion is the dominant deformation mechanism of the fine-grained ZK60 alloy. The effects of deformation temperature and strain rate on the strain-hardening and strain-softening behaviors are analyzed by the K-M approach. The results show that the dislocation proliferation contributes to the hardening process but DRX play an important role in the softening process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"The wetting behavior in laser brazing can be designated as inconstant, caused largely by external process discontinuities such as the wire feeding. To reveal periodic melt pool propagation effects that occur during laser brazing of aluminum and for a better understanding of those effects in laser brazing in general, this paper analyzes high-speed recordings of the brazing process with aluminum alloy. It is demonstrated that two main effects of periodic melt pool behavior in different frequency scales occur during the process, related directly to the wire feeding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Developing excellent performance conductors with high strength and electrical conductivity is a key issue in the electrical conductor industries. In this paper, an extruded composites containing trace amounts of Sc, Zr and graphene was prepared. Then all samples were extruded into round bars with a final diameter of 6.3 mm. Research results show that the UTS of one stage aging is 1812.7 MPa and the elongation is 21.4%. The hardness increases rapidly from 25.8HB(Brinell hardness) to 69.8HB within the first 12 h when the aging temperature at 280 C. During the secondly stage aging, a peak electrical conductivity of 58.5%IACS(International annealed copper standard, 100%IACS=58.0 MS m(?1)), which is obtained after a secondary aging at 380 C for 48 h. A large number of nano-sized precipitates phase with smaller diameter are uniformly distributed throughout the matrix after aging at 280 C for 24 h. With the increasing of aging time, the size of the precipitates phase increases significantly. This work also provides a good guideline for designing heat-resistant conductors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"This study analyzes a thermophoretic motion system with a variable heat transmission which models the nonlinear wrinkle motions in substrate-supported graphene sheets. Through symbolic computation, the analytic N-soliton solutions are obtained for the system. The N-soliton solutions can be used to describe the multiple wrinkles in graphene sheets. Furthermore, wrinkle propagation and interaction are discussed. Snake-, V- and Z-like wrinkles are observed graphically by choosing the heat transmission function as three specific functions. A collision between wrinkles is elastic. Before and after the collision, wrinkle energy and propagation direction remain unchanged. But at collision points, the energy carried by the larger wrinkles will be subtracted. The research contributes to a deeper understanding to the structures, characteristics and propagation behavior of the wrinkles in the grapheme sheets, and has potential applications in graphene materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"Tungstate source and tartrate (Tar(2-)) additive were examined for their influences on the hydrothermal formation and characteristics of ZnWO4 nanocrystals. It was clearly shown that quasi-equiaxed nanocrystallites of similar to 50-100 nm in diameter and nanorods of similar to 40-50 nm in diameter and up to similar to 700 nm in length can be generated with (NH4)(10)W12O41 center dot 5H(2)O and K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O as tungsten sources, respectively. Introducing Tar(2-) into the K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O reaction system effectively transformed the primary crystallites of ZnWO4 from nanorods into quasi-equiaxed nanocrystals (similar to 20-50 nm) and then nanoplates (thickness of similar to 20 nm, lateral size of similar to 200 nm) and, meanwhile, aggregated the crystallites into spheroidal clusters (similar to 2-3 mu m in diameter) with the increasing Tar(2-)/Zn2+ molar ratio up to similar to 2. Optical spectroscopy revealed that the ZnWO4 products exhibit broad-band photoluminescence (similar to 425-700 nm) through T-3(1u) -> (1)A(1g) transition of the [WO6](6-) ligand under short ultraviolet excitation and the nanorods show the best luminescence among all tested samples. Calcination at 500 degrees C may effectively remove the adsorbed Tar(2-) species and greatly improve luminescence of the samples synthesized in the presence of Tar(2-).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,We present a unified method to derive the reflectivity of a plane wave normally incident on an interface. The key idea is to use the flux continuity and the proposed principle of least reflection to acquire the needed generality and conciseness.

12,"Composite modified slag fiber (CMSF) has been widely used as insulation material for enclosures in the field of construction; however, its corrosion characteristics and crack formation are unclear. Therefore, the damage behavior of CMSFs with two acidity coefficients (ACs) immersed in water for 365 days was studied; the fiber structure and composition were measured. The crystalline phase on the fiber surface was identified as CaCO3 deposits that dissolved after long-term immersion, resulting in pits. Owing to continuous replacement of H+, Ca2+ continuously migrates from the inside to the outside of the fiber, resulting in a stepwise increase in the AC of the fiber cross-section; the surface pits significantly increased and joined together to form an axial crack. However, the Si-O-Si bond has no significant fracture during long-term immersion. These findings support the theory on the crack behavior of CMSFs during long-term immersion for practical applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Cabbage waste (CW), as one important source of vegetable wastes, was a potential alternative for the biogas production due to the readily biodegradable properties. Therefore, optimization of acidogenesis of CW in two-stage process was studied in leaching bed reactor (LBR). The main influential parameters such as regulated initial pH and leachate recirculations with different volumes were investigated in this study. Inoculum to substrate ratio (ISR) and sprinkle frequency which had negligible effect on the VFAs production played an important part in the acidification rate. The diversity of microbial community was analyzed and great changes in bacteria and archaea distribution were observed. The relative abundance of acidogenic bacteria increased to 99.8% after acidification, which mainly consisted of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, however, the archaea population was substituted by rapid-growing bacteria and decreased sharply. The optimization of acidogenesis and microbial analysis would provide information on how to operate the LBR efficiently based on the process and microbiological control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"A shearing interferometer based on the use of a low-coherence short-wave infrared source, two Savart shear devices, and the phase-shifting technique is proposed in this research. It is free of speckle-noise and robust to environmental perturbations, and it is capable to identify phase-type defects in the inspected sample using a gradient image obtained by the phase-shifting technique. This paper introduces the configuration, measurement theory, experimental setup, and experimental results of the proposed interferometer. The results confirm the capability of defect detections of the proposed interferometer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"In the present study, antibacterial paper was prepared by mixing chlorhexidine with modified galactomannan. The effects of the oxidation time and citric acid dosages in the modification processes on the physical properties of the paper samples were examined. Also, the effects of the antibacterial agent dosages on the antibacterial properties were studied. The results showed that when the oxidation time was 5 hours, the tensile index, bursting index, and folding endurance increased by 18.4%, 31.9%, and 200.0 %, respectively, when compared with the control paper. Also, when the amount of citric acid was 7%, the tensile index, bursting index, and the folding endurance increased by 20.3%, 36.6%, and 195.1 %, respectively, when compared with the control paper. The paper with two modified polysaccharides displayed antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This study's elemental analysis results indicated that when the amount of chlorhexidine was 2%, its retention in paper with oxidized or esterified galactomannans was 1.74% and 1.59%, respectively. Furthermore, the SEM results showed that the structures of the bacteria around the inhibition zone were damaged and their activities had been inhibited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"Anisotropy photoresponse can be effectively achieved based on gradient organic heterojunction. However, the gradient heterojunction has yet been studied due to the complicated process and great random error inside. Especially in the field of transient optics, the light on/off in femto/picosecond range is vitally important for high-speed optical systems, such as application in fiber communications. In this paper, the wedge-structured organic heterojunction was fabricated based on molecular beam epitaxy. The devices were combined with both wedge-structured heterojunction and half-wave plate. When the probe light was tuned to 2.0 eV, a narrow passband was instantly observed once the pump and probe light were perpendicular to each other. The photoresponse can be achieved within 0.84 ps which can tune the optical signals on and off in transient optics. The results have demonstrated an exciting application in photo sensing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"Using pulsed laser deposition technique, highly c-axis oriented CeO2 film with the in-plane full width of half maximum (FWHM) value of 2.78 degrees was fabricated on the homoepitaxial MgO (homo-MgO) layer for the first time. Interestingly, the quality of the CeO2 film was inconsistent with the homo-MgO film. To explain the puzzling finding, the growth mechanism of CeO2 on the homo-MgO films had been illustrated. The potential barrier caused by large value of roughness was put forward to explain the appearance of the CeO2 (111) peak. In addition, by the interaction of MgO film's texture and surface roughness, the reason why a higher quality of CeO2 film obtained under the P-s of 70 W was clarified in detail. In the end, we presented compelling evidence to prove the reason why the c-axis oriented CeO2 film can grow on the IBAD-MgO substrate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

19,"The electric field gradient (EFG) is studied via ab initio density functional theory calculations for the prototype LaMnO3 manganite under ferromagnetic and A-type antiferromagnetic configurations with different values of on-site Hubbard U potential correction on the Mn-3d states. It is shown that the relaxation of internal atomic positions inhibits fully activated MnO6 Jahn-Teller distortions, as determined by calculating the EFG tensor and the Jahn-Teller distortion parameter.. In fact, a strong correlation between the EFG values, especially at the La site, and the Jahn-Teller distortion was found and used to confirm the importance of an appropriate description of the electron-electron correlations when predicting the ground state properties of LaMnO3 using a GGA + U approximation for the exchange-correlation functional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"The Co1.1Fe1.9O4 ferrite with high magnetic anisotropy has great potential to be applied in sensors, transformers, and magnetic recording, etc. However, there are few researches about improving the magnetic anisotropy of Co1.1Fe1.9O4 ferrite. In this work, the tape-casting method was adopted to fabricate laminated Co1.1Fe1.9O4 ceramics. Their relative densities are all higher than 95%, and their magnetic anisotropies especially for Delta M-r (the percentage residual magnetization between in-plane and out-of-plane) and Delta H(C )are considerably enhanced by this method comparing with that of the Co1.1Fe1.9O4 ceramic prepared by traditional solid-state reaction. It is also found that the magnetic anisotropies of these laminated Co1.1Fe1.9O4 ceramics are thickness-dependent probably due to the effect of grain size, that is, the magnetic anisotropies can be stronger when reducing the thickness of the sample. This provides a new approach to improve the magnetic anisotropy of ferrites for electronic devices applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"The micro-structure and mechanical properties of DZ9 superalloy were studied before, after, and during the high-temperature aging by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoindentation, and fatigue tests. The obtained results showed that the ??-phase of the superalloy was significantly coarsened after a long-term aging at 980?; however, the cubic-shape morphology was basically retained for the ??-phase. Changes of the hardness and modulus of the eutectic ??-phase were not apparent; while, these properties were decreased for the dendrite arm of the ?- phase. Moreover, the tensile-strength and lifetime in creep-rupture were also declined under 980 ?/250 MPa. In addition, aside from aging, both the average elasticity modulus and hardness were higher in the vertical direction of the columnar crystal compared to those in the parallel direction of ?001?. It is also of great importance to study the anisotropy of the directional solidification of the nickel-based superalloy and direction of the mechanical properties of the eutectic ??-phase and the dendrite arm ??-phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"In this paper Al-Al2O3 nanocomposites were prepared through liquid metallurgy route and their microstructure, mechanical and tribological properties are analyzed. The pin-on-disc equipment under dry sliding conditions was used to determine the wear characteristics of prepared nanocomposites. The worn surfaces of nanocomposite Al-Al2O3 nano-composite have been characterized by SEM. The hardness of the cast nanocomposite samples was measured by using Vickers micro hardness tester. In tensile test specimens, the acoustic emission (AE) technique was used to monitor the acoustic energy released during the deformation process and for the early crack detection of the composite material. The investigation shows that Al- 1.2Al(2)O(3) nano-composites have improved wear resistance, least co-efficient of friction, best surface smoothness than the Al6061 matrix alloy.

26,"Swift heavy ion irradiation on nonlinear optical active potassium pentaborate (KB5) single crystal altered the structural, optical and electrical properties of the crystal. Point defects created during irradiation is evidenced from the high resolution X-ray diffraction analysis. From the photoluminescence spectrum it is understood that the weakening of B-O bond led to red shift in the KB5 crystal. The frequency dependence of dielectric constant and dielectric loss is been explained on the basis of polarization mechanism. Also it is observed that the polarization decreases due to trapping of charge carriers at the defect regions. The increase in conductivity with frequency is due to the reduction in the space charge polarization at higher frequencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"Kadam is a fast growing tree species in Bangladesh. The main aim of this study is to observe the influence of tree age of kadam on chemical pulping. In this research 8, 18 and 30 years old kadam wood were pulped under different active alkali of 16, 18 and 19% maintaining 25% sulphidity and its effect on chemical composition, kappa number, pulp yield and delignification was investigated. The result shows that the content of extractive, lignin, alpha-cellulose and hemicellulose increase to different content along with the increase of tree age. There are also some differences of pulping properties with different tree age. Pulp yield of 8 years old kadam is higher than other ages of kadam trees. The hand sheets were made and the physical strength properties likely tear, tensile and burst were evaluated at two freeness level.

28,"Dynamic response of a round aluminum tube supported at both ends was investigated when impacted at its center by an external mechanical loading. The tube was subjected to different conditions. First, the empty tube was tested. Then the tube was filled with different amounts of stationary water (i.e., 25, 50, 75, and 100% full), based on the inner volume of the tube. Finally, flowing water through the tube was considered. Different magnitudes of impact loading were also applied. The study was primarily conducted experimentally with some additional numerical studies completed to further understand the results. The impact force as well as strain along the tube were measured for all described test conditions. Their results were compared. Additionally, the vibrational frequency and damping of the system were examined using strain-time histories. The results showed that the dynamic behavior of the tube was significantly dependent on the amount of internal water as well as its flow condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

XRD patterns showed a single YBa2Cu3O7-delta phase for all samples. The resistance versus temperature measurements showed that all samples exhibited metallic normal state behavior. The addition of Li2O3 suppressed the superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O7-delta more than Na2CO3 and K2CO3. The AC susceptibility measurements showed a decrease in T-c chi ' for Li2CO3 addition. T-c chi ' was not much affected with Na2CO3 and K2CO3 addition which was around 93-94 K for x = 0-1.0 wt%. However, T-c chi ' was very much suppressed in the Li2O3-added samples with T-c chi ' decreasing from 94 K for x = 0 to 83 K for x = 1.0 wt%. The peak temperature T-p of the imaginary part of the susceptibility chi '' shifted to lower temperatures for Li2CO3, Na2CO3 and K2CO3 addition. This indicated the intergranular coupling and flux pinning force were suppressed when alkali metal carbonate was added. This work also showed that alkali metals with smaller ionic radius, Li, suppressed superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O7-delta more than the larger ionic radius, Na and K.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"Ultrasonic treatment (UST) of metals is based on the exciting of resonant high-frequency vibrations to induce oscillating elastic stresses in the bulk of materials, which result in the generation, motion and rearrangement of crystal lattice defects. Normally, the resonant vibrations are obtained by using cylindrical samples or ultrasonic instruments having the length equal to the half-wavelength of ultrasound. In such waveguides, however, the distribution of the stress amplitude is not uniform along their axis. Accordingly, changes in the structure and properties due to the UST are different along the sample. I sere, a new type of ultrasonic waveguide based on the Gaussian (ampulla) horn is proposed and called a double-Gaussian waveguide. It is composed of two identical high-amplitude parts of a Gaussian waveguide joined at a node that allows one to achieve a uniform distribution of the amplitude of normal stresses in a significant region with a length equal to that of a doubled Gaussian region. Analytic results obtained by Eisner are used to calculate geometrical characteristics of the waveguide and the latter are refined by finite element modeling. Characteristics of double-Gaussian waveguides made of steel 45 and titanium alloy VT6 (Russian grades) are calculated. This type of waveguide can be used in the bulk ultrasonic treatment of materials to expose the samples to oscillating stresses of an equal amplitude.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,Eutectic LaB6-ZrB2 powder was synthesized by borothermal reduction of an La(OH)(3)-ZrO(OH)(2) mixture under vacuum with isothermal curing at 1200 - 1600 degrees C. The mixture of hydroxides was prepared via coprecipitation from aqueous solutions of La and Zr nitrates in a suspension of amorphous boron. The effect of an excess of B on the phase and elemental compositions of the boride mixture was studied.

32,"3D reconstruction of ZnO micron ridges was carried out, and the sintering behaviors of these features were studied. Both the grain size and the relative density increase with the sintering time. The densification is through grain boundary diffusion, and the grain growth is through evaporation-condensation. The pore number in the ridges decreases with the pore size increase. Both grain boundary diffusion related flux J(gb) and evaporation-condensation related diffusion flux J(e/c)(g) increase with the sintering time. However, the former is five orders of magnitude lower than the latter, indicating the dominance of the grain growth process in the ridges. Pore shapes evolve from deformed round tubes, to trigonal tubes, and then to deformed flat tubes. The pore surface evolves from a saddle ridge type to saddle ridge plus saddle rut types. The decreasing dihedral angle psi during sintering indicates increased surface energy of pores, consistent with the 3D reconstruction results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"High-temperature superconducting coils (HTSCs) have an applied feature in reduction of power air-core inductors losses. This paper presents an analytical method for calculating the mutual inductance of an air-core superconducting variable inductor and investigates the impact of dimensional parameters on the mutual inductance. The proposed method is based on changing the position of a movable inner coil inside an outer coil. A variable inductor may consist of two finite length coaxial helical-shaped coils that their mutual inductance can be changed to achieve a variable inductance. The proposed variable inductor may be further optimized for high-power and high frequency applications and has the potential to be realized in matching circuits technology. To calculate the mutual inductance, a direct and fast method has been employed to solve nonlinear double integration of Neumann's formula along the current-carrying path that offers two advantages. Firstly, it reduces the computational time comparing to the area-integration methods, especially for complex geometries. Secondly, it can split coil turns accurately as well as other design details that violate axial symmetry. In the end, the Finite Element (FEM) and the loop model methods have been used to verify the results of the analytical method. The analytical and FEM results showed an error of less than 0.064% in the least compatible case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the recipe was as follows: molasses of 80 g/L, soybean peptone of 10 g/L, yeast powder of 15 g/L, corn juice of 70 mL/L, sodium citrate of 8.5 g/L. The culture conditions were also optimized as initial pH of 6.9, temperature of 37 degrees C, and inoculation quantity of 2%. The combination of neutralization with intermittent feeding was applied for the fermentation. Moreover, a dynamic model was proposed for the cell growth of Lactobacillus casei LT-L614, through fitting reducing sugar amount and fermentation time. The feeding time interval was optimized according to the logistic model.

37,"In contrast to the description provided by Archard's equation, material loss under a wearing force is more or less nonlinear. Excluding the wear regime transition and other possible factors such as oxidation, this nonlinear relationship may result from variations in the mechanical behavior of materials such as strain hardening. Although this is a classic topic, relevant issues have still not been fully clarified or quantified. Better understanding of the nonlinearity would help achieve good control of the wear of materials, especially surface wear encountered in nano/microsystems, which are sensitive to surface damage or deterioration. In this study, we investigated the nonlinearity of material loss versus wearing force, without involving the wear regime transition, for three alloys, Al5182 (fcc), AZ31B alloy (hcp), and steel (bcc). An attempt is made to study this phenomenon in depth and extract additional information on the material behavior from the nonlinearity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"SmCo5/Co exchange-coupled films with high saturation magnetization, and hence high energy product were fabricated on MgO substrates by sequential deposition of elemental Sm and Co layers at 450 degrees C followed by subsequent annealing at the same temperature for 1 h. Formation of defects induced multi-layered structures and the composition of individual layers were confirmed through high resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRSTEM) imaging acquired on high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Micromagnetic simulations and magnetic measurements further confirmed that the observed structure is coupled in rigid phase between soft and hard magnetic layers and the enhancement in coercivity results due to the domain wall pinning at the defects sites. This leads to the magnetic energy density in the film of the order of 22.2 MGOe which is close to the bulk value and have potential applications towards Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This method of passivation is relatively simpler and can be carried out at a much lower temperature as compared to the usual passivation method of the silicon surface by growing the SiO2 layer on it. Also, the passivating layer of SnO2 produced in this new method has a good shelf-life.

41,"The windshield defrost system, in general, is a vehicle safety feature. Thus, its restricted by variety of directives. However, the OMEs' benchmark targets could be even more demanding as the deicing process is in addition also part of passengers comfort. From vehicle design point of view the windshield defrost system is typically connected to HVAC unit (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning). In the technical solution the windshield is heated via hot air convection. Nevertheless, other methods are becoming more and more popular, like directly heated glass by hot wire ohmic heating (heated glasses). The defrost CFD model should predict the ice layer thickness in time and space and in environmental conditions defined according to appropriate directives and technical solution. The accurate and fast modelling technique is essential part of a vehicle development, especially nowadays, where the optimization techniques area widely used and requires hundreds of simulations runs. Modelling requests are even increasing with modem pure electric vehicles (EVs), were the thermal and energy management is more demanding compared to the classical internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The aim of the work is to verify possibility to model the ice layer thickness with simplified approach, which could be beneficial from computational time burden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of boron compounds is beneficial due to high thermal and chemical stability of the multilayer and sharp interfaces between the layers caused by low interlayer atomic diffusion. The results indicate that the multilayer structures MoB2/B4C and Mo2B5/B4C provide a relatively high reflection up to 95% and better energy resolution SE/E in comparison to the multilayers based on widely used materials such as Mo, W and N at energies 1-20 keV.

43,"Zirconia oral implants are increasingly considered as an alternative to metallic (titanium) ones, mostly for their aesthetic properties and their metal free composition that enables soft tissue integration. We report a systematic comparison of the fatigue performance of oral implants of identical geometry, made of partially stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) and titanium as a reference group, using random spectrum fatigue testing in both air and saline solution. The spectrum data clearly points unequivocally to the operation of a fatigue (damage accumulation) failure mechanism in the zirconia implants. Saline solution reduces the quasi-static fracture strength. It also causes a marked degradation of their spectrum fatigue longevity, but it does not affect their spectrum fatigue fracture strength. Given that the quasi-static fracture strength of the tested implants is smaller in saline solution than in air, the results suggest that the maximum admissible design loads for spectrum loaded zirconia oral implants are of the order of 0.8 times their wet (saline) quasi-static fracture strength.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"We theoretically study the coupling of magnetic plasmon polaritons (MPPs) with photonic band gap (PBG) in a system composed of a one-dimensional (1D) silver nanowire pair array lying on a one-dimensional photonic crystal (1D PC). The near-field plasmon interactions in individual silver nanowire pairs induce MPPs. The 1D PC consisting of dielectric multilayer stacks with alternating refractive indices forms a PBG in the reflection spectrum. When the position of the PBG of the 1D PC is tuned to be close to the MPPs, the MPPs and the PBG can couple together to lead to a hybrid mode within the PBG. At the hybrid mode resonance, the magnetic fields in the center of Ag nanowire pairs are enhanced to nearly 4.3 times larger than those in the nanowire pair array directly lying on a substrate. Our numerical results hold important applications in magnetic sensors and magnetic nonlinearity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

46,"Various biocompatible polymers have been developed using electrospun nanofibers for local drug delivery matrices, but many of them are non-FDA-approved polymers or chemicals. Material safety should be considered in biomedical devices, but the effectiveness of electrospun nanofibers is limited with only the approved chemicals. Therefore, we considered the material in FDA-approved polymers and solvents and developed nanofibers using the general additives in the pharmaceutical industry, such as hypromellose, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and Gellan. The nanofiber, mainly composed of hypromellose and PVA, was applied to a local peptide drug delivery system. Electrostatically complexed Gellan and peptide were loaded in the nanofiber by co-electrospinning. The morphology of the nanofibers with different PVA blending ratios was visualized by scanning electron microscope. The nanofiber composed of only hydrophilic polymers quickly wetted in water and became a transparent gel-like lump. A drug release test of peptide-loaded nanofiber was performed resulted in 37% of initial burst release suppression with the gellan and peptide loaded nanofiber compared with solely peptide loaded hypromellose nanofiber. In addition, higher PVA blending to hypromellose was slightly effective for sustained release of peptide compared with pure peptide-loaded hypromellose nanofiber. Therefore, we suggest the potential application of hypromellose/PVA nanofiber-loaded Gellan/peptide complex to a mucosal layer drug delivery patch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, catalytic pyrolysis of biomass components was performed to understand the evolution mechanism of liquid products. It was found that under the optimal reaction conditions (15Fe/ZSM-5, 600 degrees C, and catalyst to biomass ratio of 10), the largest yields of aromatic hydrocarbons were produced during catalytic cracking biomass pyrolytic vapors.

51,"Interactive failures are failures caused by two or more components that often occur in complex systems when the system is modified, upgraded, or simply designed inadequately. However, the official guideline provided, namely, common cause analysis, cannot discover these problems. It cannot establish a complex interactive system model, nor can it provide a unified analysis method for all parts of the system. Another method, systems theoretic process analysis, is limited to the control system. To solve this problem, a method called system theoretic formal analysis method (STFAM) is proposed in this paper. STFAM establishes a system-component-interactive model that provides an abundance of interactive information for failure analysis and presents a unified model to support the analysis of multiple components in the system. It is divided into three steps. First, a hierarchical system structure is built and then transformed into a formalized state machine. Next, the interactive failures are determined and converted into a linear temporal logic or computation tree logic model. Finally, NuSMV is used to verify the model and record the results. To evaluate the proposed method, a practical problem that occurred in full-authority digital engine control, in which in some cases, the valve closes for unknown reasons until the system is reset is presented. An analysis of the issue demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"This paper extends the independent point-wise density interpolation to the bi-material topology optimization to improve the structural static or dynamic properties. In contrast to the conventional elemental density-based topology optimization approaches, this method employs an analysis-mesh-separated material density field discretization model to describe the topology evolution of bi-material structures within the design domain. To be specific, the density design variable points can be freely positioned, independently of the field points used for discretization of the displacement field. By this means, a material interface description of relatively high quality can be achieved, even when unstructured finite element meshes and irregular-shaped elements are used in discretization of the analysis domain. Numerical examples, regarding the minimum static compliance design and the maximum fundamental eigen-frequency design, are presented to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed formulation and numerical techniques. It is shown that this method is free of numerical difficulties such as checkerboard patterns and the ""islanding"" phenomenon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

54,"Rotational-type mesodefects - strain induced junction disclination, are formed at joints and ledges of high-angle grain boundaries during plastic deformation of polycrystals. The strength of these mesodefects increases with deformation and, as a result, they create non-uniform elastic stress fields, which significantly affect the processes of structure formation, strain hardening and material's fracture. In the present work, the interaction of a slip band propagating in a grain body under the action of an external stress field with an elastic field of wedge disclination is investigated by the discrete dislocation dynamics simulation method. The simulation results show that the behavior of the front of the band has common regularities. For a given distance between the slip band and the disclination y(0), the behavior of the dislocation cluster in the front of the band essentially depends on the distance between the slip planes of the dislocations h. For small h(c), it is similar to the behavior of a dislocation pile-up. However, the maximum density of dislocations occurs not in the head of the cluster, as in the classical blocked dislocation pile-up, but in its central part. An increase in the distance h between dislocations slip planes leads to a ""splitting"" of the front of the band. For larger h the front of the band transforms into a broken from both sides dislocation wall. The minimal distance h e above which such dislocation wall is formed, depends on the disclination strength omega(0) and the distance y(0). The maximal misorientation of the wall is equal to the disclination strength omega(0) at y(0) = 0. With an increase in the external stress, the wall overcomes the force barrier of the disclination and moves as a whole to the lateral surface of the crystal. Multiple reiteration of this process leads to the possible appearance of the system of broken from both sides dislocation walls in the body of grain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

56,"Ni?Fe?P coatings have been successfully electrodeposited from Iron-Nickel sulfate bath under several conditions: Fe/Ni molar ratio (0.1?0.5), current density (15?55 mA cm(?2)) and solution pH (2?4). The chemical composition, morphology, structure and magnetic properties of the deposits were studied using SEM-EDX, XRD and AGFM techniques. The EDX results showed that the Ni?Fe?P coatings can be classified into two categories named low Fe content and high Fe content. Magnetic hysteresis loops displayed a soft magnetic character for all the deposited coatings. XRD and AGFM results revealed that the High Fe content coatings present a crystalline structure and high saturation magnetization, Ms, while those with low Fe content exhibited an amorphous structure with low Ms values. The central composite design (CCD) methodology using the ANalysis Of VAriances (ANOVA) and the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) have been applied to investigate the main and the interaction effects of several electroplating parameters on the crystalline phase proportion, CP, and the saturation magnetization, Ms, of the deposits. The ANOVA results showed that Fe/Ni ratio and pH are the most significant factors on the studied properties. A relationship between the factors and the studied responses (CP and Ms) has been established via a linear and quadratic model. A perfect agreement between the experimental and the predicted values is confirmed by high correlation coefficient values: R-2;=;0.97 for CP and 0.92 for Ms. The optimal factors required for the best properties of Fe?Ni?P coatings have been determined by the desirability function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The films were deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) without intentional heating of the substrate and at elevated temperatures up to 150 degrees C. The material stoichiometry was accurately controlled by adjusting deposition conditions including the oxygen flow, process pressure, pumping speed, and RF-power. Besides, fine turning of the critical deposition parameters during the deposition was implemented by measuring the variation of film conductance in-situ. The film morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Hall effect measurements were also performed to determine the relation between the deposition conditions and the electrical properties of the films.

The derivation is based on the assumption that the deforming rod encounters a response force from the surrounding medium, and a first-order perturbation analysis of the governing equilibrium equations. It is shown that a dimensionless universal buckling relationship, independent of material and geometry, exists between the critical axial load, both in compression and tension, and the critical torsional load. A reducing axial compression, or an increasing axial tension, enhances the critical torsional load. In addition, two different mode shapes are predicted for the same critical combined loads, and the buckled shapes are generally three-dimensional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study constructs a drug delivery system with Zn(II)-Co(II) bimetal-organic framework nanoparticles with encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX), a model chemotherapeutic molecule. Beyond conventional therapeutic mechanisms powered by DOX, the newly applied Co(II) to the drug delivery system catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a Fenton-like process, leading to necrosis due to oxidative stress beyond threshold.

RT-PCR results obtained from 18 MM patients and 10 health people showed that the expression of CIAPIN1 gene was 4 times higher in normal human compared to MM patients. Besides, CIAPIN1 siRNA (si-CIAPIN1) transfected U266 cells presented higher proliferation ratio and superior colony forming ability than U266 cells and U266 cells transfected with non-coding siRNA (controls) evaluated by CCK8 test and soft agar colony formation assay, respectively.

63,"This study investigated the properties of colloidal nanoalumina (CNA)-blended cementitious mixtures in the presence of calcite to promote better understanding of the enhancing mechanisms of nanoalumina in cementitious materials through experimental investigation and thermodynamic calculation. The rate of heat evolution, compressive strength, connected pore structure, and chloride binding capacity were investigated. The results show that CNA can accelerate cement hydration at early age, and therefore improve the 1-day strength of blended mixtures. The strength at 28 and 56 days can be maximized with 1% by weight CNA addition, but considerably reduced with 5% by weight CNA. Different from the mechanical properties, the connected pore structure and chloride binding capacity are improved straightforwardly with CNA addition, which benefits the ability to resist chloride attack. The experimental and modeling results demonstrate that CNA addition benefits the generation of carboaluminate, which has high efficiency to fill voids due to its higher volume, thus densifying the microstructure as well as improving the chloride resistance. However, these aluminate-ferrite-monosubstituent (AFm) phases demonstrate little cementing capacity relative to calcium silicate hydrate (C S H) gels, thus resulting in an obvious decrease of strength with a high amount of CNA addition even though the microstructure is further densified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"Charge-current-induced torque effects on the magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic/metal bilayer is interesting from the aspect of fundamental physics as well as the applications in spintronic devices. The torque-induced variation of damping constant of magnetization can be foreseen from the change of the linewidth of ferromagnetic resonance spectrum. The Oersted torque (tau Oe) and current-induced torque (tau C) are induced by charge current; while the spin-orbit torque (tau SO) and field-like torque (tau FL) are induced by spin current. However, the torque effects often were hindered due to the heating-induced artifacts. In this work, we particularly pay attention to minimize the Joule heating effects in order to investigate the intrinsic torque effects in cobalt (Co)/platinum (Pt) bilayer with an applied charge current ranging from -60 to 60 mA. In this range, the Oersted field is estimated as 0.25 Oe which is much smaller than the experimental result of Delta Hr (similar to 0.7 Oe), implying some contribution from the spin-current induced field like torque. The current-polarization-induced asymmetry of linewidth Delta W, Delta W equivalent to W+Jc-W-Jc, increases from 0 to 0.15 with Jc changing from 0 to 60 mA, which is attributed to the spin-orbit torque.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"To be able to charge a correct amount of chlorine dioxide in the D-0-stage, a pulp mill needs good control of the bleaching process and good sensors to keep the variability of the bleaching result on an acceptable level. It is also important to include the bleaching agent demand from the dissolved matter in the pulp slurry. If this is done correctly, over- or undercharging of bleaching agents can be reduced, which lead to lower bleaching chemical cost, lower polluting emissions and higher pulp quality. Our previous research has shown that the dissolved organic carryover from the O-2-stage varies significantly when bleaching softwood kraft pulp. The present study investigated the corresponding impact in the case of bleaching of birch pulp. Different mill configurations and process conditions have been simulated in laboratory trials, including proceeding A-stage treatment, different degrees of washing before and between the stages, and a comparison of the effects of recycled and non-recycled wash filtrates.

And there were significant differences in the interplanar spacing and growth direction of alpha-Si3N4 nanowires with different diameters. Moreover, the high temperature oxidation resistance of nanowires were systematically analyzed and obtained the following results: the oxidation reaction of Si3N4 nanowires became intensified significantly at about 1100 degrees C, and the diffraction intensity of Si3N4 in XRD patterns decreased with the increase of oxidation temperature until it was substantially oxidized to SiO2 at about 1400 degrees C; and the changes in the microstructure of Si3N4 nanowires became more intense as the oxidation temperature increased until a significant shrinkage occurred at about 1400 degrees C, at which point it no longer exhibited a distinct nanowire morphology.

In this article, the structure and morphology of polyacrylamide nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). And the fluorescence microscopy and core displacement equipment were used to evaluate the properties of the expansion and plugging properties. Results showed that the nanoparticles prepared by inverse emulsion polymerization can be able to pass through the pores in the rocks due to the uniform particle size which is less than 500 nm. When the nanoparticles were in contact with water for 72 hours, the average particle size increased to 12.2 mu m. The water-swelled nanoparticles can effectively block the high-permeability layer and improve the oil recovery in the low-permeability layer.

72,"A systematic analysis about the influences of electron beam focusing on scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging for silicon (Si) trapezoidal lines was performed based on a sophisticated Monte Carlo (MC) simulation program. It was found that the focus position and the aperture angle highly affect the final quality of SEM imaging. The effective electron beam shape (EEBS) is hence suggested as the broadening function to overcome this issue for theoretical analysis, rather than the widely-used Gaussian profile. However, EEBS is hardly acquired due to it strongly depends on both the sample topography and the electron beam focusing condition, which make it is impossible to be applied in practical analysis. An approach is proposed to find a best-fit traditional Gaussian profile, which can optimally replace the EEBS in the case of the same sample structure and experimental condition for establishing a database of the parameter in traditional Gaussian profile. Experimenters will benefit from this database to obtain true line-scan profiles for accurate gate linewidth measurement. This investigated result could greatly improve the accuracy of linewidth measurement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"The thermodynamic behavior of nanocrystals is different from that of corresponding bulk materials, mainly because the large surface-to-volume ratio strongly affects the chemical and physical properties of nanocrystals. Fracture bonds of surface atoms inevitably lead to instability of materials at nanoscale. From the point of view of classical thermodynamics and modern molecular dynamics, many excellent models of the size and shape dependence of the melting behavior of nanosolids have been established. However, the bond properties of a system are not clear. An integrated model based on bond number and bond strength in a system with a cubo-octahedral structure is developed to predict the size-dependent thermal characteristics of nanoparticles. Without any adjustable parameters, this model can be used to predict the melting point and cohesive energy of low-dimensional materials, suggesting that both depend on the size and on the atomic distance. The good agreement of the theoretical prediction with the experimental and molecular dynamic simulation results confirms the validity of the cubo-octahedron in describing the thermodynamic behaviors of nanoparticles even without considering their crystalline structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,"In this study, the microstructure, mechanical properties, and texture of deep drawing dual-phase (DP) steel subjected to different cold rolling reductions were characterized via optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The results revealed that the microstructure of the steel is composed of ferrite and a small amount of martensite after cold rolling annealing. The ferrite grain size varied only slightly with the reduction. In addition, the orientation density along the ? orientation line increased continuously with increasing cold rolling reduction ratio. Similarly, the {112}?110?;and {223}?110?;components along the ? orientation line and the adjacent {554}?225?;and {332}?113?;components were strongly developed. The ratio of the {111} plane texture volume fraction to that of the {100} plane texture, i.e., V-{111}/V-{100}, increased initially and then decreased, reaching the optimum value at 75% reduction. The maximum strength of the steel (i.e., 430 MPa) was realized at 55% reduction. However, the best elongation and r values (29.8% and 1.46, respectively) were obtained at 75% reduction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"The article presents the results of the study and analysis of the structure, properties and deformation parameters of a long-length bar of a circular cross-section from grade 10 steel obtained using severe plastic deformation (SPD) by free torsion at a temperature of 600 degrees C. Using computer simulations with Deform 3D software, the stress-strain state of the samples, including the distribution of accumulated strain, average stresses, and thermal field, are investigated. A physical experiment was carried out, the structure parameters and microhardness in the longitudinal section of the samples after deformation were investigated. It was shown that the free-torsion SPD method provided a non-uniform accumulation of ultrahigh strains up to 6 in long-length metal bars of a circular cross-section, the formation of a gradient type structure with a mean grain size from 1 to 7 mu m and with a gradient in mechanical properties. The effect of localization of deformation during uniform torsion of the workpiece was revealed, at the same time, the temperature of the bar during severe plastic deformation increased up to 30 degrees C. EBSD analysis revealed a gradient structure of steel specimens with a mean grain size of about 1 mu m near the surface area and similar to 5 mu m near the central area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,"We investigated the effect on passivation performance of ozone-based Al2O3 thin films grown by atomic layer deposition due to the increase in ozone concentration; ozone concentration was varied from 150 g/Nm(3) to 330 g/Nm(3). We found that the carrier lifetime and implied open-circuit voltage (iV(oc)) increased as the ozone concentration increased in the as-deposited condition. Although the passivation performance after annealing also improved and had a maximum value in the low ozone concentration region (<250 g/Nm(3), 17 wt%), it showed a reverse trend compared to the as-deposited sample in the high ozone concentration region (>250 g/ Nm(3)) as the ozone concentration increased. The maximum values of carrier lifetime and iV(oc) obtained in the low ozone concentration region are 1.4 ms and 656 mV, respectively. The improved values in the low ozone concentration region are attributed to a decrease in carbon and increase in hydrogen at the Al2O3/Si interface after forming gas annealing. As a result, the interfacial trap density in the low ozone concentration region was enhanced than that of the high ozone concentration region after annealing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"In this study, graphene nanocrystallited carbon films were deposited with electron irradiation induced deposition in electron cyclotron resonance plasma. The orientation of nanocrstallites was revealed with transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. The TEM results showed that the graphene nanocrystallites aligned perpendicular to substrate surface. The anisotropic-magneto-resistive performances of the films were investigated under diowed that from 400 to 2 K, the film resistance varied periodically as the film rotated along its surface axial, exhibiting a sinusoidal feature. In room temperature, the average angular resolution of the film was better than 0.5%/degree, and the largest relative changing rate of the film MR ratio reached over 400% as magnetic field increased from 3 to 9 T. The mechanism of this performance was investigated through electrical transport measurement and magnetic hysteresis loops, which revealed the spin-enhanced magnetism of the nanocrystallites were the main origin of this anisotropic magnetic response behaviors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the fabrication of aluminosilicates, fly ash was introduced into the batch in the amounts 2.5 - 7.5%, the firing temperature of the articles was 1000 degrees C, and the isothermal soaking time was 1 h. The investigations showed that the introduction of 2.5% fly ash into aluminosilicates promotes leaching of heavy metals, sulfates, and chlorides according to the current regulation 200333EC.

82,"In pressurized water reactors, the existence of lead contamination can promote the corrosion of Alloy 690TT. During the manufacturing, transportation, and assembly processes, Alloy 690TT surface is easily scratched and it is easily ignored. The effect of added lead on the scratched surface is different from that on the unscratched surface. In the present study, Alloy 690TT was treated with mechanical polishing (MP) and electrochemical polishing (EP) to generate scratched and unscratched surfaces. With the addition of lead, the thickness of passive film on the MP sample increases by eight times, while that on the EP sample only slightly increases. These chemical composition changes of passive films induced by lead result in the drop of their electrical resistivity, and the electrical resistivity of passive film on the MP sample is reduced by two orders of magnitude, while that on the EP sample decreases only three times. Nevertheless, the thickness and electrical resistivity of passive film on the MP sample are always greater than those of the EP sample. The toxic effect of lead on the MP sample is more severe than that of the EP sample, which may be closely related to their subsurface microstructure. Therefore, Alloy 690TT should better avoid being scratched in the secondary circuit system of pressurized water reactors, as scratched behavior will result in a faster corrosion rate of Alloy 690TT with the presence of lead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"Realkalization potential of drinking water reservoir coatings The realkalizing effect of mineral mortars is known from the repair of carbonated concrete in building construction. The application there is limited to the use of an ordinary Portland cement (CEM I) based repair material and to an average carbonation depth of less than 20 mm beyond the reinforcement. Concerning the repair of drinking water reservoirs, special boundary conditions must also be considered from both a hygienic and a technical point of view. According to the DVGW Code of Practice W 300-3, cement-bonded coatings are classified according to their ability to realkalize leached or carbonated concrete. The realkalization depot of the mortar and the existing residual alkalinity of the substrate are decisive for the choice of the cement-bonded coating. The relationship between the alkalinity depot and resistance to an reoccurring leaching attack of repair mortars as well as the simultaneous realkalization of the concrete substrate are not sufficiently known. In a DVGW funded research project, the performance of repair mortars is being investigated. The necessary boundary conditions for a successful realkalisation are determined and a more detailed description of the realkalisation depot is developed, aiding planners and users in their endeavor to estimate and improve durability of structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"It is very difficult to plan the maintenance requirements of concrete pavements with alkali-silica reaction. Up to now, the necessary assessment has been carried out via visual appearance, AKR-provoking concrete investigations as well as polarization microscopic investigations on thin sections. With these investigations a forecast for the damage development is not possible. It is only possible to assess whether damage is no longer to be expected or whether there is still further potential for residual damage. The often significant deterioration of concrete pavement can be traced back to an undetected horizontal crack formation. In the context of an alkali-silica reaction (ASR), horizontal cracks can be found in the area of the joint crosses, the transverse joints and the longitudinal joints, which then extend several centimeters into the carriageway slab. The article illustrates the consequences of a damaging ASR and other loads in a carriageway slab. For the first time, it establishes a systematic relationship between a damaging ASR in a carriageway slab and the horizontal cracks in the area of the joints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"The compressive strength of concrete under biaxial dynamic compression The compressive strength of two concretes under biaxial dynamic compressive stress was investigated. A biaxial split Hopkinson bar was used, that applied the dynamic load to the test specimen in the form of two load waves perpendicular to each other. For reference, the static compressive strengths under biaxial load with different stress ratios of the two load axes were determined in a triaxial testing machine. The results indicate a partially superposition of the two strength-increasing effects of multi-axial compressive stress and increased strain rate. In particular, clear differences can be seen in the fracture and crack pattern for the different load types.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,A constitutive model is developed that incorporates the wavy elastic response of an arc-shaped metallic glass (MG) ribbon subjected to applied progressive normal load. This model is based on the evolution of the angle made between the buckled ribbon and the horizontal plane. It predicts the amount of elastic strain preventing the yielding of material when it is used as a flat spring or electromechanical switch for MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) and NEMS (Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems). The numerical solution of the constitutive equations resulting from the model is compared to experimental results and shows good agreement. This present result is useful for miniaturised ribbons since the estimation of the elastic strain in these was previously quite difficult.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By the method of quadratures, we reduce the obtained system of integral equations to a complex system of linear algebraic equations. We also determine the stress intensity factors at the tips of edge cracks when the plane is uniformly loaded at infinity (tension or transverse shear). Finally, the influence of the shapes and relative sizes of holes and cracks on the stress intensity factors is investigated for various external loads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dependencies of threshold voltage, ON-current, OFF-current and subthreshold slope of ultra-thin body germanium-on-insulator MOSFETs on three different BOX dielectrics are examined by employing well-calibrated Synopsys TCAD. The variation of threshold voltage and ON-current becomes less sensitive with high-k BOX dielectrics whereas smaller variation of OFF-current is observed for the device with low-k BOX dielectrics. The subthreshold slope remains almost unaltered for all BOX dielectrics. Furthermore, a positive substrate bias is found to suppress variability of digital performance parameters of GeOI p-MOSFETs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A notable anisotropic magnetization component having a fourfold symmetry has been observed in the antiferromagnetic state in low fields. The angular dependence of the heat capacity does not indicate any additional phase which implies that the observed magnetization anisotropy is an intrinsic property of Ce2RhIn8. A clear angular dependence of magnetic phase boundaries on the applied magnetic field has been also revealed. A possible interpretation of these results is discussed in the context of previously reported studies of magnetic structures in Ce2RhIn8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

95,"A new architecture for a thin (2-cm depth) rear projection display is described. In order to achieve this small depth, a very high density of rear projectors is used. Three prototype displays using rear projectors on both 5- and 2-cm pitch arrays are described. The displays can achieve an effective screen pixel pitch of as small as 0.5 mm, which makes this technology competitive in terms of resolution with fine pitch LED displays; however, orders of magnitude fewer LEDs are required: Each rear projector requires only one white LED and a color liquid crystal light modulator. In the three prototypes, the projector light modulators utilize 101-cm (40 in.), 80-cm (31.5 in.), and 60-cm (24 in.) diagonal liquid crystal display glass. To minimize cost, no lenses are utilized for the rear projectors. An RGB LED array may augment the projector array, which provides a low resolution component of the image onto which the high resolution component is superimposed by the projector array. Edge gaps between active areas on adjacent LCD glass units are completely eliminated by the rear projection approach enabling low profile wall-size seamless displays. Display contrast depends on rear projection screen design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

97,"These days, tunneling field effect transistors (TFET) for their ability in decrease of off-current transistors and also for electronic device power consumption, it is best point out for a scientist to research on this kind of transistors. By reducing off-current, on-current decreases too in compare to MOSFET transistors. Researchers are trying to reduce-off-current so that a minimum decrease in on-current occurs. One of the methods is to select a suitable oxide for the gate electrode. This paper presents an analytical model for the potential distribution of ZrO2, HfO2 and SiO2 effect over TFET. Using the potential distribution, the tunneling drain current is derived analytically by integrating the band-to-band tunneling generation rate over the device volume.

98,"In this work, a lead-free magnetoelectric composite of AlN (300 nm)/NiMnIn (300 nm) structure has been fabricated using DC magnetron sputtering. The AlN-based multilayered structure on NiMnIn layer exhibits a (002) oriented wurtzite growth with columnar structure perpendicular to the substrate. The layered structure has low level of leakage current which is beneficial for reducing dielectric loses. The Piezoresponse of the fabricated multilayered structure is measured by Piezo force microscopy and found to be about 5.17 pm/V. The magnetization versus temperature graph shows a martensite transformation at about 273-295 K. The stain produced during this transformation is visualized in terms of variation in the dielectric constant of the fabricated heterostructure.

Such AlN-based multilayered structures with enhanced dielectric constant are useful for futuristic magnetic field sensing and Microelectromechanical system-based device applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"This paper presents an investigation of the influence on the shear force distribution and on the displacements of reinforced concrete bracing walls continuous through a basement, when modelling these walls. The shear forces and displacements are compared with those obtained when simplifying the wall by a cantilever with full fixity at the top of the basement, ignoring the transfer of shear force and bending moment into the basement. First, the influence of the basement is modelled by hinged connections between the wall and the base slab and the floor diaphragm above the basement, respectively. This will result in an unrealistically large wall shear force in the basement. Then, the flexural restraint of the wall by the base plate, and the lateral compliance of the floor diaphragm are modelled by a rotational spring and a lateral spring at those levels. Recommendations are given for reasonable values of the spring constants for practical design purposes. Special attention is given to the way in which including the basement in the mechanical model of such walls will influence aspects of their seismic design. Such aspects are the rigidity of the bracing system which influences the lateral earthquake loads, and the displacement ductility factor which influences the maximum admissible behaviour factor q.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
