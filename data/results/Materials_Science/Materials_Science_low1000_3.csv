J,"Kim, I; Yuk, JH; Choa, SH",Stretchable 5 GHz Dipole Antenna Using Silver Composite Material,"A highly stretchable small-size 5 GHz dipole antenna is presented for wearable and mobile applications. A stretchable dipole antenna was fabricated using conductive polymer composite material composed of Ag flake filler and polyester binder. The dipole antenna was printed on a stretchable polyurethane substrate using a simple and inexpensive screen-printing technique. The stretchability and durability of the dipole antenna were evaluated by the stretching and cyclic stretching tests. The stretchable dipole antenna showed excellent stretchability and RF performances up to a tensile strain of 25%. The stretchable dipole antenna also exhibited outstanding mechanical durability in the 10,000-cycle cyclic stretching endurance tests.",10.1166/sam.2019.3668,0,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

Single-crystalline Si(111) was irradiated with Mg ions at elevated temperature followed by thermal annealing under vacuum. Microstructural analysis with transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of precipitates with sizes of several 10 nm in the damaged crystalline Si matrix. Using electron diffraction, the precipitates were identified as Mg1.8Si, and the crystallographic orientation relationship between Mg1.8Si precipitates and Si was determined. The phase stability of Mg1.8Si in the Si matrix is discussed in terms of the internal stress generated during the precipitation process.",10.1021/acs.cgd.9b01002,1,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no
J,"Kruglovu, AA; Mulyukov, RR; Rudenko, OA; Karimova, AF; Enikeev, FU",Influence of the inclination angle of stiffeners on folding during superplastic forming of corrugated core panels,"Superplastic forming of thin sheet corrugated structures is of special interest in developing aircraft technologies of new generation. The manufacture of such structures includes pressure welding of a package of three sheet blanks, consisting of two outer skin sheets and one inner core blank. The stop-off coating is applied to the inner surfaces of the skin sheets before welding. During superplastic forming of the package, the skin sheets take the form of a die cavity, while the core sheet stretches between the skins to form stiffeners. One of the main problems in manufacturing three-layer structures is known to be the formation of folds on the outer surface of the skins. The paper reports on studies of the influence of the inclination angle of stiffeners on folding. The choice of skin sheets with a thickness exceeding the thickness of the core sheet by 2 - 3 times may prevent the formation of folds. However, when manufacturing the corrugated structures of variable cross-section, such as hollow fan blades of an aircraft engine, the recommended ratio may not always be implemented. Moreover, its performance is limited by the permissible weight of the blade. In the present study, finite element modeling of the process of superplastic forming of three-layer structures made of titanium sheet alloy VT6 (analog of Ti-6Al-4V) is done using ANSYS software. According to the simulation results, it was found that with an increase in the inclination angle of the ribs, the holding time under pressure should be increased.",10.22226/2410-3535-2019-4-433-435,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Lan, BL; Chu, RJ",Disagreement between non-relativistic and relativistic quantum dynamics of a driven electron,"We show, both analytically and numerically, that the non-relativistic and relativistic quantum predictions for the dynamics of a prototypical driven electron - the periodically kicked rotor - do not always agree in the non-relativistic regime. The surprisingly different quantum predictions could be tested experimentally using ultra-cold fermionic atoms in a periodically-pulsed 1D optical lattice. Similar breakdown of agreement should occur for driven quantum systems in general. Since the relativistic theory should be empirically correct, it must be used instead of the approximate non-relativistic theory to correctly study the quantum dynamics of a driven system after the breakdown time, which could lead to important contributions in a wide range of fields from atomic to molecular, chemical and condensed-matter physics.",10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102654,3,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Three chip sizes, two temperatures (60 and 90 degrees C) and 120 minutes retention time in pre-hydrolysis step were selected. After pre-hydrolysis treatment, the sample was divided into two portions; one third was used for chemical analysis and the other two thirds for soda pulping. The reference soda pulping conditions were used on either treated or untreated chips. The influence of pre-hydrolysis was determined measuring cellulose and lignin content, residual alkali and the hemicelluloses removal. The lignin and cellulose content were marginally increased and the hemicellulose removal was higher at larger chip size. Total yield and rejects, kappa number and strength properties of the unbleached pulp were measured using corresponding Tappi standard test methods. The pulping total yield and rejects of the treated chips varied between 30.31 % and 48.14 % and 0.83 % to 7.31 %, respectively. The reject from soda pulping of untreated chips was 24.16.

The attempt was accomplished through the substitutions by >= 20 mol% Pb(Mg1/2W1/2)O-3 (PMW) at the presence of additional 20 mol% Pb(Fe2/3W1/3)O-3 (PFW). The perovskite formation yields were 0% (0.8PZW-0.2PFW), 88.3% (0.6PZW-0.2PMW-0.2PFW), and >= 99.7% (virtually completed state) at higher levels of substituent PMW. Lattice parameters of the perovskite structure decreased nearly linearly with increasing fractions of Mg. Developed microstructures of the sintered ceramics mostly revealed well-developed perovskite grains with a multi-faceted polyhedral morphology. Their fracture modes were virtually intergranular. Frequency-dependent dielectric dispersion behaviors, with diffuse modes in the phase transition, were observed at the modified composition range. Values of the maximum dielectric constant increased sharply at an intermediate composition range, whereas corresponding temperatures were comparatively insensitive to the compositional change.",10.1007/s10832-019-00177-4,5,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

Through symbolic computation, the analytic N-soliton solutions are obtained for the system. The N-soliton solutions can be used to describe the multiple wrinkles in graphene sheets. Furthermore, wrinkle propagation and interaction are discussed. Snake-, V- and Z-like wrinkles are observed graphically by choosing the heat transmission function as three specific functions. A collision between wrinkles is elastic. Before and after the collision, wrinkle energy and propagation direction remain unchanged.

It was clearly shown that quasi-equiaxed nanocrystallites of similar to 50-100 nm in diameter and nanorods of similar to 40-50 nm in diameter and up to similar to 700 nm in length can be generated with (NH4)(10)W12O41 center dot 5H(2)O and K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O as tungsten sources, respectively. Introducing Tar(2-) into the K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O reaction system effectively transformed the primary crystallites of ZnWO4 from nanorods into quasi-equiaxed nanocrystals (similar to 20-50 nm) and then nanoplates (thickness of similar to 20 nm, lateral size of similar to 200 nm) and, meanwhile, aggregated the crystallites into spheroidal clusters (similar to 2-3 mu m in diameter) with the increasing Tar(2-)/Zn2+ molar ratio up to similar to 2. Optical spectroscopy revealed that the ZnWO4 products exhibit broad-band photoluminescence (similar to 425-700 nm) through T-3(1u) -> (1)A(1g) transition of the [WO6](6-) ligand under short ultraviolet excitation and the nanorods show the best luminescence among all tested samples.

Therefore, the damage behavior of CMSFs with two acidity coefficients (ACs) immersed in water for 365 days was studied; the fiber structure and composition were measured. The crystalline phase on the fiber surface was identified as CaCO3 deposits that dissolved after long-term immersion, resulting in pits. Owing to continuous replacement of H+, Ca2+ continuously migrates from the inside to the outside of the fiber, resulting in a stepwise increase in the AC of the fiber cross-section; the surface pits significantly increased and joined together to form an axial crack. However, the Si-O-Si bond has no significant fracture during long-term immersion.

J,"Mukhametgalina, AA; Nazarov, AA",A double-gaussian waveguide for ultrasonic treatment of metals,"Ultrasonic treatment (UST) of metals is based on the exciting of resonant high-frequency vibrations to induce oscillating elastic stresses in the bulk of materials, which result in the generation, motion and rearrangement of crystal lattice defects. Normally, the resonant vibrations are obtained by using cylindrical samples or ultrasonic instruments having the length equal to the half-wavelength of ultrasound. In such waveguides, however, the distribution of the stress amplitude is not uniform along their axis. Accordingly, changes in the structure and properties due to the UST are different along the sample. I sere, a new type of ultrasonic waveguide based on the Gaussian (ampulla) horn is proposed and called a double-Gaussian waveguide. It is composed of two identical high-amplitude parts of a Gaussian waveguide joined at a node that allows one to achieve a uniform distribution of the amplitude of normal stresses in a significant region with a length equal to that of a doubled Gaussian region. Analytic results obtained by Eisner are used to calculate geometrical characteristics of the waveguide and the latter are refined by finite element modeling. Characteristics of double-Gaussian waveguides made of steel 45 and titanium alloy VT6 (Russian grades) are calculated. This type of waveguide can be used in the bulk ultrasonic treatment of materials to expose the samples to oscillating stresses of an equal amplitude.",10.22226/2410-3535-2019-4-414-418,30,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

The proposed variable inductor may be further optimized for high-power and high frequency applications and has the potential to be realized in matching circuits technology. To calculate the mutual inductance, a direct and fast method has been employed to solve nonlinear double integration of Neumann's formula along the current-carrying path that offers two advantages.

J,"Sun, R; Zhong, DM; Li, WG",Formal system interactive failure analysis method based on systems theoretic process analysis model,"Interactive failures are failures caused by two or more components that often occur in complex systems when the system is modified, upgraded, or simply designed inadequately. However, the official guideline provided, namely, common cause analysis, cannot discover these problems. It cannot establish a complex interactive system model, nor can it provide a unified analysis method for all parts of the system. Another method, systems theoretic process analysis, is limited to the control system. To solve this problem, a method called system theoretic formal analysis method (STFAM) is proposed in this paper. STFAM establishes a system-component-interactive model that provides an abundance of interactive information for failure analysis and presents a unified model to support the analysis of multiple components in the system. It is divided into three steps. First, a hierarchical system structure is built and then transformed into a formalized state machine. Next, the interactive failures are determined and converted into a linear temporal logic or computation tree logic model. Finally, NuSMV is used to verify the model and record the results. To evaluate the proposed method, a practical problem that occurred in full-authority digital engine control, in which in some cases, the valve closes for unknown reasons until the system is reset is presented.

In contrast to the conventional elemental density-based topology optimization approaches, this method employs an analysis-mesh-separated material density field discretization model to describe the topology evolution of bi-material structures within the design domain. To be specific, the density design variable points can be freely positioned, independently of the field points used for discretization of the displacement field. By this means, a material interface description of relatively high quality can be achieved, even when unstructured finite element meshes and irregular-shaped elements are used in discretization of the analysis domain. Numerical examples, regarding the minimum static compliance design and the maximum fundamental eigen-frequency design, are presented to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed formulation and numerical techniques.

J,"Svirina, JV; Perevezentsev, VN; Rybin, VV",Dislocation structures forming due to an interaction of slip band with an elastic field of wedge disclination,"Rotational-type mesodefects - strain induced junction disclination, are formed at joints and ledges of high-angle grain boundaries during plastic deformation of polycrystals. The strength of these mesodefects increases with deformation and, as a result, they create non-uniform elastic stress fields, which significantly affect the processes of structure formation, strain hardening and material's fracture. In the present work, the interaction of a slip band propagating in a grain body under the action of an external stress field with an elastic field of wedge disclination is investigated by the discrete dislocation dynamics simulation method. The simulation results show that the behavior of the front of the band has common regularities. For a given distance between the slip band and the disclination y(0), the behavior of the dislocation cluster in the front of the band essentially depends on the distance between the slip planes of the dislocations h. For small h(c), it is similar to the behavior of a dislocation pile-up. However, the maximum density of dislocations occurs not in the head of the cluster, as in the classical blocked dislocation pile-up, but in its central part. An increase in the distance h between dislocations slip planes leads to a ""splitting"" of the front of the band. For larger h the front of the band transforms into a broken from both sides dislocation wall. The minimal distance h e above which such dislocation wall is formed, depends on the disclination strength omega(0) and the distance y(0). The maximal misorientation of the wall is equal to the disclination strength omega(0) at y(0) = 0. With an increase in the external stress, the wall overcomes the force barrier of the disclination and moves as a whole to the lateral surface of the crystal. Multiple reiteration of this process leads to the possible appearance of the system of broken from both sides dislocation walls in the body of grain.",10.22226/2410-3535-2019-4-409-413,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EDX results showed that the Ni?Fe?P coatings can be classified into two categories named low Fe content and high Fe content. Magnetic hysteresis loops displayed a soft magnetic character for all the deposited coatings.

Different from the mechanical properties, the connected pore structure and chloride binding capacity are improved straightforwardly with CNA addition, which benefits the ability to resist chloride attack.

It was found that the focus position and the aperture angle highly affect the final quality of SEM imaging. The effective electron beam shape (EEBS) is hence suggested as the broadening function to overcome this issue for theoretical analysis, rather than the widely-used Gaussian profile. However, EEBS is hardly acquired due to it strongly depends on both the sample topography and the electron beam focusing condition, which make it is impossible to be applied in practical analysis. An approach is proposed to find a best-fit traditional Gaussian profile, which can optimally replace the EEBS in the case of the same sample structure and experimental condition for establishing a database of the parameter in traditional Gaussian profile. Experimenters will benefit from this database to obtain true line-scan profiles for accurate gate linewidth measurement.

J,"Zhang, S",Model prediction of melting point for nanoparticles without considering the structure,"The thermodynamic behavior of nanocrystals is different from that of corresponding bulk materials, mainly because the large surface-to-volume ratio strongly affects the chemical and physical properties of nanocrystals. Fracture bonds of surface atoms inevitably lead to instability of materials at nanoscale. From the point of view of classical thermodynamics and modern molecular dynamics, many excellent models of the size and shape dependence of the melting behavior of nanosolids have been established. However, the bond properties of a system are not clear. An integrated model based on bond number and bond strength in a system with a cubo-octahedral structure is developed to predict the size-dependent thermal characteristics of nanoparticles. Without any adjustable parameters, this model can be used to predict the melting point and cohesive energy of low-dimensional materials, suggesting that both depend on the size and on the atomic distance. The good agreement of the theoretical prediction with the experimental and molecular dynamic simulation results confirms the validity of the cubo-octahedron in describing the thermodynamic behaviors of nanoparticles even without considering their crystalline structures.",10.1680/jnaen.19.00031,73,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no

We found that the carrier lifetime and implied open-circuit voltage (iV(oc)) increased as the ozone concentration increased in the as-deposited condition. Although the passivation performance after annealing also improved and had a maximum value in the low ozone concentration region (<250 g/Nm(3), 17 wt%), it showed a reverse trend compared to the as-deposited sample in the high ozone concentration region (>250 g/ Nm(3)) as the ozone concentration increased. The maximum values of carrier lifetime and iV(oc) obtained in the low ozone concentration region are 1.4 ms and 656 mV, respectively. The improved values in the low ozone concentration region are attributed to a decrease in carbon and increase in hydrogen at the Al2O3/Si interface after forming gas annealing. As a result, the interfacial trap density in the low ozone concentration region was enhanced than that of the high ozone concentration region after annealing.",10.1016/j.tsf.2019.137539,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the manufacturing, transportation, and assembly processes, Alloy 690TT surface is easily scratched and it is easily ignored. The effect of added lead on the scratched surface is different from that on the unscratched surface. In the present study, Alloy 690TT was treated with mechanical polishing (MP) and electrochemical polishing (EP) to generate scratched and unscratched surfaces. With the addition of lead, the thickness of passive film on the MP sample increases by eight times, while that on the EP sample only slightly increases. These chemical composition changes of passive films induced by lead result in the drop of their electrical resistivity, and the electrical resistivity of passive film on the MP sample is reduced by two orders of magnitude, while that on the EP sample decreases only three times. Nevertheless, the thickness and electrical resistivity of passive film on the MP sample are always greater than those of the EP sample. The toxic effect of lead on the MP sample is more severe than that of the EP sample, which may be closely related to their subsurface microstructure.

Such AlN-based multilayered structures with enhanced dielectric constant are useful for futuristic magnetic field sensing and Microelectromechanical system-based device applications.",10.1007/s40830-019-00248-z,98,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no
J,"Zahn, F; Gritsch, S",Lateral Bracing of Buildings with a Basement - Influence on the Stress Resultants and Deformations of Reinforced Concrete Bracing Walls when including the Basement in the Mechanical Model,"This paper presents an investigation of the influence on the shear force distribution and on the displacements of reinforced concrete bracing walls continuous through a basement, when modelling these walls. The shear forces and displacements are compared with those obtained when simplifying the wall by a cantilever with full fixity at the top of the basement, ignoring the transfer of shear force and bending moment into the basement. First, the influence of the basement is modelled by hinged connections between the wall and the base slab and the floor diaphragm above the basement, respectively. This will result in an unrealistically large wall shear force in the basement. Then, the flexural restraint of the wall by the base plate, and the lateral compliance of the floor diaphragm are modelled by a rotational spring and a lateral spring at those levels. Recommendations are given for reasonable values of the spring constants for practical design purposes. Special attention is given to the way in which including the basement in the mechanical model of such walls will influence aspects of their seismic design. Such aspects are the rigidity of the bracing system which influences the lateral earthquake loads, and the displacement ductility factor which influences the maximum admissible behaviour factor q.",10.1002/best.201900064,99,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes
