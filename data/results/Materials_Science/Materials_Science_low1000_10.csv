0,"Hot deformation behavior of a high-strength steel Docol 1500 Bor was investigated by compression tests on a thermal-mechanical simulator Gleeble 3500. The workability of tested steel was analyzed by building processing maps at three strains based on the test results of flow stresses. The essential deformation mechanism was further studied based on the deformation texture analysis on a scanning electronic microscope with a TSL-OIM (TM) EBSD system. It was found that that strain can affect the workability of the tested steel remarkably. At the engineering strain of 0.6, obvious textures in martensite mainly include recrystallization textures <110>//ND and other texture components <110>//RD and {001} <100>,etc. Dynamic recrystallization and recrystallization texture component <111>//ND in deformed austenite can contribute to increasing the workability of a steel Docol 1500 Bor.

For comparison, conventionally mixed TiO2-Co composites with the same compositions were sintered at 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, and 1400celcius. Structural characterizations were performed using X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. All of the sintered samples were more densified. A melted matrix was observed at a temperature higher than 1300celcius. The flexural strength and the fracture toughness of the TCA sample were higher than those of the conventionally mixed TiO2-Co sample at the same sintering temperature, while the Vickers hardness exhibited the opposite relationship. The flexural strength and the fracture toughness of the TCA sample increased until a Co content of 14 vol%, followed by decrease at 18 vol%, while those of the conventionally mixed TiO2-Co sample increased in the entire Co content range. The highest flexural strength and fracture toughness were observed for T14CA sintered at 1400celcius (161.3 MPa and 6.39 MPa m(-1/2), respectively).

2,"In this paper, a progressive failure analysis method was developed using the Hashin failure criterion and crack band model. Using the failure criterion, the failure initiation was evaluated. If the failure initiation is occurred, the damage variables at each failure modes (fiber tension & compression, matrix tension & compression) was calculated according to linear softening degradation behavior and the variables are used to derive the damaged stiffness matrix. The damaged stiffness matrix is reflected to damaged material and the progressive failure analysis is continued until the damage variables to be 1 that complete failure of material. A series of processes were performed using FE commercial code ABAQUS with user defined material subroutine (UMAT). To evaluate the proposed progressive failure model, the experimental results of open hole composite laminate tests was compared with numerical result.

3,"In the present study, new Mg-based bulk metallic glasses have been developed in a Mg-Cu-Gd-Nd based system using a Mg-Nd byproduct obtained from the recycling process of NdFeB magnet scrap through liquid metal extraction. The Mg-Cu-Gd-Nd bulk metallic glasses with a diameter of 2 mm are fabricated by injection casting using Mg-Nd byproduct. The compressive fracture strength and total strain are 850 MPa and 1.8%, respectively, for the Mg66.5-xCu28.5GdxNd5 (x=8, 10 at%) bulk metallic glasses. The activation energy of the Mg56.5Cu28.5Gd10Nd5 bulk metallic glass using Mg-Nd byproduct is similar to that of conventional Mg56.5Cu28.5Gd10Nd5 bulk metallic glass using pure elements, indicating that the thermal stability in the supercooled liquid region is similar. From the results, the recycling process for NdFeB magnet scrap can be considered a cost effective method for the formation of Mg-based bulk metallic glasses.

A detailed investigation that the effect of subsequent set pulse on the set resistance distribution is presented. The improper subsequent set pulse amplitude and duration cause the cooling process of phase change material to deviate from the crystallization requirements, which leads to poor set resistance distribution. The optimal cooling current (OCC) can generate a linear decrease of the temperature, it is necessary for optimum crystallization. The thermal simulation suggests that the optimal subsequent set pulse has a similar temperature evolution to OCC.

5,"The effect of prior austenite on reversed austenite stability and mechanical properties of Fe-0.06C-0.2Si-5.5Mn-0.4Cr (wt.%) annealed steels was elucidated. With the decrease of austenitizing temperature from 1250 degrees C to 980 degrees C, the prior austenite changed from complete recrystallization to partial recrystallization, and the average austenite size was reduced. The volume fraction of reversed austenite was increased from 26.32 % to 30.25 % because of high density of grain boundaries and dislocations. The martensite transformation temperature of annealed steels was increased from similar to 115 degrees C to similar to 150 degrees C, and both of thermal and mechanical stability of reversed were reduced. There was no significant different in tensile properties, however, the impact toughness was enhanced from 100 J to 180 J at -60 degrees C. The excellent impact toughness in annealed steel (austenitized at 980 degrees C) was obtained because of higher density of high misorientation grain boundaries, more volume fraction of reversed austenite and reduced segregation at grain boundaries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"The solidification process and the precipitation behavior of the boron-carbide hard phase comprising a new high-boron high-speed steel were investigated through the combination of phase balance calculations (by Thermo-Calc software) and experimental tests. The results revealed that a primary austenite precipitation reaction (L -> gamma), ternary eutectic reaction (L -> gamma + M-2 (B, C) + M2C), and secondary boron carbide precipitation reaction (gamma -> M (B, C) and gamma -> M-3 (B, C)) occurred during the solidification process of the steel. These reactions occurred at characteristic temperatures of 1350 degrees C, 1220 degrees C, 1100 degrees C, and 1000 degrees C, respectively. The precipitation reaction of primary austenite yielded a primary austenite dendrite and a eutectic structure distributed along the grain boundary. The ternary eutectic reaction products were austenite, M-2 (B, C) and M2C, which were distributed in the grain boundaries in a manner consistent with interdependence and mixed growth. Similarly, the secondary M-3 (B, C) boron carbide, converted from the (Fe, Cr)(3)C carbide, was precipitated from the austenite matrix. The solidification process consisted of four stages: diffusion of alloying elements, aggregation of alloying elements at grain boundaries, nucleation of M-3 (B, C) phases and growth of M-3 (B, C) phases. This new high-boron high-speed steel can be widely used in rolls and other fields where wear resistance is required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"An exact, closed form, solution is derived for the non-linear stress distribution in a cracked body under antiplane shear deformation. A generalised, non work-hardening, law is introduced to describe the material behaviour, and the stress and strain fields are derived in closed form. Such a new generalised material law includes the effect of a new parameter, a, which allows the transition from the ideally elastic behaviour (low strain regime) to the pure non-linear behaviour (large strain regime) to be modulated. A discussion is carried out on the features of the new solution and on the behaviour of stresses and strains close to and far away from the crack tip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Featured Application Smart factory, multi-state system, reliability engineering. Abstract This article presents a performance evaluation of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), in which the system and its components can have different performance levels ranging from perfect functioning to total failure. An original multistate transition process for the FMS's main component, Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools, proposed in the current article and treated as an aging process because of its increasing failure rate is investigated. The Markov reward approach is utilized to analyze the availability of CNC machine tools and sensitivity analysis of each non-operational state to the machine's downtime. To overcome the ""state explosion problem"" in the subsequent FMS performance evaluation process, an application of the Lz-transform method is proposed to determine the performance evaluation and availability of such aging multistate FMS. An illustrated case is presented to demonstrate the performance evaluation process. The results show that the suggested methods can be implemented in engineering decision making and construction of various aging multistate FMS related to demands, availability, and output performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"BiSmMoO6 microwave ceramics were prepared by solid-phase reaction method using Bi2O3-Sm2O3-MoO3 as raw materials. The rheological properties of the slurry and the microstructure and phase composition of the cast film were characterized. The results show that under the conditions of selecting the alcohol/isopropanol as the solvent, when pH = 6 and the solid phase content is 60% (mass fraction, the same below), and with the additives of the slurry 2% tributyl phosphate dispersant, 8% PVB binder, and 4. 8% polyethylene glycol plasticizer, the casting slurry has excellent rheological properties. After sintering, the cast film is dense in microstructure, and the phase composition does not change compared to the press-formed sample.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"The evolution of microstructure and texture of Ti6Al4V alloy developed by cold rolled followed by annealed treatment at a thickness reduction ratio of 15%-70% were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray bulk texture measurement technique. It was found that the grains were severely broken up and elongated by cold rolling, and the degree of the mechanical anisotropy of the Ti6Al4V alloy was increased. For the cold-rolled Ti6Al4V alloy, recovery and recrystallization occurred during annealed treatment under 840 degrees C for 40 min. The thickness reduction ratio of 10% and 30% of the cold-rolled sheets only partially recrystallized. occurred partial recrystallization. When the thickness reduction ratio reaches 50%, the deformation band structure disappears. Compared to the cold rolled Ti6Al4V alloy, the mechanical anisotropy of the annealed Ti6Al4V alloy was weaker, mainly related to the texture components. The (0001) < 10 (1) over bar0 >, ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > and (11 (2) over bar5) < 10 (1) over bar0 > components dominate the texture of the cold rolled Ti6Al4V alloy. Among them, ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > and (11 (2) over bar5) < 10 (1) over bar0 > texture components inherit the original microstructure, and the intensity of that was increased with thickness reduction ratio increased. However, the intensity and volume fraction of the texture ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > components rapidly increased and the intensity of the texture (11 (2) over bar5) < 10 (1) over bar0 > and (0001) < 10 (1) over bar0 > components were weakened by the annealed treatment. During the annealing treatment, the texture component ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > orientation is gradually strengthened by consuming other scatted orientations. In addition, it can be found that an increase in the intensity and volume fraction of ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > texture component has a positive effect on improving the mechanical anisotropy of the Ti6Al4V alloy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Mg2Ni-Ni-5%RExOy(CeO2 Nd2O3, Tb4O7) composites were synthesized via ball milling method. The microstructure and hydrogen storage properties of the materials were analyzed systematically by XRD, SEM, EDS, the electrochemical and kinetic measurements. The results show that the crystallinities of the composites with rare earth oxides decrease, and the distribution of the rare earth oxide catalysts on the surface of alloys is uniform. The maximum discharge capacities of the composites with rare earth oxides rise evidently,the discharge capacity of the sample containing Tb4O7 reaches to 871mAh . g(-1) at room temperature, and the composites can also keep higher cycling stability. The CeO2 and Tb4O7 catalysts can enhance the abilities of charge transfer on the surface of alloys, and improve the transmission rate of H atoms in the bulk of Mg2Ni alloy obviously. The rare earth oxides catalysts can also increase the gaseous hydrogen absorption capacity. The hydrogen storage capacity of the sample with Tb4O7 reaches to 2. 02% (mass fraction) at 250 degrees C, which is the maximum hydrogen absorption capacity among these samples, but the hydriding rate is relatively slow at lower temperature. The catalytic effect of the rare earth oxides is mainly related to the changeable valences of the rare earth ions, that is, the more likely of the valences change of the ions, the better the catalytic activities exhibit. The catalytic activities in descending order are Tb4O7, CeO2 and Nd2O3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"Cement-based material is brittle and is easily damaged by an impact load with a few blows. The purpose of this paper is to study the relations between the impact resistance and tensile properties of cement-based materials reinforced by polyvinyl alcohol fiber (PVA-FRCM). A drop-weight test and uniaxial tension test were performed. The relations were studied based on the experimental results, including the relation between the blow number and the tensile stress at the first visible cracking (sigma (c)) and the relation between the blow number and the tensile strain at the ultimate failure (epsilon (f)). Results showed that the blow number for the first visible crack for disc impact specimens increases obviously with the increase of sigma (c) of slab specimens. The crater diameter and blow number for ultimate failure of the disc specimens increase with the increase of epsilon (f) of slab specimens. For the PVA-FRCM specimens with larger sigma (c) and epsilon (f), much more blows are needed to cause both the first visible crack and ultimate failure. Polyvinyl alcohol fibers can reinforce impact resistance and tensile properties of cement-based materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Uniaxial tensile flow properties of a duplex Ti-6.6Al-3.3Mo-1.8Zr-0.29Si alloy in a temperature range from 213 K to 573 K are investigated through crystal plasticity modelling. Experimental results indicate that the initial yield stress of the alloy decreases as the temperature increases, while its work-hardening behavior displays temperature insensitivity. Considering such properties of the alloy, the dependence of the initial critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) on temperature is taken into account in the polycrystal plasticity modelling. Good coincidence is obtained between modelling and the experimental results. The determined values of CRSS for slip systems are comparable to the published data. The proposed polycrystalline model provides an alternative method for better understanding the microstructure-property relationship of alpha + beta titanium alloys at different temperatures in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Two non-fullerene acceptors based on the indeno[1,2-b]fluorene central moiety, with selenophene or 2-vinylselenophene as pi-bridges and 2-(5,6-difuoro-3-oxo-2,3- dihydro1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as end-capping groups, i.e. FICBF-Se and FICBF-SeVi, were synthesized, and the structure-property relationships of the acceptors were systematically studied. The introduction of the vinylene group led to clearly redshifted and broader absorption and a smaller bandgap. FICBF-Se and FICBF-SeVi exhibited optical bandgaps of 1.68 and 1.54 eV, respectively. Solar cells using polymer PBDB-T as a donor and FICBF-Se as an acceptor demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.25% with a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 11.61 mA cm(-2). However, the device based on PBDB-T/FICBF-SeVi only delivered a PCE of 3.63% with a J(sc) of 9.08 mA cm(-2), which should be mainly because the vinylene group decreased the crystallinity and its active layer morphology showed no distinct phase separation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Gasochromic switchable mirrors based on magnesium-nickel alloy thin films capped with catalytic Pd-Ag alloy thin films were prepared by a DC magnetron sputtering method. The dependence of the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation process of the films on hydrogen concentration and the ingredient of the catalytic layer has been investigated using different concentration of hydrogen gas for gasochromic optical switching cycles. The hydrogenation/dehydrogenation switching durability shows strong dependence on those two factors. We quantitatively measured the effect of different factors on the durability, response time and optical transmittance of the film, and then used characterization to find out the reason for the prolonged life and utilize this fact to improve the switching cycle of the gasochromic smart window.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"To measure the steam wetness in a steam turbine accurately, the measurement error caused by the deposited water film on the inner wall of the wetness sensor should be deducted. A hyperbolic slot-shaped resonant cavity sensor for measuring the thickness of the liquid film on the inner wall of a cylindrical cavity is designed in this paper. We establish the relationship between the liquid film thickness and resonant frequency theoretically by the medium perturbation method and verify the feasibility of measuring the liquid film thickness in the TE111 mode. The mathematical model of the current density distribution line at the end of the cavity in the TE111 mode is deduced by the method of the vector field equation. Based on the mathematical model, the sensor is designed by Full-wave simulation software. The simulation results show that the electromagnetic leakage rate of the sensor is basically 0% and the sampling error is no more than -1.3%. The liquid film thickness has a linear relationship with the frequency offsets. The experimental results show that it is feasible to accurately measure the liquid film thickness on the inner wall of a cylindrical cavity by measuring the resonant frequency of the resonator. When the thicknesses of the liquid film are within 100 um, the measuring error does not exceed 0.245, which is about 50% lower than the conductivity method. (c) 2019 Author(s).

17,"The Haldane phase represents one of the most important symmetry-protected states in modern physics. This state can be realized using spin-1 and spin-1/2 Heisenberg models and bosonic particles. Here we explore the emergent Haldane phase in an alternating bond Z(3) parafermion chain, which is different from the previous proposals from fundamental statistics and symmetries. We show that this emergent phase can also be characterized by a modified long-range string order, as well as fourfold degeneracy in the ground-state energies and entanglement spectra. This phase is protected by both the charge conjugate and parity symmetry, and the edge modes are shown to satisfy parafermionic statistics in which braiding of the two edge modes yields a 2 pi/3 phase. This model also supports rich phases, including a topological ferromagnetic parafermion (FP) phase, trivial paramagnetic parafermion phase, classical dimer phase, and gapless phase. The boundaries of the FP phase are shown to be gapless and critical with central charge c = 4/5. Even in the topological FP phase, it is also characterized by long-range string order; thus we observe a drop of string order across the phase boundary between the FP phase and the Haldane phase. This work opens a new way for finding of exotic topological phases with parafermions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"The dynamic softening during superplastic deformation and its mechanism was studied by means of tensile tests, TEM observation and EBSD analysis for coarse-grained Ti40 alloy. The results show that the coarse-grained Ti40 alloy exhibits good superplasticity under the test conditions and the maximum elongation of 436% is obtained under the condition of 840 degrees C, 1 x 10(-3) s(-1). The deformation conditions can be divided into three areas: none superplasticity area, dynamic recovery area and dynamic recrystallization area based on the Zener-Hollomon factor and elongation combined with the microstructure analysis. The critical strain model and dislocation density evolution model of dynamic recrystallization were established based on Sellars model and KM equation, respectively. The dynamic recovery mechanism is dominated by dislocation motion-dislocation cells-polygonization-subgrain formation, while the recrystallization mechanism is mainly the continuous dynamic recrystallization resulting from high-angle grain boundaries caused by the subgrains rotation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"We successfully grew a uniform and high-transmittance La-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) thin film by reducing the LBSO particle size and improving film uniformity. We report an alternating magnetic stirring and ultrasonication process that can effectively reduce the size of particles in the colloid. A two-step spin coating process can improve thin film uniformity. A two-step spin coating process consists of two main steps: aggregation and gradual evolution. Aggregation is achieved by a single coating, which causes the colloidal to particles agglomerate into uneven clusters on the substrate. The gradual evolution step improves the quality of the films by filling the pinholes left by the initial coating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"A single-camera special stereo-DIC (SS-DIC) is proposed for accurate virtual fields method (VFM) identification. The single-camera SS-DIC allows accurate surface 3D deformation measurements using a single colour camera and a specially designed colour separation device. It not only effectively eliminates the unavoidable out-of-plane movement/rotation due to unideal in-plane loading but also delivers uniformly distributed measurement points that brings great simplicity and convenience for internal virtual work calculation in VFM. In addition, since only a single camera is used for stereovision, the proposed SS-DIC system requires no complicated synchronisation devices. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are evaluated by heterogeneous deformation experiments of a holed aluminium alloy and 304 stainless steel plate. Combined with a high-speed colour camera, the proposed method is expected to be a simple and practical method for the calibration of material constitutive model under intermediate and high strain rate conditions using VFM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"In this work, a novel ZnO photocatalyst was synthesized by high temperature pyrolytic method using ZIF-8 metal-organic frameworks as precursor. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by measuring the photo-degradation of methylene blue (MB). The components, morphology and surface compositions were investigated. The effects of synthesized temperatures and synthesized atmospheres on photocatalytic degradation of MB were investigated in detail. The photocatalytic results revealed that the ZnO prepared in the aerobic atmosphere at 800 degrees C had the optimum photocatalytic performance. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance of ZnO prepared in aerobic atmosphere with low specific surface area is apparently better than that prepared in anaerobic atmosphere with large specific surface area. This abnormal phenomenon was explained in detail by a physical model. This work provides a new way to obtain ZnO photocatalyst with special morphologies for improving photocatalytic efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has become a mainstay as an insulating barrier in stackable nanoelectronics because of its large bandgap and chemical stability. At mono- and bilayer thicknesses, hBN can function as a tunnel barrier for electronic spectroscopy measurements. Noise spectroscopy is of particular interest, as noise can be a sensitive probe for electronic correlations not detectable by first-moment current measurements. In addition to the expected Johnson-Nyquist thermal noise and nonequilibrium shot noise, low frequency (<100 kHz) noise measurements in Au/hBN/Au tunneling structures as a function of temperature and bias reveal the presence of thermally excited dynamic defects, as manifested through a flicker noise contribution at high bias that freezes out as temperature is decreased. In contrast, broad-band high frequency (similar to 250MHz - 580MHz) measurements on the same device show shot noise with no flicker noise contribution. The presence of the flicker noise through multiple fabrication approaches and processing treatments suggests that the fluctuators are in the hBN layer itself. Device-to-device variation and the approximate 1/f dependence of the flicker noise constrain the fluctuator density to on the order of a few per square micron. (c) 2019 Author(s).

23,"The study of chromium doped forsterite Cr:Mg2SiO4 laser crystals grown from non-stoichiometric melts has been accomplished. Concentration series of the crystals were grown by Czochralski technique from the melts with different MgO/SiO2 molar ratios. The unit cell parameters of the crystals and their hydrostatic densities were measured, and the actual molar weights of the samples were calculated. Both the revealed hydrostatic densities and the actual molar weights appeared to be essentially less than the corresponding values for the stoichiometric Mg2SiO4. Cr4+ content in the crystals, acquired from the optical absorption spectra, linearly increases with increment of MgO excess in the parent melt within whole studied compositions range, whereas the increment of Cr3+ in the same crystals comes to the saturation. This difference in the Cr4+ and Cr3+ behavior opens the potential possibility to optimize the Cr4+/Cr3+ concentrations ratio and to improve in the future lasing properties of the crystals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"To study how different concentrations of cellulase affect the ethanol yields and the gas-production characteristics of anaerobic fermentation using the residues from the ethanol fermentation process, in a moderate temperature (37 +/- 0.2 degrees C) condition, employing a small anaerobic fermentation equipment (a sequencing batch reactor) made in our laboratory, a series of 50 d long anaerobic fermentation experiments were carried out by using cellulase with different concentrations (0.15 g/L, 0.30 g/L and 0.45 g/L). Our results indicate that cellulase concentration is an important parameter for the ethanol fermentation of corn stalks. When the cellulase concentration was 0.30 g/L, the ethanol yield reached a maximum of 39.04 g, and the anaerobic fermentation using the corn stalk residues showed the peak gas production at, as early as, 3 d. Moreover, with this concentration, the methane production per volatile solid (VS) was 26.82 mL.g(-1), and the cumulative gas production was the highest among all experiments, reaching 270.01 mL.g(-1), a high value indicating a high gas-production potential. Through mass balance analysis, we revealed that when the cellulase concentration was 0.30 g/L, the removal efficiency of total solids (TS) and VS (59.12% and 79.07%, respectively) were the highest in the bio-conversion process of corn stalks. This study can serve as a reference for the future ethanol fermentation projects using corn stalks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"With the increase of the production of the restaurant garbage, it is urgent to treat them effectively and harmlessly. Due to its effective and harmless treatment, resource and minimization, the anaerobic fermentation with the restaurant garbage has wide application in the future. In this study, the gas production characteristics have been studied with the change of fermentation system C/N ratio by changing the ratio of sludge and restaurant garbage. In addition, the influence on the fermentation system has been studied. The fermentation technology could thus be optimized by the function simulation of the whole fermentation process. It showed that the addition of sludge could relief the inhibition effect of the system and thus increased the production of methane. The simulated data of gas production were in good agreement with measured data, illustrating that the established model could satisfactorily describe the influence of different ratios of sludge and restaurant garbage on the production of methane. The anaerobic digestion process with the combination of restaurant garbage and sludge could be simulated with satisfactory effect in all, providing information for the anaerobic digestion technology with the combination of restaurant garbage and sludge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

27,"It is proved that porous polyamide non-woven fabric (PNF) can achieve an excellent toughness of the composites while keeping a good processibility. However, there is less research about the interlaminar toughening mechanism of PNF up to now. The finite element model based on cohesive zone model (CZM), which represents the PNF thickness and property, was constructed to predict the delamination onset and propagation of CFRP. In the double cantilever beams test, the main conclusions are as follows: There is little effect of thickness of PNF on the peak load in mode I delamination of CFRP, but the resistance of propagation reaches the maximum when the thickness is equal to 20 mu m. The shape of the delamination front can be directly obtained from the simulations by studying the distribution of the normal traction. For a specific ply-orientation composite, once delamination begins to propagate, the figure of delamination front is consistent. With the increase of the PNF/CFRP ply angle from [0(12)/0(12)] to [0(12)/90(12)], the propagation distance and peak load are reduced correspondingly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"The multi-sized and layered (Ti-x,Nb1-x)C surface-reinforced layer (MLRL) was fabricated on the surface of the high temperature TiNb alloy via an in situ solid-phase diffusion reaction. The MLRL is formed by the diffusion of carbon atoms that diffuse from gray cast iron into the TiNb alloy. During the diffusion reaction, the MLRL is gradually formed in situ on the surface of the TiNb alloy. Thus, there is a good bonding interface between the MLRL and the substrate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis indicates that the MLRL is composed of three layers; the outer layer is micro-nano carbide particles, the middle layer is multi-sized carbide particles, and the inner layer is gradient micro-nano carbide particles. EDS results indicate that the different particles have different ratios of Ti/(Ti + Nb). The XRD results indicate that the MLRL is mainly composed of (Ti-x,Nb1-x)C particles; (t)he diffraction peaks are located at 2 theta positions between the corresponding peaks of TiC and NbC. Nanoindention test results show that the hardness of the MLRL obviously increases (compared to that of TiC or NbC); the highest micro-hardness of the MLRL is nearly 2366 HV0.05. Benefited from the solid-solution strengthening, the multi-sized and layered structures, the relationship between the strength and toughness of MLRL can be improved. Meanwhile the high hardness and volume fraction of (Ti-x,Nb1-x)C will obviously enhance the wear resistance of the reinforced layer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of MgO in excess of its solubility in the FeCo alloy results in the formation of amorphous grain boundaries, leading to a dramatic increase of the resistivity with values over 20 times that of pure FeCo films. As a result, a large self-bias ferromagnetic resonance frequency f(FMR) of up to 9.87 GHz is obtained in the absence of an external magnetic field (H = 0 A/m) and an electric field tuning frequency range of 4.55 GHz was achieved in the as-deposited films at an electric field of 7 kV/cm. The high resistivity and high fFMR in these heterostructures provide great opportunities for application in self-bias tunable monolithic microwave integrated circuit devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,This paper describes a method of applying a silica coating on aluminum nitride and investigations concerning the thermal conductivity between the coating layer and the aluminum nitride as well as the effect of the silica coating layer on the density of samples containing aluminum nitride and glass after sintering. The coating was carried out using polycarbosilane that was transformed into silica by pyrolysis under an airflow. The measured thermal conductivities of all the samples were within an error of less than 10 W/m center dot K. The porosity of a sintered sample containing the silica-coated aluminum nitride powder and glass powder was decreased by about 10% compared to that of a sintered sample comprising pure aluminum nitride powder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"Surface oxide formation was examined on low resistivity p-type CdTe single crystals immersed into distilled water held at 50 degrees C. The oxide thickness and roughness were investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, and its composition was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was observed that after the fast growth of thin oxide layer with the thickness 1.7 nm the growth of oxide layer is proportional to a square root of the immersion time. The oxidation was described by a model in which the oxidation rate is limited by the drift of positive Cd ions from the CdTe-oxide interface into water. The penetration of Na and erosion of CdTe immersed in saturated NaCl solution was investigated by secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements on samples treated in NaCl solution for different time intervals. Very low determined diffusion coefficient of Na was explained by trapping of Na on acceptor-type defects in Cd sublattice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"To address deficiencies in traditional coating and adhesive processes for installing auto safety glasses, mounting brackets for auto safety glass were formed by the insert injection molding process via employing an insert. Specifically, float glass was used as the insert, Chemlok CH456 and CH489 were utilized as the glass primer, and soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was adopted as the material for injection molding. The adhesive force of the mounting brackets was measured, and the adhesive behavior of the mounting brackets was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicated that the adhesive force of the mounting brackets obtained by insert injection molding can be as high as 1027 N. The results showed that the primer located in fracture regions was torn from PVC and the glass. Double-interface adhesion was found between the glass, the primer, and PVC. In particular, the primer and the glass surface formed strong adhesion by mechanical locking, diffusion existed between PVC and the primer, and the diffusion depth was greater than 10 mu m. This process greatly shortens the production cycle of the mounting brackets for auto safety glass and greatly improves the adhesive quality of the mounting brackets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Co3C magnetic nanoparticles have been synthesized using supercritical conditions of ethanol. The phase structure of the samples has shown two phases of orthorhombic Co3C and Co structures. The morphology of the prepared nanoparticles reveals a spherical-like shape. Tailoring the synthesis parameters has led to controlling the magnetic properties depending on the ratio of Co3C:Co in the samples. The magnetic properties of the samples have been measured, revealing ferromagnetic behavior. The data yield coercivity (H-C) was of 600-950 Oe and saturation magnetization (M-S) of 20-38 emu/g. The results present alternative approach to nucleate Co3C magnetic nanoparticles. The synthesis method will be optimized in the future to produce a pure Co3C phase structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"An ensemble of resonators arranged on a subwavelength scale is usually considered as a bulk effective medium, known as a metamaterial, and can offer unusual macroscopic properties. Here, we take a different approach and limit ourselves to the study of only a few number of such elementary components and demonstrate that they still offer uncommon opportunities. Typically, owing to the multiple scattering and the phase shift that the resonances offer, we observe fields that vary at scales completely independent of the wavelength in free space. By smartly tuning the resonance frequencies, we can design at will the complex current distribution in those resonators. This way, we design a superdirective antenna, i.e., an antenna that is surprisingly more directive than its size would foreshadow. This approach is verified numerically and experimentally in the context of microwaves, but this applies to any wave field where subwavelength resonators exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"This study aimed at evaluating the coupling effect of silane Si69 bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide in metakaolin (MK) in automobile tire tread compounds based on a styrene-butadiene rubber/butadiene rubber blend. A reference compound of a typical tread recipe, filled with silica and carbon black, was used as a reference due to the acknowledged effect of TESPT in silica incorporation in elastomers. A silica sample without silane was also prepared. Silica was then completely substituted by MK, producing two samples, with and without silane. The samples were tested for crosslink density, rheometry, and morphology, and the vulcanization reaction parameters were determined and evaluated. Silane improved the interaction between MK and the polymer matrix, evidenced by the increase in crosslink density and vulcanization reaction rate, the same effect silane causes on silica-filled composites. Morphology also revealed that silane increased MK dispersion and adhesion to rubber. On the other hand, MK seems not to be as reinforcing as silica, considering that maximum torque is related to the stiffness of the material, with MK exhibiting lower values for this parameter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"The aim of this study is to investigate the global buckling of a relatively long composite cord-rubber tube subjected to axial compression and its cross-sectional instability due to bending by a macromechanical nonlinear finite element (FE) model (nonlinear buckling analysis). Composite reinforcement layers are modelled as transversely isotropic ones, while elastomer liners are described by a hyperelastic material model that assumes incompressibility. Force-displacement, equivalent strain, equivalent stress results along with oblateness and curvature results for the complete process have been presented. It is justified that bending leads to ovalization of the cross section and results in a loss of the load-carrying capacity of the tube. Strain states in reinforcement layers have been presented, which imply that the probable failure modes of the reinforcement layers are both delamination and yarn-matrix debonding. There is a significant increase in strains due to cross-sectional instability, which proves that the effect of cross-sectional instability on material behaviour of the tube is crucial. A parametric analysis has been performed to investigate the effect of the member slenderness ratio on cross-sectional instability of the composite tube. It shows that Brazier force is inversely proportional to the slenderness ratio. It further shows that higher oblateness parameters occur in case of a lower slenderness ratio and that cross-sectional instability takes place at a lower dimensionless displacement in case of a lower slenderness ratio. FE results have been validated by a compression/bending test experiment conducted on a tensile test machine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"A set of (p) a-Si:H/(i) a-Si:H/(n) c-Si heterostructures is investigated by coplanar conductance measurements. The thickness of the (i) a-Si:H buffer layer is varied between 2 and 50 nm, well beyond the values used in heterojunction solar cells. The change in this thickness plays a role on band bending at the heterointerface and therefore impacts the level of inversion of carrier population at the c-Si surface. Measurements are compared with 1D analytical calculations and 2D electrical modeling. It is demonstrated that the deep defect density, related to silicon dangling bonds, in the (i) a-Si:H layer strongly increases from 1 x 10(17) to 4 x 10(18) cm(-3) when the (i) a-Si:H layer thickness is decreased from 50 to 2 nm. This result is interpreted in terms of defect formation and dependence of the defect density upon the position of the Fermi level with respect to the valence band edge. Quantitative analysis in the framework of the defect-pool model demonstrates that the strong increase of defect density is also promoted by an increase in the width of the valence band tail in the thin (i) a-Si:H layer, suggesting that a very thin layer also suffers from increased disorder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"The current-induced magnetization dynamics is an important subject in spintronics research. It contains many interesting physical phenomena and has a high potential for spintronic applications. Most magnetic memory devices are based on the magnetization switching operation. Thus, finding the switching mechanism, as well as the exact understanding of it, is an essential implement for spintronic devices. Here, we show that the current can switch the magnetization via chiral buckling. To destabilize the uniform magnetization, a critical current value is needed. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) produces a shift in this critical current and the sign of this shift also depends on the domain polarity. Thus, a certain current can select a certain domain polarity. During the switching process, a fluctuation of magnetization is exponentially amplified by the current that forms the magnetization buckling. We explain these phenomena by linear stability analysis and show that two distinct switching operations are possible depending on the DMI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"Hydrogenated nano-crystalline silicon suboxide (nc-SiOx:H; x < 1) is a two-phase material in which nanometersized silicon (nc-Si) region enclosed by hydrogenated amorphous silicon suboxide (a-SiOx:H) matrix. nc-SiOx:H thin films are produced by using highly hydrogen-diluted (d(H) >= 90%) plasma of silane and carbon-dioxide mixture, in a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) system. The high concentration of the H-atoms in the plasma assist the silicon atoms on the growing film surface to crystallize. Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) method was used to determine the nano-scale structures of nc-SiOx:H thin films, for varying hydrogen dilution ratios. The size, shape and the distribution of the nano-formations are found to depend strongly on the preparation conditions. From FTIR absorption and Raman scattering experiments, atomic oxygen and hydrogen contents and also the crystal ratio of the samples are evaluated. As results of nano-structural analyses, the morphologies, sizes and distributions of the nano-aggregations are found to be closely related to the crystallization of the films. From the SAXS results of the samples prepared at the hydrogen dilution ratio of 90%, the nano-aggregations are found to form in uniformly distributed core-shells. However, as the hydrogen dilution is increased to higher ratios to 95% and further to 99%, the nano-scaled fractals are deduced to form. The oxygen and hydrogen contents in nc-SiOx:H are strictly related to the crystal ratio of the samples. The crystal ratio is determined by the hydrogen dilution ratio during the deposition. The two-phase structure of nc-SiOx:H samples and the dependence on the hydrogen dilution ratio may suggest these materials are candidates for phase change materials. Depending on the deposition parameters, smaller nc-Si structures may be prepared which may have different (lower) electron densities required to melt the amorphous region and make the phase change possible due to explosive crystallization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"The experiments in this work were based on the use of grafted polymers on glass nanoparticles for eliminating cadmium ions from environmental and biological samples. Glass nanoparticles (NPs) were modified with (3-mercaptopropyl) trimetoxisilane followed by the graft polymerisation of N,N-dimethylacrylamide and allylamine and then with bromoacetic acid. The grafted polymers on the glass NPs were characterised by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and elemental analysis. Surface morphology was investigated via transmission electron microscopy. The optimum pH for cadmium adsorption and the adsorption capacity of the nanoadsorbent were 6.5 and 46.70 mg g(-1), respectively. The Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson models were employed to analyse the equilibrium adsorption data of Cd (II) on the grafted glass NPs. Finally, the grafted glass NPs were utilised for Cd (II) elimination from the biological and environmental samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"In this work, gold nanoparticles have been prepared using the leaf extract of Eupatorium odoratum assisted with microwave irradiation. The role of pH on the synthesis of gold nanoparticles has also been studied. At higher value of pH, size of nanoparticles got highly diminished, going below 10 nm. A probable mechanism of formation of such small nanoparticles has been proposed in this Letter. The effects of different parameters such as reaction time, temperature and pH variation on the final morphology of gold nanoparticles have been investigated. The characterisation of the samples has been carried out by transmission electron microscope, UV-Vis absorption spectroscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscope and zeta potential analysis. Further, a comparative study of catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles of two different sizes was performed by monitoring the reduction of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Experimental study showed that smaller nanoparticles are more efficient in their catalytic activity than their larger counter parts. The consistency in sizes and shapes, higher stability and rapid synthesis are the major advantages of this synthesis method. Thus, this procedure of synthesis of gold nanoparticles may offer an attractive alternative to the existing ones and opens a full range of possibilities for various analytical applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"The main objective of this study is to assess the long-term performance of Pt nanoparticle coated anodised Ti coupons which are used for electrochemical dissolution of spent mixed-oxide nuclear fuels during reprocessing. In this work, electrodes were exposed to a simulated dissolver solution containing a representative fraction of low-activity actinides and fission products in 11.5 N nitric acid in a mock-up of the service dissolver vessel. Platinum nanoparticles were coated onto anodised titanium coupons through a seed-mediated hydrothermal method. The coated coupons were then exposed in the simulated dissolver solution for about 1185 h at 110 degrees C. Morphological and compositional analyses confirmed the presence of metallic Pt nanoparticles on the electrode surface with some localised cracking. The electrochemically active surface area of the Pt-nanoparticle coated anodised titanium coupon after exposure was found to be twice that of polycrystalline platinum thus establishing the durability and efficiency of the coating on the electrode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"In this work, Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with average sizes of 20 nm were well-dispersed on the surfaces of magnetic carbon-coated Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@C) microparticles through a simple in situ growth process. The catalytic efficiency of the as-prepared AgNPs-decorated Fe3O4@C particles was evaluated using a model reaction based on the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) by an excess of NaBH4. The kinetic data of the reduction reaction could be explained by the assumption of a pseudo-first-order reaction with regard to 4-NP. Also the particles are catalytically more active due to their extremely high-density AgNPs immobilised on the surfaces of Fe3O4@C particles. Significantly, the Fe3O4@C@Ag catalysts can be easily separated from the reaction media by applying an external magnet, and can be reused for several cycles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"We have performed transverse- and zero-field muon spin rotation/relaxation experiments, as well as magnetometry measurements, on samples of Fe1-xVxSe and their Li + NH3 intercalates Li-0.6(NH2)(0.2) (NH3)(0.8) Fe1-xVxSe. We examine the low vanadium substitution regime: x = 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02. The intercalation reaction significantly increases the critical temperature (T-c) and the superfluid stiffness for all x. The nonintercalated samples all exhibit T-c approximate to 8.5 K while the intercalated samples all show an enhanced T-c > 40 K. Vanadium substitution has a negligible effect on T-c, but seems to suppress the superfluid stiffness for the nonintercalated samples and weakly enhance it for the intercalated materials. The optimal substitution level for the intercalated samples is found to be x = 0.01, with T-c approximate to 41 K and lambda(ab)(0) approximate to 0.18 mu m. The nonintercalated samples can be modeled with either a single d-wave superconducting gap or with an anisotropic gap function based on recent quasiparticle imaging experiments, whereas the intercalates display multigap nodal behavior which can be fitted using s + d- or d + d-wave models. Magnetism, likely from iron impurities, appears after the intercalation reaction and coexists and competes with the superconductivity. However, it appears that the superconductivity is remarkably robust to the impurity phase, providing an avenue to stably improve the superconducting properties of transition metal substituted FeSe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"0.94Na(1/2)Bi(1/2)TiO(3)-0.06BaTiO(3) (NBT-6BT) perovskite structure ceramics doped by nano-sized TiO2, which stayed in the grain boundaries of NBT-6BT grains, were prepared by the solid-state method. NBT-6BT: xTiO(2) (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) 0-3 type composite structure ceramics were fabricated successfully and the effects of doped TiO2 on structure and piezoelectric properties were investigated in detail. The results show that some TiO2 enter into the lattice of NBT-6BT matrix, which result in a decrease of Cc phase content and an enhancement of crystal symmetry. The increasing amounts of TiO2 significantly improve the depolarization temperature of NBT-6BT ceramics. After doping 0.1 mol of TiO2, the depolarization temperature improves by 88%. The dielectric loss tan delta and piezoelectric coefficient d(33) are 0.044 and 99 pC/N, respectively, which indicates that this kind of ceramic is a new type of lead-free piezoelectric materials suitable for higher temperature range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"Dynamic strain ageing (DSA) is observed in the tensile behaviour of 20MnMoNi55. The DSA phenomenon contributes extra hardening for a certain combination of straining rate and temperature. At temperature ranging from 200 degrees C to 400 degrees C and a straining rate of 10(-4)-10(-2 )s(-1), alloy 20MnMoNi55 exhibits DSA. In the present work, DSA stresses are calibrated as a function of strain, strain-rate and temperature. Modification of the Johnson-Cook material model by incorporating DSA has been attempted.

48,"Solar cell wafer cutting process produces a lot of silicon carbide-based waste named HT-SiC. Herein, we developed a novel catalyst through a one-pot hydrothermal process combined with an ion-exchange method to synthesize Cu-SSZ-13/HT-SiC composite and applied in denitration catalytic reaction. TMAdaOH and Cu-TEPA were used as templates to prepare the precursor for Cu-SSZ-13, respectively. Results showed that, with participation of HT-SiC, SSZ-13 crystal was successfully obtained by using TMAdaOH template, while it would get only amorphous structure by using Cu-TEPA template. NH3-SCR(Selective Catalytic Reduction, SCR) exhibited catalytic activity and stability of Cu-SSZ-13/HT-SiC in medium and high temperature zones was more effective than those of Cu-SSZ-13 without HT-SiC, and NO consumption by the former was about 11-fold of the latter at 500 degrees C. Moreover, compared with Cu-SSZ-13/alpha-SiC catalyst prepared with pure SiC (alpha-SiC), Cu-SSZ-13/HT-SiC shows better catalytic activity in the whole temperature range. These favorable performances are attributed not only to the good thermal conductivity and thermal stability of SiC, but also to the 7.34wt% Fe component contained in HT-SiC, which acts as an active site for reducing NO in NH3-SCR. This method not only provides a way to reuse the SiC waste, but also enhances denitrification activity of Cu-SSZ-13 in medium and high operating temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"Numerous theories of molecular ordering in the nematic phase exist that attempt to incorporate the features of weak attractions, excluded volume (aspect ratio), and rigid and non-rigid segments, as well as assess entropic and enthalpic effects. Para-quinquephenyl represents a model rodlike molecule, but study of this liquid crystal presents challenges and surprises given the high temperature of the nematic phase. We present NMR experiments throughout the nematic range on two specifically deuterium-labelled quinquephenyl isotopomers, which we combine with high fidelity molecular dynamics simulations to explore and quantify various aspects of orientational order. The striking agreement between experiment and simulation provides new insights into the role of molecular flexibility and correlations (clustering, director fluctuations) on observed order parameters. We compare several nematic theories with our observations and discuss implications for further theoretical understanding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,"Titanium dioxide (B)/glass fiber cloth (B-T/GFC) composites with photothermal enhanced photocatalytic properties were prepared by using a facile chemical synthesis and Sol-Gel method, using the glass fiber cloth and TiH2 as substrate and precursor, respectively. XRD, SEM and TEM were employed to investigate the composition, structure and morphology of B-T/GFC composite. Different properties of the materials were studied by spectrophotometer, optical contact angle measuring instrument and solar simulator. The results show that the composite surface is composed of anatase black TiO2 with a disordercoating of about 1 nm. Meanwhile, the B-T/GFC composite with high hydrophobicity has strong absorption ability in the wavelength range from 250 nm to 2000 nm. Compared with glass fiber cloth, the B-T/GFC composite reveals better photothermal ability under sunlight with one solar intensity (1 kW/m(2)). The photocatalytic degradation ability of B-T/GFC composite in organic pollutants cutting waste solution is better than those of pure black TiO2 (B-T) and P25. After irradiation for 2 h, the degradation of COD over B-T/GFC composite is about 1.3 times higher than that of P25. The B-T/GFC composite possessing excellent photothermal enhanced photocatalytic properties performance may lead to a range of novel applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"The dependence of the Hall conductivity on temperature and magnetic field in optimally doped La2-xCexCuO4 +/-delta (x = 0.105) thin films demonstrates that both the hole and the electron bands undergo Cooper pairing. The magnetic field suppresses the dominant hole band pairing more effectively, making the subdominant electron band pairing visible. Positively charged Cooper pairs dominate the Hall signal in the mixed state at a weak magnetic field near T-c, while at large field the negatively charged Cooper pairs take over. Sign reversals of the Hall conductivity induced by superconducting fluctuation occur in the transition and can be explained by a weakly coupled two-band Ginzburg-Landau-Lawrence-Doniach model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"High-speed machining experiment of pure copper and aluminum bronze (QAl9-4) is carried out at the same cutting condition to obtain the different chips. The valence electron structure (VES) parameters that affect adiabatic shearing sensitivity were studied in this paper. The results show the bond energy and lattice electron number are related to adiabatic shearing sensitivity. Adiabatic shearing sensitivity increases with the increase of bond energy, and the decrease of lattice electron number. For pure copper, the bond energy is smaller and the lattice electron number is higher, so its adiabatic shearing sensitivity is low. The shape of chip is approximate ribbon. For aluminum bronze (QAl9-4), the bond energy is increased and the lattice electron number is decreased due to aluminum (Al) addition, so its adiabatic shearing sensitivity is higher than that of pure copper. The serrated chip divided uniformly by Adiabatic Shear Band (ASB) was formed. The basis can be provided for optimizing process parameters, improving and selecting materials with different cutting performance by studying the specific alloy elements on the influence of adiabatic shearing sensitivity to predict the chip morphology to some extent in VES level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,"Reaction-bonded boron carbide composites were fabricated by both microwave (under Ar/10% H-2) and conventional heating (under vacuum or Ar/10% H-2). Silicon carbide (SiC) formation occurred in all cases and was slightly favored in the case of microwave heating under Ar/H-2. The resulting microstructures were influenced by the heating process and atmosphere; the SiC existed in the form of needles with conventional heating under vacuum. SiC small polygonal grains were present after microwave heating under Ar/H-2. Both the atmosphere and the electromagnetic field influence the SiC morphology. Despite this difference, the hardness and toughness of composites obtained by both heating techniques were similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"Offshoring strategies raise a critical question to defining the country images of brands, as offshoring results in discrepancies between the country-of-brand origin (COB) and the country-of-manufacture (COM) by relocating COM from the home to another country. Based on cognitive dissonance theory and social exchange theory, this study assesses the outcomes of apparel brands' differing types of offshoring strategies by tracing consumers' brand perception as these change after the revelation of offshoring information, particularly by comparing those outcomes between an upscale brand and a midmarket brand. Results from an experimental study revealed that a brand originating from a developed country's offshoring from a developing country can significantly decrease brand credibility and prestige, while a brand originating from an emerging country's offshoring from a developed country does not significantly improve those brand assets in either the upscale or the midmarket brand contexts. The paper concludes with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications along with suggestions for future research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,"Meso-Macro porous alumina was fabricated using yeast cells as a pore-forming agent. Alumina powder synthesis was achieved by a low cost process (recrystallisation of alum).The effect of the pore forming agent on the true porosity, bulk density and thermal conductivity of porous alumina was characterized. The results show that the true porosity increased with the increasing addition of yeast cells. The bulk density and thermal conductivity at room temperature decreased with the increasing yeast addition. A genetic algorithm method was used to minimize the thermal conductivity of the macro-porous alumina based on the amount of yeast cells used, the sintering temperature, and the hold time. The genetic algorithm found that the best thermal conductivity achievable was equal to 0.152 Watt/m. degrees C at 20wt% concentration of yeast, a sintering temperature of 1230 degrees C and 1.5 hours of soaking time. The experimental value was 0.14 Watt/m. degrees C and the slight variance between these values were postulated to be due to experimental error in the measurements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,"Microbial pathogens use hydrolases as a virulence strategy to spread disease through tissues and colonize medical device surfaces; however, visualizing this process is a technically challenging problem. To better understand the role of secreted fungal hydrolases and their role in Candida albicans virulence, we developed an in situ model system using luminescent Re(I) and Ir(III) containing probe molecules embedded in a biodegradable (poly(lactic-coglycolic acid), PLGA) polymer and tracked their uptake using epifluorescent imaging. We found that secretion of esterases can explain how physically embedded probes are acquired by fungal cells through the degradation of PLGA since embedded probes could not be liberated from nonbiodegradable polystyrene (PS). It was important to verify that epifluorescent imaging captured the fate of probe molecules rather than naturally occurring fungal autofluorescence. For this, we exploited the intense luminescent signals and long spectral relaxation times of the Re and Ir containing probe molecules, resolved in time using a gated imaging system. Results provide a visual demonstration of a key virulence trait of C. albicans: the use of hydrolases as a means to degrade materials and acquire hydrolysis products during fungal growth and hyphal development. These results help to explain the role of nonspecific hydrolases using a degradable material that is relevant to the study of fungal pathogenesis on biotic (tissues) surfaces. Additionally, understanding how fungal pathogens condition surfaces by using nonspecific hydrolases is important to the study of fungal attachment on abiotic surfaces, the first step in biofilm formation on medical devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,"Medical implants of polypropylene (PP) are commonly used in many surgical procedures to support tissues. Previous studies on polypropylene meshes removed from patients demonstrated biodegradation relative to the amount of time after implantation. Among the many possible factors, bacterial colonization is believed to be one of the causes for the biodegradation of PP. To gain insights on this hypothesis, PP mesh samples were tested in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) media containing Escherichia coli (E. coli) to observe possible degradation in a controlled single-organism environment. Mesh samples were immersed in either an LB media with E. coli or a control solution, and the biodegradation was measured at 1-, 2-, and 3-month intervals. The samples were then harvested from both LB media with E. coli and the control media for analysis, and results were then compared with pristine polypropylene mesh. The experimental results demonstrate qualitative and quantitative bioerosion, increased oxygen content, and enhanced hydrophilicity over the surface of the mesh structure, thus confirming the oxidative degradation in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,"Lipid membranes routinely undergo protein-mediated morphological remodeling during vital processes such as cellular transport and division. These membrane remodeling proteins can be broadly classified into two categories: one that generates a spherical shape and another that generates a cylindrical shape. To gain physical insights into membrane shape transitions, it is important to investigate the stability of membranes in the presence of these two types of proteins. However, the existing membrane theory is mostly restricted to the class of membranes that interact with the sphere shape-generating proteins and possess isotropic symmetry. In this work, we use curvature elasticity of the lipid membranes to derive the stability criterion for membranes that interact with the cylindrical-shape-generating proteins that possess orthotropic symmetry. We derive the convexity condition followed by the stability criterion for a generalized form of strain energy that can entertain material heterogeneity. The proposed framework would allow for a rigorous analysis of a broader set of membrane-protein interactions during key cellular processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,"We have investigated the crystallization in amorphous silicon doped with B2H6 for varing doping levels under epsilon-field. Crystallization rate is classified into 3 stages based on the doping time, the mechanisms involved, and the rate determining step. The crystallization rate is saturated at around 10 mu m/h after 2 min doping time. The main mechanism for the rate saturation is due to the high internal epsilon-field caused by the heavy doping. The direction of the internal epsilon-field in the case of p-type doping is opposite to that of n-type doping, which causes the final saturated crystallization rate to be higher in the case of p-type doping, and lower in the case of n-type doping, compared to the intrinsic a-Si. The B2H6-doped samples with an epsilon-field show an uni-directional needle network microstructure with a preferred orientation of < 111 > direction in (110) plane. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

60,"Iron-titanium sulfides FeTi2S4 and Fe2TiS4 have been structurally and magnetically characterized using powder X Ray Diffraction with Rietveld refinement method and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy at variable temperature. Both sulfides have the same crystallographic phase, based on the monoclinic Cr3S4 type structure and vary in atomic coordinates; FeTi2S4 retains the ideal atomic positions proposed for the Cr3S4 phase, while in Fe2TiS4 the metal displacements from ideal sites are noticeable. Mossbauer spectra reveal different magnetic behaviors; in FeTi2S4 there is a transition from paramagnetic to magnetic ordering at temperature Tc = 145 K, giving rise to unusually low hyperfine magnetic field of 2.5 T (at 77 K) if compared with values of iron magnetic moments reported previously, this behavior is explained on the basis of blocking Fe localized magnetic moments by the Spin density wave (SDW) originated from 3d Ti atoms. In Fe2TiS4 a transition from paramagnetic to (SDW) arises at Tc = 290 K, the SDW is spread in both Fe and Ti metals through [1 0 1] crystallographic plane and undergoes a transition of first order from Incommensurate SDW (ISWD) to Commensurate SDW (CSDW) at T-IG = 255 K.

61,"The influence of PCBM on the electronic energy levels of P3HT:PCBM photocathodes was investigated in a nonaqueous electrolyte using a benzoquinone redox couple. The presence of PCBM introduces a density of interface states at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, consequently leading to the formation of an interfacial dipole layer and decrease in the built-in potential developed at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface. Photoelectrochemical measurements reveal a decrease in photovoltage from 0.26 V to 0.16 V and cathodic shift in onset potential from -0.27 V to -0.34 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) as PCBM content of the P3HT:PCBM photocathode is increased from 0 through 50 wt%. Additionally, depletion layer widths decreased from 90 nm to 50 nm. When the thickness of the active layer was controlled to coincide with the depletion layer thickness (e.g., 90 nm), photocurrent densities at pristine P3HT photocathodes were found to be higher than for P3HT:PCBM photocathodes. This suggests that the built-in electric field within the active layer is seemingly capable of effective exciton dissociation in the absence of a fullerene acceptor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,Hafnia zinc oxide (HfxZn1-xO) nanorod-like structures were processed for photoswitching applications through a facile chemical strategy. Their crystalline structure and phase purity were examined by X-ray diffraction and Raman analysis. The evolution of HfxZn1-xO in rod-like configuration was inferred through scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The band gap values of HfxZn1-xO were estimated using Tauc's plot to be around 2.89-3.11 eV. The association of multiple defects within the hafnia based nanorods was further substantiated through luminescence results via sub-band signals in near visible region. Nyquist and bode plots of HfxZn1-xO nanorods were extracted from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic results to evaluate the role of grain boundaries on their conductivity values. The electrical properties of HfxZn1-xO nanorods including their carrier density were estimated by capacitance vs. voltage (1/C-2 vs. V) measurements. The photoswitching potential of n-HfxZn1-xO was investigated by spin casting the nanostructures on p-Si and investigating the diode's charge transfer characteristics. The Hf composition in the respective diode architecture was found to influence their corresponding photocurrent values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,"Herein, we report the dual functionality of a single n-type gallium nitride (n-GaN) layer as an electron transporter and transparent conductor, which has applications in reusable organic solar cells. After silicon doping with an optimized electron concentration, thin-film layer of GaN showed exceptional electrical properties including charge carrier mobility of 161 cm(2) V(-1)s(-1), electrical conductivity of 1.4x10(6) S cm(-1), and sheet resistance of 11.1 Omega cm(-2). Organic solar cells based on n-GaN exhibited power conversion efficiency comparable to those based on a conventional ITO/ZnO bilayered cathode. Furthermore, the n-GaN substrates exhibited reusability; due to excellent chemical stability of n-GaN, the reconstructed organic solar cells maintained their initial performance after the substrates were recycled. We suggest a new type of reusable n-GaN cathode layer featuring an integrated electron transporting layer and transparent electrode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"The reliability and the expected lifetime of optical fibres used in different structural applications, including composites are closely related to the chemical environment action on the silica cladding. To ensure the long-term mechanical strength of the optical fibres, a polymer coating was applied onto the fibre surface during fabrication. The aging mechanism is assumed to enlarge or to extend the ""Griffith flaws"" which are spread at the fibre surface. Systematic experiments have been carried out to assess different reagent's effect on the fibre mechanical strength, such as fluorinated vapors, acetylene, ammonia and organic compounds. Different types of fibres, including hermetically coated ones, have been aged and subjected to mechanical tests under dynamic conditions.

65,"Urchin like Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere precursors have been synthesized via a rapid sol-gel synthetic route followed by a solvent-induced self-transformation process. The preparation of Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere phosphors involves the following steps: firstly epoxide-driven sol-gel reactions induce gel formation. Secondly, the gel transforms into urchin-like hollow microspheres precursor through a solvent-induced self-transformation process. Finally, Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere phosphors are obtained after a low temperature calcination procedure. Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere phosphors with diameter around 1-2 mu m present an urchin-like external surface constructed by randomly aggregated and interconnecting nanoplatelets.

66,"Many destructive test methods are used to prove the resistance against loads occurring in a bonded joint during its life cycle. In addition to the determined mechanical properties, the evaluation of the failure behavior is an important quality criterion. Maximum adhesive strength is achieved with cohesive failure and this joint strength can be predicted. Based on this fact it is more important to determine the failure percentages objectively and reproducibly. In addition, adhesive-specific, characteristic structures are formed in cohesive fracture surfaces which indicate the failure-relevant, locally acting loads. In industrial practice, there is no evaluation method to objectively evaluate and analyze the failure ratio of an adhesively bonded joint. The innovation of the developed, computer-aided analysis of the fracture surfaces involves the objective determination of the failure ratio according to international standards and the further analysis of the failure-relevant fracture processes. This enables the adhesive user to evaluate a large number of test specimens in a time-efficient, objective and automated manner. The automated evaluation method calculates the failure mode proportions based on digital images of the fracture surface. The segmentation and classification use a histogram-based color differentiation. The region growing algorithms were optimized and tested with a database of different adhesives and materials. Furthermore, it is possible to get knowledge about load conditions of the destroyed joint by analyzing the fracture surface. To quantify the relationship between load conditions and the resulting fracture structure a topographical 3d method and a 2d imaging method is investigated. The differentiation between the load angle and testing temperatures shows significant, adhesive-specific characteristics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Demkov, Phys. Rev. B 97, 075423 (2018)]. Further theoretical analysis presented here suggests that coupling of electrons in graphene to interfacial hybrid plasmon/optical modes via remote-phonon scattering may result in an effective attractive electron-electron interaction that, in turn, could lead to electron pairing and superconductivity. Specifically, we consider top-gated graphene supported by STO. Using the full dynamic polarizability within the random phase approximation for the entire system (including the hybrid modes arising from the coupling of the graphene plasmons to the optical phonons of the STO substrate and gate insulator), we estimate the superconducting transition temperature in the strong-coupling limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"We study the electronic transport through a pair of distant nanosystems (S-a and S-b) embedded in a single-mode cavity. Each system is connected to source and drain particle reservoirs and the electron-photon coupling is described by the Tavis-Cummings model. The generalized master equation approach provides the reduced density operator of the double system in the dressed-states basis. It is shown that the photon-mediated coupling between the two subsystems leaves a signature on their transient and steady-state currents. In particular, a suitable bias applied on subsystem S-b induces a photon-assisted current in the other subsystem S-a which is otherwise in the Coulomb blockade. We also predict that a transient current passing through one subsystem triggers a charge transfer between the optically active levels of the second subsystem even if the latter is not connected to the leads. As a result of backaction, the transient current through the open system develops Rabi oscillations (ROs) whose period depends on the initial state of the closed system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

71,"Understanding the structural origin of the functionality in cuprates has attracted tremendous attention over several decades. In particular, probing distortions in the Cu-O bonding is of great importance for exploring the coupling between the charge and the lattice, a key mechanism for superconductivity and other functionality in correlated materials. Here we study a superlattice modulation in the Tb2Cu0.83Pd0.17O4 ""214"" material, which possesses no superconductivity itself but has the parent structure of the R2CuO4 (R = a rare-earth element) superconducting cuprate group. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we find that this superlattice modulation is formed by Cu ion displacements in a direction perpendicular to the Cu-O planes. The superlattice modulation undergoes a reversible electronic smectic-nematic phase transition under electron-beam illumination. With the help of in situ TEM results, our findings imply that the superlattice modulation in this material arises from spatially modulated charge ordering at the Cu sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"The breath-figure method using the condensation of water droplets can easily fabricate regular porous films. Although the method is simple, the phenomenon itself requires the control of many parameters that change throughout the process. Therefore, we require a unified understanding of polymers for the fabrication of ordered porous films. In this study, to clarify the required molecular structures of polymers to form a regular porous structure, we systematically explored poly(methacrylate)s with cyanobiphenyl moieties connected by dodecyl groups in the side chain (P11CB); these could form a hexagonal ordered porous structure on the entire film surface. The comparison of P11CB and P11B, which is a P11CB without cyano groups, showed that the local polar groups in hydrophobic polymers promote the formation of ordered porous films. Furthermore, no holes were formed in films of P0CB which is a P11CB without alkyl spacers due to its hydrophilicity. Long alkyl chains resulted in changed hydrophilic polymers to hydrophobic polymers. The introduction of long alkyl chains as a spacer between the biphenyl moiety and polymer backbone is preferred in the cases of particularly few amounts of biphenyl groups in the polymer. The biphenyl groups showed the ability to improve film formability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"The main goal of this attempt is to explore and analyze the behavior of a material containing artificial surface defect and solicited under variable amplitude cyclic loading. The observation and the follow-up of the loading history and the characterization of the damage accumulation were evaluated in the presence of an artificial surface defect. The results made it possible to highlight a strong nonlinearity of the damage accumulation. However, the absence of sequence effects encountered in a defect-free material has been found. In the perspective of developing an approach to evaluate the influence of the defects on cumulative damage under variable amplitude loading, this work consists of coupling a multiaxial fatigue criterion adapted to defective materials with a law of uniaxial damage solicited under variable amplitudes loading. A cumulative damage law has been used to analyze the validity of the proposed method. Introducing the equivalent multiaxial fatigue stress due to the presence of the defect allowed us to predict the residual lifetime of a defective material, and to find the effects of sequences usually observed for variable amplitude loading for the defect-free material. A coherent agreement is observed between the results predicted by the improved model and those obtained from the experimental investigations on specimens containing artificial surface defect subjected to purely alternating tension and torsion under increasing and decreasing load levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study incorporates a polymerization process that produces a cross-linking of the PANI chains, yielding an extended disordered branched lattice. The presence of the phenazine structure is fundamental and allows the polymer to acquire extra dimensions, which permits a transition to the metallic phase when doping is increased as the Fermi level goes through the mobility edge into a region of extended states. This PANI system is described assuming that the polymerization process gives rise to a structure that could be represented by a Bethe lattice.

The abundant fluorine radicals grafted onto the paper surface, via the substitution and opening of the bonds in the cellulose polymers, yielded CFx (x: 1-3) functionalities, as observed by XPS and ATR-FTIR analyses. Lower power (100 W) and treatment times (0.5 min) were sufficient to obtain very highly fluorinated surfaces.

82,"We discuss an even-odd effect for an impurity with N-fold-degenerate internal states immersed in a two-dimensional superfluid-Mott-insulator quantum critical bath which is described by a spin-S XY Bose-Kondo impurity model with N = 2S + 1. Using a dimensional- and momentum-cutoff regularized renormalization group and unbiased large-scale Monte Carlo numerical simulations, we establish the phase diagram for the S = 1 impurity with all relevant terms included. We show that a threefold-degenerate S = 1 impurity coupled to a critical bath has a nondegenerate ground state with a quantized charge, in qualitative contrast to the spin-1/2 case where the impurity is partially screened. We then argue that all impurities with odd-2S degeneracy share the same universal physics as the spin-1/2 case and all impurities with even-2S degeneracy are the same as the spin-1 case. We validate our conjecture with unbiased Monte Carlo simulations up to S = 2. A physical consequence of this even-odd effect is that two spin-1/2 impurities in the critical bath form a long-range entangled state at a low temperature, which can be realized in ultracold atoms in an optical lattice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"Stress-strain (SS) curve is a necessary ingredient of any mathematical model describing metal forming processes. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) imposes additional requirements on SS-tests because some of deformation mechanisms, such as shear band sliding, micro-cracks, etc., prove to be suppressed due to specific character of stress-strain state: complex loading path, all-round high pressure, and high gradients of stress and strain tensor fields. In this work, a novel method of SPD SS-curve construction combining the classical uniaxial compression test with microhardness measurements is proposed. The barreling effect is negligibly small owing to specific experimental conditions. This renders spatially uniform the stress-strain state and allows avoiding the inverse finite element modeling. The cast leaded tin bronze alloy Cu85-Pb5-Sn5-Zn5 has been studied during upsetting process. An experimental force-displacement diagram appears to be strictly linear up to the moment of destruction under uniaxial compression. The dendritic structure evolution in both axial and cross sections of a cylindrical sample was studied by optical microscope. Local distortions in elements of this structure are evidence of spatial fluctuations in plastic strain at macroscopic level. Microhardness in these sections was also measured. Shear bands appear at strain epsilon(p) approximate to 0.14 and they are responsible of the softening behavior. In this work, softening is contrary to the experiments on deep rolling treatment where the monotonic increase in microhardness was observed. Microhardness measurements allow expanding the total strain into dislocation sliding and shear band sliding summands. This expansion makes it possible to discard the shear band sliding item and obtain an initial segment of SS-curve (up to strain epsilon(p) = 0.32 for bronze Cu85-Pb5-Sn5-Zn5) available for SPD simulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"To elucidate the influence of Fe on the interaction between carbon and hydrogen in graphite nanocrystals, graphite nanocrystals were mechanically milled with steel balls in a hydrogen atmosphere, and the potential of the material produced to store hydrogen was evaluated. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra revealed that milling reduced the graphene size and increased the average distance between graphene layers. Elemental analysis showed that milling increased both the H/C and Fe/C ratios in the material. After being milled in a hydrogen atmosphere, samples released hydrogen at a lower temperature than before milling. Thermal decomposition occurred in two stages-235 to 475 degrees C and 692 to 749 degrees C-and yielded a total of 1.0 wt% hydrogen. It is hypothesized that these two stages corresponded to hydrogen released from Fe3C structures and from the Fe-catalyzed graphitization reaction, respectively. Before milling, samples slowly released a total of 0.5 wt% hydrogen over a temperature range from about 300 to over 900 degrees C. Fe-C-H materials are attractive for hydrogen storage because they are composed of carbon and iron, which are inexpensive and abundant elements on Earth, and they have a high hydrogen weight density of 11 wt%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"Magnetron sputtering is widely used for deposition of silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) coatings on glass in large-area applications. Since repeated deposition simulates the factory-scale in-line processing, amorphous aluminum-doped SiOxNy layers with thickness of about 250 nm were deposited by reactive pulsed DC sputtering in a multi-pass process with repeated linear movement of a glass substrate under an Al-alloyed Si target. Using specular X-ray reflectivity we show periodic fluctuations of the material density throughout the entire thickness of the resulting coating. The number of periods corresponds to the number of passes of the substrate through the plasma of the magnetron. Fitting results suggest a model consistent with a periodic alternation of the O/N ratio. These subtle stoichiometric fluctuations in the SiOxNy layer composition were confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis with nanoscale resolution, and with detailed elemental maps of characteristic X-rays of the layered cross-section. Our study demonstrates the superior sensitivity of the relatively simple nondestructive X-ray reflectivity method for industrial line-process inspection compared to ellipsometry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,"Owing to the alloying effect, the bond composition of CdSexS1-x nanocrystals is complex. To reveal the bond nature of the Raman red shift in complex-alloyed nanocrystals, we propose the concept of a basic bond unit for nanocrystalline alloy systems. An alloyed nanocrystal can be decomposed into basic bond units according to a bond-by-bond approach. A local-mode model of alloyed nanocrystals is developed, which is applied to determine the Raman red shift of the destination bonds in a basic bond unit. Using this theory, the Raman spectra of CdSexS1-x nanocrystals are obtained. The calculated Raman curves are in good agreement with the experimental ones, indicating that the concept of basic bond unit can well demonstrate the chemical bond nature of the Raman spectra of the alloyed nanocrystals. Based on the strategy of breaking up the whole alloyed nanocrystal into basic bond units, the nanosize effect of Raman shifts may be accurately predicted even just by a pocket calculator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

89,"The end-oxygens (end-O) of metal-oxygen chains on transition-metal (TM) surfaces play a vital role in the decomposition of H-contained molecules, such as H2O and alcohols. However, the achievement of high density of ordered end-O structures on TM surfaces is still challenging so far. In this paper, based on the evidence of ultrahigh vacuum-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we successfully prepared the high density of ordered end-O structures on Ni(110) surfaces through breaking the long Ni-O chains to short Ni-O chains by NO adsorption on (2 x 1)Ni-O/Ni(110) reconstructed surfaces. The mechanism of end-O formation has been interpreted: at low NO coverage at 90 K, NO molecules tiltedly adsorb on Ni atoms in Ni-O chains causing a strong distortion; when NO coverage is increased close to saturation (similar to 0.5 ML), the accumulated stress of Ni-O chains finally breaks the Ni-O bonds, resulting in the release of the host Ni atoms in Ni-O chains to the hollow sites and the formation of two end-O for each released Ni. Furthermore, the ordering of end-O structures on Ni(110) surfaces can be greatly enhanced by the annealing of the sample to 250 K. Such an approach to prepare the high density of ordered end-O structures is expectedly applied to other TM surfaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles have been extensively proposed for delivering drugs into the brain and have shown their ability to cross the blood brain barrier in vitro and in vivo. However, the application of nanoparticles could be limited by their potential side effects. In this study, two glioblastoma cell lines with the poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles were treated at different concentrations. Through MTT assay, the viability of treated cells was quantified. Induction of apoptosis was analysed by flowcytometry as well as quantitative PCR assay for the expression of BCL2 family genes. The results of this study showed that the treatment with poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles induced neither apoptosis nor necrosis in these cells. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed that poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles treatment caused significant changes in the expression of some BCL2 family members. In conclusion, it seems that poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles treatment at non-toxic dose can change the expression of some apoptosis-related genes in glioblastoma cells while has no significant effect on their viability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"This paper shows that just taking a picture of the carbon preform can be a powerful detection method of missing rod. The poor quality of the carbon preforms including missing rods cannot provide tailored composite to meet desired properties. By the way, the carbon preform is manufactured manually now and often there happen a mistake that a carbon rod is omitted. Therefore, an effective solution for guaranteeing the quality of the carbon preform is needed. For that reason, this paper proposes new inspection method that can detect the missing rods of multidirectional carbon preform. This method utilized some image processing techniques to simplify the image of carbon preform. In this method, the carbon preform image is modified so that the carbon rods and background can be easily separated.

Moreover, because the inspection method suggested in this paper can be easily converted into the form of software, it is expected to be applied effectively to the fields of manufacture of the multidirectional carbon preform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since VLS is a catalyst-based method, we have initially modeled the gold droplet using a modified Young's equation to be more suitable for SnO2 nanowires. Apart from the droplet geometry, the flow profile of the source vapor can also affect the overall formation of nanowires. This effect is more predominant for solid sources of SnO vapor where highly variable density and length of nanowires are observed. To understand this complex phenomenon, we describe a spatial growth model to predict the observed profile of SnO2 nanowires at different locations on silicon substrates. The model is based on gas transportation over the nanosized catalyst droplets, leading to a gradual reduction in both the length and density of the grown wires. This theoretical model is applied to a randomly patterned distribution of gold catalysts, and the results are consistent with the experimental findings. Since gold is used as the growth catalyst for tin oxide nanowires, the parameters of gold droplets atop silicon nanowire and Young's angle are extracted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"Some ionic surfactant-based lyotropic mixtures, exhibiting cholesteric phases, were prepared to investigate the effect of the surfactant alkyl chain length on a) uniaxial-to-biaxial phase transitions and b) stabilization of different cholesteric phases. Potassium alkanoates, KCx, (potassium undecanoate, KC11, potassium dodecanoate, KC12, and potassium tridecanoate, KC13) were chosen as the surfactant molecules. The lyotropic mixtures, which were composed of KCx/potassium sulfate (K2SO4)/decanol (DeOH)/water/brucine, where brucine is a chiral dopant molecule, were studied. Partial phase diagrams were constructed to show how the surfactant alkyl chain affects the phase topologies in the phase diagrams. It was observed that the presence of a longer surfactant alkyl chain in the mixture favors the stabilization of the larger discotic cholesteric, Ch(D), and cholesteric biaxial, Ch(B), phase domains. The phase transitions from the uniaxial cholesteric to biaxial cholesteric phase were shifted to lower temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"The production of hydrogen by means of the photocatalytic decomposition of the water molecule and its use as an energy vector is one of the most important subjects of study at present, in addition, if in this process a TiO2-graphene catalyst system is used and the use of solar energy without the addition of any sacrificial agent, the subject is promising to develop a sustainable and environmentally friendly process. In many studies of the photocatalytic system based on carbon material, it is essential to use an agent that is sacrificed which, from an industrial point of view, detracts from its value, since the use of these chemicals to generate hydrogen from water becomes indispensable. In this study, the TiO2-graphene system is used in photocatalytic processes in the decomposition of the water molecule with the use of solar energy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"The current trend is the introduction of antimicrobial agents for the purpose of inhibiting or avoiding (adherence) adhesion and (increasing) the multiplication of their microorganisms on the surface of the impression materials. This study aims to determine the properties of antibacterial and antifungal elastic impression materials in full agreement with (bacterial flora) microflora specific for every patient ( with identification of existing species). In the same time there are considered modern methods of sterilization and insertion of antiseptics, trajectories with profound impact in the field of biocompatibility. The obtained microorganisms were transplanted on differentiated and selective (differentiated) culture medium in order to obtain pure cultures.Each microbial strain obtained was tested to identify several characteristics. The examinations carried out by means of the electron microscopy very accurately detect the microbial load in the structure of the impression materials, sounding an alarm signal on its use in particular clinical situations. Alginates present in their structure polysaccharide structures that represent an excellent substrate of microorganisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
