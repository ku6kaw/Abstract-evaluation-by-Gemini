J,"Hossain, MF",Fabrication of Nanosticks-Like CdS Sensitizer for the Application of Solar Cells,"The novelty of this work is to fabricate the Nanosticks (NSs) like CdS sensitizer on the surface of TiO2 electrode by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method with a very high vacuum annealed at 350 degrees C for 30 min. Whereas, nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes have been prepared on FTO (SnO2: F) glass by a spin-coating method with high purity (99.99%, Degussa P25) TiO2 powder. The surface of the CdS layer has been covered by NSs like structures which are confirmed by the scanning electron microscope image. The 100 nm of platinum-coated FTO substrate and polysulfide-based electrolyte are used to assemble the Gratzel Solar cell (GSC). The performance of solar cell (SC) based on NSs like CdS has been compared with the nanoparticles (NPs) based CdS sensitized SC, where CdS NPs has synthesized by CBD without any post-annealing. The efficiency of NSs like CdS sensitized SC exhibits 2.44%, which is 2 folds of the efficiency of the CdS NPs sensitized SC.

J,"Li, KD",The Influence of Process Parameters on the Morphological Characteristics by Directional Etching for Materials Nanoarchitectonics,"In nanoarchitectonics, the advanced technology of directional etching is highly demanded for the fabrication of modern electronic device with high anisotropy ratio of structures. To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle. The featured surface morphologies, including the pyramid, ripple, mounds and etch pits, are reproduced numerically, and these simulation results correspond well with the observations of directional etching experiments. This study provides the fundamental knowledge and detailed information for the advanced application of the directional etching technology.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17429,2,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes

J,"Vathani, AM; Dhanalakshmi, S; Jeyakumaran, N; Prithivikumaran, N",Fabrication of Al-TiO<sub>2</sub> Thin Film Electrode by Spray Pyrolysis Technique for Urea Sensing,A simple cost effective Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was fabricated for urea sensing. Urea is the key end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans. Increased level of urea leads to loss of kidney function. Thus determination of urea is important in analysis of kidney diseases. Al-TiO2 thin films were deposited with different concentration of Al by Spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the anatase phase of the Al-TiO2 thin films with tetragonal structure. A shift is observed in the XRD peak position compared to as prepared TiO2 thin film indicates the incorporation of Al ions into Ti ions. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study shows that the absorption increases and the absorption peak shifts towards the visible region for Al-TiO2 thin films compared with that of the as prepared TiO2 thin film. The optical band gap values changes with the change in the Al concentration in TiO2 thin films. The electrochemical analysis for optimized Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. CV studies of Al-TiO2 thin film electrode show the good stability and linearity which is essential to fabricate biosensor. The sensor response to urea is linear with correlation coefficient of 0.944 and the sensitivity is 3.17 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2).,10.1166/jnn.2020.17447,5,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no

The mechanical reliabilities of Sn58Bi and epoxy Sn58Bi solder were evaluated by the board-level drop test and the 3-point bend test after temperature-humidity storage testing. The microstructure and chemical composition of the solder joints were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The addition of epoxy in solder paste did not affect the morphology of the intermetallic compound. The thickness of the scalloped-shaped Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound of solder/OSP joint increased with aging time. The drop number until fail for the epoxy Sn58Bi/OSP joint was higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint; the average numbers of drops withstood by the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint and epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint following the reflow process were fewer than 10 drops and 180 drops, respectively. The drop number of solder/OSP joints decreased with increasing aging time. The result of the 3-point bend tests shows that the number of bend cycles for the epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint was 30 times higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint.

The hydrophobic surfaces covered with square pillar structures in the hexagonal array were prepared and the repulsive normal load and friction coefficient of the droplet were characterized. The force measurements in the vertical and lateral directions on the droplet confined between the prepared hydrophobic surfaces revealed that the compressive resistance to the vertical motion which is identical with the repulsive capillary force increases with deformation when the deformed droplet is horizontally symmetric. On the other hand, the friction coefficient of the squeezed droplet is inversely proportional to the repulsive capillary force. It was found that the reduced pressure acting on the solid-liquid interface results in the abnormal reduction in friction coefficient.

Using the Green function formalism with density matrix expressions, we analyze the SOT contributions from the Fermi-level and -sea electrons. We find that the intrinsic-SOC-induced inverse spin galvanic effect generates spin accumulations perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The anti-damping torque results purely from the Fermi-level contribution, while the field-like torque from both the Fermi-level and -sea contributions. At zero bias voltage, the SOT is symmetric with respect to the Fermi energy (i.e., an even function of the Fermi energy), whereas the presence of bias further introduces the anti-symmetric torque components. When the ferromagnet magnetization lies in the honeycomb plane, all Fermi-sea contributions disappear. The maximum SOT among different Fermi energies is also inspected. For large enough in-plane magnetization compared to the staggered potential, the field-like torque has a maximum at zero Fermi energy. When the magnetization is smaller than some value characterized by the intrinsic SOC, the maximum of the anti-damping torque occurs at the cross point of the two Dirac linear bands in the leads. More importantly, we find that the anti-damping torques responsible for magnetic switching as well as the torkance require staggered potential from an applied out-of-plane electric field, i.e., lattice buckling is essential to the switching. When the electric field is reversed, the anti-damping torque and the torkance are also reversed. Accordingly, full electric control of the SOTs can be realized in this buckled system.",10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165914,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the origin of phonon anomaly has remained ambiguous (i.e. longitudinal acoustic or transverse acoustic modes). We performed first-principles calculations to investigate the phononic properties of these materials and theoretically confirmed that the Kohn anomaly originates from the lower transverse acoustic mode along the ?X direction, thereby revealing the frequency derivative discontinuity of the mode. In particular, the Kohn anomaly region is found to move from the interior to the boundary X point of the Brillouin zone with increasing number of valence electrons. We deduced that the Kohn anomaly originated from the electrons of the filled energy level near the van Hove singularity. These results suggest that the screening of the ionic electric field decreases, while the coupling of conduction electrons with the highly degenerate modes between the TA and LA via Umklapp scattering process increases. The Fermi surface nesting also plays a role in enhancing the superconductivity.

J,"Giraldo, JC; Peña, NM; Ney, MM",Encoding the electrodynamics in spatiotemporal boundaries,"Maxwell's equations represented by differential operators describe the local dependence between both electric and magnetic fields in every location of space and time. This description responds to the field concept proposed by Michael Faraday and formalized by James Clerk Maxwell. The discretized version in the form of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique relies on a proposal of local computation of the respective differential operators making use of the central difference approximation of the second derivative of functions through the Taylor series expansion. This article introduces a novel time -symmetric ""non -local"" technique from the mathematical formalism of electromagnetic potentials in the wave equation and its physical interpretation in the Minkowski spacetime. In the proposed case study, the ""non-local"" proposal is 1643 faster than FDTD, i.e.,more than three orders of magnitude, and it uses a time-step that is 4096 times greater than the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy limit without encountering stability problems. New electromagnetic potentials are calculated from the previous and distant ones located at vertices of spatiotemporal regions called causal diamonds that tessellates spacetime without the need for computations inside them. We show that the performance gain is proportional to the size of the spacetime tessellations because the ratio ""domain to boundary"" increases as the domain extension does. Consequently, our novel ""non -local"" approach provides a reduction in computational complexity and a more comprehensible explanation of their fundamental physical aspects, without contradicting the principles of the successful classical field theory.

With this rule, we proposed a novel algorithm that allows encoding potentials along the characteristic lines that tessellate the spacetime.

It is observed that the doping energy is negative for dopant (N, P, S) into vacancy graphene at pyridinictype site, yet it is positive at graphitic-type site for pristine graphene. It could be inferred that the introducing process is exothermic reaction for defective graphene. Meanwhile, for the adsorption of C2H2 on the surface of defective graphene, we notice that C2H2 would prefer to be adsorbed at the top site of the doping atom and the adsorption energy increases with the introducing of dopants, indicating that the dopant would enhance the interaction between C2H2 and graphene.

The photogenerated current of the InZnO phototransistor at long light wavelength (>600 nm) was significantly improved by utilizing narrow bandgap MoS2 as the capping layer (1.3 eV). At lower wavelength, photocarriers are generated due to the optical absorption of both InZnO and MoS2 layers, whereas the latter ensures significant photocarrier generation even at the higher wavelength region of the visible spectrum. The photogenerated carriers subsequently transfer to the underlying InZnO layer of superior carrier mobility that has a high channel conduction of additional electrons from the optically-induced doubly positively charged oxygen vacancies (Vo(++)) where the gate field is screening, thereby leading to the higher photoconductive gain of the InZnO/MoS2 phototransistors. The dynamic photosensitivity behaviour of the aforesaid phototransistor reveals the presence of persistent photoconductivity (PPC) due to the oxygen vacancy associated with InZnO which can be removed by applying a reset gate pulse from -15 to +5 V. The optical properties of these phototransistors were further enhanced by replacing the opaque Ti/Au electrode by an ultrathin transparent Ti/Au electrode. Utilization of the transparent electrode results in enhanced electron injection from source to channel due to a reduced barrier height under illumination giving rise to a ten-fold improvement in the photocurrent and responsivity of the phototransistors. A position-dependent study of the photocurrent w.r.t beam position also reveals that the enhancement in photocurrent is strongly dependent on the position and is at its maximum when the beam is placed near the source region.",10.1088/1361-6528/ab4526,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As known, the ultrathin alumina mask (UTAM) surface nanopatterning technique allows the fabrication of periodic nanoparticle (NP) arrays with 5 nm gaps among the NPs, however, it still faces a significant challenge in realizing the reliable distribution of nanogaps over a large area, because of the unavoidable collapse of the UTAM pore wall during the traditional one-step homothermal pore-widening process. Herein, an efficient two-step poikilothermal pore-widening process was developed to precisely control the pore wall etching of a UTAM, enabling effectively avoiding the fragmentation of the UTAM and finally obtaining a large-scale UTAM with a pore wall thickness of about 5 nm.

J,"Bajars, J; Chappell, DJ",Modelling uncertainties in phase-space boundary integral models of ray propagation,"A recently proposed phase-space boundary integral model for the stochastic propagation of ray densities is presented and, for the first time, explicit connections between this model and parametric uncertainties arising in the underlying physical model are derived. In particular, an asymptotic analysis for a weak noise perturbation of the propagation speed is used to derive expressions for the probability distribution of the phase-space boundary coordinates after transport along uncertain, and in general curved, ray trajectories. Furthermore, models are presented for incorporating geometric uncertainties in terms of both the location of an edge within a polygonal domain, as well as small scale geometric fluctuations giving rise to rough boundary reflections. Uncertain source terms are also considered in the form of stochastically distributed point sources and uncertain boundary data. A series of numerical experiments is then performed to illustrate these uncertainty models in two-dimensional convex polygonal domains. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To our knowledge, laser-induced incandescence (LII) and extinction are used to characterize particulate emission at the exhaust for the first time because laser diagnostics are generally applied to laboratory flames, automotive engines and aeroengines. The 30-kW boiler was first characterized by temperature mapping in the combustion chamber and particle diameter analysis by scanning mobility particle sizer at the exhaust and inside the first combustion chamber for a better understanding of the running of this complex combustion system. Non-intrusive laser-based diagnostics including broadband LII, two-color LII and laser extinction excited at 1064 nm have been employed to study the particulate emissions at the exhaust of the boiler during the start-up and the steady-state phases of the boiler. The cross analysis of the experimental results obtained with the different diagnostics shows that particle size distributions, particles volume fractions and the temperature distribution are strongly dependent on the boiler cycle linked to the pellets loading. Laser extinction and LII-based methods provided complementary information about the particulate emissions. The LII technique probes incandescent soot particles formed during the combustion of pellets, while laser extinction detects both soot and non-incandescent particles (such as dust, fly ashes).",10.1007/s00340-019-7350-5,78,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

Their alternating current impedance characteristics, under various frequencies, were measured and studied as a function of temperature in the range 200 to 400 K. Both the real (Z') and imaginary (Z '') parts of the complex impedance were temperature dependent. It was apparent that the Z ''-Z' curve for all temperatures exhibited single semicircles. The center of these semicircles was below the Z' axis. With temperature increment, the diameter of the semicircles decreased. The characteristics of the semicircular curve indicated that the parallel resistance (R-p) and constant phase element (CPE) in parallel combination with the series resistance (R-s) should be appropriate for the equivalent electrical circuit model for the produced heterojunctions.

The results of current density-voltage (J-V) curves justified a large leakage current along with minimal response under illumination. A recombination process controls the mechanism for carrier portage in the zone of V <= 0.16 V, while a space-charge-limited current process governs the carrier portage mechanism in the circumstance of V value beyond 0.16 V. Frequency (f) dependent conductance (G/omega)-V and capacitance (C)-V curves were measured to extract the series resistance (R-s) and density of the interface state (N-ss). On the basis of extraction in the manner of Nicollian-Brews, the value of R-s rose with f abatement. With zero bias voltage applied, the value of R-s was 189.84 Omega at 2 MHz and rose to 715.10 Omega at 20 kHz.

Oxygen was introduced during the sputtering process to prevent the reduction of transmittance and the formation of nonstoichiometric compositions. The dependence of the optical and electrical properties of MTO thin films on the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio was systematically investigated. The transmittance of the MTO single layer (24 nm) at 550 nm gradually increased from 85.9% to 88.2% with an increase of the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio from 0% to 7.9%.

J,"Cojocaru, S",Surface adapted partial waves for the description of elastic vibrations in bilayered plates,"An approach is proposed in which the form of the partial waves in the decomposition of the displacement field is chosen in such a way that boundary conditions on the outer surfaces of a layered structure are matched exactly. So found basis functions are further used to solve for the remaining boundary conditions. Explicit analytic expressions for the vibration spectrum and normalized amplitudes of a free plate in the long wavelength regime are derived and their behavior in the full space of material parameters is discussed. Thus, it is found that properties of the fundamental flexural mode change in a strongly non-monotonous way. In particular, by increasing the thickness of added layer one may observe the same propagation velocity for up to three different values of layer thicknesses ratio. Existence of an important criterion based on the relative signs taken by the amplitudes on the outer surfaces in this regime is revealed. It allows to establish a clear correspondence between symmetric and antisymmetric solutions for a single layer and those for a bilayered plate. It is suggested that the criterion is not limited to case of two layers. Branches of the spectrum are classified accordingly and their evolution from long to short wavelength is discussed.

J,"Giannopoulou, A; Kounavis, P",Spectral-resolved two-light beam photoresponse spectroscopy to resolve and investigate different photogeneration processes in organic semiconductors,"A photocurrent spectroscopy employing two-color light excitation beams scanned at different photon energies is proposed to resolve and to investigate different photogeneration processes involving exciton dissociation and above bandgap excitations in organic semiconductors. The basic concept of this spectroscopy is based on the phenomenon of photoresponse enhancement (PE), recently observed in pentacene films. In this phenomenon, the photocurrent, generated with modulated probe-light creating excitons, undergoes enhancement under additional above bandgap bias-light excitation, which acts to facilitate exciton dissociation. In the proposed photocurrent spectroscopy, the excitation energies of probe-light producing photocurrent undergoing PE and those of the biaslight which can induce PE are specified. This allows us to resolve photogeneration via exciton dissociation, which is facilitated by above bandgap excitations, and the onset of the above bandgap excitations, which facilitate exciton dissociation in pentacene films. It is found that light excitation in the region of 1.77-2.43 eV generates excitons diffusing with a diffusion length of 50-80 nm, which is compatible with that of triplet excitons, to the pentacene-substrate interface where dissociate via electron transfer to positive donor-like traps. For light excitation exceeding 2.43 eV, above bandgap excitations become strong competing triplet exciton creation by singlet fission. These results can be explained if the singlet fission and the above bandgap excitations are mediated by charge transfer states with energy-dependent electron-hole separations.",10.1016/j.orgel.2019.105481,95,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"González, N; Sánchez, F; Roth, M; Etchegoyen, A",A muon-based observable for a photon search at 30-300 PeV,"The observation of an ultra-high energy photon component of the cosmic radiation is one of the open problems in Astroparticle Physics. The stringent theoretical and experimental upper limits to the photon flux above 100 TeV make the search of a weak photon signal in the vast hadronic cosmic ray background a challenging task. At these energies, photon primaries entering the atmosphere develop an extensive air shower which is driven by electromagnetic processes with a poor muon component. The muon content of the air showers is one of the most promising observables that could lead to the best possible discrimination between photons and hadronic cosmic rays. In this article, we define a parameter capable of quantifying the muon component while reducing the fluctuations due to the unknown lateral distribution of muons. We explain the different features of this observable using simulated air showers between 30 and 300 PeV. We show that a merit factor of 5 in the separation between photon and proton primaries and a photon signal efficiency of at least similar to 92% while rejecting 99.97% of the proton-initiated showers can be reached in the mentioned energy range of interest. This separation power can be achieved provided the shower features, specially the primary energy, are reconstructed sufficiently precise and without significant biases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Structurally, the linearized operators associated with these fronts have unstable essential spectrum-corresponding to instability of the spatially asymptotic states - and stable point spectrum-corresponding to stability of the transition profile of the front. We show that these waves are linearly orbitally asymptotically stable in appropriate exponentially weighted spaces. While the technical device of exponential weights allows us to accommodate the unstable essential spectrum of individual waves in our linear analysis, it does not shed light on the long-time pattern formation that is observed experimentally and in numerical simulations. To begin to address this issue, we consider a periodic array of unstable front and back solutions. While not an exact solution of the governing equation, this periodic pattern mimics experimentally observed phenomena. Our numerical experiments suggest that the convecting instabilities associated with each individual wave are damped as they pass through transition layers and that this stabilization mechanism underlies the pattern formation seen in experiments.

The optimum ratio of the channel width between p-type and n-type accumulation-mode varactors was investigated through the simulation in order to maximize a quality factor (Q-factor) of the tunable capacitor at the maximum capacitance (C-MAX) state. The number of composite-varactor unit in each branch was designed to be binary-weighted, and the total capacitance can vary linearly by digitally turning on and off both varactors. It was firstly implemented in 65-nm bulk CMOS process, and showed comparable tuning range, Q-factor, and harmonic distortion performances while reducing the silicon area by half and eliminating the MIM capacitor in comparison with the conventional SCA. In the measurement, the proposed tunable capacitor showed a Q-factor of 60.3 at C-MAX state and a tuning range of 2.8 at 2 GHz frequency band.

In the first two cases, which are Bravais lattices, we find that facets with the orientation favored in the equilibrium shape of isolated islands are most prone to this instability, while the analogous facet for the hexagonal lattice is the least unstable. We argue that this is due to a significant difference in the reconstructed/equilibrium versus the non-reconstructed edge energy for non-Bravais crystals. Surface/edge energy is typically modeled as a single-valued function of orientation. We put forward a simple geometric argument that suggests this picture is inadequate for crystals with a non-Bravais lattice structure. In the case of a hexagonally structured lattice, our arguments indicate that the non-reconstructed edge energy can be viewed as both discontinuous and multi-valued for a subset of orientations that are commensurate with the crystal structure.

Conditional sampling techniques confirm turbulent E x B-drifts as physical driving mechanism of radial fast ion transport, which features sub-, super- or quasi-diffusive regimes depending on the fast ion energy and propagation time. To address the question of how far local intermittency is associated with each regime, we analyze characteristics of time-intermittency on an extensive set of local fast ion time-series across all observed regimes. Modeling the time-average fast ion profiles as the result of a meandering smaller instantaneous beam allows us to predict the skewness of such time-series based on their time-average.

J,"Nawaz, M",Numerical study on the impact of variable diffusion co-efficients and chemical reaction on transport phenomenon in nonlinear axisymmetric flow,"In this article, conservation laws, temperature dependent viscosity, thermal conductivity and mass diffusion models are used for mathematical modeling of flow of Casson fluid induced by nonlinear axisymmetric stretching sheet exposed to non-uniform magnetic field. Mathematical models are solved by finite element method. Convergence is ensured and grid independent analysis is performed. Several numerical simulations are executed to investigate the behavior of velocity, temperature and concentration under the variation of parameters. The impact of viscous dissipation, Joule heating, variation of viscosity and thermal conductivity is investigated through numerical simulations. The developed computer program is tested by comparing with computed results. The intensity of applied magnetic field and Joule heating are directly proportional to each other and an increase in the intensity of magnetic field causes an increase in the temperature. A rise in viscosity due to a rise in temperature has remarkable impact on both velocity and temperature. However, an increase in thermal conductivity (due to rise in temperature) results a significant increase in the temperature as conduction of heat from hot surface into the fluid speeds up. The wall heat flux increases when intensity of the magnetic field is increased.",10.1088/1402-4896/ab4853,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our numerical results demonstrate the presence of three distinguished regimes of transverse light expansion at different propagation distances. At short propagation distance, the Kerr-type nonlinearity are dominated and results in the transverse localization of light through the self-trapping mechanism. Radiation loss, causes the light escape from the injected guides, affect the light expansion in middle distance via broadening the light beam width. At longer distance the disorder terms led to the transverse localization of light, again. Also, we compared the propagation of light in edge and middle modes in the presence of the above effects. Our results show that the propagation distance of first localized regime for edge modes is larger than the middle modes since the edge modes can exchange energy with one of the left or right waveguides, while for middle modes there are two ways for energy exchange. Therefore the discrete diffraction can be diminished the nonlinear effects in middle modes faster than the edge modes.",10.1007/s11082-019-2110-7,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These photocathodes are robust against laser irradiation and RF fields, are easy to handle, and have longevity. The surface cleaning of photocathodes is essential to improve and maintain their quantum efficiency (QE) in an RF gun cavity. In this paper, we propose a backside electron-beam irradiation heating technique as an in situ surface-cleaning procedure for photocathodes in an RF gun cavity. In the proposed technique, thermal electrons accelerated by a DC electric field are irradiated from the back of the photocathode, and their beam power is converted to heat, thereby heating the photocathode. Unlike other surface-cleaning techniques, surfaces of any cathode shape can be cleaned uniformly using this heating method. We designed and developed a cathode plug that includes the proposed heating system for large-diameter (similar to 8 mm) photocathodes. Thermal simulation of the entire system, including the photocathode and its holding structure, and RF simulation of the choke structure for preventing the leakage of RF power were performed. The developed heating system was installed in an RF gun in High Energy Accelerator Research Organization KEK and subjected to RF aging and beam commissioning. From the results of beam commissioning, it was found that the QE of the photocathode increased to approximately 2.5 times the initial value due to the in situ annealing in the RF gun cavity.",10.1016/j.nimb.2019.10.023,124,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

Gels are both ubiquitous in nature and widely applied in engineering applications. In this work, we develop a physics-based dynamic theory to investigate the tunable wave propagation properties of gels. Gels are soft and can generate large deformation. The constitutive relation takes account the coupled large deformation and diffusion of gels. The dynamic governing equations take account the relative motions between the polymer network and solvent, which leads to a pressure diffusion wave similar to the ""slow pressure wave"" in the classical Biot's poroelastodynamics. It is different from the pressure wave in pure solid or pure liquid. The phase velocity, group velocity and attenuation coefficient are analyzed at different frequencies and propagating directions for both pressure wave and shear wave. We show that the wave propagation properties of gels are not only related to the material properties including the crosslink density and the interaction property between solvent and polymer, but also can be tuned by different mechanical loading conditions and chemical stimuli. It is also predicted that the constrained swollen gel exhibits anisotropic wave propagation properties, which leads to the splitting of the pressure wave and shear wave propagating through it.

The technique is based on the experimental gate-to-source or gateto-drain capacitance-voltage (C-GS-V-GS or C-GD-V-GD) characteristics of FETs. As the gate bias (V-G) increases, the effective channel length (L-eff) extends by the increased conductivity of the channel from the source or the drain. Due to trapped charges at the trap sites with a high density of traps along the channel, abrupt change in the C-V characteristics is observed. For the transition gate bias (V-G,V-t) with abrupt change in the C-V characteristics, the dominant trap location (X-t) can be converted through the channel conduction factor (alpha(V-G) to be the effective channel length L-eff(V-G) = alpha(V-G).L-ch). We expect that the proposed C-V technique to be useful in non-destructive electrical characterization of lateral trap locations (interface states, bulk traps, and/or grain boundary traps caused by the bias stress and/or fabrication process) along the channel in FETs.

However, the mechanism of the crystallinity improvement in C-60 overlayers remains to be fully elucidated. In this work, the surface (step and terrace structure) of pentacene films is investigated in terms of the terrace width using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to clarify the mechanism. We found that the terrace width becomes wider as the substrate temperature for pentacene film growth increases, and the terrace width becomes narrower as the thickness of pentacene films increases. In addition, we investigate the influence of the terrace width of pentacene underlayers on C-60 overlayers using AFM and X-ray diffraction. We found that pentacene underlayers with wide terraces increase the grain size and improve the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers. These findings indicate that growing pentacene underlayers with wider terraces allows for further enhancement in the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers, leading to higher quality pentacene/C-60 stacked heterostructures.",10.1016/j.tsf.2019.137638,144,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

Transitions between bound and free electron states determine basic plasma properties, yet the effects of degeneracy on these transitions have only been theorized. Here, we use an x-ray free electron laser to create and characterize a degenerate plasma. We observe a core electron fluorescence spectrum that cannot be reproduced by models that ignore free electron degeneracy. We show that degeneracy acts to restrict the available electron energy states, thereby slowing the rate of transitions to and from the continuum. We couple degeneracy and bound electron dynamics in an existing collisional-radiative code, which agrees well with observations. The impact of the shape of the cross section, and hence the magnitude of the correction due to degeneracy, is also discussed.

The measurements of thermal cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C and 24-hour temperature cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C withstanding the effects of 20-hour penetration of 85 degrees C were carried out in CdS/CdTe solar cells with structures of FTO/CdS/CdTe/Au, FTO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, and FTO/MZO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, respectively. The performances of these cells before and after the thermal aging experiments were investigated by using light and dark I-V together with C-V. The results reveal varied performance degradation before and after thermal aging in the cells with different structures. Among these, the most deteriorated device is the one without back contact (BC), whose efficiency decreased by 25.12% after thermal cycling accompanying an obvious roll-over phenomenon when forward bias was greater than open circuit voltage.

J,"Tucker, RW; Walton, TJ; Arrayás, M; Trueba, JL",A new paradigm for the dynamics of the early Universe,"This paper invokes a new mechanism for reducing a coupled system of fields (including Einstein?s equations without a cosmological constant) to equations that possess solutions exhibiting characteristics of immediate relevance to current observational astronomy. Our approach is formulated as a classical Einstein-vector-scalar-Maxwell-fluid field theory on a spacetime with three-sphere spatial sections. Analytic cosmological solutions are found using local charts familiar from standard LFRW cosmological models. These solutions can be used to describe different types of evolution for the metric scale factor, the Hubble, jerk and de-acceleration functions, the scalar spacetime curvature and the Kretschmann invariant constructed from the Riemann?Christoffel spacetime curvature tensor. The cosmological sector of the theory accommodates a particular single big-bang scenario followed by an eternal exponential acceleration of the scale factor. Such a solution does not require an externally prescribed fluid equation of state and leads to a number of new predictions including a current value of the ?jerk? parameter, ?Hopfian-like? source-free Maxwell field configurations with magnetic helicity and distributional ?bi-polar? solutions exhibiting a new charge conjugation symmetry. An approximate scheme for field perturbations about this particular cosmology is explored and its consequences for a thermalisation process and a thermal history are derived, leading to a prediction of the time interval between the big-bang and the decoupling era. Finally it is shown that field couplings exist where both vector and scalar localised linearised perturbations exhibit dispersive wave-packet behaviours. The scalar perturbation may also give rise to Yukawa solutions associated with a massive Klein?Gordon particle. It is argued that the vector and scalar fields may offer candidates for ?dark-energy? and ?dark-matter? respectively.",10.1088/1361-6382/ab4ecc,154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, polarization may be induced in the surface due to the surface dangling bonds. In this work, using the average local dipole evaluated by maximally localized Wannier functions, we investigated polarization properties of these two surfaces layer-by-layer. It is found that a remarkable polarization which is more than eight times that of the bulk, is induced on these two surfaces. Moreover, we found that the polarization oscillates around the bulk value in the inner surface layers, and quickly approaches to the bulk value at a depth of four layers. Such polarization variation was further analyzed from the viewpoints of atomic rearrangement and charge transfer. Thus (1010)$(10\bar{1}0)$(101 over bar 0) and (1120)$(11\bar{2}0)$(112 over bar 0) surfaces are actually not completely non-polar facets, but rather non-polar bulk core combined with polar surface layers which would potentially affect the surface properties.

We find that the QED background is huge in the whole phase space region; however, it can be largely reduced when a suitable kinematic cut condition on p(J/psi) and theta(J/psi) is implemented, where p(J/psi) is the momentum of J/psi and theta(J/psi) is the angle between J/psi and the e(+)e(-) beam. In the range of pi/9 < theta(J/psi) < 8 pi/9 and P-J/psi > 3 GeV, the cross section of the QED background is of the same order as that of the QCD contribution.

J,"Morice, C; Kopp, T; Kampf, AP",Nonunique connection between bulk topological invariants and surface physics,"At the heart of the study of topological insulators lies a fundamental dichotomy: Topological invariants are defined in infinite systems but surface states as their main footprint only exist in finite systems. In the slab geometry, namely, infinite in two planar directions and finite in the perpendicular direction, the 2D topological invariant was shown to display three different types of behavior. The perpendicular Dirac velocity turns out to be a critical control parameter discerning between different qualitative situations. When it is zero, the three types of behavior extrapolate to the three 3D topologically distinct phases: trivial, weak, and strong topological insulators. We show analytically that the boundaries between types of behavior are topological phase transitions of particular significance since they allow us to predict the 3D topological invariants from finite-thickness transitions. When the perpendicular Dirac velocity is not zero, we identify a new phase with surface states but no band inversion at any finite thickness, disentangling these two concepts which are closely linked in 3D. We also show that at zero perpendicular Dirac velocity, the system is gapless in the 3D bulk and therefore not a topological insulating state, even though the slab geometry extrapolates to the 3D topological phases. Finally, in a parameter regime with strong dispersion perpendicular to the surface of the slab, we encounter the unusual case that the slab physics displays nontrivial phases with surface states but nevertheless extrapolates to a 3D trivial state.",10.1103/PhysRevB.100.235427,158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Negative transformation enthalpies were introduced to obtain reliable values for the formation enthalpy of halides. Formation enthalpies of halides are computed within 25 kJ/mol.at and their molar volumes are underestimated by 20%. The MAM provides better estimates than models using Palling electronegativity or Born-Haber cycle calculations assuming an ionic lattice of the Born-Haber type.

The evolution of the collision cascade as well as the defects generated in the nanotube were studied using molecular dynamics simulation. We found that point defects and stacking faults were induced by the cascade. The interior surface of the nanotube acts as the sinks to absorb the point defects as the same as the exterior surface does, especially when the distance between them is decreased. Consequently, both the two surfaces influence the time evolution and the residual number of point defects in the nanotubes. In the gold nanotubes with fixed external diameter, the number of interstitials is decreased with the internal diameter increasing, while the number of vacancies does not show a clear trend with the variation of the internal diameters. The probability of formation of stacking faults is higher in gold nanotubes with larger internal diameters which caused by the fact that the formation of stacking faults is facilitated by the interior surface. The results show that, due to the specific geometry of the nanotubes, the evolution and the production of the cascade-induced damage has its own features.",10.1016/j.nimb.2019.09.029,169,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

J,"Trofimov, VA; Trykin, EM",Enhancement of ABCs efficiency at computer simulation of optical pulse interaction with inhomogeneous nonlinear medium,"We focus our attention on enhancing of computation performance at numerical simulation of a laser pulse interaction with inhomogeneous nonlinear medium (optical periodic structure or photonic crystal) which is described in the framework of 1D Schrodinger equation without using slowly varying envelope in spatial coordinate. It allows taking into account the optical pulse reflection from medium inhomogeneous. In practice, as a rule at computer simulation the domain size before photonic crystal is many times greater than the photonic crystal size. Decreasing this domain one can essentially increase a computation performance. This aim is achieved by re-statement of the problem: instead of initial distribution of complex amplitude along spatial coordinate before the photonic crystal we consider its specifying as a boundary condition (BC), which results in the pulse propagation in both directions of the propagation axis. Taking this into account and that a part of a laser pulse reflects from faces of photonic crystal layers, we use the artificial boundary conditions (ABCs). To avoid an influence of waves propagated in negative direction of spatial coordinate on the laser pulse interaction in photonic crystal (this influence appears due to imperfection of ABC). We introduce in consideration some number of artificial waves related with the equation under consideration. With this aim, firstly, we provide a computation of the laser pulse propagation in a linear medium and storage the complex amplitude values at chosen section of a coordinate, along which a laser light propagates. Then we use this complex amplitude values as a left boundary condition for 1D nonlinear Schrodinger equation in domain containing a nonlinear photonic crystal. To decrease amplitude of the wave reflected from artificial boundaries. We demonstrate also that instead of a complex amplitude values storage one can use the corresponding analytical expression for the linear Schrodinger equation solution, corresponding to a laser pulse propagation in a linear domain before the photonic crystal. We discuss also various ways for full transform of the optical pulse energy for reflected wave into artificial waves. This results essentially increasing of computation efficiency.

The variations of surface supersaturation with thin layer height, bulk supersaturation and rotation rate are analyzed. The results show that keeping still is very unfavorable for the growth of thin layer, a certain rotation rate should be applied to the Z-cut plate to increase the concentration gradient across the (0 0 1) face, thus making sure that thin layers can grow from the edges while small pyramids barely grow from the face center. Given the result that end faces of thin layers nearly bear a bulk supersaturation, a relative low bulk supersaturation will be better to ensure both the growth of thin layers and the good surface uniformity brought by low supersaturation. Moreover, as thin layers grow, rotation rate should be increased to make up the insufficient solute supply resulting from the decreasing linear speed.

J,"Wu, L",A fast spectral method for the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation for quantum gas mixtures: Homogeneous relaxation and transport coefficients,"A fast spectral method (FSM) is developed to solve the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation for quantum gas mixtures with generalized differential cross-sections. The computational cost of the proposed FSM is 0 (Mdv-1 Ndv+1 log N), where d(v) is the dimension of the problem, Mdv-1 is the number of discrete solid angles, and N is the number of frequency nodes in each direction. Spatially-homogeneous relaxation problems are used to demonstrate that the FSM conserves mass and momentum/energy to the machine and spectral accuracy, respectively. Based on the variational principle, transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion are calculated by the FSM, which agree well with the analytical solutions. Then, the FSM is applied to find the accurate transport coefficients through an iterative scheme for the linearized quantum Boltzmann equation. The shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of three-dimensional quantum Fermi and Bose gases interacting through hard-sphere potential are calculated. For Fermi gas, the relative difference between the accurate and variational transport coefficients increases with fugacity; for Bose gas, the relative difference in thermal conductivity has similar behavior as the gas moves from the classical to degenerate limits, but the relative difference in shear viscosity decreases when the fugacity increases. Finally, the viscosity and diffusion coefficients are calculated for a two-dimensional equal-mole mixture of Fermi gases. When the molecular masses of the two components are the same, our numerical results agree with the variational solutions. However, when the molecular mass ratio is not one, large discrepancies between the accurate and variational results are observed; our results are reliable because (i) the method does not rely on any assumption on the form of velocity distribution function and (ii) the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy density satisfies the minimum bound predicted by the string theory.

This type of product, however, can suffer from syneresis: densification due to the expulsion of fluid. Gaining insight into the physical principles governing syneresis in such soft hybrid dispersions remains a challenge from a theoretical perspective, as experimental data are needed to establish a basis. We record non-accelerated syneresis in a model system for low-fat mayonnaise: a colloid polymer mixture, consisting of oil in water emulsion with starch in the aqueous phase. We find the flow rate of expelled fluid to be proportional to the difference in hydrostatic pressure over the system. The osmotic pressure of the added starch, while being higher than the hydrostatic pressure, does not prevent syneresis because the soluble starch is lost to the expelled fluid.

J,"Levit, R; Ochoa, DA; Martinez-Garcia, JC; García, JE",Evidence for a dynamics crossover and its implication on the freezing temperature determination of relaxor ferroelectrics,"Relaxor ferroelectrics are characterized by a broadened and dispersive permittivity peak in their temperature-dependent dielectric spectra. Although several models have been proposed to explain the nature of these materials, understanding their relaxation dynamics still remains open and requires additional theoretical and experimental explanations. Particularly, a precise determination of the freezing temperature still remains controversial because the influence of dynamic ruptures at temperatures approaching the freezing states (dynamic crossovers) has never evaluated before. In this paper, a model-free approach for describing the super-Arrhenius behaviour in glassy systems is validated for relaxor ferroelectrics. As a result, a predicted dynamic change at a specific temperature (crossover temperature) is evidenced by a derivative-based representation of the relaxation time data. The Stickel function is suggested as a more straightforward but model-dependent method for obtaining the dynamic crossover temperature. Furthermore, the divergence (freezing) temperature is obtained on the basis of the Gruneisen-style activation energy temperature index without assuming any model equation for parameterizing the relaxation data. The influence of the dynamic change occurrences on the freezing temperature determination is also considered, showing that the dynamic crossover temperature determination is a key factor for a proper finding of the freezing temperature in relaxor ferroelectrics.",10.1088/1361-6463/ab43b2,189,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Morozumi, T; Shimizu, Y; Umeeda, H; Yuu, A",Hidden relations in three generation seesaw model with Dirac mass matrix of four-zero texture,"We present predictions for CP violating phases of the Type-I seesaw model with four-zero textures on the Dirac mass matrix. For the four-zero textures, the effective low energy Majorana mass matrix is parametrized with seven parameters. They are three mass-dimensional parameters, two angles and two CP violating sources. The number of these parameters is less than that of the general description of the Majorana mass matrix with three neutrino masses, three mixing angles and three CP violating phases. In particular, only two independent CP violating sources give rise to three CP violating phases. The efficient and comprehensive method is proposed in this paper to investigate four-zero textures in Type-I seesaw. We numerically show the possible range of CP violating phases in the plane of a Dirac CP violating phase and one of Majorana phases. Some cases show the strong correlations among two phases. These correlations can be explained by hidden relations among the elements of Majorana matrix with the fourzero textures. The hidden relations are classified according to the position of one vanishing off-diagonal element of Majorana mass matrix. The Majorana mass matrix all of whose elements are non-vanishing also produces other hidden relations particularly in the case of four-zero textures. By applying the hidden relations, we describe the concrete correlations among CP violating phases.

In particular, we consider the task of coarse-graining rigid bodies in the context of generalized multipole potentials that have controllable levels of accuracy relative to their atomistic counterparts. We show how the multipole framework yields a hierarchy of models that systematically connects a CG ""point molecule"" approximation to the exact dynamics. We use these results to understand when and how the CG models fail to describe atomistic dynamics at the trajectory level and develop asymptotic error estimates for approximate molecular potential energies. Implications for other model-reduction strategies are also discussed.

Therefore, the ultimate efficiency of combined lasers will be affected if no compensation measure is taken in some typical systems such as high energy system. Based on the model of array lasers with incoherent combination, laser propagation in atmosphere is simulated by generating a random atmospheric turbulence phase screen to modulate the phase of the laser beam. The distorted wavefront of atmospheric turbulence is divided according to the array distribution. The phase generated by tilt aberration coefficient which is solved by the method of fitting sub-wavefront data is eliminated in the phase of sub-beam, which simulates the process of correcting tilt aberration. The simulation results show that comparing with the case of tilt aberration, the power in the bucket (PIB) and the Strehl rate (SR) of combined lasers focusing in far-field are improved when the tilt aberration influenced by the same atmospheric turbulence phase screen is corrected. At the same time, coherence length ranging from 4 cm to 45 cm is used to characterize atmospheric turbulence of different intensities. At each coherent length, the PIB and SR are calculated when the distances of propagation of lasers are 2 km and 3 km, separately. The simulation results show that although PIB and SR before and after tilt aberration are corrected, they become worse with the decrease of coherence length, and PIB and SR are improved more obviously when tilt aberration is corrected in stronger turbulence. An experiment in the case of 2 km is carried out by using a prototype of incoherent combination, and the data are obtained by measuring the focused spot at the target. The measurement results confirm that the correcting of tilt aberration can improve the beam quality of array lasers with incoherent combination in far-field. In summary, the research conducted in this work can obtain tilt aberration accurately and the corresponding method of correction is easy to implement, which can provide supporting data for improving the performances high energy laser systems.",10.7498/aps.68.20190961,208,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

More importantly, we demonstrate that hole injection can affect the core structure, increase the mobility, and eventually trigger a spontaneous mutual annihilation, which could be employed as a possible facile way to reduce the dislocation density.",10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b02918,214,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Yamashita, K; Hanasaki, K; Ando, A; Kinoshita, T",Phase coherence of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical antidot lattice,"We report on the experimental investigation of the phase coherence of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical antidot lattice (ADL). In the ADL, a series of potential hills are arranged on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice and crisscrossing channels with zero ac Stark shift form a 2D mesh with multiple junctions. Due to these structural features, matter wave interference released from the ADL is clearly visible even at antidot heights of the 300 times the photon recoil energy. However, phase coherence is significantly reduced at extremely tall antidot heights and atom hopping is suppressed. We explain this loss of coherence by introducing a periodic effective potential felt by the atoms on the mesh lines, which is the result of the quantization of the faster atomic motion in the orthogonal direction. This effective potential localizes atoms at the junctions, forming a bundle of tubelike gases. Using the Bose-Hubbard model, we interpret the coherence properties in terms of a 2D Josephson junction array. We have also observed the emergence of vortexlike holes after merging the tubelike gases. We discuss the effect of transverse thermal phase fluctuations and interpret the appearance of the vortexlike holes as a possible signature of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless crossover in the 2D lattice plane.",10.1103/PhysRevA.100.063611,215,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

Using a set of vibrating wires as a turbulence generator and vortex detectors, we measured the distribution of times of flights between the generator and the detectors for emission directions parallel and perpendicular to the vibration direction of the generator wire. We find that the times exhibit a single exponential distribution for emissions in both directions, indicating temporally random emission of vortex rings with a single mean emission rate. When a limit is set on the detection diameter of the vortex rings, the detection times exhibit a double exponential distribution for the perpendicular direction for ring diameters above 10 mu m, suggesting that large vortex rings reach the detector with a high rate emission at later times. In the parallel emission direction, the emission rate during an equilibrium state exhibits a power law behavior with a minimum diameter of detected vortex rings, implying that a vortex tangle generated by an oscillating object has a self-similar structure of vortex lines.",10.1007/s10909-019-02285-5,217,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,

When the high power laser is injected into silver spherical hohlraum, the high temperature radiation source formed in the hohlraum can drive the high velocity blast wave in the laboratory to study various astrophysical phenomena such as supernova remnants, stellar jets, etc. As the basis of laser driven blast wave experiments, the first experimental results of energy coupling and partitioning of silver spherical hohlraum with one laser entrance hole (LEH) on Shenguang III prototype laser facility are introduced in this work. Four beams with 3.2 kJ of laser energy in a 1ns square laser pulse from the upper hemisphere are used to heat the silver spherical hohlraum targets. The silver spherical hohlraum targets are 800 mu m-diameter and 650 mu m-diameter LEH, and are fabricated by electroforming silver onto an acrylic mandrel. The laser coupling and partitioning to the targets are investigated by using the optical and X-ray diagnostics. The experimental results show that the radiation temperature is beyond 240 eV, the laser-to-X-ray conversion efficiency of silver hohlraum is 0.68 and the silver albedo is 0.83. With the driving of the high temperature radiation source, most of laser energy is coupled to the residual shell, and the high velocity blast wave can be generated. The laser energy not coupled to the target is lost through scattering light, emitting hot electrons and radiating X-rays. The experimental results show that the fraction of energy lost due to the scattering light is 15%, that due to emitting the total hot electrons is less than 1%, almost 30% of the laser energy is lost from the LEH by radiating the X-ray flux, almost 9% of the laser energy leaks from the spherical shell consisting of the 5.6 mu m-thick Ag layer and 10 mu m-thick CH layer through the X-ray radiation flux, and 45% of the laser energy is converted into the kinetic energy and internal energy of the remaining spherical shell. Therefore, more than 50% of the laser energy will be used to drive the high velocity blast wave in the subsequent experiments. After 950 ps, the silver plasma is concentrated in the center of the silver spherical hohlraum, which does not affect the injection of 1ns laser.

A simultaneous analysis of low-frequency data and ionosonde data allowed us to conclude that the difference in the main parameters of the polarization spectrum at two stations is due to the appearance of sporadic E-s layers having a nonuniform horizontal intensity distribution with characteristic scales of the order of the base between stations. A difference in the depth of variations in the polarization parameter epsilon was also found during the ionosphere recovery after magnetic storms.

The target space is argued to be two dimensional and flat, and its orthogonal directions are physically interpreted.

J,"Halder, S; Samaddar, S; Purkait, K; Purkait, M",Effect of Projectile Charge State on Electron Emission Spectra from He Atom,"The single ionization of He atom by the impact of highly charged dressed projectile nucleus is investigated by applying the three-body formalism of three-Coulomb wave (3CW) model and the first Born approximation (FBA). In the 3CW formalism, the interaction between the dressed projectile and the active electron is represented by a model potential containing both the long-range and short-range part of the Coulomb potential. The target is treated as a one-electron atom, where the interaction of the active electron with the rest of the target is represented by a similar type of model potential. The correlated motion of each pair of particles, interacting through long-range Coulomb potential, is taken into account in the final state. In addition, an independent particle model and a single-zeta Roothaan-Hartree-Fock 1s wavefunction, describing helium in its ground state, is used to carry out the calculations, where the effective charge of the target nuclei is obtained from the initial orbital energy. The energy distributions of the double-differential cross sections (DDCS) at low and intermediate energy electron emission from helium atom have been investigated. Our theoretical results are compared with both the available experimental measurements and theoretical calculations using other methods. There is good overall agreement of the present calculations with experimental data except for low-energy electron emission (less than 10 eV). For target ionization by a dressed projectile, we find that the cross sections depend on the projectile charge. For distant collisions involving high energy ions, the primary effect of bound projectile electrons is to screen the projectile nuclear charge, thereby reducing the strength of the interaction potential. Finally, the energy distribution of DDCS ratio at different angles has also been studied.",10.1007/s13538-019-00712-2,238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The direct correlation function of a hardcore potential is assumed to be represented by A Mayer function instead of THE one used in the Random Phase Approximation and Mean Spherical Approximation.

J,"Pagano, A; Pagano, EV",A note on Lorentz transformations and simultaneity in classical physics and special relativity,"Since early models of wave propagation in both stationary and moving media during the nineteenth century, the Lorentz transformation (LT) has played a key role in describing characteristic wave phenomena, e.g., the Doppler shift effect. In these models LT connects two different events generated by wave propagations, as observed in two reference systems and the synchronism is absolute. In relativistic physics LT implements the relativity principle. As a consequence, it connects two space-time event coordinates that both correspond to the same physical event and ""absolute synchronization"" is not allowed. The relativistic interpretation started from Einstein's early criticism of the notion of ""simultaneity"" and Minkowski's invariance of the space-time interval. In this paper, the two different roles of LT, i.e., in classical wave propagation theories and in relativistic physics, are discussed. Einstein's early criticism is also re-examined with respect to LT in view of its significance for the notion of simultaneity. Indeed, that early criticism is found to be defective. Our analysis is also useful for general readers in view of its impact on modern speculations about the existence of a preferred system of reference sigma, where light propagation is isotropic, and related implications.",10.1140/epjh/e2019-90058-4,240,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Uniform noise with mean zero and amplitude eta is introduced to uniform nearest neighbour coupling of value unity. Disordered averages of thermodynamic quantities are calculated from 100 disordered realizations for each transverse field reading. We show that the system exhibits distinct behaviour of ordered and disordered state separated at eta 1.0. For eta less than or similar to 1.0, thermodynamic behaviour of the system gradually deviates from pure quantum Ising model. For eta > 1.0 system exhibits highly fluctuating thermodynamic behaviour. Edward-Anderson order parameters are calculated and shown to be much less fluctuating and suitable as an order parameter for eta > 1.0. Qualitative behaviour of the system is not affected by finite-size effect and replacing the fluctuation with normally distributed noise. Finally, for noise level between eta = 1.0 and 1.5, the system exhibits a faster phase transition and enhances transverse magnetization before the critical point. For certain ranges of noise amplitude before the critical point, the quantum fluctuations are amplified.

Time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can determine the percent of each electronic transition contributing into a specific molecular transition between ground and excited states. This scheme, however, ignores electronic correlation during the transitions, which of crucial importance for correcting the difference energies between MO levels.

The corresponding single-excited molecular orbitals (SEMO) are employed to calculate the intensities of absorption peaks of a well-known OLED molecule Alq(3). First, TDDFT is used to simulate the molecule and to obtain its MOs and it is shown that TDDFT is capable to track the dominant electronic transitions and their specific MOs responsible for the optical process, and so, it provides a reliable basis for calculations of SEMO.

J,"Campos, LMBC; Silva, MJS; Moleiro, F",On Alfven wave propagation along a circle on dipolar coordinates,"The multipolar representation of the magnetic field has, for the lowest-order term, a magnetic dipole that dominates the far field. Thus the far-field representation of the magnetic field of the Earth, Sun and other celestial bodies is a dipole. Since these bodies consist of or are surrounded by plasma, which can support Alfven waves, their propagation along dipole magnetic field lines is considered using a new coordinate system: dipolar coordinates. The present paper introduces multipolar coordinates, which are an example of conformal coordinates; conformal coordinates are orthogonal with equal scale factors, and can be extended from the plane to space, for instance as cylindrical or spherical dipolar coordinates. The application considered is to Alfven waves propagating along a circle, that is a magnetic field line of a dipole, with transverse velocity and magnetic field perturbations; the various forms of the wave equation are linear second-order differential equations, with variable coefficients, specified by a background magnetic field, which is force free. The absence of a background magnetic force leads to a mean state of hydrostatic equilibrium, specified by the balance of gravity against the pressure gradient, for a perfect gas or incompressible liquid. The wave equation is simplified to a Gaussian hypergeometric type in the case of zero frequency, otherwise, for non-zero frequency, an extended Gaussian hypergeometric equation is obtained. The solution of the latter specifies the magnetic field perturbation spectrum, and also, via a polarisation relation, the velocity perturbation spectrum; both are plotted, over half a circle, for three values of the dimensionless frequency.",10.1017/S0022377819000837,264,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no

The values of the specific heat (at the magnetic phase transition temperature T-N) increase with the increasing of the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g.

The areas obtained by the FDM, from selected absorption lines, were used as input for a multidimensional method of data analysis. This procedure was applied in a NMR-based metabolomics investigation. In FDM, instead of spectra, the absorption peaks' specification, such as central frequency, line width, amplitude and relative phases, are estimated and the spectra are built using this information. Therefore, one can select the lines by width and intensity to exclude the broad lines such as baseline, solvent line and albumin peak. Also lines with small amplitude such as noise can be excluded from the spectra. Moreover, the spectra do not suffer from aliasing or baseline problems. These characteristics are fundamental in the metabolomics investigations. To show the superiority of our method over the standard FFT to obtain the spectra, we reconstructed the spectra from simulated FID by both methods. As an example, this new approach is used to analyze the non-small cell lung cancer A549 exposed to different treatments and principal component analysis is used to compare the performance of both methods.",10.1007/s00723-019-01158-0,266,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

The output force of the traditional asymmetric microgripper is stable. However, its output displacement is small, typically half the output displacement of the symmetric microgripper. To solve these problems, in this study, we designed a large-displacement asymmetric microgripper. First, we calculated the relationship between the theoretical input and output variables based on their geometric relationship. Then, we analyzed the performance of the microgripper using finite element software. Lastly, we used a piezoelectric actuator as the input driver of the microgripper. The errors associated with the theoretical and simulated output displacements were 7.05% and 924%, respectively. At 150 V of driving voltage, the maximum output displacement was 224 pm, and the actual magnification was 11.2 times.

This prime-index relation provides estimates of the neutrino-nucleon cross sections valid across many decades of neutrino energy scales. The PeV data are from the recently published astrophysical nu(mu) + (nu) over bar (mu) rates in the IceCube detector as well as neutrino-nucleon cross section measurements.

The precursors with bithiazole were successfully prepared, their inorganic and organic parts were connected on molecular level. The DSC results indicated they would all exist in liquid phase at temperature ranging from 180 K to 280 K. The UV-VIS showed that a red shift of the main electronic transitions from 254 to 268 nm of PBSIBTHM to PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 14 (from 249 to 266 nm of PBSIBTMeM to PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 17).

Two different planar trap geometries were considered: the first is a One-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry in which the ions are trapped off-plane and the second is a Two-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry in which the ions are trapped in between the two sheets. Both DC and RF potentials were used to trap ions. The fields were tailored to obtain linear trapping fields in these two geometries. This was done by splitting the central electrode into segments and applying suitable DC potentials to them. The potentials were computed using a least square method. The simulations were carried out considering a printed circuit board (PCB) with a Teflon base.

Noise theories and the associated measurement techniques are a major issue for the emerging semiconductor technologies, the development of accurate computer-aided design (CAD) models, and the designing of low-noise circuits and systems. The conventional shot noise model usually satisfactorily describes the p-n junction noise in solid-state devices, such as diodes and transistors. It has proven to be very efficient for many different conventional and advanced semiconductor technologies. However, alterations may sometimes be needed as previous works indicate scenarios where this so-called shot noise exhibits deviations from the theory, which translates into some noise suppression. In this article, we report on alterations that look like low-frequency diffusion noise enhancement (unexpected noise increase). It occurs at low current levels, for many generic commercially available diodes and the p-n junctions in transistors. Therefore, we propose an appropriate electrical noise model that satisfies both the low-frequency noise experimental data and the electrical behavior of the devices observed from impedance spectroscopy. We also evaluate this model as the ambient temperature is varied. Finally, it is discussed how this model can be connected to the conventional van der Ziel shot noise model and a better insight on the possible origin of such diffusion noise enhancement is provided.",10.1109/TED.2019.2947693,294,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The Schottky behavior was transformed into Ohmic in the blended polymer. PSB was synthesized from the solution of polycondensation of terephthaloyl chloride (T) and 4-(4-hydroxybenzylideneamino)phenol (SB). The polymer showed good thermal stability with T-g of 312 degrees C as determined by thermal gravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry TGA-DSC and high molecular weight 3.5 x 10(5) (g/mol) with coiled conformation as determined by laser light scattering.

In blended polymers, the conduction across the junction was characterized by Schottky emission at low field and Poole-Frenkel emission at high field. The Schottky barrier height showed a small increase with temperature, which was attributed to reduction in the built up of image charge. The Schottky and Poole-Frenkel emission coefficients were also determined and Schottky emission coefficient agreed with the theoretical value, while Poole-Frenkel emission coefficient was small. In short, the metal-semiconductor junction was affected by the blending, while conduction within the polymer remained independent of PANI concentration.",10.1142/S0218625X19500720,297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This system contains ions (as radiators) close to the hot nano plasma spheres (HNPSs). Considering two separate models of the point radiated ions and applying the fluid dynamic equations and suitable Green's function, the optical resonance of HNPSs is declared. The thermal effects in HNPSs show that a series of optical resonances occur in the system and the dominant resonance frequencies depend on the plasma geometry, electron density, electron temperature. The resonance frequencies in the two different models are exactly identical. Also, a new type of resonance frequency (subsidiary resonance frequencies), resulting in the thermal effects, is seen by considering two radiators beside the HNPS and, in this case, due to the sign of the ion radiators with same strengths, the even or odd modes are excited, separately. In other words, the permissible resonance frequencies in colloidal nano sphere solutions are categorized into two principal types: dominant resonance frequencies and subsidiary resonance frequencies. In addition, the graphs of the scattering patterns and resonance frequencies of this problem are analyzed. All of the resonance frequencies are varied with the temperature so that decreasing the Debye length (temperature) of HNPSs decreases the resonant frequencies and changes the dominant color of the system.

Extensive physicochemical characterization of the resulting materials shows that solvothermally treated oxides present lower crystallite size and larger surface area, although without previous calcination these samples appear to have a higher degree of structural disorder. These differences are sharply reflected in the changes in photocatalytic activity for the removal of methylcyclohexane (MCH) and toluene vapours at relatively high concentrations. Thus, the best performance for MCH elimination is obtained with the photocatalysts prepared by calcination and subsequent solvothermal treatment. Following this procedure, the resulting Ti1-xZrxO2 material presents larger surface area and high Zr surface concentration with minimal disturbance of the anatase structure.

Metallic molybdenum as well as MoO3 were used as precursors while the sulfurization was performed by chemical vapor deposition. A multi-technique characterization was employed to fully describe the deposition of molybdenum as well as its sulfurization. Thus, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning electron and atomic force microscopies indicated that the molybdenum layers were completely transformed in MoS2.

J,"Iliev, N; Trivedi, AR",Low-Power Sensor Localization in Three-Dimensional Using a Recurrent Neural Network,"This letter discusses a novel low-power circuit to self-localize a mobile sensor node in the three-dimensional space using a passive optical receiver. Self-localization of sensors, where a sensor node computes its spatial location by itself, reduces transmission demand, and improves real-time conformity of mobile wireless sensor systems. Our approach forms an over-determined system of angles-of-arrival (AoAs) to mobile sensor received from an optical anchor grid. The AoA system is solved with a linear program (LP) solver, which is implemented using a nonlinear feedback recurrent neural network. To solve the primal and dual LP optimization problems in the AoA system, we show a single multifunctional data path that does not require matrix inversions; thereby, enables within-sensor low-power computations to self-localize. Additionally, unlike other optical indoor positioning architectures, our approach does not require measurements of received signal strength and, thereby, is insensitive to power and alignment imbalances in the anchor grid. We show proof-of-concept field programmable gate array (FPGA) and ASIC simulations of our approach and validate its operation under noisy AoA data and for different numbers of anchors. An FPGA implementation in 180 nm CMOS achieves a peak similar to 0.12 mega localization operations per second per Watt (MOPS/W), while ASIC design in 45 nm CMOS shows a peak similar to 7.7 MOPS/W.",10.1109/LSENS.2019.2950335,312,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

As a result, the beam quality of amplified signal will become poor.

The numerical results show that the hybrid seeding OPA scheme can suppress the phase distortion transformation from pump to signal in both spatial and temporal domains. Consequently, the phase of output signal is well restored to its input state.

However, such side information is generally derived from users' explicit interactions, such as Twitter connections or trust lists, which is not always available in most scenarios. Alternately, obtaining such side information from users' implicit networks is easy. Thus, in this paper, we consider the similarity network for users' semantic locations, assuming that users with neighboring semantic locations have similar consumption habits. To demonstrate this, we evaluate our study in a practical scenario: the smartphone recommendation based on operator records. A novel recommendation paradigm is designed, which includes three key steps: discovery of semantic locations, hierarchical construction of the neighbor network, and items' popularity-based recommendation based on interpersonal similarities. The empirical results illustrate that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods (13% coverage improvement than models without introducing networks and about 5% higher than model with a call-log based network).

Previously, preliminary work in mice and in diabetic patients showed that Mn2 + ions could be used as a contrast agent to monitor the function of insulin-producing /3-cells by acting as a calcium analogue. Clinical translation of this work was hampered by a lack of available Mn contrast agents, but both mangafodipir and Mn gluconate are currently being used in clinical trials. As a first step towards using Mn in diabetic patients to monitor treatment or disease progression, we imaged the pancreas of healthy rats using mangafodipir, Mn gluconate and Mn chloride (as a control). The hypothesis was that Mn gluconate produces pancreatic enhancement similar to that seen previously with mangafodipir and Mn chloride, with greater enhancement following glucose challenge vs saline challenge. 18 Wistar rats were imaged at 7 T and normalised plateau pancreatic enhancement over baseline was compared for saline vs glucose challenge, calculated from a sigmoid fit to the enhancement curve. For saline vs glucose challenge, mean increases in plateau height +/- sd were: 22 +/- 18% for Mn chloride, 31 +/- 29% for mangafodipir and 41 +/- 17% for Mn gluconate. A paired t-test indicated that enhancement was greater for glucose vs saline (p = 0.01) and that there was no significant difference in the percentage enhancement between any of the compounds (p > 0.2). In conclusion, all three contrast agents produced similar enhancement, with greater plateau height under glucose challenge vs saline challenge.

It was further examined that the hollow electron beam radius over various sections of the BCU should not lead to beam-wave interaction, and if so, it should not propagate toward the interaction cavity. For this purpose, azimuthal electric field intensities in various azimuthally symmetric modes below the operating mode were plotted against the radial coordinate in various sections of the BCU and checked for the azimuthal electric field intensity values with the range of beam radius in the corresponding section. The electric field intensity maxima should be avoided within the range of beam radius in the corresponding section.

Rev. E 80 011106) in all considered dimensions, i.e. one, two, and four dimensions. Two disorder types were considered. First, while particle hopping on ordered sites is deterministic, hopping on disordered sites is subject to be stochastic, i.e. active particles on disordered sites hop to randomly selected neighboring sites. Second, disorder is assumed to be random dilution of lattice sites, i.e. particles cannot occupy disordered sites. The order parameter was found to be continuous for disorder of stochastic hopping, i.e. the first-order transition was rounded to the second-order transition for any small amount of disorder, whereas the transition remained first order but the critical exponent associated with the power law decrease of active-site densities varied for considerable amount of lattice site dilution.

J,"Liu, ZY; Zhang, WP; Cui, F; Gu, LT",Micro-manufacturing technology of a three-dimensional curved surface diamond structure for gyroscope applications,"A novel three-dimensional (3D) micro-manufacturing technology of a curved surface diamond structure used for a micro birdbath resonator gyroscope (mu-BRG) with integrated curved electrodes is presented. The integrated curved electrodes with the same curvature as the birdbath shell are embedded using a self-aligned process, which avoids the extra assembly process, ensures the symmetry and improves the driving capacity of the mu-BRG. The capacitive gap is defined by the sacrificial layer, and a uniform and small gap distance (2 mu m) between the curved electrodes and the birdbath shell is obtained. The mu-BRGs with a diameter of 1.2 mm and a thickness of 2 mu m have been demonstrated by employing boron-doped microcrystalline diamond films deposited using hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD). In this paper, the device structure and basic working principle of the gyroscope are described. The key steps in the fabrication process, such as isotropic wet etching of the bulk silicon for a birdbath mold, photoresist spray-coating for patterning the curved electrodes, and deposition and etching of diamond films, are considered in detail and well solved. The radial deviation of the etched birdbath mold is about 0.31% for the similar to 560 mu m radius shell and the surface roughness of the birdbath mold is favorable (Rq = 4.933 nm, Ra = 3.945 nm).

Radio frequency and inductively coupled pure oxygen plasma techniques were used to obtain the fine etched structures. A simple etching scheme describing the obtained results is presented for each type of plasma technique and mask type. Although the Al mask is widely believed to have outstanding properties over other metallic materials, we found that the Cu mask exhibits lower side edge etching for both types of plasma techniques. A formation of thick and crystalline copper oxide layer in contrast with thin amorphous aluminum oxide is believed to be the reason for this behavior.

The static effects were acquired by, using the pressure dependences of these fluorescence peak positions. The static effects for the ten fluorescence peaks resulted in thermal blue shift, but the dynamic effects for all peaks except Y-7 led to thermal red shift. The observed nature of thermal shift (i.e. red or blue) of a fluorescence peak was due to competition between the static and dynamic effects. Based on an approximate treatment, the static parameter A (characterizing the static effect) and electron-phonon coupling parameter alpha' (characterizing the dynamic effect) for these fluorescence peaks were estimated in the case where therrhal shift curves from low temperature to near or higher than room temperature were not measured. Parameters A for all fluorescence peaks and alpha' for all peaks except Y-7 were comparable in sign and magnitude with those of the sharp luminescence peaks of other rare earth ions in crystals and so were deemed to be reasonable.

Assuming the scattering potential lies in a RKHS, we find that the imaging equation can be rewritten as the inner product of the desired unknown function with the adjoint of the forward operator applied to the kernel of the imaging operator. We therefore may choose the kernel of the imaging operator such that the adjoint applied to this kernel is precisely the reproducing kernel of the Hilbert space the reflectivity function lies in. In this way we are able to obtain an alternative definition of an ideal image. We will demonstrate this theory using synthetic aperture radar imaging as an example, though there are other applicable imaging modalities i.e. inverse diffraction and diffraction tomography [1, 6]. We choose SAR as it was the motivating application for this work. We will compare the RKHS ideal imaging technique to the standard microlocal analytic ideal image from backprojection theory.

By comparing them with the corresponding formulas in the diffuse interface model, the two coefficients are then obtained. The mass transition coefficient is proportional to the rate of molecular unidirectional transition under the mutual equilibrium of liquid and vapor species. The mass diffusion coefficient is proportional to the rate of molecular unidirectional travel through a unit surface under the condition that two local elements at two sides of the surface are in mutual equilibrium. This diffusion coefficient can finally be expressed as the product of the Fick concentration diffusion coefficient and the mixing density besides an energy (or temperature) factor.

While as far as the authors are aware, carrier mobility model of s-Ge/Si is still rarely reported to date. In view of that all above, based on the E-k relation in both conduction band and valence band of s-Ge/Si material, the analytical models of physical parameters in energy band are established, and the models are verified by experiments. Then the s-Ge/Si carrier models are further established based on our band structure model, and the Monte Carlo method is used to verify our s-Ge/Si carrier mobility model. The quantificational results of our paper will help understand s-Ge/Si material physics and provide an important theoretical basis for the design of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration.",10.1166/jno.2019.2685,358,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

The activity is suitable for a high school physics course or introductory college courses for both science majors and non-science majors. The students investigate dragging a 1-kg mass (representing a stone) on a small wooden sled under three conditions: over dry sand, using wooden rollers over dry sand, and over wet sand. This last condition has been recently proposed as a potential method used by the Egyptians. The force required to pull the sled at a constant velocity is measured and used to calculate the kinetic coefficient of friction for each of the three test conditions. Students then perform a similar activity pulling their professor across a sand volleyball court.

J,"Rüdiger, G; Schultz, M",Non-diffusive angular momentum transport in rotating <i>z</i>-pinches,"The stability of conducting Taylor-Couette flows under the presence of toroidal magnetic background fields is considered. For strong enough magnetic amplitudes such magnetohydrodynamic flows are unstable against non-axisymmetric perturbations which may also transport angular momentum. In accordance with the often used diffusion approximation, one expects the angular momentum transport to be vanishing for rigid rotation. In the sense of a non-diffusive Lambda effect, however, even for rigidly rotating z-pinches, an axisymmetric angular momentum flux appears which is directed outward (inward) for large (small) magnetic Mach numbers. The internal rotation in a magnetized rotating tank can thus never be uniform. Those particular rotation laws are used to estimate the value of the instability-induced eddy viscosity for which the non-diffusive Lambda effect and the diffusive shear-induced transport compensate each other.

J,"Sakolowski, A",Applying Structural Mathematics in Physics: Case of Parallel Connection,"Research identifies two domains by which mathematics allows learning physics concepts: a technical domain that includes algorithmic operations that lead to solving formulas for an unknown quantity and a structural domain that allows for applying mathematical knowledge for structuring physical phenomena. While the technical domain requires employing only students' technical skills, the structural domain requires activating students' algebraic reasoning and applying it to learn more about physical systems beyond evaluating formulas. Students' technical skills in mathematics do not convert into structural skills automatically, and this is perceived as an obstacle that prevents complete appreciation of physics knowledge. There can be various ways to activate or to develop students' mathematical structural domain in physics. Most common are: (a) mathematical modeling that involves experimental activities concluding with algebraic relations; (b) stimulating students to work with symbols in limiting situations; or (c) developing the understanding of physics formulas (e.g., see Ref. 5). While all these methods are valuable, students still face difficulties with transferring their structural math skills to physics, thus new attempts are made. The process of developing students' algebraic structural skills proposed in this paper is a combination of the current approaches; however, as a means of developing mathematical reasoning, a mathematical structure is used that is derived from a physics formula. More specifically, this paper presents an attempt to interpret formula for the equivalent resistance of a parallel electric circuit using the properties of a rational function. Such formulated aim reflects not only recommendations of the physics education research community but also mathematics because it guides students in how to merge mathematical knowledge with the behavior of a physical system to learn more about the system.",10.1119/1.5135795,362,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no

J,"Schlottmann, P",Edge singularities in the one-dimensional Bariev model,Bariev's model for correlated hopping in one dimension is integrable and soluble within the framework of two nested Bethe Ansatze. For repulsive interaction and finite magnetization the low energy excitation spectrum is a two-component Luttinger liquid with conformal charges c = 1. In zero magnetic field the spectrum of spin excitations is gapped. For higher energy excitations the single-hole (single-particle) spectral functions display edge singularities that deviate from those expected from a Luttinger liquid. The system can be described as a mobile impurity coupled to the Luttinger liquid yielding an effective x-ray edge type model. Using the Bethe Ansatz solution for repulsive interaction we obtain expressions for the critical exponents for the single-particle and single-hole Green's functions in zero magnetic field.

Substantial variations of pressure that are comparable with large meteorological variations are experimentally observed upon flowing a direct current pulse with a small amplitude and alternating currents of an industrial frequency through the conductor. Such significant and fast variations of the pressure occur at the instant the current in the conductor changes. Even current pulses with a short duration influence the pressure distinctly.

As a result, the conductance peak at the zero-bias limit has an opportunity to change into antiresonance in the case of appropriate structural parameters. When strong intrados Coulomb interaction is taken into account, the zero-bias conductance tends to show up as one peak with its width tightly related to the level, Coulomb strength, and the Zeeman splitting of the quantum dot.

The Oersted torque (tau Oe) and current-induced torque (tau C) are induced by charge current; while the spin-orbit torque (tau SO) and field-like torque (tau FL) are induced by spin current. However, the torque effects often were hindered due to the heating-induced artifacts. In this work, we particularly pay attention to minimize the Joule heating effects in order to investigate the intrinsic torque effects in cobalt (Co)/platinum (Pt) bilayer with an applied charge current ranging from -60 to 60 mA. In this range, the Oersted field is estimated as 0.25 Oe which is much smaller than the experimental result of Delta Hr (similar to 0.7 Oe), implying some contribution from the spin-current induced field like torque.

J,"Xu, C; Hui, PM",Emergence of cooperation in finite populations under biased selection,"We study the effects of biased selection on evolutionary games in finite populations. Biased selection is induced by including a number of invariant agents, who do not evolve, into an otherwise competing and evolving population. The invariant agents react differently when they encounter different types of variant agents, helping the cooperators to attain a higher payoff than the defectors by a difference d. The probability of a single cooperator invading and taking over a population of all defectors is evaluated based on the Moran process. When M invariant agents are introduced into the evolving population of size N, their presence helps promote the replacement of defectors by cooperators, in comparison with the case of unbiased selection with M = 0. While the prisoner's dilemma cannot sustain a cooperative population without the invariant agents, it is possible for cooperation to emerge with biased selection. We show that for a given N (M), there is a threshold of M (N) above (below) which an initial population of all defectors evolve into one of all cooperators. The dependence of the threshold on the game's payoffs, intensity of selection, and the values of M and d is studied. Beyond the prisoner's dilemma, biased selection also promotes cooperation in a bigger part of payoff parameter space corresponding to other types of games. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The effective electron beam shape (EEBS) is hence suggested as the broadening function to overcome this issue for theoretical analysis, rather than the widely-used Gaussian profile. However, EEBS is hardly acquired due to it strongly depends on both the sample topography and the electron beam focusing condition, which make it is impossible to be applied in practical analysis. An approach is proposed to find a best-fit traditional Gaussian profile, which can optimally replace the EEBS in the case of the same sample structure and experimental condition for establishing a database of the parameter in traditional Gaussian profile.

We found that the carrier lifetime and implied open-circuit voltage (iV(oc)) increased as the ozone concentration increased in the as-deposited condition. Although the passivation performance after annealing also improved and had a maximum value in the low ozone concentration region (<250 g/Nm(3), 17 wt%), it showed a reverse trend compared to the as-deposited sample in the high ozone concentration region (>250 g/ Nm(3)) as the ozone concentration increased. The maximum values of carrier lifetime and iV(oc) obtained in the low ozone concentration region are 1.4 ms and 656 mV, respectively. The improved values in the low ozone concentration region are attributed to a decrease in carbon and increase in hydrogen at the Al2O3/Si interface after forming gas annealing.

Electronic properties such as the ionization energy, electron affinity and energy gap between the frontier molecular orbitals of the CNT are not significantly changed by the adsorption or the encapsulation of 4T. Contrary to the p-type characteristics of 4T, its complexes formed with CNTs exhibit n-type characteristics due to the higher electron mobility than the hole mobility. Among the endo- and exohedral complexes, the former one shows the highest electron mobility of 3.79 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The absorption properties of all the systems were studied by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).

In this paper, we propose nanolayer-embedded compact pseudo-photonic crystals (PPCs) that enable strong interaction between ultrathin nanolayers and photonic crystal modes. In typical two-dimensional slab photonic crystals, the transverse-magnetic (TM) photonic crystal bandgap is not well formed, making it difficult to operate the TM photonic crystal waveguide modes. However, by utilizing the low-frequency TM PPC bands, a long propagation TM waveguide mode, a slow TM waveguide mode, and a TM photonic bandgap are all readily available. In particular, the insertion of a nanometer-thick low-refractive-index layer in the vertical center of TM PPC waveguide can localize the electric fields tightly in nanometer space, causing strong field interaction with the inserted nanolayer material. Using the TM slow light near PPC band edges, field interaction with the nanolayer is significantly enhanced. We can also realize nanolayer-embedded high-quality-factor (Q-factor > 10(4)) PPC cavities using the TM PPC bandgap.

The corresponding second- and third-order renormalized moments of the longitudinal velocity gradient and the resulting skewness values are found to depend on the Reynolds number in nontrivial fashions. For intermediate and moderately high Reynolds numbers, the skewness value does not exhibit any scaling behavior with respect to the Reynolds number. Instead, the skewness value remains bounded for any Reynolds number and it approaches a constant value for infinitely high Reynolds numbers. In the same scheme, we also incorporate another interpolation function between the production and inertial ranges coming from energy balance equation and inputs from renormalization-group analysis.

J,"Fang, JS; Yu, KY; Chen, ST; Cheng, YL; Wang, YS; Chen, GS",Reliability Enhancement of Copper/Porous SiOCH Metallization Systems Using Nitrogen Stuffing and Bias-Filter Sputter Deposited Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Barrier,"A robust ultrathin barrier to retard Cu diffusion is needed for fabricating state-of-the-art Cu interconnects associated with porous dielectric materials. Gas stuffing of grain boundaries is widely used to strengthen conventional polycrystalline TiN and TaN barriers. Alternatively, a self-formed MnOx layer derived typically from sputter-deposited Cu(Mn) alloy film is a viable barrier. However, vacuum plasma generated during Cu(Mn) deposition tends to damage porous dielectric materials. Thus, this study combines the two approaches, proposing a strategy to enhance reliability of copper/porous carbon-doped organosilica (p-SiOCH) metallization systems using nitrogen stuffed p-SiOCH and bias-filter sputter deposited Mn2O3. An ultrathin (1-4 nm) Mn2O3 film, deposited by reactive sputtering with a biased-filter mechanism on nitrogen-stuffed p-SiOCH (p-SiOCH(N)), was proposed as a barrier layer to prevent Cu from diffusion. Electrical properties of the samples were evaluated by capacitance-voltage and current density-electric field measurements. The bias-filter mechanism eliminated plasma damage of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. Furthermore, stabilization annealing converted Mn2O3 to Mn2O3-x(N) (manganese sub-oxynitride), giving the highest barrier performance for the Cu metallization layer, while maintaining the pristine dielectric properties of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. The Cu/Mn2O3-x(N)/p-SiOCH(N) structure also exhibited extremely low leakage currents after reliability tests, indicting their applicability to Cu metallization.

And with the structural feature size of the ILGP decreasing from tens of microns to microns and even sub-microns, the diffraction dispersion phenomenon will inevitably become a prominent problem in research and design of non-dispersion elements. Nevertheless, under the broadband light source illumination, the analysis of the dispersion characteristic of diffraction spectrum of the microstructure array has not been reported in detail. Therefore a theoretical model of micro-optical element with a typical one-dimensional rectangular phase grating (RPG) and a widely used white LED source is established in this paper. The dispersion characteristic of the diffraction spectrum is studied, that is, with the increase of period of the RGP or the cone angle of incident beam, the dispersion of diffraction spectrum weakens. Dispersion parameter C and its formula are proposed, which can precisely measure the chromatic dispersion degree of the diffraction spectrum. Furthermore, the boundary criterion point of non-dispersion C = 0.3 is given explicitly. It is explored that no matter whether the cone angle of incident beam or the RPG period increases, the non-dispersion output light can be obtained only by matching the two parameters to make the dispersion parameter C less than 0.3. Then an RPG sample, of which the structural parameters are consistent with the designed ones, is fabricated by using micro-nano processing technology. By changing the cone angle of incident beam, the luminance and the chromaticity coordinates of the diffraction beam are tested. The analyses of the test results of the fabricated RPG sample show that the spectrum dispersion regularity is in accord with the theoretical analysis. The consistency verifies the correctness of dispersion parameter C, its formula and the non-dispersion boundary criterion point. The dispersion parameter C and non-dispersion boundary criterion point presented in this paper provide a guidance for analyzing the dispersion characteristics when the structural parameters of the integrated light guide plate and other broadband micro-optical element are designed.",10.7498/aps.68.20190716,473,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The special plateau valued with 0.25 h/e(2) of nonlocal resistance in H-shaped four terminal devices can be used as the fingerprint of quantum spin Hall effect. Based on the HgTe/CdTe quantum well, with the aid of nonequilibrium Green's function theory and multi-terminal Landauer-Biittiker formula, we calculate the nonlocal resistance and study the dephasing effect of spin topological states in the presence of exchange field and external magnetic field.

The latter destroy time reversal symmetry and change the width and relative position of topological gap, but do not influent the topological stability of helical edge states. In the contrary, dephasing processes don't change the width and relative position, however, they broke the topological stability. We consider two kinds of dephasing: normal dephasing and spin dephasing. In the first kind, the carriers lose only the phase memory while maintaining the spin memory. In the second kind, the carriers lose both phase and spin memories. Because of the spin locking properties, normal dephasing almost have no influence on the helical edge states.

J,"Zhang, BF; Zhu, K; Wu, H; Hu, HF; Shen, Z; Xu, J",Numerical study of metallic semiconductor nanolasers with double-concave cavity structures,"Metallic semiconductor nanolaser, as an ultra-small light source, has been increasingly attractive to researchers in last decade. It can have wide potential applications such as in photonic integrated circuits, on-chip interconnect, optical communications,etc. One obstacle to miniaturization of the laser size is that the loss increases rapidly with the cavity volume decreasing. In previous studies, a type of Fabry-Perot cavity with capsule-shaped structure was investigated and demonstrated both numerically and experimentally, showing that its cavity loss is reduced dramatically in contrast to the scenario of conventional rectangular cavities. However, when the cavity size is reduced down to nanoscale, capsule-shaped structure surfers high loss. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, a novel type of double-concave cavity structure for metallic semiconductor nanolaser in a 1.55 mu m wavelength range is proposed and numerically studied. The proposed structure consists of InGaAs/InP waveguide structure encapsulated by metallic clad, and has a cylindrical reflection end face and concave curved sidewalls. The cylindrical reflection end face can push the resonant mode into the cavity center and reduce the optical field overlap with metallic sidewalls, which can reduce the metallic loss. The curved-sidewalls topologically reduce the electric field component perpendicular to the sidewalls, and thus reducing the plasmonic loss. By optimizing the waist width of the double-concave cavity structure, the radiation loss can be effectively reduced, resulting in the improvement of cavity quality factor and the decrease of threshold current. Finite-difference time-domain simulations are conducted to investigate the properties of the proposed cavity structures such as resonant mode distribution, cavity quality factor, confinement factor, threshold gain and threshold current in this paper. The numerical results show that the double-concave cavity laser with cavity volume as small as 0.258 lambda(3) increases 24.8% of cavity quality factor and reduces 67.5% of threshold current, compared with the conventional capsule-shaped one, demonstrating an effective improvement of metallic nanolaser. With those advantages, the proposed structure can be used for realizing the ultra-small metallic semiconductor nanolasers and relevant applications.",10.7498/aps.68.20190972,479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The understanding of the friction mechanism of the alkane liquid film confined between two substrates is important when the friction law on a macro/nano scale is not applicable. In this work, the molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the effect of the chain length on the friction properties of the liquid films that are confined between two golden substrates. There are seven pure alkane liquid films that are composed of one molecule CnH2n + (2)(n = 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18), and six mixed alkane liquid films that are composed of two molecules C6H14/CnH2n + (2)(n = 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) with a ratio of 1:1. The results show that the friction force and the coefficient of friction of pure alkane liquid films both increase as the chain length increases when the carbon atom number is less than 12, whereas the friction property keeps stable when the carbon atom number of the alkane molecule is greater than 10 and the pure hexadecane liquid film has the largest friction force. In the mixed films, the addition of short chain alkane molecules can strengthen the friction, and the hexane/dodecane mixed film has the maximum friction force. The short chain molecule dilutes the C8H18 film and C10H22 film which cause the friction force to decrease. During the sliding progress, the formation of solid-like high density-packet layers is the main reason for the friction reduction. When no solid-like layer or just one solid-like layer is formed at the interface of golden base, the liquid alkane film is liquid-like and its viscosity becomes much larger than that in the normal state, which leads to high friction force. The short chain molecules reduce the density of the solid-like layers, which causes the film to transform from solid-like state to liquid state, thus resulting in the increase of friction. The friction property mainly depends on the layered structure, and the interaction between the golden surface and liquid film contributes to the friction. This study helps to understand the friction mechanism of ultra-thin liquid films.",10.7498/aps.68.20190740,480,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

The biomedical research that seeks cures for these conditions has been dominated by a qualitative, inductive mind-set. Although the inductive approach has not been effective in developing medical treatments, it has amassed enough information to allow construction of quantitative, deductive models of acute cell injury. In this work we develop a modeling approach by extending an autonomous nonlinear dynamic theory of acute cell injury that offered new ways to conceptualize cell injury but possessed limitations that decrease its effectiveness. Here we study the global dynamics of the cell injury theory using a nonautonomous formulation. Different from the standard scenario in nonlinear dynamics that is determined by the steady state and fixed points of the model equations, in this nonautonomous model with a trivial fixed point, the system property is dominated by the transient states and the corresponding dynamic processes. The model gives rise to four qualitative types of dynamical patterns that can be mapped to the behavior of cells after clinical acute injuries. The nonautonomous theory predicts the existence of a latent stress response capacity (LSRC) possessed by injured cells. The LSRC provides a theoretical explanation of how therapies, such as hypothermia, can prevent cell death after lethal injuries.

Most PL studies use conventional lamp light sources whose spectral distribution is filtered with a monochromator, but this results in a still impure spectrum with a low spectral intensity. Tunable dye lasers offer a tunable light source which cover the desired excitation wavelength range with a high spectral intensity, but their operation is often cumbersome. Herein, the design and properties of an improved dye-laser system which is based on a Q-switch pump laser are presented. The high peak power of the pump provides an essentially threshold-free lasing of the dye laser, which substantially improves the operability. It allows operation with laser dyes, such as Rhodamin 110 and Pyridin 1, which are otherwise on the border of operation of the laser. The system allows to cover the 540-730 nm wavelength range with four dyes. In addition, the dye laser output pulses closely follow the properties of the pump, which directly provides a time-resolved and tunable laser source.

The influences of spin-flip coefficient of interdot lambda, spin-flip coefficient of intradot eta and interdot hopping coefficient t + delta(sigma) Delta t on thermospin property are discussed. As interdot hopping coefficient t is equal to energy level epsilon, the spectrum of G(s) shows Fano-like effect with epsilon variation. Antiresonance position of G(s) is almost unchanged and its width becomes narrower with epsilon increasing. Spin thermopower S-s is close to the maximum of the peak and charge thermopower S-c is equal to zero for t = epsilon. As a result, the pure spin thermopower S-s can be obtained, which means that a pure spin current may be produced by a temperature gradient in our system. It is found that spin figure of merit ZT(s) can reach a considerable value by adjusting key parameters of the system, such as Delta t, beta, alpha, phi. The typical T-shaped spin valve can be treated as a stable thermospin battery which allows to convert the heat energy to spin voltage, thus produces the pure spin current in the device.

J,"Firsova, NE; Ktitorov, SA",Extraction of the short-range defect potential parameters from available experimental data on the graphene resistance,"We consider a problem of obtaining information about the scattering potentials of the monolayer graphene sample using available experimental data on its resistance. For this purpose, we study theoretically the dependence of graphene resistance on Fermi energy having in mind to compare it with experimental data where super-high mobility electrons in suspended graphene samples without chemical doping were investigated. As far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the Coulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering potentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The empty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical shortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage of the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We consider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit formulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution of this scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function of the Fermi energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results are consistent with experiment, where the resistance was measured as a function of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene. This fact gives a possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the basis of the available experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with the gate voltage controlled Fermi level position.

For engineering research, we determine the candidate hotspots mainly based on data analysis of highly cited papers in the Web of Science Core Collection and select the fronts based on expert research and judgment. The research hotspots are selected from topics clustered through co-citation analysis, which are based on four topic indicators including the number of core papers, total citations, average publication year of core papers, and the percentage of consistently cited publications. It is thus crucial to design proper strategies for hotspot selection. We compared the performance of several hotspot selection strategies and found that the proposed mixed selection strategy performs best.

In contrast, for the sample with x = 0.9, the out-of-plane Ni-O bond length shows a sharp thermal contraction in the high-temperature region, which is suggestive of changes in the orbital occupation accompanied by the development of checkerboard-type charge correlations. Furthermore, the x = 0.9 sample is characterized by a large atomic displacement parameter for the apical O atoms along the out-of-plane direction, which is interpreted as the existence of two types of Ni3+ sites with different orbital occupancies.

J,"Karthika, C; Balasubramaniam, M",Mirror nuclei of 1<i>n</i>/2<i>n</i> halo systems as 1<i>p</i>/2<i>p</i> emitters,"Background: The advent of radioactive ion beams has helped considerably to explore exotic decay modes like proton radioactivity in extremely proton-rich nuclei lying on or beyond the proton drip line. Recently, an experimental study was reported on the structural properties of proton-rich nucleus O-11. Interestingly, O-11 is the mirror nucleus of the widely studied 2n halo system Li-11. In addition, O-11 formed in the experiment was identified through its decay by 2p emission. A similar kind of interdependence between neutron halo and its mirror counterpart for 2p emission was reported [Charity, Elson, Komarov, Sobotka, Manfredi, and Shane, J. Phys.: Conf series 420, 012073 (2013)]. Purpose: To study and analyze whether the mirror nuclei of known 1n/2n halo systems are 1p/2p emitters. Method: The preference for the mirror nuclei of 1n/2n halo systems for 1p/2p emission over the other (2p/1p emission) is studied by Q-value systematics and potential energy minimization using a cluster-core model. The half-lives of the mirror nuclei of neutron halo systems were determined using a recently proposed empirical formula [Sreeja and Balasubramaniam, Eur. Phys. J. A 54, 106 (2018); Sreeja and Balasubramaniam, Eur. Phys. J. A 55, 33 (2019)]. Results: Among the mirror nuclei of 1 n halo systems, N-11 (the mirror of Be-11) and F-15 (the mirror of C-15) were found to have a preference for 1p emission over 2p emission by Q-value systematics. The potential energy surface analysis supported the result where both N-11 and F-15 were found to be ground-state 1p emitters. The trend got changed with an increase in angular momentum where the minimum in potential shifted from 1p to 2p cluster. Moreover, the half-life calculation matches with the result obtained from Q-value systematics. Conclusion: For the 2n halo systems, all the studies made indicate that the respective mirror nuclei have a preference for 2p emission. A similar conclusion cannot be drawn for the mirror nuclei of In halo systems except for N-11 and F-15, which were found to be ground-state 1p emitters. All the remaining mirror nuclei of In halo systems prefers 2p emission as favorable decay mode than the expected 1p emission. The empirical formula can be used as a good tool to evaluate half-life values of proton emitters provided the Q values are known with desirable accuracy.",10.1103/PhysRevC.100.054611,511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike previous studies on traffic tolls, the flow congestion model is used to take into account the dynamic propagation of traffic flow. The LWR (Lighthill-Whitham-Richards) model and the Greenshields' velocity-density function are used to describe the dynamic properties of traffic flow. The quasi-analytic solutions of the three possible cases in UE due to different charges are derived. Both analytical and numerical results indicate that rarefaction waves and shock waves appear in the corridor under the coarse toll. The three-dimensional evolution diagrams of traffic flow and space-time diagrams illustrate that the introduction of course toll lets flow patterns more complicated.

J,"Lopez-Pina, A; Losada, JC; Benito, RM",Competition games between teams vying for common resources under consensus dynamics on networks,"Dynamics on complex networks and associated games have numerous practical applications for a wide range of fields. The analyses addressed in the literature frequently consider game frameworks defined between the individual nodes within a given network. However, many real situations are related to teams of agents which are external to the network but that compete over the state of the network elements. In this paper we carry out an analytical and numerical analysis of games played between two teams that compete to maximize their benefits from the resources of the same population, whose elements form a network. This population could be a group of voters in an election, a set of potential clients within a given market, or a certain species in an ecosystem, whose state favourable to one of the teams (political opinion, volume of purchases or pollination, for example) must be maximized. The dynamics of the state of each node of the network is given by a consensus function, and the steady state depends on the network structure and the external action of each team. We have found an optimal analytical solution for the team's actions that maximize its benefit, when the network of connections with the population is fixed and equal for both teams. Additionally, we find analytically the optimal network of connections from the team agents to the population so that the achievable payoff for said optimal action is maximum over all alternative networks. Finally, we consider the case of a game played on subsets of the general population by each of the two competing teams, ultimately leading to a Nash equilibrium. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The present work explores the method of decoupling the anisotropic MPs directly for bulk soft FSMs. The small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were performed on the [1 0 0]-oriented alloys Fe1-xGax (Galfenol) under a series of magnetic fields. Those two-dimensional (2D) SANS patterns were decomposed and reconstructed by the spherical harmonic approaches. The scattering intensities, which are respectively decomposed into isotropic and anisotropic components, show clearly the pathway of three types of magnetic domains. The 90 degrees domain process is thus quantified directly in the bulk Galfenol. The evolution trend for the domain process is consistent with that for the lattice strain and magnetization responses, which has been respectively evidenced by the in-situ neutron diffraction and initial magnetization measurement. Meanwhile, the quantitatively addressed domain process agrees well with the simulated results by the energy-based domain rotation modelling. These observations indicate that the anisotropic magnetization processes correlate tightly with the lattice strain response, which are of significant importance for the understanding and design of large magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS).

J,"Chatterjee, A; Maghsoodi, A; Perkins, NC; Andricioaei, I",Elastic continuum stiffness of contractile tail sheaths from molecular dynamics simulations,"Contractile tails are key components of the biological nanomachinery involved in cell membrane puncturing, where they provide a means to deliver molecules and ions inside cells. Two intriguing examples of contractile tails are those from bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin. Although the two systems are different in terms of biological activity, they share a fascinatingly similar injection mechanism, during which the tail sheaths of both systems contract from a so-called extended state to around half of their length (the contracted state), accompanied by release of elastic energy originally stored in the sheath. Despite the great prevalence and biomedical importance of contractile delivery systems, many fundamental details of their injection machinery and dynamics are still unknown. In this work, we calculate the bending and torsional stiffness constants of a helical tail sheath strand of bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin, in both extended and contracted states, using molecular dynamics simulations of about one-sixth of the entire sheath. Differences in stiffness constants between the two systems are rationalized by comparing their all-atom monomer structures, changes in sheath architecture on contraction, and differences in interstrand interactions. The calculated coefficients indicate that the T4 strand is stiffer for both bending and torsion than the corresponding R2-pyocin strands in both extended and contracted conformations. The sheath strands also have greater stiffness in the contracted state for both systems. As the main application of this study, we describe how the stiffness constants can be incorporated in a model to simulate the dynamics of contractile nanoinjection machineries.

The ground state is studied by the superfluid local density approximation (SLDA) and small-amplitude collective modes are studied by the iterative quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). The results illustrate the evolutions of collective modes of a small system in traps from spherical to elongated or pancake-shaped deformations. For small spherical systems, the influences of different SLDA parameters are significant, and, in particular, a large pairing strength can shift up the oscillation frequency of collective modes. The transition currents from QRPA show that the compressional flow patterns are nontrivial and dependent on the deformation. Finally, the finite-size effects are demonstrated to be reasonable when progressing towards larger systems. The hydrodynamical results of collective frequencies can be reproduced by SLDA-QRPA with reduced pairing strengths.

J,"Sonin, EB",Interplay of spin and mass superfluidity in antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates and bicirculation vortices,"This paper investigates the coexistence and interplay of spin and mass superfluidity in antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). The hydrodynamic theory describes the spin degree of freedom by equations similar to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory for bipartite antiferromagnetic insulators. The variables in the spin space are two subspins with absolute value h/2, which play the role of two sublattice spins in the antiferromagnetic insulators. As well as in bipartite antiferromagnetic insulators, in antiferromagnetic spin-1 BEC there are two spin-wave modes: One is a gapless Goldstone mode and the other is gapped. The Landau criterion shows that in limit of small total spin (two subspins are nearly antiparallel), the instability of supercurrents starts from the gapped mode. In the opposite limit of large total spin (two subspins are nearly parallel), the gapless modes become unstable earlier than the gapped one. Mass and spin supercurrents decay via phase slips, when vortices cross streamlines of the supercurrent. The vortices participating in phase slips are nonsingular bicirculation vortices. They are characterized by two topological charges, which are winding numbers describing circulations of two angles around the vortex axis. The winding numbers can be half-integers. A particular example of a half-integer vortex is a half-quantum vortex with the superfluid velocity circulation h/2m. However, the superfluid velocity circulation is not a topological charge, and in general the quantum of this circulation can be continuously tuned from 0 to h/2m.",10.1103/PhysRevResearch.1.033103,535,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

Whenever one turn trajectory deviates from a predefined window, a global control event is generated to trigger an online TBT data acquisition. The data acquisition is synchronized for all BPMs around the ring. In the meantime, the bunch-by-bunch (BxB) data, which is acquired from a single dedicated feedback BPM, has also been collected for analyzing possible coupled bunch instabilities (CBI). In addition to CBI caused mainly by ion bursts, other types of fast transient motions, such as, the top-off residual disturbance and fast orbit disturbance, have been captured with the new tool. The sources of the glitches can be approximately localized with the synchronized TBT data from multiple BPMs around the ring.",10.1016/j.nima.2019.162566,552,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

J,"Hart, O; Haroche, M; Castelnovo, C",Long-range Coulomb interactions and nonhydrodynamic behavior in thermal quenches in spin ice,"When spin ice systems undergo a sudden thermal quench, they have been shown to enter long-lived metastable states where the monopole excitations form so-called noncontractible pairs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 107201 (2010)]. While the nature of these states is well understood, the dynamical mechanisms underpinning their formation remain largely unexplored and are the subject of this study. We find that the long-range tail of the Coulomb interactions between monopoles plays a central role by suppressing the monopole-assisted decay of noncontractible pairs with respect to monopole-antimonopole annihilation. In conjunction with low final quench temperatures, where the system enters a nonhydrodynamic regime in which the monopoles effectively move at terminal velocity in the direction of the local force acting on them, the interactions lead to a metastable plateau that persists in the thermodynamic limit. This is a remarkable phenomenon, reminiscent of jamming and some instances of glassiness: A transient modification of the short-time dynamics of the system allows it to enter a metastable state whose lifetime can easily be astronomically large at (experimentally relevant) low temperatures. We demonstrate this using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field population dynamics theory, and we provide an analytical understanding of the mechanisms at play. When the interactions between monopoles are truncated to finite range, the metastable plateau reduces to a finite size effect. We derive the finite size scaling behavior of the density of noncontractible pairs in the metastable plateau for both short- and long-range interactions and discuss the experimental implications of our results.",10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184411,555,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The desire for fast X-ray pulses that accommodate photon counting rates of hundreds or thousands of counts per second per sensor drives system design toward high sensor current slewrate. Typically, readout of high current slewrate events is accomplished by increasing the sampling rate, such that rates of order 1MHz may be necessary for some experiments. In our microwave multiplexed readout scheme, the effective sampling rate is set by the frequency of the flux-ramp modulation (fr) used to linearize the SQUID response. The maximum current slew rate between samples is then nominally Phi(0)f(r)/2M(in) (where M-in is the input coupling) because it is generally not possible to distinguish phase shifts of > pi from negative phase shifts of < -pi. However, during a pulse, we know which direction the current ought to be slewing, and this makes it possible to reconstruct a pulse where the magnitude of the phase shift between samples is > pi. We describe a practical algorithm to identify and reconstruct pulses that exceed this nominal slew rate limit on the rising edge. Using pulses produced by X-ray transition-edge sensors, we find that the pulse reconstruction has a negligible impact on energy resolution compared to arrival time effects induced by under-sampling the rising edge. This technique can increase the effective slew rate limit by more than a factor of two, thereby either reducing the resonator bandwidth required or extending the energy range of measurable photons. The extra margin could also be used to improve crosstalk or to decrease readout noise.",10.1007/s10909-019-02250-2,556,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Ward, TJ; Whittaker, RJ",Effect of base-state curvature on self-excited high-frequency oscillations in flow through an elastic-walled channel,"We investigate the development of flow-induced small-amplitude high-frequency oscillations occurring in a rigid fluid-conveying channel with a section of the upper wall replaced by a taut elastic sheet. We consider an axially nonuniform base state, caused by a negative transmural pressure (internal minus external), which results in the sheet bending inward, and then examine the evolution of oscillatory perturbations about this state. Due to the curvature of the base state, any normal displacement of the sheet will lead to a change in the axial stretching of the sheet, which is an order of magnitude higher than would be the case for perturbations to a uniform sheet. This stretching provides an additional restoring force that can be dominant. We derive a modified tube law to describe the wall mechanics with this additional effect and combine it with an existing fluid model to obtain a complete description of the system. At leading order, we obtain a one-dimensional eigenvalue problem for the frequencies and mode shapes of the oscillatory perturbations. The nonlinear interaction between the perturbations and the base-state curvature manifests itself as an additional integral term in the eigenvalue problem, corresponding to the total axial stretching in the wall. The normal modes are neutrally stable at leading order, and their slow growth or decay is determined by considering the global energy budget of the system. The stability of the system can be expressed in terms of a critical Reynolds number of the mean flow through the channel. We explain the behavior of the system as two key dimensionless parameters F and K are varied. These quantify the dimensionless axial tension and base-state curvature effects, respectively. Numerical simulations are used to identify distinct flow regimes in parameter space, which we explore further in detail using asymptotic analysis. This reveals that at large K, i.e., strong base-state curvature effects, the leading-order axial profiles of the modes are forced to adjust in order to eliminate the need for significant stretching in the wall. This has the effect of stabilizing both the fundamental and, to a lesser extent, the first harmonic modes, which results in the first harmonic becoming the most unstable mode.",10.1103/PhysRevFluids.4.113901,559,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

After introducing the general form of the time evolved state, various classes of entangled states are generated. Indeed, the influence of different orders of tunneling strengths on the generated entangled states has been studied. Depending on the tunneling strength constants, two-, three-and four-partite entangled states are generated, all of which are superposition states of macroscopic number of BEC atoms. Considering three-particle collision dramatically changes the generated entangled states. Moreover, in particular cases, the resulted states are non-entangled. Also, we show that tunneling and collisional interactions can be manipulated to generate a pair of atomic entangled coherent states (quasi-Bell states).

The topological characteristics of the flow were also analyzed using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method. It was therefore possible to propose a sequence of flow topologies (four distinct flow states) during the changeover phenomenon of the impinging slot jet. The results show that the asynchronous phenomenon of the impinging slot jet seems to be related to the transitional characteristics of the jet flow. The flow topology of the most stable and energetic states (top and bottom jet flow states) creates a pressure imbalance inside the area of interest, resulting in the appearance of two transitional flow states. For the top or bottom impinging jet flow states, the jet remains in a relatively stationary position and the flow in the area of interest is quasi-two-dimensional.

J,"Huan, L; Hui, X",Analysis of broadening mechanism of ionospheric echo spectrum and spectrum sharpening method,"High-frequency sky wave detection equipment must rely on the ionosphere as the propagation medium in the early warning and sea state remote sensing tasks. The ionosphere is time-varying and unstable, which will change the characteristics of the high-frequency electromagnetic wave propagating through it, resulting in the broadening of the echo spectrum, thus seriously affecting the detection of targets and the inversion of sea state parameters. The reason and mechanism of the echo spectrum expansion are analyzed in detail from the dispersion effect, phase contamination and multimode propagation. The bandwidth of the dispersion effect is different from that of the high frequency detection equipment. When the bandwidth of the sky wave equipment is 3-30 MHz, the bandwidths of the dispersion effect are 41.6-57.4 kHz and 0.17-10.8 MHz. The multi-quasiparabolic ionospheric model is used to discuss the frequency selection measures to avoid multimode propagation. The modulation process of ionospheric contamination to echo is studied theoretically. It is shown that the nonlinear phase contamination will cause the energy of echo to diffuse in frequency domain and to be unable to accumulate. To solve the problem of phase contamination which is difficult to solve in practice, a contamination correction method without estimating the instantaneous frequency of the echo is proposed. In the method the consistency principle of signal subspace and signal frequency vector expansion space is used, and therefore the phase contamination term can be well estimated. Based on the real data, the contamination correction results from the proposed method, phase gradient autofocus method, maximum entropy spectral analysis method and time-frequency processing method are given. The results show that the new method is a better method and can effectively sharpen the broadened echo spectrum.",10.7498/aps.68.20190887,595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Li, CX; Shi, ZX; Zhuang, LY; Ye, XM",Effect of surfactants on thin film spreading under influence of surface acoustic wave,"For the spreading of thin and free film of a partially wetting liquid with insoluble surfactant under the influence of surface acoustic wave, the dimensionless evolution equations governing the spreading dynamics are derived. The evolution equations contain the film thickness and the surface concentration of insoluble surfactant. Assuming that the thickness of the thin film is much smaller than the wavelength of sound in the liquid, the sound leaking off the surface acoustic wave cannot be sustained in the liquid film, and the acoustic radiation pressure and attenuation of the acoustic wave in the solid are both weak. Then the films spreading under different physical mechanisms are observed by numerical simulation. The results show that the surface acoustic wave drives the liquid film to spread and move. When the capillary stress is weak and the liquid film spreading is mainly controlled by the drift induced by surface acoustic wave, the spreading process consists of rapid spreading stage and balancing stage, and the Marangoni effect caused by uneven distribution of surfactant makes the liquid film spread faster in the first stage. When the capillary stress and the drift jointly dominate film spreading, the spreading process contains three stages, i.e. spreading stage, contracting stage and balancing stage. The effect of surfactant accelerates the spreading process, but the existence of contracting stage makes it take longer for the film to reach equilibrium. In addition, the disjoining pressure used in this paper promotes the liquid film spreading, as well as the Marangoni effect. As the correlation coefficient between disjoining pressure and surfactant concentration, a, and the Marangoni number, M, increase, the maximum thickness and the spreading radius of liquid film change faster.",10.7498/aps.68.20190791,596,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no

When pumped by the linearly polarized incident wave with the electric field direction along one of the SRRs' arms, the meta-molecules emit the SHG that can have two non-zero orthogonal electric field components, provided that the top SRR and the bottom SRR are not arranged in mutually parallel or anti-parallel manner. Due to the strong coupling between the two SRRs, the plasmonic properties of the stero-stacked meta-molecules could be tuned by varying the twist angle between the two SRRs. In this process, we demonstrate that the amplitudes of the two orthogonal SHG field components, and the phase difference between these two components can be varied with changing the twist angle between two SRRs. Based on the concept of the light polarization, different polarization states can be achieved by changing the differences in phase and amplitude between the orthogonal field components. Therefore, the twist angle dependent amplitudes of and phase difference between two orthogonal SHG field components can be used to manipulate the polarization states of the emitted SHG. For the stero-stacked meta-molecules with a fixed twist angle of 60 degrees, elliptically, near-circularly andnear-linearly polarized SHG emission can be obtained at different fundamental wavelengths. In addition, for the fundamental wave with a fixed wavelength of 1500 nm, the stero-stacked meta-molecules with different twist angles are demonstrated to be able to emit SHG with elliptical andnear-linear polarization states.",10.7498/aps.68.20190837,597,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Peng, WG; Song, HF; Zhan, Q; Wu, XH; Jing, JH",Formation and internal nucleosynthesis in massive rotating Wolf-Rayet stars,"Wolf-Rayet stars (WR stars) were discovered by French astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet in 1867. The Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descents of the most massive, extremely hot (temperatures up to 200000 K) and very luminous (10(5) L-circle dot - 10(6) L-circle dot) O stars, with 25M(circle dot) - 30M(circle dot) solar mass for solar metallicity. The WR stars possess very strong stellar winds, which have velocities up to 3000 km/s and wind mass loss rate 10(-5) M-circle dot a year. These winds are observed in the broad emission line profiles (sometimes, even P-Cygni profiles) of WR spectra in the optical and UV range. Actually, these winds are so strong that they can peel the star and convert it into a nude nucleus without envelope. It has been found that three bright galactic stars located at Cygnus region have broad strong emission bands, rather than absorptions lines, superposed on the typical continuum of hot stars. In 1930 Beals correctly identified these features as emission lines produced by high ionized elements such as helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The physical factors which can affect the evolution of WR stars are explored in this paper. These physical factors include stellar mass, initial velocities, orbital periods, metallicities, etc. According to the equations for angular momentum transfer and chemical element diffusion, we can ascertain how these physical factors influence the evolution of WR stars and the mixing of chemical elements in WR stars. The result indicates that massive stars with high initial velocities and metallicities have strong stellar winds and be prone to producing WR stars. In contrast with the counterpart with high metallicities, it is hard for the single star with low metallicity to generate WR star due to weak wind. However, the star with very high initial velocity and low metallicity can form chemical homogenious evolution. The star has an enlarged convective core and a very thin hydrogen envelope and it can also generate WR star. The component in the binary system with short orbital period can transfer mass to the companion star through Roche lobe overflow, and this physical process can produce WR star under the condition of low metallicity. Furthermore, mass removal due to Roche lobe overflow reduces the temperature of stellar convective core and rate of nuclear reaction. It is shown that mass metallicities of chemical elements including He-4, C-12, F-19, Ne-22, Na-23, Mg-25 in the primary star are higher than those in the single stars, whereas mass metallicities of chemical elements including H-1, N-14, O-16, Ne-20, and Al-26 are lower than those in the single counterparts. In a word, the conditions for massive stars with high initial velocities and metallicities in the binary system with short orbital period favor the formation of WR stars.",10.7498/aps.68.20191040,599,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no
J,"Zhang, SH; Shao, M; Zhang, SZ; Zhou, JH",Light rays in Fourier domain,"Establishing a universal model to characterize the relationship between light rays and optical waves is of great significance in optics. The ray model provides us with an intuitive way to study the propagation of beams as well as their interaction between objects. Traditional ray model is based on the normal of a beam wave front. The normal vector is defined as the direction of ray. However, it fails to describe the relationship between light ray and optical wave in the neighborhood of focus or caustic lines/surface since light ray in those regions are no longer perpendicular to the wavefront. In this work, the ray model of a light beam is built according to its Fourier angular spectrum, where the positions of rays can be determined by the gradient of the phase of the Fourier angular spectrum. On the other hand, the Fourier angular spectrum of a light beam can be reconstructed through the ray model. Using Fourier angular spectra, we construct the ray model of two typical beams including the Airy beam and the Cusp beam. It is hard to construct ray model directly from the optical field of these beams. In this ray model, the information about ray including direction and position involves the propagation properties of light beams such as self-accelerating. In addition, we demonstrate that the optical field of the focused plane wave can be reconstructed by the ray model in Fourier regime, and the optical field in spatial domain can be obtained by inverse Fourier transform. Simulation results are consistent with the results from Debye's method. Finally, the high-dimensional ray model of light beams is elaborated in both spatial and spectral regime. Combined with focused plane wave, Airy beam and rays in quadratic gradient-index waveguide, our results show that the ray model actually carries the information about optical field in both spatial and Fourier domain. Actually, the traditional ray model is just a spatial projection of the high-dimensional ray model. Hence, when traditional ray model fails at the focus or caustic lines/surface, it is able to obtain the spectrum of the corresponding optical field from the Fourier domain, and then obtain the field distribution in spatial domain by inverse Fourier transform.",10.7498/aps.68.20190839,600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions on the bottom surface of the small-sized PILGP are presented. The two-dimensional micro-prism expressions make the micro-prisms spread out on a two-dimensional scale of the bottom surface of the PILGP. By fitting and analyzing a large number of simulation data, the relationship expressions between the coefficients of the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions and the structural parameters of the PILGP are established. The above expressions are directly applied to the two-dimensional distribution design of micro-prism on the bottom surface of small-sized PILGPs with different structural parameters. Without the help of the designers' experience and the multiple simulations of the software, the average value of luminance uniformity in the partial integrated BLMs is obtained to be 84.94%.

The two-dimensional distribution of the micro-prism on the bottom surface of the PILGP with high luminance uniformity can be obtained directly by using the above expressions. By fine-tuning the coefficients of two-dimensional micro-prism expressions, calculated by the coefficient relation-expressions, the utilization of light energy, illuminance uniformity and luminance uniformity of the partial integrated BLM respectively reach 90.69%, 88.02% and 92.17%, which meet the practical requirements. The optimization and design time of the partial integrated BLM are both greatly saved. Further, the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions on the bottom surface of the PILGP are analyzed and the physical mechanism is explained reasonably.

J,"Zhao, J; Tang, DL; Xu, L; Li, PC; Zhang, F; Li, J; Gui, BY",Effect of anode magnetic shield on inner magnetic pole etched in anode layer Hall thruster,"For anode layer Hall plasma thruster, the etching of inner magnetic pole is one of the key factors affecting its service life. In order to solve the problem of inner magnetic pole etching in anode layer Hall plasma thruster, the effect of anode magnetic shield on inner magnetic pole etched in anode layer Hall thruster is studied by combining particle simulation PIC with sputtering simulation. The magnetic shielding of anode changes the distribution of magnetic field configuration on the surface of the anode, and improves the magnetic mirror ratio of the magnetic mirror field of the thruster to the magnetic field width of the positive gradient on the central axis. The ratio of the magnetic mirror is 1.4 times that of the original one, and two additional saddle magnetic fields are added on both sides of the original saddle magnetic field region. It not only is conducive to confining electrons and improving the ionization rate of working gas, but also keeps a certain distance between the anode and the high temperature electron region, which provides the reliable reference data for the design of high power Hall plasma thruster. When the discharge voltage is 900 V and the working pressure is 2 x 10(-2) Pa, the simulation results show that after the anode is shielded by the magnetic shield, the energy range of most of the incident ions on the inner magnetic pole is 40-260 eV, which is 100 eV lower than the energy range 40-360 eV in the case without shielding the anode. The probability distribution of particle energy without magnetically shielding the anode between 260 eV and 600 eV is obviously higher than that of ion energy with magnetically shielding the anode. The maximum probability distribution of cosine value of incident angle is extended from a small range near 0.1 (incident angle 84 degrees) to a large range of 0.1-0.45 (incident angle 84 degrees-63 degrees). The magnetic shielding makes the incident ions disperse on the surface of the inner magnetic pole, which is helpful in reducing the etching of inner magnetic pole. The maximum etching rate of inner magnetic pole after the anode has been magnetically shielded is reduced from 16 x 10(-10) m/s to 6.1 x 10(-10) m/s, which is 2.62 times lower. The comparison of simulation results with experimental results in the case without magnetically shielding the anode shows that they are in good agreement.",10.7498/aps.68.20190654,602,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no

This technology is a non-ionizing and non-invasive pathological detection method, which has great potential application in early detection of cancer. However, ultrasound-modulated optical imaging technology is insufficient in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and imaging contrast. Frequency-shifted laser feedback technology with microchip laser is a new type of highly sensitive interference technology, whose gain coefficient for weak optical signal can reach 10(6). This technology can greatly improve the SNR of imaging. Combined with the high sensitive laser feedback technology, the ultrasound-modulated laser feedback technology is proposed. The SNR of this technology is better than that of the traditional ultrasound-modulated optical imaging technology. The increase in SNR can achieve greater depth of detection in biological tissue imaging, but there is no significant improvement in imaging contrast. In order to improve the contrast of biological tissue imaging and achieve high resolution imaging of thick biological tissue, we use ultrasound microbubble contrast agent in ultrasound-modulated laser feedback imaging technology. We establish a Monte Carlo photon transport model with microbubbles in order to study the mechanism of contrast enhancement in ultrasound-modulated laser feedback imaging with microbubbles. Finally, we establish an experimental system to verify the correctness of the simulation results. Experimental and simulation results show that in the transparent solution, the ultrasonic microbubble contrast agent can enhance the ultrasound-modulated laser feedback signal and generate harmonic modulation, which can improve the imaging contrast by detecting the enhancement of the fundamental and harmonic signals of the feedback. In the scattering medium, the ultrasonic microbubble contrast agent can significantly attenuate the ultrasound modulated laser feedback signal, and the imaging contrast can be improved by detecting the attenuation of the fundamental and harmonic signal.",10.7498/aps.68.20190770,603,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

The present work demonstrates a facile means of removing transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) from a glass substrate in selected areas. When agarose gel (agar), a material typically used in desserts, is sandwiched between two TCO-coated glass substrates and connected to a dry cell, the TCO is removed from the glass at the agar stamping area within 2 min. This method allows etching of TCOs using acid-free, inexpensive, and readily available starting materials. Analyses by optical microscopy, transmission spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that this etching occurs as a result of reduction of the TCO in conjunction with the electrolysis of water at the interface between the TCO and agar surfaces. Using this technique, high-throughput patterning of TCOs with an edge resolution of several micrometres was achieved. Furthermore, the shape of the agar template can be readily changed simply by cutting the agar using scissors.

The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction. This also demonstrates that the effect of the DQDs can be replaced a thermal reservoir when the rate difference of a photon absorbed and emitted by DQDs is larger than zero; otherwise, it is irreplaceable.

Andrzej Bachowicz using an obstacle lighting lamp that is currently in production. The developed simulation model, which has been verified experimentally, was used to determine the influence of changes in meteorological parameters on the temperature distributions on the surface of the lamp. It will be used in the future to optimize the geometry of the heat sink used in the lamp in terms of electricity consumption and thermal resistance. It is planned to extend the application of the lamp under difficult climatic conditions. Abstract The article presents the results of experimental and theoretical works aimed at determining the distribution of heat emitted by an obstacle lighting lamp. These kind of lamps are commonly applied as a warning for air traffic vehicles. There is a need for lighting devices with various intensities, whose application depends on the location and operating conditions. The overall aim of the author's work is to develop a computer model that would enable us to conduct research aimed at determining the optimal parameters of lamp operation without the need to build many physical models. Measurements of heat emitted by a currently manufactured lamp were made, and based on these, a numerical model of the lamp operating under laboratory conditions was developed. The considered lamp has two heat sources, one of which is light-emitting diodes (LEDs), while the other heat source consists of stabilizers and other elements of the lamp power supply system. After positive experimental verification of the numerical model, theoretical analyses of heat emission under various meteorological conditions were carried out, while the values of ambient temperature and airflow velocity were changed; then, the influence of these parameters on the temperature distribution on the surface of the lamp was determined.",10.3390/app9224951,626,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no

J,"Ahmad, S; Arshad, MJ",Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP: Rapid Bandwidth Utilization after Fast-Recovery Phase,"The purpose of this study is to enhance the performance of Multistream Fast Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keeping in view the recent web-based applications that are being deployed on long-range, high-speed, and high-bandwidth networks. To achieve the objective of the research study, a congestion control after fast-recovery module for congestion control scheme of Multistream Fast TCP is proposed. The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Consequently, Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP consumes the available network bandwidth in lesser time and increases the throughput and goodput. The proposed module enhanced the performance of the transport layer protocol. Our findings demonstrate the performance impact in the form of a decrease in the convergence time to consume the available network bandwidth and the increase in the throughput and the goodput.",10.3390/app9214698,631,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

J,"Baek, YJ",On Non-Completeness and G-Equivariance,"With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.",10.3390/app9214692,642,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The spatial inhomogeneity corresponds to a spatially dependent scaling of the sine-Gordon potential term. The uncoupled inhomogeneous sine-Gordon equation has stable stationary front solutions that persist in the coupled system. Carrying out a numerical investigation it is found that these inhomogeneous sine-Gordon fronts loose stability, provided the coupling between the two inhomogeneous sine-Gordon equations is strong enough, with new stable fronts bifurcating. In order to analytically study the bifurcating fronts, we first approximate the smooth spatial inhomogeneity by a piecewise constant function. With this approximation, we prove analytically the existence of a pitchfork bifurcation. To complete the argument, we prove that transverse fronts for a piecewise constant inhomogeneity persist for the smooth 'hat-like' spatial inhomogeneity by introducing a fast-slow structure and using geometric singular perturbation theory.",10.1088/1361-6544/ab2ca5,653,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes
J,"Bykovskii, NE; Senatskii, YV",On the Mechanism of Absorption and Restoration of Radiation Transmission in the Channel of Small-Scale Self-Focusing of a Short Laser Pulse in Neodymium Glass,"When diagnosing a small-scale self-focusing (SSSF) channel of a 0.5-ns laser pulse with an intensity of 3-5 GW/cm(2) in neodymium glasses, an absorption jump was detected (with a front of approximate to 0.5 ns) at wavelengths of 1.06 and 0.66 mu m in addition to filament-like damage typical of SSSF, spectral broadening, and laser radiation scattering. The absorption coefficient reached 0.15 cm(-1), and transmission in the medium was restored during 15-35 ns for phosphate glass and 5-10 ns for silicate glass. The physical bases of this effect of the appearance and relaxation of absorption in glasses have not been previously presented. An analysis of the experimental data showed that the absorption jump is due to the fast population of the I-4(11/2) level of Nd3+ ions in glasses when nonlinear processes occur in the SSSF channel such as stimulated Raman scattering and broadening of the laser pulse spectrum. The relaxation time of the population at the I-4(11/2) level and the restoration of transmission in glasses after the termination of the laser pulse are determined by the characteristic sizes of the Nd3+ ions excitation regions arising in the samples upon interference of the laser and scattered radiation, as well as the thermophysical characteristics of the glasses.",10.1134/S1063783419110106,654,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To solve this problem, the effects of immunization probability on the maximal infected density and the average infected density are investigated, and it's found that large immunization probability will depress the maximal infected density sharply. Moreover, it's proved that small immunization probability is of great importance, which could not only reduce the cost of immunization at low risk but also decrease the outbreak risk of the next year by making the average infected density larger in the current year. Besides, a generalized immunization strategy is presented, which makes the immunization strategy easy to carry out and meanwhile keeps the maximal and the average infected density almost as good as those in the original dynamic immunization strategy. Moreover, the control effects in eight real networks are also investigated, which proves the usefulness of the modified dynamic immunization strategy.

We start from weak microwave pulses which lead to only trivial pyroelectric peak response. However, when the microwave pulses become intense, the normally expected pyroelectric signal seems to be suppressed and the sign of the voltage signal can even be completely changed. Analysis indicates that while the traditional pyroelectric model, which is a linear model and works fine for our data in the small regime, it does not work anymore in the large signal regime. Since the small-signal model is the key foundation of electromagnetic-wave sensors based on pyroelectric effects, such as pyroelectric infrared detecters, the observation in this work suggests that one should be cautious when using these devices in intense fields. In addition, the evolution of detector signal with respect to excitation strength suggests that the main polarisation process is changed in the large signal regime. This is of fundamental importance to the understanding on how crystalline solids interact with intense microwaves.

J,"De Gregorio, P",On the Definition of Energy Flux in One-Dimensional Chains of Particles,"We review two well-known definitions present in the literature, which are used to define the heat or energy flux in one dimensional chains. One definition equates the energy variation per particle to a discretized flux difference, which we here show it also corresponds to the flux of energy in the zero wavenumber limit in Fourier space, concurrently providing a general formula valid for all wavelengths. The other relies somewhat elaborately on a definition of the flux, which is a function of every coordinate in the line. We try to shed further light on their significance by introducing a novel integral operator, acting over movable boundaries represented by the neighboring particles' positions, or some combinations thereof. By specializing to the case of chains with the particles' order conserved, we show that the first definition corresponds to applying the differential continuity-equation operator after the application of the integral operator. Conversely, the second definition corresponds to applying the introduced integral operator to the energy flux. It is, therefore, an integral quantity and not a local quantity. More worryingly, it does not satisfy in any obvious way an equation of continuity. We show that in stationary states, the first definition is resilient to several formally legitimate modifications of the (models of) energy density distribution, while the second is not. On the other hand, it seems peculiar that this integral definition appears to capture a transport contribution, which may be called of convective nature, which is altogether missed by the former definition. In an attempt to connect the dots, we propose that the locally integrated flux divided by the inter-particle distance is a good measure of the energy flux. We show that the proposition can be explicitly constructed analytically by an ad hoc modification of the chosen model for the energy density.",10.3390/e21111036,672,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SLAC pulses are theoretically derived, then applied to the design of enhanced BIR-4 and hyperbolic secant pulses to demonstrate practical utility of the new pulses. At 7T, SLAC pulses are shown to improve the flip angle homogeneity compared to a standard adiabatic pulse with validation in both simulations and phantom experiments, under SAR equivalent experimental conditions.

However, it is presently not clear how the type of doped-O species affects the capacitive performance. In this paper, an attempt has been made to probe into the possible correlation between the type of doped-O species and the corresponding capacitive performance. Three O species (C=O, C-O and O-C=O) have been introduced onto TiC-derived carbon (TiC-CDC) by using a facile room-temperature oxidation strategy with three typical oxidizing agents (H2O2, HNO3 and (NH4)(2)S2O8), respectively. The results have shown that as the content of the C=O species increases, both the specific capacitance and the capacitance retention for the oxidized TiC-CDC samples become higher, showing a positively correlative performance. This work suggests that optimizing the type of doped-O species will be great potential for obtaining the optimal electrochemical performances for the O-doped carbon materials.",10.1142/S179329201950142X,704,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Inam, O; Qureshi, M; Omer, H",De-noising Multi-coil Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Patch-Based Adaptive Filtering in Wavelet Domain,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently requires transform domain de-noising methods to preserve important features in the reconstructed images such as corners, sharp structures, and edges. Wavelet transform-based image de-noising is a standard approach used in MRI to recover smooth surface and sharp edges from the given noisy MR images, thereby improving diagnostic interpretations. Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) techniques such as SENSE have been recently developed with an aim to improve the data acquisition speed, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and spatial resolution of the reconstructed images. However, the SENSE reconstruction algorithm often encounters noise during data acquisition and reconstruction process which not only contaminates the quality of the reconstructed images but also leads to poor diagnostic interpretations in clinical settings. During SENSE reconstruction process, noise can appear in the reconstructed image mainly due to two reasons (1) imperfections in the receiver coils; (2) un-folding the aliased images of multiple receiver coils to obtain a single composite image. In this paper, a new adaptive patch-based filtering in wavelet domain is presented to recover sharp structures and edges without introducing any artifacts in the SENSE reconstructed images. The proposed method uses soft-thresholding function as a shrinkage process which typically involves thresholding the small wavelet coefficients to reduce the noise without affecting the important features in the SENSE reconstructed images. For the evaluation of the proposed method, several experiments are performed using simulated phantom and in vivo data sets. The SENSE reconstruction quality using the proposed method is compared with contemporary de-nosing techniques, in terms of structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the SENSE reconstruction using the proposed method when compared to the other contemporary de-nosing methods successfully removes the noise and preserves the fine details in the reconstructed MR images without introducing blurring artifacts.",10.1007/s00723-019-01153-5,732,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ITER project has reached 57.4% of the total construction work scope through to first plasma. Construction of ITER is indeed progressing at full speed, with some ITER components having already been manufactured, such as the toroidal field coil structures and the gyrotrons of the electron cyclotron heating and current drive system, as a result of decades of technological development. Construction of JT-60SA and WEST is also progressing on schedule to support ITER in various engineering and physics aspects. The EU and Japan are advancing with their pre-conceptual designs for DEMO, and the experience and lessons learned from ITER are already being applied to both designs. China reported on the status of the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor engineering design. One of the technical issues evident from these DEMO designs is the interfacing of the plasma-facing, in-vessel components with plasmas. Advanced plasma-facing elements having liquid metals and an advanced in situ boron coating technology were applied to existing fusion reactors, the results of which were reported at this conference. It was also reported that commissioning of the injector for the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility engineering validation and engineering design activities (IFMIF/EVEDA) project has been completed and testing of the Radio Frequency Quadrupole accelerator has begun. Europe and Japan presented their plans to construct neutron irradiation test facilities: the DEMO-Oriented Neutron Source (DONES) and Advanced Fusion Neutron Source (A-FNS), respectively.

The control of the electrode thickness could be useful to manipulate the energy confinement and the band dispersion of the surface guided mode. It has been demonstrated recently that high aspect ratio (HAR) electrode could produce a dispersive shear horizontal and vertically polarized surface modes in the bulk piezoelectric substrate. In this theoretical study, we propose to employ a high aspect ratio electrode on top of the GaN/sapphire-layered substrate enabling the presence of Sezawa surface mode. Based from the dispersion band, we obtained a higher frequency of surface guided mode in the non-radiative zone in the GaN/sapphire heterostructure configuration compared to the bulk GaN substrate. Indeed, these guided modes are induced by the hybridization between Sezawa surface mode and the mechanical resonance of the HAR electrode producing nearly a flat band at the limit of First Brillouin Zone. Furthermore, the displacement of each guided modes indicates the confinement of energy mostly in the electrode with a slight amount of energy in the top layer of the substrate. We demonstrated also the frequency tuning of guided mode using diverse materials for the electrode but also the thickness of GaN layer.

Here, we study the thermoelectric response of a series of five anhydrous 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium halide ionic liquids with varied chain length and counterion in a high-aspect-ratio, horizontal-temperature-gradient geometry, where convection is minimal. While a canonical, constant-volume thermodynamic model indicates that greater disparity and longer aliphatic groups should exhibit larger Seebeck coefficients, we instead measure the opposite: Longer aliphatic chains correlate with lower densities and greater heat expansion, stronger intermolecular associations, stronger steric repulsion, and lower Seebeck coefficients. As evidence of the critical role of thermal expansion, we measure that the Seebeck effect is nonlinear: Values of -2.8 mV/K with a 10 K temperature difference and -1.8 mV/K with a 50 K difference are measured with ether ion. Our results indicate that steric repulsion and heat expansion are important considerations in ionic liquid design; with large temperature differences, the Seebeck coefficient correlates negatively with heat expansion.

Increasing x and y had differing effects on the crystal structures, photoluminescence properties, and particle morphologies of the synthesized powders.

The total fringing capacitance arising due to induced fringing fields in the device is divided into inner, outer and bottom fringing capacitance.

The 3-D Poisson's equation has been solved in the channel region using the parabolic potential approximation method to develop the surface potential expressions.

However, the existing information exchange protocols only focus on either pairwise information exchange or group information exchange, and none of these protocols enable private and public information exchange to occur simultaneously. Thus, a general secure information exchange protocol for a multiuser channel is desirable. With this motivation, this paper investigates simultaneous private and public information exchange in a Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (MIMO) multiuser relay channel. In an aim to achieve this goal, signal alignment is chosen as the core technique. With the designed precoding matrix for each user, private information is aligned with its exchange partner, and public information forms a coding chain at the relay. With the aligned private signal and public coding chain, neither an untrusted relay nor external eavesdroppers can recover the original individual information. Performance analyses of the proposed protocol are conducted. First, we conduct transmission performance analyses from the perspective of time slot cost. Second, we conduct a security analysis for private information exchange and public information exchange. Third, we conduct secrecy sum-rate analysis for three attack scenarios: an untrusted relay attack only, an eavesdropper attack only, and both an untrusted relay and eavesdropper attack. The simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed protocol can enable simultaneous private and public information exchange while resisting attacks by an undesired receiver, an untrusted relay, and external eavesdroppers.",10.3390/e21111054,776,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

After XRD and SEM analysis, the five CYSZ ceramic coatings (CeO2 content 0, 1, 5, 10, 15 mol%) prepared were tetragonal phase structures before and after the thermal shock experiment, and the thickness of CYSZ ceramic coating was about 200 mu m. Adding appropriate amount of nano CeO2 promoted the formation of micro-cracks in the coating, released the coating stress, slowed down the thermal shock damage process, and prevented the transformation from t-ZrO2 to m-ZrO2. The AFM morphology showed that the coating surface grains grow vertically after thermal shock cycle, which indicated that the entry of Ce4+ into ZrO2 lattice resulted in lattice distortion and made the grains more stable. When the content of CeO2 is 1 mol%, the thermal shock resistance excellent is 84 times. Therefore, the addition of CeO2 can effectively improve the thermal shock resistance performance of CYSZ thermal barrier coating, meeting the requirements of high temperature working conditions of aeroengine and hot-end components.",10.1166/jno.2019.2712,780,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

We assume incompressible and inviscid potential flow and that the circulation is already generated. The resulting velocity field complements the one that is known to generate Prandtl?s induced drag in three dimensions. We demonstrate how fluid particles in a velocity field are attracted towards an object, and that this, due to conservation of momentum, results not only in lift, but also in drag forces. The magnitude of a disturbance velocity can be derived from the circulation of bound and shed vortices accompanying the object and parameters taken from the von K;rm;n vortex street description. Another part of the drag is generated by vortices that emerge behind blunt bodies when fluid particles do not follow the surface of the objects. We obtain a mathematical description of the resistance of several types of blunt bodies and rotating cylinders. The model involves no parameters that are derived from empirical data.

J,"Mollaei, M; Jafarian, SMM",The introduction of the surfing scheme for shock capturing with high-stability and high-speed convergence,"In this paper, a novel shock capturing scheme with high stability and speed of solution is presented. The scheme divides the dependent variables into two parts, i.e. Surf and Surfer, like surfing sport. The Surf part is calculated by applying the concept of Sobolev gradient on the dependent variables. Furthermore, it has the least difference with these variables, along with the lowest discretization error and the same equation. Hence, it is expected that this part can be solved at high stability conditions and large time steps. In addition, the Surfer part is obtained from the difference between the Surf part and the dependent variables. Therefore, only the error-maker operators (for example, a discontinuity like a shock) are in this part and accordingly it has a local nature. Due to this feature, it can be solved with fewer points compared to the Surf part. Therefore, its equation is solved as quickly as Surf equation, despite its limited stability conditions. Finally, the summation of the Surf and Surfer solutions makes the main solution. The scheme has been applied to the inviscid Burgers' equation with an initial value of the step function, and one-dimensional inviscid Euler flow through a nozzle with a shock wave. The stability condition for the Burgers' equation has been increased to a Courant number of 10(10) and the solution time for the Euler flow case has been decreased by one-fifth. Comparison of the results with traditional methods indicates the ultra-high stability and ultra-speed convergence of this scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

But it is difficult to get the distribution of multivariate data by saving the dependency between its variables and transferring it to the outcome distribution. On the other hand, copula function keeps safe the dependency. Thus entropy principle can be added to copula concept to approximate the distributions of the multivariate dependence data sets. In this article, we would like to work on the most copula entropy based on known Spearman's rho as an extra constraint. For this aim, we approximate Spearman's rho via empirical distribution function of a given data set.

It is found that 3% of CNTs in the nanocomposite produced 3 x 10(-6)S cm(-1) electrical conductivity comparable with that of A-150 and the soft tissue. Also, TEM picture shows the electrical network formation in the continuous PA phase and the interface of PA and PE phases. Determination of the density and the weight percentage of elements of this nanocomposite reveal that the obtained values are similar to A-150 and the soft tissue. On the other hand, simulations carried out by Geant4 toolkit show that the fluence of secondary charged particles of the gamma rays or neutrons inside the gas cavity originating from A-150 and the nanocomposite (3% CNT) is similar. In addition, microdosimetric distributions derived from a TEPC with the nanocomposite wall agree well with a TEPC with A-150 wall. Hence, the frequency-mean and dose-mean lineal energies obtained by the two TEPCs are also compatible. A maximum difference 3% is observed between the frequency-mean lineal energies. Also, the dose-mean lineal energies differ up to 10%. Consequently, the dose-equivalent determined by the two above TEPCs is found similar.

The main advantage of this theory is that the study of 2D wavefront propagation can be carried over in a ray coordinate system, which is 1D (in the space variable). This makes the theory (along with the shock ray theory, SRT) more efficient than solving the full Euler system in 2D and is well suited for certain applications. However, the WNLRT and the SRT are developed only in a homogeneous and quiescent medium whereas it is important to update these theories to inhomogeneous and moving media. In this article, we derive the WNLRT system in an inhomogeneous and moving medium filled with polytropic gases. The governing system of this theory involves three balance laws in the ray coordinate system, which is strictly hyperbolic under the condition that the wavefront speed is greater than the ambient sound speed. In order to validate the developed theory, we solve the derived system numerically and show that the effect of medium anisotropy has been captured in terms of the geometry of a propagating wavefront. We also compare our numerical results with linear ray theory to highlight the success in capturing the nonlinear geometric effect of the propagating wavefront. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Park, H; Lee, K",Adaptive Natural Gradient Method for Learning of Stochastic Neural Networks in Mini-Batch Mode,"Gradient descent method is an essential algorithm for learning of neural networks. Among diverse variations of gradient descent method that have been developed for accelerating learning speed, the natural gradient learning is based on the theory of information geometry on stochastic neuromanifold, and is known to have ideal convergence properties. Despite its theoretical advantages, the pure natural gradient has some limitations that prevent its practical usage. In order to get the explicit value of the natural gradient, it is required to know true probability distribution of input variables, and to calculate inverse of a matrix with the square size of the number of parameters. Though an adaptive estimation of the natural gradient has been proposed as a solution, it was originally developed for online learning mode, which is computationally inefficient for the learning of large data set. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive natural gradient estimation for mini-batch learning mode, which is commonly adopted for big data analysis. For two representative stochastic neural network models, we present explicit rules of parameter updates and learning algorithm. Through experiments on three benchmark problems, we confirm that the proposed method has superior convergence properties to the conventional methods.",10.3390/app9214568,805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike existing approaches, the proposed framework provides natural 3D manipulation of a face without background distortion and interactive face editing by a user's input, which leads to freeform manipulation without any limitation of range or shape. To achieve these features, a 3D morphable face model is fitted to a face region in a video frame and is deformed by the user's input. The video frame is then mapped as a texture to the deformed model, and the model is rendered on the video frame. Because of the high computational cost, parallelization and acceleration schemes are also adopted for real-time performance.

J,"Shirmoharnmadi, Z; Nikoofard, A; Ershadi, G",AM3D: An accurate crosstalk probability modeling to predict channel delay in 3D ICs,"Migration from Two Dimensional Integrated Circuits (2D ICs) to Three Dimensional Integrated Circuits (3D ICs) reduces the delay due to the shorter wire length between sender and receiver. However, Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) that connect layers in the structure of 3D ICs can seriously increase the delay due to capacitance coupling between TSVs and lead to crosstalk fault. The severity of crosstalk faults depends on transitions appearing on TSVs that is called transition patterns. To propose an efficient crosstalk tackling mechanisms in 3D ICs, an accurate probability analytical model is required to predict the delay caused by TSVs (3D ICs) in the attendance of these transition patterns. In this regard, this paper proposes an accurate crosstalk probability model for 3D ICs called AM3D that estimates the latency of communication channels of 3D ICs in the attendance of crosstalk faults. The model is applicable for both non-protected TSVs and TSVs which are protected by crosstalk mitigation mechanisms. In order to accredit our proposed model, various SPICE simulations are conducted and obtained outcomes in different benchmarks are compared with extracted results from AM3D. Comparisons present an average of 1.81% discrepancies between the time delay obtained from SPICE simulations and time delay calculated by our proposed model.",10.1016/j.microrel.2019.06.071,831,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

In the calculations, a Sakhalin-type pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator is assumed as a power source for the launcher. Launchers with three and five pairs of parallel rails connected into a series electrical circuit are considered. The simulation was performed for different numbers of projectiles in a burst and for different projectile masses. It is established that a major factor limiting the operation of launchers in such modes is the heating of the rails. It is shown that the rate of rail heating is determined by the inhomogeneity of the current density distribution along the rail section due to the nonstationary diffusion of the magnetic field into the rails and by the velocity skin effect. It has been shown previously that the maximum heating of the rails occurs in regions located outside the launcher channel provided that the width of the outer rail extends beyond the section of the launcher channel. We investigated the possibilities of reducing the heating of rails in these regions using rails of different widths in the rail launcher channel, using rails of different materials and rails with inhomogeneous electrophysical properties, and using armatures of different materials. The calculations show that with an optimal choice of the material and structure of the rails and the armature material corresponding to this structure, multirail launchers 5-6-m long can provide a projectile velocity of 2-2.5 km/s in a burst of 10-16 projectiles with masses of up to 800 g at a firing rate of 200-300 shots per second with no melting of the rails in the launcher channel.",10.1109/TPS.2019.2942100,833,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

We studied variation of tilt angle as function of FM layer thickness which was increased near to Spin Reorientation Transition (SRT) value for FM layer in corresponding system.

This theory reproduces closely the exact result of Bethe Ansatz in the 1D limit and does not produces any spurious phase transitions for any anisotropy in the quasi-1D regime at finite temperatures in agreement with the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We study the static spin-spin correlation function in order to analyse the interplay of lattice geometry and anisotropy in these systems. We compare the square and triangular lattice. For the latter we find that there is a quantum transition point at an intermediate anisotropy of similar to 0.6. This quantum phase transition establishes that the quasi-1D regime extends upto a particular point in this geometry. For the square lattice the change from the 1D to 2D occurs smoothly as a function of anisotropy, i.e. it is of the crossover type.

For this, an additional negatively polarised electrode is mounted in P+(source)-N (channel)-N+(drain) structure over the source region to overcome material solubility. This improves the electrical characteristics of the device. Along with this, we have implanted a low workfunction metal layer (ML) in the oxide layer under the gate electrode for creating more abruptness at the junction to improve the subthreshold swing (SS) of the device.

Further to this, the optimization of metal layer workfunction and misalignment of metal layer in TFET have been performed to get optimum device characteristics. In addition to this, for the suppression of ambipolar behaviour, gate electrode is shorted from the drain side.

The segmentation, or partition of the image pixels, is viewed as a model structure selection problem, where the decisions are based on the implementable codelength of the model, akin to minimum description length for lossy representations. The intended usage of the extracted disparity map is to provide to the decoder the geometry information at a very small fraction from what is required for a lossless compressed version, and secondly, to convey to the decoder a segmentation describing the contours of the objects from the scene. We propose first an algorithm for constructing a hierarchical segmentation based on the persistency of the contours of regions in an iterative re-estimation algorithm. Then, we propose a second algorithm for constructing a new sequence of segmentations, by selecting the order in which the persistent contours are included in the model, driven by decisions based on the descriptive codelength.

Currently, only invasive and sacrificial methods exist to study neurochemical alterations following TBI. Nuclear magnetic resonance methods-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS)-are powerful tools which may be used noninvasively to diagnose a range of medical issues. These methods can be utilized to explore brain functionality, connectivity, and biochemistry. Unfortunately, many of the commonly studied brain metabolites (e.g., N-acetyl-aspartate, choline, creatine) remain relatively stable following mild to moderate TBI and may not be suitable for longitudinal assessment of injury severity and location. Therefore, a critical need exists to investigate alternative biomarkers of TBI, such as acrolein. Acrolein is a byproduct of lipid peroxidation and accumulates following damage to neuronal tissue. Acrolein has been shown to increase in post-mortem rat brain tissue following TBI. However, no methods exist to noninvasively quantify acrolein in vivo. Currently, we have characterized the T-1 and T-2 of acrolein via nuclear magnetic resonance saturation recovery and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill experiments, accordingly, to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of acrolein obtained with MRS. In addition, we have quantified acrolein in water and whole-brain phantom using PRESS MRS and standard post-processing methods. With this potential novel biomarker for assessing TBI, we can investigate methods for predicting acute and chronic neurological dysfunction in humans and animal models.

Moreover, to analyze the secrecy performance comprehensively, two eavesdropping scenarios, i.e., non-colluding eavesdroppers (NCE) and colluding eavesdroppers (CE) are considered. Based on this, by modeling the dynamic buffer state transition as a Markov chain, we derive the exact closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability, the average secrecy throughput, and the end-to-end delay for each schemes. The analytical analysis and simulation shows that the SCJ-OPA scheme achieves similar performance as the NJ scheme when the total transmit power is small. On the other hand, when the transmit power is high, the performance achieved by SCJ-OPA is similar to that of SCJ. Thereby, the SCJ-OPA scheme can achieve better performance across the entire total transmit power, which makes up the defects of NJ and SCJ exactly.",10.3390/app9214506,868,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

Moreover, no structural phase transitions were observed for either the low-T-c or high-T-c phases of (NH3)(y)LixFeSe0.5Te0.5 over the wide pressure range of 0?15.3 GPa, and the T-c-lattice constant (c) plots for both phases were recorded to determine the critical point separating SC-I and SC-II.",10.1088/1367-2630/ab5034,878,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Ye, F; Marchetti, PA",Fractional excitations in one-dimensional fermionic systems,"We study the soliton modes carrying fractional quantum numbers in one-dimensional fermionic systems. In particular, we consider the solitons in the one-dimensional fermionic superfluids. For the s-wave order parameter with phase twisted by an angle phi, the complex Z(2) soliton may occur carrying a localized fractional quantum number phi/(2 pi). If the system is finite with length L, we show the existence of a uniform background -phi/(2 pi L) which, though vanishing in the thermodynamic limit, is essential to maintain the conservation of the total integer quantum number. This analysis is also applicable to other systems with fractional quantum numbers, thus providing a mechanism to understand the compatibility of the emergence of fractional quantum number in the thermodynamic limit of a finite system with only integer quantum numbers. For the p-wave pairing case, the Majorana zero mode may occur associated with a real Z(2) soliton, and the fractionalized quantum number is the dimension of the single particle Hilbert space, which turns out to be 1/2. Again for a finite system with length L, there is an accompanying uniform dimension density -1/(2L) to maintain the dimension of the Hilbert space invariant.

The AAO is chosen as the leak element because its conductance remains constant from vacuum to atmosphere. The container to be measured is connected to the vacuum system via the AAO leak element. The dynamic differential pressure decay with time between the inlet and outlet of AAO leak assembly was measured and fitted by an exponential function, followed by volume calculation. The volume of two different containers has been obtained using this method with nitrogen, helium, and argon, respectively. The influence of temperature fluctuation on experimental results under vacuum and atmospheric pressure outlet conditions was discussed. For vacuum outlet conditions, the temperature change caused by pressure decay in one single experiment is small enough to satisfy the isothermal hypothesis, which makes the influence of temperature fluctuation on the experimental results negligible. The preliminary results compared with the static expansion method demonstrate that this novel volume measurement technique is accurate, simple and efficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

For the pure qubit, when the NSIT conditions or the CNSIT conditions are not violated, the ANSIT conditions can not be violated, and a suitable conjunction of the CNSIT conditions and the NSIT conditions may be better for testing macrorealism. While for the driven qubit, the non-violation of the CNSIT conditions implies the non-violation of the NSIT conditions, which in turn implies the non-violation of the ANSIT conditions.

This new mechanism is about the asymmetric geometry of the container, which induces anisotropic thermalization, and results in a density gradient and propels the motor.

Along with the integrated core number increasing, the only shared cache serves too many processing threads to maintain sharing data efficiently. In this work, an enhanced router network is integrated within the private cache level for fast interconnecting sharing data accesses existing in different threads. All sharing data in private cache level can be classified into seven access types by experimental pattern analysis. Then, both shared accesses and thread-crossed accesses can be rapidly detected and dealt with in the proposed router network. As a result, the access latency of private cache is decreased, and a conventional coherence traffic problem is alleviated. The process in the proposed path is composed of three steps. Firstly, the target accesses can be detected by exploring in the router network. Then, the proposed replacement logic can handle those accesses for maintaining data coherence. Finally, those accesses are delivered in the proposed data deliverer. Thus, the harmful data sharing accesses are solved within the first chip layer in 3D-IC structure.

It has been done by solving the Boltzmann equation numerically, using MATLAB. In this work, the relaxation behaviour has been analysed for the temperatures between 0.1 and 3 K.

For 3 K, the global distributions do not change at all with time, but for 0.1 K this change is significant.

J,"Bhandari, C; Satpathy, S",Two dimensional electron gas in the δ-doped iridates with strong spin-orbit coupling: La<sub>δ</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>,"Iridates are of considerable current interest because of the strong spin-orbit coupling that leads to a variety of new phenomena. Using density-functional studies, we predict the formation of a spin-orbital entangled two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the delta-doped iridate La delta Sr2IrO4, where a single SrO layer is replaced by a LaO layer. The extra La electron resides close to the delta-doped layer, partially occupying the J(eff) = 1/2 upper Hubbard band and thereby making the interface metallic. The magnetic structure of the bulk is destroyed near the interface, with the Ir-0 layer closest to the interface becoming non-magnetic, while the next layer (Ir-1) continues to maintain the AFM structure of the bulk, but with a reduced magnetic moment. The Fermi surface consists of a hole pocket and an electron pocket, located in two different Ir layers (Ir-0 and Ir-1), with both carriers derived from the J(eff) = 1/2 upper Hubbard band. The presence of both electrons and holes at the delta-doped interface suggests unusual transport properties, leading to possible device applications.",10.1088/1361-648X/ab2f3f,903,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

We consider Co and Fe single adatoms deposited on a Pt-terminated thin film while a Pt adatom is assumed to be supported by a Co-terminated film. The vacancy is injected in the top-surface layer of the films with both types of termination. After finding the most stable location of the defects, we discuss their magnetic properties tied to those of the substrate and investigate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Previous simulations (Brahimi et al 2016 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 28 496002) predicted a large out-of-plane surface MAE for the Pt-terminated CoPt films (4 meV per f.u.) in contrast to in-plane surface MAE for Co-terminated films (-1 meV per f.u.). Here, we find that the surface MAI:, is significantly modified upon the presence of the atomic defects. All investigated defects induce an in-plane MAE, which is large enough for Fe adatom and Pt vacancy to switch the surface MAE from out-of-plane to in-plane for the Pt-terminated films. Interestingly, among the investigated defects Pt vacancy has the largest effect on the MAE in contrast to Co vacancy, which induced the smallest but still significant effect.

A three-dimensional turbulence simulation is performed, based on the reduced fluid model. The background parallel flow is applied by introducing the time independent parallel momentum source. Changing the magnitude of the momentum source, the behavior of the zonal flow is investigated. The drift wave turbulence is affected by the parallel flow, and it shows the spatial competition between turbulence modes. The spatial competition appears/disappears abruptly, depending on the intensity of the parallel momentum source. As a consequence of the transition between the turbulence state, the radial profile of the turbulence drastically changes, which leads to the change of the turbulence force to drive the zonal flow. In this way, the parallel flow indirectly affects the zonal flow through the deformation of the turbulence.

The spins at the core/shell interface and some parts of the core volume have a random orientation due to the presence of chemical disorder created by the experimental procedures. The mentioned random effects based on the chemical disorder and intermixing of core and shell produces random interactions, which according to the presented model can behave similar to the spin glass system. Due to the existence of a competition between exchange and anisotropy energies, the coercivity field contain two parts: In the first part, the effects of exchange interactions will dominate the effects of anisotropy. As a result, this section will include low anisotropy and frustrated spins, which is coupled to neighbor particles due to the strong exchange interactions. In the second part, which is the volume part of matter, the anisotropy is higher; in this case, the spins are frozen and remain fixed so that the neighbor particles do not have much effect on them. Since the nanoscale particles have a significant value of surface to volume ratio, there will be a competition between these two parts. Energy product variations for FePt/Fe3O4 core/shell increases when coherent rotation is dominant in the core/shell system. By increasing shell thickness, coherent rotation of spins disappears and the magnetization rotation will not be uniform, which leads to a decrease in energy product. To increase the maximum product energy, we need to increase the value of coercivity which is achieved by increasing the core thickness. If we can increase the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of the core, then the coercivity and thus the maximum energy product will increase.",10.1007/s10948-019-05246-x,914,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

This dissipation can have an important feedback on the shape of the CO2 plume during injection, but the impact of vertical pressure dissipation, in particular, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of lateral and vertical pressure dissipation on the injection of CO2 into a layered aquifer system. We develop a compressible, two-phase model that couples pressure dissipation to the propagation of a CO2 gravity current. We show that our vertically integrated, sharp-interface model is capable of efficiently and accurately capturing water migration in a layered aquifer system with an arbitrary number of aquifers. We identify two limiting cases - 'no leakage' and 'strong leakage' - in which we derive analytical expressions for the water pressure field for the corresponding single-phase injection problem. We demonstrate that pressure dissipation acts to suppress the formation of an advancing CO2 tongue during injection, reducing the lateral extent of the plume. The properties of the seals and the number of aquifers determine the strength of pressure dissipation and subsequent coupling with the CO2 plume.

It is shown that the power and wavelength of the heralded photon source, together with the angular accuracy of the measurement of the photon polarization rotation, form the main constraints to determine the type of gravitational waves sources, which would be the target of HOM gravitational wave spectrometers. The currently available pW power heralded photon sources, with typical heralded photon frequencies in the order of 10(14) Hz (visible-UV part of the optical spectrum) are totally unsuitable, in terms of required detection time for any of the GW sources, which are presently targeted by ground and space based GW detectors. The operation of the HOM interferometer as a GW spectrometer is illustrated with a numerical model that uses the gravitational wave strain data recorded by LIGO on 14 September 2015 (GW150914 event). Assuming an angular accuracy of mu rad for the measurement of photons polarization rotation, these measurements could only be carried out with HOM interferometer's arm lengths of the order of 10.000 km (only achievable in space, if we do not use optical cavities), and by using heralded photon sources of about 1 W power, producing heralded photons with wavelengths in the radio-wave band of the electromagnetic spectrum, 10 MHz. Although the technology to produce this type of heralded photon sources is currently not available, a brief discussion of the possible implementation of a large arm HOM interferometer in space is introduced.",10.1088/1361-6382/ab42df,927,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

In the first stage, a minimum energy cluster structure is generated by an unbiased global search algorithm coupled with a DFT code using a light XC functional and small basis sets. In the second stage, the obtained cluster structure is further optimized by another round of global minimization search coupled with a DFT calculator using a heavier XC functional and more costly basis set. Electronic properties of the structures are illustrated in the form of a ternary diagram.

We adopt flavor-dependent quark imaginary chemical potentials, namely, (mu(u), mu(d), mu(s))/iT = (theta - 2 pi C/3, theta,theta + 2 pi C/3) with C is an element of [0, 1]. The RW periodicity is guaranteed and the center symmetry of Z(3)-QCD is explicitly broken when C not equal 1 and/or quark masses are nondegenerate. For N-f = 3 and C not equal 1, the RW transition occurs at theta = theta(RW) = (2k + 1)pi/3(k is an element of Z), which becomes stronger with decrease of C. When C = 1, the theta(RW) turns into 2k pi/3 for N-f = 2 + 1, but keeps (2k + 1)pi/3 for N-f = 1 + 2; in both cases, the RWtransitions get stronger with the mass mismatch. For other C not equal 0 cases, the theta(RW)'s are not integral multiples of pi/3. We find that the RWtransition is more sensitive to the deviation of C from one compared to the mass nondegeneracy, and thus the strength of the traditional RW transition with C = 0 is the strongest.

A standard approach is to saturate the pore space with a fluid and perform NMR relaxation measurements. The standard measurements are sensitive to the low-lying diffusion eigenmodes and they allow an estimation of the pore size distribution. To obtain more complete information about the pore geometry including connectivity, it is necessary to determine the entire set of eigenmodes. Towards this goal, we present here a new approach to excite and detect higher eigenmodes that are not visible in standard relaxation measurements. The method is based on a two-dimensional pulse sequence that incorporates a pair of gradient pulses. The validity of our methodology was tested on a sample of bulk water that has an eigenmode spectrum that is known.

Thus a simple iterative geometry-based interface-preserving reinitialization is proposed to reconstruct a signed distance function (SDF) while fixing the interface location with the combination of the external and internal iterations. The external iteration is used to restore the nature of the SDF. And the internal iteration firstly determines displacement errors of zero-level-set interpolation points via the geometric position of the interface, then the errors are redistributed iteratively to adjacent nodes until moving zero-level-set interpolation points are driven back to their original positions. The novel approach performs excellent mass conservation and shape preservation without sacrificing the simplicity of the iterative reinitialization.

Our investigation demonstrates that metal nanoparticles are responsible for inducing plasmonic and light trapping effects, where their spatial arrangement, geometry and position in transparent conductive oxide (TCO) play a crucial role in modulating the electrode optical and electrical properties. Besides, an enhanced average transmittance and reduced sheet resistance over the conventional electrodes are recorded.

We also compute the stability of extended nonlinear modes showing significant differences from the usual homogeneous nonlinear array. The transmission of a nonlinear pulse across the void shows three main regimes-transmission, reflection, and trapping at the void's position-and we identify a critical momentum for the pulse below (above) where the pulse gets reflected (transmitted), or trapped indefinitely at the void's position. For relatively wide pulses, we observe a steep increase from a regime of no transmission to a regime of high transmission, as the amplitude of the soliton increases beyond a critical wave-vector value. Finally, we consider the transmission of an extended nonlinear wave across the void impurity numerically, finding a rather complex structure of the transmission as a function of wave vector, with the creation of more and more transmission gaps as nonlinearity increases.

For these reasons, cosmic ray instruments are common on both scientific spacecraft and operational spacecraft such as weather satellites. Cosmic rays (CRs) and Solar energetic particles (SEPs) include ions over the full range of elements found in the Solar System. High-resolution measurements of the energy spectra of space radiation are key to understanding both acceleration and propagation processes. An inherent challenge is the large range of energies of such spectra. Cosmic ray energies range up to over 10(21) eV, while SEPs can reach a few GeV. Multi-instrument measurements are currently required to cover the full range of particle energies. Indeed, the highest energy particles, due to the rarity, can only be measured with ground-based instruments using the atmosphere as a calorimeter. Over limited energy ranges, SEP spectra are often approximated by a power law; however, over the full energy range, SEP events exhibit changing spectral shapes (e.g. ""knees"", ""roll-overs"" and ""cut-offs""). These features give information about the acceleration processes, such as size of the acceleration region, time of acceleration, morphology of the magnetic field during acceleration, and others, all of which can vary from event to event. Measurements of such features are often compromised by the need to combine measurements from more than one instrument, each with its own limited energy range. Even if there are no gaps between the energy intervals of the instruments, differing systematics can severely impact data analysis. A single instrument capable of measurements over a continuous and extended energy range would offer vastly more reliable measurement of the energy spectra of SEP events as well as replacing multiple instruments on resource-limited spacecraft. The most common method to measure GCRs and SEPs from a few to similar to 100 MeV for protons, is Si Solid-State Detector (SSD) stacks. Above these energies, Cherenkov detectors are typically used together with SSDs. Ideally, to provide full energy coverage with no gaps, this requires a Cherenkov radiator with a threshold of similar to 100 MeV. No suitable Cherenkov detector with such a low threshold has been developed. We are in the process of developing a synthetic diamond Cherenkov detector for this purpose. Diamond's high index of refraction (2.42) results in a theoretical threshold of 92 MeV for protons. Even with a practical threshold of similar to 110 MeV, this is ideal for extending the energy range from that of SSDs alone to that of sapphire Cherenkov detectors (202 MeV threshold) with higher energies attainable using plastic Cherenkov detectors. Both Sapphire and plastic Cherenkov radiators have spaceflight heritage.",10.1016/j.nima.2019.162338,943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in recent years He-3 has become severely scarce, which led to a tremendous price increase and acquisition restrictions of this material. Motivated by this, the development of He-3-free solutions became a priority. In a previous work, we have established a novel concept for neutron detection: a proportional counter with boron carbide (B4C) fine powder suspended in the proportional gas, forming a neutron sensitive aerosol that relies on the B-10 neutron capture reaction. Computer simulations and prototype exposure to a cold neutron beam yielded favorable results, validating the detection concept, which may also be applied to hard x-ray and gamma ray detection by using fine particles made of a heavy element, such as Bi or Au. In this work we study the effect of the presence of B4C microparticles in the charge gain and energy resolution of a proportional counter filled with Ar-CH4 (90%-10%), by irradiation with x-rays from a Fe-55 source. For the same applied voltage, an average gain loss by a factor of 36% and energy resolution (FWHM) increase by 15% (absolute value) was observed with the inclusion of B-4 C microparticles. Intrinsic energy resolution was calculated, obtaining 15% for pure P10 operation and 32% in the presence of the microparticles. While the gain drop is recoverable by increasing anode voltage, energy resolution degradation may be a drawback in low energy applications, were energy resolution is favored over detection efficiency.",10.1016/j.nima.2019.162392,944,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate here that the direction of self-propulsion, relative to the particle orientation, may be as influential for the phase behavior as the pair interactions are for passive particles, and enable dynamic properties that are not available to passive systems. We perform simulations on ensembles of self-propelled squares, and find that squares that self-propel in the direction perpendicular to a side rapidly reach a steady state with a characteristic cluster distribution, positional order, and well-defined diffusion constant. After tuning the direction towards a corner, the particles form large and dense clusters that show a transient collective motion, and display remarkable fluctuations over long time scales, with a distinct periodicity. Clusters of these particles appear unstable beyond a critical size, and susceptible to a catastrophic disintegration. Directionality is found to effect equally sharp transitions in the mixing properties of active squares and passive squares, and the behavior of the passive ensemble.

J,"Petersen, OL",On the Cauchy Problem for the Linearised Einstein Equation,"A classical problem in general relativity is the Cauchy problem for the linearised Einstein equation (the initial value problem for gravitational waves) on a globally hyperbolic vacuum spacetime. A well-known result is that it is uniquely solvable up to gauge solutions, given initial data on a spacelike Cauchy hypersurface. The solution map is an isomorphism between initial data (modulo gauge producing initial data) and solutions (modulo gauge solutions). In the first part of this work, we show that the solution map is actually an isomorphism of locally convex topological vector spaces. This implies that the equivalence class of solutions depends continuously on the equivalence class of initial data. We may therefore conclude well-posedness of the Cauchy problem. In the second part, we show that the linearised constraint equations can always be solved on a closed manifold with vanishing scalar curvature. This generalises the classical notion of TT-tensors on flat space used to produce models of gravitational waves. All our results are proven for smooth and distributional initial data of arbitrary real Sobolev regularity.",10.1007/s00023-019-00857-5,949,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deceleration parameter (q) is marginally less than zero indicating accelerating universe. The scale factor (S) is graphically shown with time. The model represents oscillating universe between the above-mentioned limits. Because of the bounce in QSSC, the maximum density phase is still matter-dominated.

J,"Bao, LP; Li, WY; Wu, LQ",Singularly perturbed solutions of a class of non-Fourier temperature field distribution,"Thermoelastic coupling model excited by laser is of great significance in engineering. To study the thermoelastic coupling model, the distribution of temperature field must be determined firstly. Because the laser excitation time is short (usually femtosecond), the traditional Fourier heat conduction law is no longer suitable. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the distribution of temperature field by using the non-Fourier heat conduction law. Previous studies on the temperature field model mostly use numerical analysis and computer simulation to discuss its numerical solution, but few can directly solve the analytical solution of the model. Up to now, there are few reports about using singularly perturbed analysis method to solve the asymptotic solution of temperature field model and determine the jumping position of heat conductivity coefficient. In this paper, a temperature field model is constructed by using the non-Fourier heat conduction law, i.e. a class of singularly perturbed hyperbolic equations with small parameters in an unbounded domain. The nonlinear singularly perturbed two-parameter hyperbolic equations with discontinuous coefficients are obtained when the heat conduction coefficients jump due to sharp temperature changes. By using the singularly perturbed biparametric expansion method, the asymptotic solution of the problem is obtained. First, the expansion of the problem is obtained by using singularly perturbed method. The existence and uniqueness of the internal and external solutions are obtained by estimating the maximum modulus of the internal and external solutions and the maximum modulus estimates of the time derivatives, and the formal asymptotic expansion of the solutions is obtained. Secondly, the singularly perturbed hyperbolic equation is corrected by the singular perturbation theory, and the derivative of the solution is estimated. The position expression of the jump of the thermal conductivity coefficient is determined by the Fourier transform, and the seam method is used to connect the seams of the two sides of the jump position of the thermal conductivity coefficient, thus the form asymptotic expansion of the solution is obtained. Finally, the uniform validity of the asymptotic solution is obtained by estimating the residual term, and the distribution of the temperature field with discontinuous heat conduction coefficient is obtained. In this paper, we have synthetically applied the knowledge of ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, mathematical and physical equations, nonlinear acoustics, mathematical analysis, singular perturbation theory and so on, which enriched the study of non-Fourier temperature field model.",10.7498/aps.68.20190144,953,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,,,

J,"He, TC; Li, J",Measurement of gravity acceleration by cold atoms in a harmonic trap using Kapitza-Dirac pulses,"The interferometry of two Kapitza-Dirac (KD) pulses acting on cold atoms in a harmonic oscillator potential well is investigated by Feynman path integral method. The wave function and density distribution function of the system at a given time are calculated analytically by using the propagator under the action of an external field. The first KD pulse acts on cold atoms to produce a large number of modes in the harmonic oscillator potential well. The maximum value of wave packet of mode 0 is larger than those of other modes. These modes evolve along different paths. The external field changes the phase of each mode and makes the evolution path of the mode deviate from that without the external field. When the second KD pulse is added, it splits the mode of the first KD pulse, and thus generates more modes. These modes will evolve along different paths under the action of external field and harmonic potential well, and interfere with each other. At the moment of measurement, all the wave packets are separated without overlapping. The effect of the external field does not change the magnitude of the density distribution at the time of measurement, but makes the wave packet of each mode shift. The phase difference between adjacent modes decreases linearly with the increase of field intensity. When the external field is a gravity field, we calculate the Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao lower bound. The Fisher information is proportional to the mass of atoms and inversely to the third power of harmonic potential well frequency. We can improve the measurement accuracy of interferometer by reducing the frequency of harmonic potential well and increasing atomic mass. When the initial state is the ground state of the harmonic potential well, the accuracy of the gravity acceleration measured by the interference device can be obtained to be 10(-9) by using the experimental parameters. The initial state is the ground state of the harmonic potential well and the external field, and the calculation result indicates that the measurement accuracy will decrease. At the same time, the enhancement of inter-atomic repulsion and attraction interaction will also lead the measurement accuracy to increase.",10.7498/aps.68.20190749,955,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no

However, it usually needs synthesizing through a complicated multistep process involving high temperature (e.g., 1350 degrees C), severe reduction (e.g., 700-1300 C for up to 240 h in Ca or Ti metal vapor atmosphere) and post-purification. Owing to the H2O sensitivity of mayenite, the post-purification is quite troublesome once impurities are introduced. High-density, loosely bound encaged electrons with a low work function make it promise to possess practical applications. Therefore the facile method of massively producing the high-quality C12A7:e- with high Ne is extremely desired. In this work, C12A7:e- bulks are for the first time synthesized by simple spark plasma sintering process directly from a mixture of C12A7, CA and Ca powders under milder conditions (e.g., sintered at 1070 C for 10 min in a vacuum). The obtained electride, which exhibits a relative density of 99%, an electron concentration of 2.3x 1021 cm-3 and an obvious absorption peak at 2.5 eV, is obtained via SPS process at 1100 C for 10 min. Electronic structure is also investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance. The occurrence of Dysonian characteristic, a typical feature of good electronic conductors, strongly suggests that the electrons are trapped in mayenite cavities. Furthermore, the obtained C12A7:e- exhibits good sinterabilty on a crystal scale of 5-40 um. Thermionic emission test results show that the thermionic emission begins to occur at 700 K and a large current density of 1.75 A/cm2 is obtained in the electron thermal emission from a flat surface of the polycrystalline C12A7:e- with an effective work function of 2.09 eV for a temperature of 1373 K with an applied electric field of 35000 V/cm in a vacuum. Owing to no external reductant is needed, this developed route exhibits notable superiority over the conventional reduction method for phase-pure C12A7:e-.

J,"Liang, JL; Zhang, Y; Qiu, XY; Wu, SY; Luo, Y",First-principles study of Fe:Mg:LiTaO<sub>3</sub> crystals,"The electronic structures and absorption spectra of LiTaO3 (LT) crystal and Fe:Mg:LiTaO3 crystal with different Mg concentrations are investigated by first-principles through using the density functional theory. The supercell crystal structures are established with 60 atoms with four models: the near-stoichiometric pure LiTaO3 crystal (LT); the iron doped LiTaO3 crystal (Fe:LT), with the charge compensation model expressed as Fe-Li(2+)-2V(Li)(-); the iron and magnesium co-doped LiTaO3 crystal (Fe:Mg:LT), with the charge compensation model taken as Fe-Li(2+)-Mg-Li+-3V(Li)(-); the other iron and magnesium co-doped LiTaO3 crystal (Fe:Mg(E):LT), with Mg ion concentration near threshold value (slightly less than 6 mol%) and taking the charge compensation model as 2Mg(Li)(+)-FeTa2-. The geometry optimization results show that the total energy values of all models can achieve certain stable values, which means that the models used in this paper are very close to the actual crystal structures. In the electronic structures, the extrinsic defect energy levels in the forbidden band of Fe:LT crystal are mainly contributed from the Fe 3d orbital, and the band gap of Fe:LT about 3.05 eV is narrower than that of LT, the band gap of Fe:Mg:LT and Fe:Mg(E):LT sample are 2.72 eV and 2.45 eV respectively. The results show that the orbit of Fe 3d, Ta 5d and O 2p are superposed with each other, forming covalent bonds, which results in conduction band and valence band shifting toward low energy in iron doped LiTaO3 crystal. The Fe 3d orbit is split into E-g orbit and T-2g orbit under the influence of the crystal field. There are two absorption peaks at 417 nm (2.97 eV) and 745 nm (1.66 eV) in the Fe:LiTaO3 crystal. The first one is attributed to the transfer of the T-2g orbital electron to conduction band. The last one can be taken as the result of E-g electron transfer of Fe2+ in crystal. The intensities and positions of these peaks vary with the concentration of Mg ion. Specially, with the concentration of Mg ion attaining the threshold value, the peak at 745 nm disappears, and the other peak moves slightly to 457 nm (2.71 eV). With the Mg ion concentration at the threshold value, the Fe ions can occupy Ta positions. This occupying condition makes the E-g orbital energy change greatly compared with the scenario in the Fe-Li condition, and it affects hardly the T-2g orbital energy. So, if the absorption nearby 745 nm waveband can be taken as the useful process in holographic storage application, it is better to take smaller concentration of Mg ions (less than threshold value). On the other hand, nearby 457 nm waveband, concentration of Mg ions can be chosen as a large value.",10.7498/aps.68.20190575,958,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Periodic disk array structure reduces the surface plasmon frequency of Ti, excites the spoof surface plasmons in the THz band and leads to resonance enhanced absorption. The resonance absorption frequency is determined by the structural parameters of Ti disk array including period and diameter while the absorption rate of THz wave is greatly affected by the thickness of Ti disks. The resonant cavity in micro-bridge structure can reduce the resonance frequency and enhance the coupling efficiency.

J,"Wang, RX; Li, X; Li, L; Xiao, YC; Xu, SW",Stability analysis in three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction,"Spin-transfer torque-based magnetic random access memory is becoming more and more attractive in industry due to its non-volatility, fast switching speed and infinite endurance. However, it suffers energy and speed bottlenecks, so the magnetic tunnel junction urgently needs a new write scheme. Compared with the spintransfer torque, emerging spin-orbit torque will replace spin-transfer torque as a new write scheme of magnetic storage technology for its faster writing speed and avoiding the barrier breakdown. A three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction consists of magnetic tunnel junction/heavy metal structure offers a promising perspective from a technological point of view in the design of new generation of magnetic random access memory, for it is possible to control the magnetization dynamics through two current densities of spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque. In this paper, the stability of magnetic states in the three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction is studied theoretically. Through linearizing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation including the spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque defined in the spherical coordinates, the new equilibrium directions and linear differential equations are obtained. Performing linear stability analysis of the new equilibrium directions, the phase diagrams defined by the direction of pinned-layer magnetization vector and the current density of spin-orbit torque are obtained. Several magnetic states are distinguished in the phase diagram, such as in-plane precessional and stable states, out-of-plane precessional and stable states. When the pinned-layer magnetization vector rotates out of the film plane, through adjusting the direction of pinned-layer magnetization vector, the switching from stable state to precessional one can be realized. Orientating the pinned-layer magnetization vector in the film plane, neither the out-of-plane precession nor stable states emerges for the current density of spin-orbit torque and spin-transfer torque are relatively small. The instability current takes a minimum value with the pinned-layer magnetization vector nearly parallel or antiparallel to the easy axis of free layer and increases with the direction of pinned-layer magnetization vector deviating from these two locations. The magnetization reversal can be realized through adjusting the current density of spin-transfer torque, and the reversal time can decrease greatly under the assisting of spin-orbit torque. By showing the dependence of magnetization vector on the time of different magnetic states, the validity of phase diagram is confirmed. The selecting of the different directions of the pinned-layer magnetization vector provides an alternative way to control the current-driven magnetization dynamics.

J,"Ye, HF; Jin, D; Kuang, B; Yang, YH",Effect of equilibrium distribution positivity on numerical performance of lattice Boltzmann method,"Traditionally, the numerical performance of the lattice Boltzmann method is mainly determined by the moment degree of a discrete equilibrium distribution. The equilibrium distribution positivity is merely considered as an ancillary property which is used to constrict the numerical configuration. With the newly-developed partial Gaussian-Hermite quadrature scheme, the positivity of equilibrium distribution is validated as an independent property like moment degree which can be adjusted by discrete velocities. Researchers speculated that the positivity should also be significant for the numerical performance by the lattice Boltzmann method and can be used to improve the performance. Comparing with the classical improvement through moment degree, the positivity approach will not bring additional computation. However, due to the lack of boundary treatment, the speculation has not been validated by detailed numerical simulations. In this paper, through employing a periodic case, the Taylor-Green vortex, to avoid the boundary issue, we in depth analyze the numerical effect of the model positivity, including the numerical accuracy in the model positive range, the influence of positivity on the numerical performance, and the significance comparison between positivity and moment degree. The results show that for a given model, the numerical accuracy is not consistent in the whole positive range. As the configuration is close to the border of positive range, the accuracy will degrade though it is still acceptable. The numerical performance of a model depends on both moment degree and positivity. The role that the moment degree plays lies mainly in the qualification of a model on Galilean invariance. Once a model fulfills the Galilean invariance, its numerical performance is solely dependent on the positivity. Hence, the improvement approach through modifying the model positivity is a viable solution, and a Galilean invariant model with wider positive range does possess a better numerical performance regardless of its moment degree. Furthermore, based on the numerical results in this paper, all DnHm models with high moment degree are better than the classical D2Q9 model.

In this process of harmonic generation, the length of nonlinear crystal is an important factor affecting the conversion efficiency and beam-quality. The optimal length of the nonlinear crystal is influenced by incident laser parameters and crystal absorption coefficient. At present, for the UV 355 nm picosecond laser generated from extra-cavity sum frequency, published are few reports about detailed analysis and research on the influence of photon ratio of the incident laser beams and nonlinear crystal absorption on optimal length of sum frequency crystal. In this paper, the steady-state solutions with the highest conversion efficiency under different incident conditions are obtained by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of the three waves coupling equations. The effects of different photon ratios and absorption effect of the sum frequency crystal on the optimum crystal length are analyzed. We propose a solution based on the fundamental frequency laser amplified to shorten crystal length and improve conversion efficiency. In this scheme, the 532 nm second harmonic laser with a high conversion efficiency over 65% can be achieved by LiB3O5 crystal. After that, the 1064 nm fundamental frequency laser is separated from the second harmonic laser, and then it is amplified by the Nd:YVO4 laser crystal pumped by an 808 nm laser diode. Finally, the ultraviolet 355 nm picosecond laser is obtained by combining the 1064 nm fundamental frequency laser with the 532 nm second harmonic laser in the LiB3O5 crystal. The simulation results show that the incident photon ratio of the sum frequency reaction can be changed by amplifying the residual fundamental frequency laser, and the optimum length of the sum-frequency crystal corresponding to the highest conversion efficiency can be shortened. Meanwhile, the absorption and walk-away effect of the sum frequency crystal can be also reduced. The final 355 nm laser output power can be increased more than 40 percent compared with the traditional scheme of early reports. In consequence, the high sum frequency conversion efficiency of the UV 355 nm picosecond laser can be obtained by changing the photo ratio of the incident laser beams through amplifying the fundamental frequency laser.",10.7498/aps.68.20190876,966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Zhou, GZ; Li, Y; Lan, T; Dai, JJ; Wang, CO; Wang, ZY",Design and simulation of integration of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers and heterojunction bipolar transistor,"Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are widely used in the field of short-range optical communication and optical interconnection because of their advantages such as low threshold current, large modulation bandwidth, easy two-dimensional integration, easy coupling with optical fibers and low cost. The VCSELs and heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) are longitudinal current devices, so they can be well integrated on the same wafer, and the output light power can be modulated by the HBT base current. Integration of VCSELs and HBT are designed in this paper. The VCSELs and PNP InGaP/GaAs HBT form a direct series structure. The reflectivity of DBR is 99.72% at a resonant wavelength of 850 nm and 99.57% after adding HBT separately. Therefore, the addition of HBT has little influence on the reflectivity of DBR at the resonant wavelength. The electro-optical characteristics of the integrated structure are simulated by using PICS3D software. An interim collector is added into the model in order to ensure that the simulation can be carried out smoothly. Firstly, HBT is conducted and the current flows from the emitter to the interim collector. Then, the voltage across the interim collector and the N-type electrode is increased to make VCSELs conducted and the current of the transition collector drop to zero. The interim collector can be removed from the actual structure because the current is zero. The simulation results show that the current gain coefficient is 400, and the maximum modulation rate of the base current to the output light power rises up to 280 mW/mA. The maximum temperature in the active region increases with the base current increasing, and the output light power first increases and then tends to be saturated.

The phase composition, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of (1 - x) Li2Zn3Ti4O12-x CaTiO3 (x = 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 wt%) ceramics were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDS and network analyzer.

The SEM micrographs shown that as the CaTiO3 contents increased, the average grain size of the composition ceramics decreased. The microwave dielectric properties of the composition ceramics can be effectively controlled by varying the CaTiO3 contents. The values of dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and tau(f) of the composition ceramics were increased, and the quality factor (Q x f) was decreased with increasing the CaTiO3 contents.

We focus on the impact of variable reactivity of patchy particles on the form of miscibility gap. We show that the variation of model parameters determining features of interparticle interaction makes it possible to obtain miscibility gaps of different types within the unified formalism. In particular, we uncover two different mechanisms of the formation of phase separation curves with lower critical solution temperature. The first mechanism is realised in the case of positive bonding energy; the second one can takes place when the energy of formation of two-bonded particles is lower than that for all other m-bonded ones. We conclude that the most interesting and non-trivial phase behavior is observed in the case of patchy particles with variable reactivity. Using rigorous statistical model, we uncover new mechanisms of phase separation in a solution consisting of patchy particles, which are capable to form directed and saturated thermoreversible bonds.

The structure and chemical composition of the ferrites were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The presence of peaks in the XRD patterns was confirmed by the formation of a cubic spinel structure, because the main peaks of the patterns were related to the single-phase cubic spinel structure with PDF-number of 008-0234. The XRD patterns showed a slight shifting in peaks position due to unstable spacing values with increasing Mg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ contents in all ferrites. The mean crystallite size and lattice constant were determined from the Scherer's formula and XRD data. They were found to have been increased by the increase of x concentration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images were used to analyze the ferrites' structures. In addition, room temperature magnetization and coercivity of ferrites were determined from the hysteresis loops in a magnetic field of 9 kOe by alternative gradient force magnetometer. It was found that the magnetization and coercivity of ferrites with increasing x contents were increased, which is discussed according to the site's occupation of the substituted cations on the sub-lattices. Among all synthesized ferrites, Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.8 showed the highest magnetization and coercively, whereas Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.0 displayed the lowest corresponding values.

In this paper, we propose a plasmonic nanoantenna with PT-symmetric potential for unidirectional scattering functionality. The studied plasmonic nanoantenna is comprised of three metallic layers separated by two dielectric layers. Such kind of system, with the same coefficient kappa of loss and gain in each of the two dielectric layers, holds the characteristic of PT symmetry. We show that the unidirectional scattering is obtained for the passive structure (i.e., kappa = 0), and the switching between forward and backward directionality can be achieved with a single structure by changing the excitation wavelength, when the induced electric dipole (ED) and magnetic dipole (MD) modes satisfy the first or second Kerker conditions, respectively. In addition, we find that the forward-to-backward ratio spectra can be strongly affected by the non-Hermiticity parameter kappa. In particular, it is possible to reverse the radiation direction at the same wavelength in a wide spectra band by adjusting kappa. Moreover, putting the nanoantennas in an array of transverse configuration can efficiently narrow the main lobe angular beam width to be <6 degrees.

From the analysis results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Hall-effect measurement, the amorphous GeSn film starts to crystallize at 450 degrees C while the crystallinity enhances at 500 degrees C by employing rapid thermal annealing (RTA) as the film crystallization process. With capping layer on the whole region, the hole concentration becomes too high to turn the JL P-TFTs off. However, by limiting capping layer on source/drain region to increase hole concentration, total series resistance is reduced due to lower sheet resistance and contact resistance, which consequently improves the drive current, I-ON/I-OFF ratio and field-effect mobility. Based on the best process conditions and structure to form the poly-GeSn JL P-TFTs, I-ON/I-OFF ratio up to 5.6 x 10(2) are achieved while peak field-effect mobility of 20.8 cm(2)/Vs is obtained.

J,"Cotter, J; Guldiken, R",Vertical manipulation of fluids through electrostatic formation: model development and experimental validation,"A novel actuation method, called electrostatic formation (ESF), for MEMS and other applications, is introduced. The ESF mechanism uses a droplet of liquid material that is electrostatically deformed. ESF differs from Electrowetting and Electrowetting on Dielectric as the electrode used to apply the voltage is of a smaller diameter than the droplet being manipulated, and the electrode is located above the manipulated fluid. Modeling this movement requires adherence to the Lippmann and Young-Laplace equations simultaneously. In order to understand how the surface tension is specifically manipulated, as is required for the development of a model of representation of the phenomenon, a force-based interpretation of the Lippmann equation is outlined, with focus on how it compares to the force response provided by hydrostatic pressure under the influence of gravitational field forces. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a differential surface charge must be present of which the formulation is complex in nature, likely stemming from the combination of the internal pressure and a localized skin effect caused by an electric double layer that is present at the surface of the transformed liquid. In this study, a target liquid of gallium is manipulated under electrostatic charge in a physical experiment and compared against the geometry suggested by the developed model.

We observed oscillations of the melting transition line, in which the oscillating part of the melting temperature has sharp peaks when the number of vortices N exactly coincides with the triangular number n(n + 1)/2 (n is an integer number), at least for N < 50. This is in contrast to the case of square shapes where the enhancements appeared as broad peaks around N = n(2). Furthermore, the field ranges of the N-vortex state expand at the triangular numbers of N, suggesting that the triangular number of vortices has a more stable configuration than the others. Numerical studies on the configuration of vortices in a triangle shape show that geometrical matching with no defect structures is realized at the triangular numbers, whereas an edge dislocation often appears in the other nonmatching cases.

In contrast to most of the conservative methods, the current approach does not modify the mesh and therefore, the connection between variables at both sides of the interfaces is solved using interpolation. The conservation of fluxes is imposed by a pair of vector equations which relates the matrix coefficients of the Finite Volume problem with the weighting factors used for interpolating. These relations are satisfied by projecting the matrix coefficients from an interface to its opposite and then computing the weighting factors according to a conservation principle. This new strategy is implemented for an incompressible flow solver including a transport equation of a scalar function. The conservation and accuracy properties of the proposed methodology are analyzed in a set of numerical problems where the theory and the computational implementation are validated.

In this work, we present an estimation of the refractive index of an alternative gas, Octafluoropropane (R-218), and we explore its feasibility as a Cherenkov radiator, for tagging charged particles at momenta as low as 2 GeV/c.",10.1016/j.nimb.2019.07.014,989,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Efremidze, L; Stanley, DJ; Park, A; Wasilewski, N",Empirical implementation of entropy risk factor model: A test on Chilean peso,"Currencies are used by many investors as a speculative or investment instrument. Their movements are complex and there are exchange rate models which suggest how to predict long and short-term fluctuations. In this paper we investigate the predictability of an exchange rate with an entropy risk factor model. Considering that recent studies find complex systems characteristics of financial markets, we explore the usefulness of sample entropy as a risk factor for currency fluctuations. The empirical testing of sample entropy is based on the data of the Chilean peso (CLP) exchange rate for the period of January 1, 2005 and November 25, 2016. We find evidence that Chilean peso market has enough market inefficiencies that can be profitably exploited by the sample entropy based prediction algorithm developed in this paper.

In this work, we report a new and facile strategy to prepare three-dimensional (3D) Au/C networks comprised of carbonaceous skeletons and tiny gold nanoparticles by directly carbonizing the nanoporous block copolymer films complexed with the gold salts. The robust complexation makes it ease of generating numerous dispersed gold nanoparticles with an average diameter as small as approximate to 15 nm confined in the carbonaceous frameworks after carbonization. Thus-developed Au/C networks are highly expected to find widespread applications such as catalysis, sensing, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Hermida-Ramon, JM; Öhrn, A; Karlström, G",Structure and spectrum of the hydrated electron. A combined quantum chemical statistical mechanical simulation,"In the current work, in order to model a free electron solvated in water, we have implemented a method to represent the molecular charge distribution as a set of Slater-type functions within the framework of a QM/MM method called QMSTAT. Also, it has been introduced in this method a new approach to calculate the intermolecular induction energy in the presence of very strong electric fields. Unlike most previous potentials, our method uses the ab initio energies of the electron-water complex as reference to obtain the few fitted parameters that the model needs, instead of the ab initio potential of the electron. A Metropolis-Monte Carlo simulation of 15 million steps has been carried out in a system that consists of an electron solvated in 200 water molecules explicitly described. The obtained results predict a vertical electron detachment energy of 3.30 eV and a radius of gyration of 2.38 angstrom, which are in very good agreement with the experimental data of 3.27+0.10 eV and 2.45 angstrom, respectively. We have also obtained the absorption spectrum of the hydrated electron from our simulation. The maximum of the spectrum agrees very well with the experimental result and the experimental width at half-maximum is only 0.11 eV wider than the calculated curve. The calculations predict the same blue tail as the experimental result but with a less smooth shape. Also, our results indicate that the transfer of intensity from the transition arriving to the highest of the three p states to transitions arriving to higher-lying states contributes to the intensity enhancement of the blue tail of the spectrum. Regarding the solvated structure of the free electron, we have found that if the basis center is used as the electron site to calculate the correlation functions, the results predict a structure where the electron places itself on top of a central water molecule surrounded by the remaining water molecules in a very organized and stable arrangement. However, if the maximum of the electron density is used as electron site the obtained picture shows an electron located in a very fluctuating cavity that collapses and reforms continuously.

This study investigates the interaction between graphene and aluminum oxide layer (Al2O3) and the influence of Al2O3 on the properties of graphene. The electrical characterization demonstrates the tunability in the resistivity of Al2O3/Gr devices by applying V-g. Al2O3 deposition introduced n-doping in graphene and is affirmed by shifting of charge neutrality point towards negative V-g. The selective coverage of channel, results in the formation of p-n junction within graphene FET which becomes more pronounced upon DUV treatment. Moreover, the study validates the modulation in interface properties of pristine GFET and Al2O3/Gr at different V-g and temperatures. An enhancement in the intervalley and phase coherence scattering rates is observed for Al2O3/Gr device. Therefore, the effect of dielectric layer on graphene based field effect transistors would be of great interest to tune the properties the device.",10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.06.157,994,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Jiang, J; Zhou, TS",Nontrivial effects of uncertainty on epidemic spreading under limited resources,"While epidemic spreading often involves uncertainty (represented by noise), its control depends on the resource amount to be invested. It is unclear how the noise affects epidemic spreading under limited resources. Here we analyze an artificial model of epidemic spreading on a two-layer network, which considers three factors often neglected in other studies: noise, resource amount and time delay. We find that the noise can significantly impact epidemic spreading, depending on resource amount, sub-network topology, connection strength between sub-networks, and time delay. Main findings include: (1) for a given number of resources, a stronger noise correlates to a smaller fraction of the population infected. Moreover, if the more resources are invested, then the effect of the noise in reducing the fraction of the population infected becomes more apparent; (2) for a large range of time delay or topology degree, there is an optimal noise intensity such that the fraction of the population infected is smallest. These findings would provide useful guidelines for government decisions on the control of epidemic spreading.

We determined a maximum intra-pulse phase distortion (B-integral) of 21.2 rad by mixing the burst with a reference. The difference in the B-integral between the first and last pulse in the burst was large, 12.8 rad, but can be compensated for. Moreover, burst-to-burst amplitude fluctuations (standard deviation, std) were below 6%, where phase fluctuations were similar to 0.6 rad (std) or less. Even if these fluctuations cannot be compensated for, they still allow for efficient coherent combination, which opens up for transform-limited or narrow-line high-energy divided-pulse amplification with single-frequency seeding.",10.1109/LPT.2019.2942175,997,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

We prove the robustness of delay parameters on prices of underlying asset and prices of three types of options, which differ in their payoff functions. We provide numerical experiments which validate our theoretical results and find that when the underlying assets exist delayed response, the corresponding impact on option prices is robust with respect to the small changes in delay parameters.

J,"Ling, X; Chen, JJ; Guo, N; Zhu, KJ; Long, JC; Shi, Q; Jiang, R",Multiple states induced by dynamic speed allocation in dynamical networks,"Most previous studies on dynamical networks assume that all nodes move at the same speed, but the moving speed of each node in realistic system tends to differ from each other. In this paper, we propose a dynamic speed allocation algorithm with maximum speed based on the degree of nodes. By adjusting a tunable parameter in the algorithm, we obtain three different stable states in the network: uniform, clustered and decentralized state. There are two thresholds to describe the phase transitions between them. The transportation capacity of the network in clustered state is the best, the second in uniform state and the worst in decentralized state. It is found that there exists an optimal tunable parameter in clustered state, leading to the maximum traffic throughput of the network. Combining the spatial distribution of nodes, the nodes will aggregate into a group in clustered state or many different groups in decentralized state. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previous reports have shown that the two-band and spin paramagnetic effects are responsible for the inter-plane (H//c) and in-plane (H//ab) upper critical field behaviors of the 112-type iron-based superconductor Ca1-xLaxFeAs2 (x similar to 0.2) respectively.

The theoretical calculations on the upper critical fields fit well with the experimental results over a wide range of temperature. In addition, the upper critical field increases with the increase of the directional angle, which is similar to the result for MgB2.
