J,"Hossain, MF",Fabrication of Nanosticks-Like CdS Sensitizer for the Application of Solar Cells,"The novelty of this work is to fabricate the Nanosticks (NSs) like CdS sensitizer on the surface of TiO2 electrode by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method with a very high vacuum annealed at 350 degrees C for 30 min. Whereas, nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes have been prepared on FTO (SnO2: F) glass by a spin-coating method with high purity (99.99%, Degussa P25) TiO2 powder. The surface of the CdS layer has been covered by NSs like structures which are confirmed by the scanning electron microscope image. The 100 nm of platinum-coated FTO substrate and polysulfide-based electrolyte are used to assemble the Gratzel Solar cell (GSC). The performance of solar cell (SC) based on NSs like CdS has been compared with the nanoparticles (NPs) based CdS sensitized SC, where CdS NPs has synthesized by CBD without any post-annealing. The efficiency of NSs like CdS sensitized SC exhibits 2.44%, which is 2 folds of the efficiency of the CdS NPs sensitized SC.

J,"Li, KD",The Influence of Process Parameters on the Morphological Characteristics by Directional Etching for Materials Nanoarchitectonics,"In nanoarchitectonics, the advanced technology of directional etching is highly demanded for the fabrication of modern electronic device with high anisotropy ratio of structures. To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle. The featured surface morphologies, including the pyramid, ripple, mounds and etch pits, are reproduced numerically, and these simulation results correspond well with the observations of directional etching experiments. This study provides the fundamental knowledge and detailed information for the advanced application of the directional etching technology.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17429,2,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes

J,"Vathani, AM; Dhanalakshmi, S; Jeyakumaran, N; Prithivikumaran, N",Fabrication of Al-TiO<sub>2</sub> Thin Film Electrode by Spray Pyrolysis Technique for Urea Sensing,A simple cost effective Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was fabricated for urea sensing. Urea is the key end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans. Increased level of urea leads to loss of kidney function. Thus determination of urea is important in analysis of kidney diseases. Al-TiO2 thin films were deposited with different concentration of Al by Spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the anatase phase of the Al-TiO2 thin films with tetragonal structure. A shift is observed in the XRD peak position compared to as prepared TiO2 thin film indicates the incorporation of Al ions into Ti ions. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study shows that the absorption increases and the absorption peak shifts towards the visible region for Al-TiO2 thin films compared with that of the as prepared TiO2 thin film. The optical band gap values changes with the change in the Al concentration in TiO2 thin films. The electrochemical analysis for optimized Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. CV studies of Al-TiO2 thin film electrode show the good stability and linearity which is essential to fabricate biosensor. The sensor response to urea is linear with correlation coefficient of 0.944 and the sensitivity is 3.17 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2).,10.1166/jnn.2020.17447,5,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

Optimal glucose and microcrystalline cellulose transformation conditions resulted in yields of 41.05 wt.% and 38.56 wt.% for EL, 0.73 wt.% and 2.63 wt.% for ethyl-glucoside (EG), 0.42 wt.% and 0.36 wt.% for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and 2.18 wt.% and 2.16 wt.% for 5-ethoxy methyl furfural (EMF), respectively. Increasing the reaction time and temperature resulted in an optimized yield of EL. These increases also resulted in decreased EG and EMF yield, and the change trend of HMF was not significant.

The mechanical reliabilities of Sn58Bi and epoxy Sn58Bi solder were evaluated by the board-level drop test and the 3-point bend test after temperature-humidity storage testing. The microstructure and chemical composition of the solder joints were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The addition of epoxy in solder paste did not affect the morphology of the intermetallic compound. The thickness of the scalloped-shaped Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound of solder/OSP joint increased with aging time. The drop number until fail for the epoxy Sn58Bi/OSP joint was higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint; the average numbers of drops withstood by the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint and epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint following the reflow process were fewer than 10 drops and 180 drops, respectively. The drop number of solder/OSP joints decreased with increasing aging time. The result of the 3-point bend tests shows that the number of bend cycles for the epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint was 30 times higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint.

J,"Chen, SH; Huang, TW",Spin-orbit torques from intrinsic spin-orbit couplings in a periodically buckled honeycomb lattice,"In this paper, we study the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) originated from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of intrinsic type in a periodically buckled honeycomb nanoribbon such as silicene. Using the Green function formalism with density matrix expressions, we analyze the SOT contributions from the Fermi-level and -sea electrons. We find that the intrinsic-SOC-induced inverse spin galvanic effect generates spin accumulations perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The anti-damping torque results purely from the Fermi-level contribution, while the field-like torque from both the Fermi-level and -sea contributions. At zero bias voltage, the SOT is symmetric with respect to the Fermi energy (i.e., an even function of the Fermi energy), whereas the presence of bias further introduces the anti-symmetric torque components. When the ferromagnet magnetization lies in the honeycomb plane, all Fermi-sea contributions disappear. The maximum SOT among different Fermi energies is also inspected. For large enough in-plane magnetization compared to the staggered potential, the field-like torque has a maximum at zero Fermi energy. When the magnetization is smaller than some value characterized by the intrinsic SOC, the maximum of the anti-damping torque occurs at the cross point of the two Dirac linear bands in the leads. More importantly, we find that the anti-damping torques responsible for magnetic switching as well as the torkance require staggered potential from an applied out-of-plane electric field, i.e., lattice buckling is essential to the switching. When the electric field is reversed, the anti-damping torque and the torkance are also reversed. Accordingly, full electric control of the SOTs can be realized in this buckled system.",10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165914,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two kinds of doping scenarios are considered, namely dopants into pristine graphene and vacancy graphene. It is observed that the doping energy is negative for dopant (N, P, S) into vacancy graphene at pyridinictype site, yet it is positive at graphitic-type site for pristine graphene. It could be inferred that the introducing process is exothermic reaction for defective graphene. Meanwhile, for the adsorption of C2H2 on the surface of defective graphene, we notice that C2H2 would prefer to be adsorbed at the top site of the doping atom and the adsorption energy increases with the introducing of dopants, indicating that the dopant would enhance the interaction between C2H2 and graphene. Regarding hydrogen molecule, the dopant has less promotion effect on the adsorption. Moreover, the graphene plays a role of electron donor while the gas molecule (C2H2/H-2) is the electron acceptor when it is adsorbed.

The photogenerated current of the InZnO phototransistor at long light wavelength (>600 nm) was significantly improved by utilizing narrow bandgap MoS2 as the capping layer (1.3 eV). At lower wavelength, photocarriers are generated due to the optical absorption of both InZnO and MoS2 layers, whereas the latter ensures significant photocarrier generation even at the higher wavelength region of the visible spectrum. The photogenerated carriers subsequently transfer to the underlying InZnO layer of superior carrier mobility that has a high channel conduction of additional electrons from the optically-induced doubly positively charged oxygen vacancies (Vo(++)) where the gate field is screening, thereby leading to the higher photoconductive gain of the InZnO/MoS2 phototransistors. The dynamic photosensitivity behaviour of the aforesaid phototransistor reveals the presence of persistent photoconductivity (PPC) due to the oxygen vacancy associated with InZnO which can be removed by applying a reset gate pulse from -15 to +5 V. The optical properties of these phototransistors were further enhanced by replacing the opaque Ti/Au electrode by an ultrathin transparent Ti/Au electrode. Utilization of the transparent electrode results in enhanced electron injection from source to channel due to a reduced barrier height under illumination giving rise to a ten-fold improvement in the photocurrent and responsivity of the phototransistors. A position-dependent study of the photocurrent w.r.t beam position also reveals that the enhancement in photocurrent is strongly dependent on the position and is at its maximum when the beam is placed near the source region.",10.1088/1361-6528/ab4526,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As known, the ultrathin alumina mask (UTAM) surface nanopatterning technique allows the fabrication of periodic nanoparticle (NP) arrays with 5 nm gaps among the NPs, however, it still faces a significant challenge in realizing the reliable distribution of nanogaps over a large area, because of the unavoidable collapse of the UTAM pore wall during the traditional one-step homothermal pore-widening process. Herein, an efficient two-step poikilothermal pore-widening process was developed to precisely control the pore wall etching of a UTAM, enabling effectively avoiding the fragmentation of the UTAM and finally obtaining a large-scale UTAM with a pore wall thickness of about 5 nm. As a result, large-scale NP arrays with high-density sub-5 nm and even smaller gaps between the neighboring NPs have been realized through applying the as-prepared UTAM as the nanopatterning template. These NP arrays with sub-5 nm gaps show ultrahigh SERS sensitivity (signal enhancement improved by an order of magnitude compared with NP arrays with 5 nm gaps) and good reproducibility, which demonstrates the practical feasibility of this promising two-step pore-widening UTAM technique for the fabrication of high-performance active SERS substrates with large-scale ultra-small nanogaps.",10.1088/1361-6528/ab49ac,48,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

J,"Ayubali, AA; Shanmugavel, BP; Padmanabhan, KA",On the relative accuracy of power law analyses for uniaxial low stress steady state high homologous temperature deformation,"If the mathematical operations are correct, uniaxial low stress, steady state high homologous temperature creep and steady state structural Superplasticity phenomena can be well described by a 'power law' that relates the applied stress to the strain rate of deformation (Padmanabhan et al., 2015). Isothermal dislocation creep, which exhibits no grain size dependence, displays a linear log strain rate - log stress relationship till there is a change in the rate controlling mechanism. In contrast, during grain-size dependent, isothermal steady state structural superplastic flow, even within narrow strain rate ranges the slope changes, notwithstanding the presence of the same rate controlling mechanism. In both the phenomena the stress exponent, n, decreases with increasing temperature even for a constant rate controlling mechanism (Padmanabhan, 1973). Four analytical methods, differing in details, are based on the power law equation, viz., a procedure used by experimental scientists, its improved variant, a method in vogue in rheology and a procedure due to Padmanabhan et al., 2015. By examining experimental data pertaining to many systems, it is demonstrated that the method of rheology does not follow the tenets of Dimensional Analysis and that the scatter in the predictions is the maximum for this case. The method of experimental scientists ignores the temperature dependence of the stress exponent and this leads to significant discrepancies between the measured and predicted properties. When mathematics is correct and the relevant physical situation is taken into account, the other two methods, i.e. the improved method of the experimental scientists and that of Padmanabhan et al., 2015, lead to similar results, but the latter analysis is more accurate because of its better normalizing procedure.

The basic concept of this spectroscopy is based on the phenomenon of photoresponse enhancement (PE), recently observed in pentacene films. In this phenomenon, the photocurrent, generated with modulated probe-light creating excitons, undergoes enhancement under additional above bandgap bias-light excitation, which acts to facilitate exciton dissociation. In the proposed photocurrent spectroscopy, the excitation energies of probe-light producing photocurrent undergoing PE and those of the biaslight which can induce PE are specified. This allows us to resolve photogeneration via exciton dissociation, which is facilitated by above bandgap excitations, and the onset of the above bandgap excitations, which facilitate exciton dissociation in pentacene films. It is found that light excitation in the region of 1.77-2.43 eV generates excitons diffusing with a diffusion length of 50-80 nm, which is compatible with that of triplet excitons, to the pentacene-substrate interface where dissociate via electron transfer to positive donor-like traps. For light excitation exceeding 2.43 eV, above bandgap excitations become strong competing triplet exciton creation by singlet fission.

The temperature of maximum magnetoresistance (MR) shifted from 115 to 185 K. However, its magnitude, 1500% at 5 T, remained unchanged due to capping.

Among lithium secondary batteries, the lithium polymer battery, which has similar performance to the lithium secondary battery, is made of a solid polymer electrolyte. Lithium ions in a solid polymer electrolyte exist in the form of a solution by a polar group in a polymer matrix. Lithium ions in the solid polymer electrolyte migrate via the segmental motion of the polymer. That is, the properties of a polymer matrix in a solid polymer electrolyte can affect the conduction of lithium ions. Therefore, this study focused on the electrochemical properties of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer-based solid polymer electrolyte. For this, poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer-based solid polymer electrolytes, which have spherical micelles, and various sizes of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer micelle, were prepared.

However, even though these types of LEDs are based on direct transition type semiconductors, thermal energy is still emitted during operation owing to forward conduction and reverse leakage currents.

Twenty eight male, 10-week old Wistar rats were used, divided into three groups, i.e., the control one, the group including the diabetic rats and, finally, the group including the diabetic rats which were treated using sitagliptin. The biomechanical study was based on a series of three-point bending tests of the femora of the sacrificed rats and the analysis of the experimental data was implemented in terms of the actual geometry of the fractured cross-section.

On the contrary, the slope of the load-deflection curve (corresponding to a measure of the stiffness) of diabetic bones is slightly lower compared to the control bones.

We applied advanced analytics and in silico approaches to illustrate the retrieval-based potential to elucidate host responses and enable discovery of corresponding biomarkers indicative of in vivo implant performance. Hip retrieval analysis was performed using variables based on immunostaining, polarized microscopy, and fretting-corrosion and oxidation analyses. Statistical analyses were performed in R. Hierarchical/k-means clustering and principal component analysis were used for data analysis and visualization. Correlation Engine (CE) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were employed for in silico corroboration of putative biomarkers. Higher giant cell and histiocyte scores and positivity for CD68 and CD3 indicating infiltration with macrophages and T-cells, respectively, were detected mainly among older generation hips with higher ultra-high-molecular-weight-polyethylene loads. Our in silico analysis using pre-existing data on wear particle-induced loosening substantiated the role of CD68 in implant-induced innate responses and identified the CD68-related molecular signature that can be indicative of development of aseptic loosening and can be further corroborated for diagnostic/prognostic testing in clinical setting.

J,"Wang, BH; Hu, YH",Pressure diffusion wave and shear wave in gels with tunable wave propagation properties,"Gels are composed of cross-linked polymer network and solvent. Gels are both ubiquitous in nature and widely applied in engineering applications. In this work, we develop a physics-based dynamic theory to investigate the tunable wave propagation properties of gels. Gels are soft and can generate large deformation. The constitutive relation takes account the coupled large deformation and diffusion of gels. The dynamic governing equations take account the relative motions between the polymer network and solvent, which leads to a pressure diffusion wave similar to the ""slow pressure wave"" in the classical Biot's poroelastodynamics. It is different from the pressure wave in pure solid or pure liquid. The phase velocity, group velocity and attenuation coefficient are analyzed at different frequencies and propagating directions for both pressure wave and shear wave. We show that the wave propagation properties of gels are not only related to the material properties including the crosslink density and the interaction property between solvent and polymer, but also can be tuned by different mechanical loading conditions and chemical stimuli. It is also predicted that the constrained swollen gel exhibits anisotropic wave propagation properties, which leads to the splitting of the pressure wave and shear wave propagating through it. The theory provides a general frame for fundamental understanding and quantitative characterization of the dynamic behaviors of gels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Morice, C; Kopp, T; Kampf, AP",Nonunique connection between bulk topological invariants and surface physics,"At the heart of the study of topological insulators lies a fundamental dichotomy: Topological invariants are defined in infinite systems but surface states as their main footprint only exist in finite systems. In the slab geometry, namely, infinite in two planar directions and finite in the perpendicular direction, the 2D topological invariant was shown to display three different types of behavior. The perpendicular Dirac velocity turns out to be a critical control parameter discerning between different qualitative situations. When it is zero, the three types of behavior extrapolate to the three 3D topologically distinct phases: trivial, weak, and strong topological insulators. We show analytically that the boundaries between types of behavior are topological phase transitions of particular significance since they allow us to predict the 3D topological invariants from finite-thickness transitions. When the perpendicular Dirac velocity is not zero, we identify a new phase with surface states but no band inversion at any finite thickness, disentangling these two concepts which are closely linked in 3D. We also show that at zero perpendicular Dirac velocity, the system is gapless in the 3D bulk and therefore not a topological insulating state, even though the slab geometry extrapolates to the 3D topological phases. Finally, in a parameter regime with strong dispersion perpendicular to the surface of the slab, we encounter the unusual case that the slab physics displays nontrivial phases with surface states but nevertheless extrapolates to a 3D trivial state.",10.1103/PhysRevB.100.235427,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This type of product, however, can suffer from syneresis: densification due to the expulsion of fluid. Gaining insight into the physical principles governing syneresis in such soft hybrid dispersions remains a challenge from a theoretical perspective, as experimental data are needed to establish a basis. We record non-accelerated syneresis in a model system for low-fat mayonnaise: a colloid polymer mixture, consisting of oil in water emulsion with starch in the aqueous phase. We find the flow rate of expelled fluid to be proportional to the difference in hydrostatic pressure over the system. The osmotic pressure of the added starch, while being higher than the hydrostatic pressure, does not prevent syneresis because the soluble starch is lost to the expelled fluid. From these findings, we conclude that forced syneresis in these systems can be described as a gravity-driven porous flow through the densely packed emulsion, explainable with a model based on Darcy's law.",10.1039/c9sm01097a,102,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

It is the first unit cell model for the molten carbonate DCFC in which both 4-electron carbon oxidation and 2-electron CO oxidation reactions, as well as the reverse Boudouard reaction, are considered. The simulation results verify that, besides the relatively sluggish kinetics of the anodic reactions, cell performance is mainly limited by ohmic losses in the anode. Further modeling exploration reveals that a minimum effective electronic conductivity of around 0.56 S/cm is required to facilitate proper electrical conduction in the cathode to attain high DCFC performance. It was found that there are optimal volume fractions for the carbon fuel and liquid electrolyte in the anode. If the effective electronic conductivity of the cathode falls to 0.56 S/cm, optimal volume fractions also exist for the solid material and liquid electrolyte in the cathode.

The mobility increases from 1.4 to 3.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), and the threshold voltage negatively shifts from -0.23 to -0.51 V. Synaptic behaviors under both a single pulse and multiple pulses are employed to study the temperature dependence.

Here, we report on the configuration of horizontally aligned ZnO-nanowires-based metallic cavity ensemble with a light to dark current ratio of similar to 1000. An enhanced polarization photodetection ratio of transverse electric (TE) to transverse magnetic (TM) was experimentally observed compared to the single ZnO nanowire photodetector. Finite difference time domain simulation was performed on the metallic cavities, showing the distinct resonance behaviors under TE and TM light. The confinement by the multi-reflection and optical resonances between the metallic claddings contribute to the high anisotropy ratio. Furthermore, the polarized light absorption in the metallic cavity was studied as well as in the naked nanowire, which reveal a significant dependence on the cavity diameter and wavelength. For the metallic cavities, the absorption ratio of TE to TM show an enhanced value in the range of 300-500 nm wavelength and 85-150 diameter and a reversed value in the range of 400-500 nm wavelength and 17-50 diameter. While for the naked nanowires, the ratio show an apparently opposite value in these two regions.

Using 3D particle physics, rain, snow and freezing rain buildup on flat and cylindrical surfaces was assessed. The numerically simulated moisture accumulations were subsequently successfully verified experimentally through a series of outdoor and indoor moisture accumulation experiments. We also conducted molecular dynamics simulations to assess how hydrogen bonds influence snow and rain adhesion on high and low energy substrates. The simulations supported the experimental observations, namely that freezing rain results in increased moisture adhesion and accumulation due to the spreading of the water droplets, resulting in more hydrogen bonds between water droplets and substrates than snow.

J,"Trapezon, AG",Residual Stress Effect on the Strength Estimate of Base-Coating Systems,"The effect of manufacturing-induced residual stresses in layered isotropic composites of basecoating type on the latter strength is studied. The conventional method, based on the principle of additivity of the initial properties of layers of a symmetric composite, is applicable to uniaxial tension or compression, but not to bending, where the latter principle is not valid. Therefore, in the latter case, stress calculation has to be based on the method of equivalent bending stiffness linking the derived strength characteristic with operating stresses in the composite layers. Residual stresses in strength assessment are taken into account by substituting their analytical expressions into respective calculation models. The reliability of mostly used relationships for determining residual stresses is analyzed. To this purpose, an independent derivation of engineering formulas for axial residual stresses was carried out, varying elastic parameters, thickness, and number of layers of the composite. The substitution of the above formulas into the additivity relation for an isotropic symmetric system under uniaxial loading does not change the latter form, due to self-balancing of residual stresses and, therefore, residual stresses do not affect the strength estimate. As an example, the axial tensile strength of an aluminum alloy clad with corrosion-resistant steel was calculated for various ratios of cladding layer-to-steel layer thickness. The results on the composite hardening are presented. It is shown that, in contrast to the uniaxial tension of a composite, residual stresses in bending loading, significantly affect the strength assessment results. Numerical results on such an assessment are presented for a case study. A scheme for determining the endurance limit under cyclic bending was elaborated based on the Goodman hypothesis and experimentally verified.

The first flexural mode of blade vibrations is analyzed at the design stage for a wide range of the angle of attack based on the developed database of the critical values of the reduced vibration frequency in straight cascades of blade airfoils. The multiple regression equation is developed that depends on the relative blade spacing and stagger angle of the straight cascade of blade airfoils, coefficient of the flexural-torsional coupling of the blade, and angle of attack with the correlation factor of the studied parameters in the range of 0.92-0.98. Using the obtained equation, the numerical program has been developed for the determination of the dynamic stability limit against subsonic flutter for the first flexural mode of the blade vibrations. The program allows one to find the numerical values of critical reduced frequencies as the characteristics of its dynamic stability and determine their dependence on the angle of attack. The results of practical application of the developed program are presented using the assessment of the dynamic stability of the flexural mode of axial compressors in four modern aircraft gas-turbine engines.

The method permits of measuring the ballistic coefficient of a bullet without a specialized measuring laboratory, i.e., under unequipped shooting-ground conditions. The only metrological equipment is a mobile unit for evaluating the muzzle velocity. The relation is derived based on the experimental design by the central alternate that describes the range of point values for an examined process since the range of nonexistent ones does not permit of employing the uniform alternate. The range of initial bullet velocities is divided into the three subranges to include all points of the central alternate into the range of existent values.

Compared to conventional sheet metal components, stringer sheets show a significant increase in stiffness and therefore offer new possibilities for lightweight design. A challenge in stringer sheet forming is the failure due to instability, which appears in the buckling of the stringer in concave curvatures. The prediction of this failure mode is so far only possible by complex numerical simulations. This work introduces an analytical model for the prediction of the buckling failure during forming of concave stringer sheet curvatures under different process boundary conditions.

J,"Al-Naddaf, M; Tannoury, GA; Han, J; Parsons, RL; Zhang, C",Development of Laboratory Procedure for Evaluating Microcracking Technology on Cement-Modified Soil Subgrade,"Cement modification of soils has been widely practiced for the last few decades. Recently, cement has become a more economical binder to modify in situ subgrade soil because other binders, such as fly ash, have become less available and therefore their prices have gone up significantly. In addition, a much higher percentage of fly ash needs be used when compared with cement to achieve the same subgrade strength and stiffness. However, cement-modified subgrade may have an issue with shrinkage cracking, which can eventually reflect through the asphalt pavement layers to the surface after construction. For some subgrade soils, a high cement content is needed to meet the unconfined compressive strength requirement without jeopardizing durability. A higher cement content will result in higher shrinkage cracking potential. To overcome this problem, microcracking technology has been developed and adopted in the field. This technology involves recompaction of cement-modified soil (CMS) with a roller 24-48 h after initial compaction to induce microcracks in the CMS and minimize the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Microcracking of CMS is not expected to significantly reduce the strength and stiffness of CMS, but it is expected to increase its permeability and reduce the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Unfortunately, the procedure to simulate microcracking of CMS in the laboratory and evaluate its effect on properties of CMS has not been established yet. This note documents the development of such a procedure and discusses the effect of microcracking on the properties (strength and modulus) of CMS specimens.",10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002982,147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Chen, XD; Hu, SY; Deng, ZL; Gao, JH; Gao, XJ",Design of large-displacement asymmetric piezoelectric microgripper based on flexible mechanisms,"The output displacement of the traditional symmetrical microgripper is large, but its micro-components or parts are easily damaged due to the uneven force exerted on the left and right jaws of the gripper. The output force of the traditional asymmetric microgripper is stable. However, its output displacement is small, typically half the output displacement of the symmetric microgripper. To solve these problems, in this study, we designed a large-displacement asymmetric microgripper. First, we calculated the relationship between the theoretical input and output variables based on their geometric relationship. Then, we analyzed the performance of the microgripper using finite element software. Lastly, we used a piezoelectric actuator as the input driver of the microgripper. The errors associated with the theoretical and simulated output displacements were 7.05% and 924%, respectively. At 150 V of driving voltage, the maximum output displacement was 224 pm, and the actual magnification was 11.2 times. Microparts can be gripped in parallel and stably, which confirms the validity of the design. Copyright (C) 2019 Tianjin University.

J,"Choi, W; Song, MJ; Lim, NH; Lee, SY",Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Continuous Welded 50N Rail,"Rails are subjected to repeated stresses due to wheel-rail contact during train service. Rails under stress conditions undergo microstructural changes, and these cause degradations of the structural integrity and lifetime of rails. In this study, three different rails (newly-manufactured rail, newly-manufactured head-hardened rail, and worn (used) rail) were compared to examine the effects of heat treatment and repeated wheel-rail contact stress on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of continuous welded rail. The crystal structure, constituent phase distribution, tensile property, and hardness were investigated at various locations along a cross section of the rails. All three rails consisted of a mixture of BCC and FCC crystal structures as a majority phase with a very small amount of cementite (Fe3C) as a minor phase. Rietveld analysis revealed that the weighted fractions of the BCC crystal structure were approximately 74%, 64%, and 85% for the new rail, head-hardened rail, and worn rail, respectively. While the web and foot areas of the three rails showed no significant differences in mechanical properties, the railheads of the three rails revealed much higher yield strength, tensile strength, and hardness. The highest tensile strength and hardness were measured at the railhead in the head-hardened rail, and were attributed to the evolution of the bainite phase, generated by additional heat treatment. The higher mechanical strength of the railhead of the worn rail is thought to have resulted from a combination of work hardening and smaller lamellar spacing of the pearlite phase, induced by repeated wear processes during train operation.",10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.12.755,163,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

By slowly varying the amplitude of modulation, we steer the light to the desired output waveguide when equal amounts of lights are launched into each waveguide. We reveal that depending on the sign of the static propagation constant mismatch (detuning) between two waveguides, the launched light can be completely switched to either of waveguides. Additionally, we numerically examine the performances of light switching for general inputs and modulation amplitudes, and show that the localization of output light is robust against small to moderate variations in the final modulation amplitude, phase difference and intensity distribution of input field between two waveguides. More importantly, according to the principle of the proposed scheme, we are capable of steering the output light to the targeted waveguide at extremely low input power.

Sn?Mg alloys arise as promising alternatives due to characteristics such as low melting point, low coefficient of thermal expansion, suitable mechanical properties, electrical resistivity and low cost of Mg as an alloying element. However, the literature is scarce on studies relating the microstructure features of unsteady state cooling conditions during solidification to the resulting properties of Sn?Mg alloys. It is of the utmost importance to know the influence of the solidification cooling rate on the representative length scale of the alloy microstructure, since it varies from about 0.4 to 8 ;C s(?1) in the soldering process. In the present study the Sn 2.1 wt%Mg eutectic alloy is solidified under unsteady state conditions over a nickel substrate for a range of solidification cooling rates from 0.5 to 12 ;C s(?1). The microstructure is shown to be formed by a mixture of ??Sn and fibrous Mg2Sn intermetallics (IMC) and an experimental growth law is proposed relating the interphase spacing between Mg2Sn fibers (?(F)) and the cooling rate. With the decrease in the cooling rate a pronounced decrease in the Mg2Sn IMC fraction is shown to occur; from about 46% to 23%. Consequently, hardness, that is shown to depend on both ?(F) and Mg2Sn fraction, decreases significantly with the decrease in the solidification cooling rate.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab58f9,166,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Das, RS; Singh, B",Insight on nano-platinum-catalyzed dehydrogenation of quercetin in presence of peroxide,"Quercetin (Qu), a noted polyphenolic flavonol molecule, exhibits remarkable antioxidant properties against bioenzymes like peroxidase and tyrosinase. However, it was found that under pH = 3.5-5.5 and room temperature, Qu cannot reduce hydrogen peroxide (HP) which is a well-perceived reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for oxidative stress. We found that in presence of noble-metal nano-particles, such redox interactions can be accomplished. We thus synthesized homogenous PVP-coated nano-platinum particles (PNP) to catalyze the oxidation of Qu by HP. On reaction, Qu is oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone (QQ) following the first-order kinetics. The observed rate constant, k(o), gradually increases and tends to saturate with increasing [HP](T) where T represents the analytical concentrations of the reactant. The saturation kinetics indicates that the activities of PNP resemble to that of bioenzymes and similarly, the nano-particles host the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The estimated value of the k(cat) reveals that the extent of catalysis of even 10(-10) M PNP is nearly comparable with the rate constants of oxidation of Qu in presence of enzymes like horseradish peroxidase and tyrosinase. Graphical abstract Quercetin (Qu) is a ubiquitous natural antioxidant. However, in acidic buffer media (pH = 3.5-5.5), hydrogen peroxide (HP) cannot oxidize Qu. Strikingly, in presence of nano-platinum particles (PNP), Qu is promptly oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone following the first-order kinetics. PNP hosts the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The saturation kinetics with respect to HP resembles to enzyme-like activities of PNP, and indeed, the calculated value of the rate constant, k(cat), is comparable with those of the rate constants of enzyme-mediated oxidation of Qu.",10.1007/s11051-019-4712-1,168,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

A significant horizontal displacement of individual Al atoms on the edges of the film is observed during the simulation. The film begins to ""spread"" slightly near the edges.

The mass transfer coefficient was hence correlated with the hydrodynamic parameters, including chloride reduction rate, bubble surface area, and gas and liquid phase concentration. The average chloride removal efficiency for the monoethanolamine (MEA) was more than 61% due to a better dispersion of pure nitrogen gas bubbles and formation of the tiny bubbles provided in the column. The results indicated that a higher chloride initial concentration corresponded to better performance of the setup. Under the typical column operating conditions, it was concluded that a collection zone H:D of 10:1 was a reasonable compromise. The flotation setup results in BHEP separation, known as amine degradation product showed about 24% average amine recovery.",10.1002/eng2.12068,184,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no

Novel NTI-based acceptors with a spirobifluorene (SF) unit (SF-NTIs) were designed and synthesized. Their absorption range (400-600 nm) were clearly different from that of previously reported acceptor with a NTI-indacenodithiophene-NTI structure (IDT-NTI, 650-800 nm). Although, the SF-NTI with the same solubilizing groups as IDT-NTI (2-ethylhexyl groups) is not soluble enough for solution processes and favorable molecular orientation properties for OSC devices, the 1-hexylheptyl substituted SF-NTI showed a good solubility and favorable ""face-on"" orientation in the active layer films. The fabricated OSCs showed power conversion efficiency as high as 5.2%, and excellent thermal stability. These results indicate that the absorption of the NTI-triads can be tuned by modifying the central pi-unit and that their orientation nature and solubility can be controlled by altering the alkyl groups on the imide moieties. These properties allow us to develop efficient NTI-based acceptors with various absorption ranges.",10.1016/j.dyepig.2019.107691,186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method is based on change identification in slope of capacitance value as a function of temperature. Temperature variation of the capacitance observed in holmium and yttrium manganite sintered at 1250 degrees C has been studied respectively. The optimum preparation of holmium and yttrium manganite with space group P6(3)cm by using high energy ball milling has been chosen in order to provide a convenient T-c. The changes of the capacitance value as a function of temperature range from 300 up to 1000 K at 50 Hz has been carried out in order to obtained the T-c value. Results obtained from the experiments showed that T-c transition could be clearly exhibited by the capacitance value for both the holmium manganite and yttrium manganite samples. The measured property values gave their T-c transition around reported value in previous studies. The ferroelectric T-c transition was observed to be 850 K and 860 K for HoMnO3 and YMnO3 respectively.

Cristobalite-SiO2 is succeeded by the rutile-type, stishovite-SiO2, at high pressures. The rutile-types of GeO2 and TiO2 are favored at ambient pressure, but small tensile stresses are sufficient to yield cristobalite-GeO2 and TiO2. The transition from one structure-type into the other is modeled using collective movements of cations or anions with different degrees of freedom for the remaining structure parameters. We find that increasing the external pressure decreases activation barriers of the cristobalite-rutile transformation. Activation barriers of the reverse transformation from rutile to critobalite decrease with decreasing pressure. If only a fraction of cations follows the collective movement we find even lower activation barriers. The final states are still tetrahedrally or octahedrally coordinated structures, albeit not the high-symmetry variants of cristobalite or rutile, respectively. The small tensile stresses needed to favor cristobalite-GeO2 and TiO2 over their respective rutile counterparts, and the low activation barriers involved in their interconversion let us propose a simple route to synthesize cristobalite-GeO2 and a new cristobalite-TiO2.",10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109170,188,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Starting with the same batch of mixed oxide prepared from reverse microemulsions, different photocatalysts have been obtained by either solvothermal treatment, calcination or a combination of both. Extensive physicochemical characterization of the resulting materials shows that solvothermally treated oxides present lower crystallite size and larger surface area, although without previous calcination these samples appear to have a higher degree of structural disorder. These differences are sharply reflected in the changes in photocatalytic activity for the removal of methylcyclohexane (MCH) and toluene vapours at relatively high concentrations. Thus, the best performance for MCH elimination is obtained with the photocatalysts prepared by calcination and subsequent solvothermal treatment. Following this procedure, the resulting Ti1-xZrxO2 material presents larger surface area and high Zr surface concentration with minimal disturbance of the anatase structure. In contrast, for toluene photooxidation, the solvothermally prepared sample shows improved performance, most likely due to its larger surface area, which contributes to hinder deactivation.",10.1166/jnn.2019.16738,189,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no

To advance their potential applications, HGSPPWs are required to have tunable capability, highly reliable, simple fabrication process, and feasible integration. In this paper, we propose two tunable HGSPPWs fulfilling the requirements. The proposed HGSPPWs consist of a metallic wedge laterally coupled with a dielectric waveguide. The modal characteristics of HGSPPWs are investigated at the optical telecommunication wavelength, which shows the modal characteristics could be effectively controlled by tuning the key geometry parameters and structure of HGSPPWs. The propagation length could achieve the centimeter scale while maintaining the propagation mode size at the deep-subwavelength scale (similar to lambda(2)/10(5)). The studies on fabrication tolerance and waveguide crosstalk show their robust property for practical implementations. The effective tunable mechanism is also proposed and studied, which shows remarkable feasibility to realize multifunctional plasmon-based photonic components.

A multitude of material characteristics, ranging from the surface chemistry of the fibers, yarn packing and knit geometry, affect perceived comfort. Standard measures of thermal and evaporative resistance characterize the fabric response at steady state and do not provide insight into the thermal/vapor balance kinetics under dynamic conditions. While investigating an existing dynamic test, International Organization for Standardization 13029:2012, for relating fabric properties to comfort, we observed that the fabric drying kinetics exhibited bimodal behavior. Here, we describe the mechanism that leads to the observed bimodal drying kinetics. While the standard measures the time taken to reach steady state, we use the power profile of the modes to derive quantitative metrics to characterize fabric properties. The derived metrics are based on the observation that the heat of wetting is nearly a constant for a given relative humidity for a material, and that the heat of sorption per unit of absorbed water is identical for a wide range of fabrics. The derived metrics distinguish different fiber types and fabric geometries.

The manufacture of such structures includes pressure welding of a package of three sheet blanks, consisting of two outer skin sheets and one inner core blank. The stop-off coating is applied to the inner surfaces of the skin sheets before welding. During superplastic forming of the package, the skin sheets take the form of a die cavity, while the core sheet stretches between the skins to form stiffeners. One of the main problems in manufacturing three-layer structures is known to be the formation of folds on the outer surface of the skins. The paper reports on studies of the influence of the inclination angle of stiffeners on folding. The choice of skin sheets with a thickness exceeding the thickness of the core sheet by 2 - 3 times may prevent the formation of folds. However, when manufacturing the corrugated structures of variable cross-section, such as hollow fan blades of an aircraft engine, the recommended ratio may not always be implemented. Moreover, its performance is limited by the permissible weight of the blade.

J,"Mukhametgalina, AA; Nazarov, AA",A double-gaussian waveguide for ultrasonic treatment of metals,"Ultrasonic treatment (UST) of metals is based on the exciting of resonant high-frequency vibrations to induce oscillating elastic stresses in the bulk of materials, which result in the generation, motion and rearrangement of crystal lattice defects. Normally, the resonant vibrations are obtained by using cylindrical samples or ultrasonic instruments having the length equal to the half-wavelength of ultrasound. In such waveguides, however, the distribution of the stress amplitude is not uniform along their axis. Accordingly, changes in the structure and properties due to the UST are different along the sample. I sere, a new type of ultrasonic waveguide based on the Gaussian (ampulla) horn is proposed and called a double-Gaussian waveguide. It is composed of two identical high-amplitude parts of a Gaussian waveguide joined at a node that allows one to achieve a uniform distribution of the amplitude of normal stresses in a significant region with a length equal to that of a doubled Gaussian region. Analytic results obtained by Eisner are used to calculate geometrical characteristics of the waveguide and the latter are refined by finite element modeling. Characteristics of double-Gaussian waveguides made of steel 45 and titanium alloy VT6 (Russian grades) are calculated. This type of waveguide can be used in the bulk ultrasonic treatment of materials to expose the samples to oscillating stresses of an equal amplitude.",10.22226/2410-3535-2019-4-414-418,231,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

Both the grain size and the relative density increase with the sintering time. The densification is through grain boundary diffusion, and the grain growth is through evaporation-condensation. The pore number in the ridges decreases with the pore size increase. Both grain boundary diffusion related flux J(gb) and evaporation-condensation related diffusion flux J(e/c)(g) increase with the sintering time. However, the former is five orders of magnitude lower than the latter, indicating the dominance of the grain growth process in the ridges. Pore shapes evolve from deformed round tubes, to trigonal tubes, and then to deformed flat tubes. The pore surface evolves from a saddle ridge type to saddle ridge plus saddle rut types.

This paper presents an analytical method for calculating the mutual inductance of an air-core superconducting variable inductor and investigates the impact of dimensional parameters on the mutual inductance. The proposed method is based on changing the position of a movable inner coil inside an outer coil. A variable inductor may consist of two finite length coaxial helical-shaped coils that their mutual inductance can be changed to achieve a variable inductance. The proposed variable inductor may be further optimized for high-power and high frequency applications and has the potential to be realized in matching circuits technology. To calculate the mutual inductance, a direct and fast method has been employed to solve nonlinear double integration of Neumann's formula along the current-carrying path that offers two advantages. Firstly, it reduces the computational time comparing to the area-integration methods, especially for complex geometries. Secondly, it can split coil turns accurately as well as other design details that violate axial symmetry. In the end, the Finite Element (FEM) and the loop model methods have been used to verify the results of the analytical method.

The strength of these mesodefects increases with deformation and, as a result, they create non-uniform elastic stress fields, which significantly affect the processes of structure formation, strain hardening and material's fracture. In the present work, the interaction of a slip band propagating in a grain body under the action of an external stress field with an elastic field of wedge disclination is investigated by the discrete dislocation dynamics simulation method. The simulation results show that the behavior of the front of the band has common regularities. For a given distance between the slip band and the disclination y(0), the behavior of the dislocation cluster in the front of the band essentially depends on the distance between the slip planes of the dislocations h. For small h(c), it is similar to the behavior of a dislocation pile-up. However, the maximum density of dislocations occurs not in the head of the cluster, as in the classical blocked dislocation pile-up, but in its central part. An increase in the distance h between dislocations slip planes leads to a ""splitting"" of the front of the band. For larger h the front of the band transforms into a broken from both sides dislocation wall. The minimal distance h e above which such dislocation wall is formed, depends on the disclination strength omega(0) and the distance y(0). The maximal misorientation of the wall is equal to the disclination strength omega(0) at y(0) = 0. With an increase in the external stress, the wall overcomes the force barrier of the disclination and moves as a whole to the lateral surface of the crystal. Multiple reiteration of this process leads to the possible appearance of the system of broken from both sides dislocation walls in the body of grain.",10.22226/2410-3535-2019-4-409-413,255,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemical composition, morphology, structure and magnetic properties of the deposits were studied using SEM-EDX, XRD and AGFM techniques. The EDX results showed that the Ni?Fe?P coatings can be classified into two categories named low Fe content and high Fe content. Magnetic hysteresis loops displayed a soft magnetic character for all the deposited coatings. XRD and AGFM results revealed that the High Fe content coatings present a crystalline structure and high saturation magnetization, Ms, while those with low Fe content exhibited an amorphous structure with low Ms values. The central composite design (CCD) methodology using the ANalysis Of VAriances (ANOVA) and the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) have been applied to investigate the main and the interaction effects of several electroplating parameters on the crystalline phase proportion, CP, and the saturation magnetization, Ms, of the deposits. The ANOVA results showed that Fe/Ni ratio and pH are the most significant factors on the studied properties. A relationship between the factors and the studied responses (CP and Ms) has been established via a linear and quadratic model. A perfect agreement between the experimental and the predicted values is confirmed by high correlation coefficient values: R-2;=;0.97 for CP and 0.92 for Ms. The optimal factors required for the best properties of Fe?Ni?P coatings have been determined by the desirability function.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab58a4,257,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no

The rate of heat evolution, compressive strength, connected pore structure, and chloride binding capacity were investigated. The results show that CNA can accelerate cement hydration at early age, and therefore improve the 1-day strength of blended mixtures. The strength at 28 and 56 days can be maximized with 1% by weight CNA addition, but considerably reduced with 5% by weight CNA. Different from the mechanical properties, the connected pore structure and chloride binding capacity are improved straightforwardly with CNA addition, which benefits the ability to resist chloride attack. The experimental and modeling results demonstrate that CNA addition benefits the generation of carboaluminate, which has high efficiency to fill voids due to its higher volume, thus densifying the microstructure as well as improving the chloride resistance. However, these aluminate-ferrite-monosubstituent (AFm) phases demonstrate little cementing capacity relative to calcium silicate hydrate (C S H) gels, thus resulting in an obvious decrease of strength with a high amount of CNA addition even though the microstructure is further densified.",10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002964,264,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no

The torque-induced variation of damping constant of magnetization can be foreseen from the change of the linewidth of ferromagnetic resonance spectrum. The Oersted torque (tau Oe) and current-induced torque (tau C) are induced by charge current; while the spin-orbit torque (tau SO) and field-like torque (tau FL) are induced by spin current. However, the torque effects often were hindered due to the heating-induced artifacts. In this work, we particularly pay attention to minimize the Joule heating effects in order to investigate the intrinsic torque effects in cobalt (Co)/platinum (Pt) bilayer with an applied charge current ranging from -60 to 60 mA. In this range, the Oersted field is estimated as 0.25 Oe which is much smaller than the experimental result of Delta Hr (similar to 0.7 Oe), implying some contribution from the spin-current induced field like torque.

The maximum values of carrier lifetime and iV(oc) obtained in the low ozone concentration region are 1.4 ms and 656 mV, respectively.

During the manufacturing, transportation, and assembly processes, Alloy 690TT surface is easily scratched and it is easily ignored. The effect of added lead on the scratched surface is different from that on the unscratched surface. In the present study, Alloy 690TT was treated with mechanical polishing (MP) and electrochemical polishing (EP) to generate scratched and unscratched surfaces. With the addition of lead, the thickness of passive film on the MP sample increases by eight times, while that on the EP sample only slightly increases. These chemical composition changes of passive films induced by lead result in the drop of their electrical resistivity, and the electrical resistivity of passive film on the MP sample is reduced by two orders of magnitude, while that on the EP sample decreases only three times. Nevertheless, the thickness and electrical resistivity of passive film on the MP sample are always greater than those of the EP sample. The toxic effect of lead on the MP sample is more severe than that of the EP sample, which may be closely related to their subsurface microstructure. Therefore, Alloy 690TT should better avoid being scratched in the secondary circuit system of pressurized water reactors, as scratched behavior will result in a faster corrosion rate of Alloy 690TT with the presence of lead.",10.3389/fmats.2019.00300,283,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no

The rheological properties of 35 and 40 vol% slips were studied. The densification, microstructure as well as hardness and fracture toughness were investigated as a function of CaPSi glass content at 1300 degrees C-1500 degrees C. The optimum NH(4)PA concentration of 35 vol% AY-TZP5 and AY-TZP10 slips at pH similar to 9 was found to be about 43% and 67% greater than that of AY-TZP slips; this behavior was related to the greater amounts of Ca2+ ions leached out from the CaPSi glass surface. The viscosity of stabilized 40 vol% slips with NH(4)PA attained a minimum value at 5.4 vol% CaPSi glass addition, and resulted in a more dense packing of cast samples. AY-TZP5 can be sintered at a lower temperature (1300 degrees C) compared to that of AY-TZP. AY-TZP5 exhibited a fine microstructure of tetragonal ZrO2 (grain sizes below 0.3 mu m), and ZrSiO4-Ca2P2O7 particles homogeneously distributed within the zirconia matrix.

J,"Park, BJ; Jin, YH; Park, NR; Kim, JT; Kim, MK",Nanolayer-embedded pseudo-photonic crystals,"In recent years, novel high-performance nanophotonic devices have been realized by applying ultrathin two-dimensional nanolayer materials to nanophotonics. In this paper, we propose nanolayer-embedded compact pseudo-photonic crystals (PPCs) that enable strong interaction between ultrathin nanolayers and photonic crystal modes. In typical two-dimensional slab photonic crystals, the transverse-magnetic (TM) photonic crystal bandgap is not well formed, making it difficult to operate the TM photonic crystal waveguide modes. However, by utilizing the low-frequency TM PPC bands, a long propagation TM waveguide mode, a slow TM waveguide mode, and a TM photonic bandgap are all readily available. In particular, the insertion of a nanometer-thick low-refractive-index layer in the vertical center of TM PPC waveguide can localize the electric fields tightly in nanometer space, causing strong field interaction with the inserted nanolayer material. Using the TM slow light near PPC band edges, field interaction with the nanolayer is significantly enhanced. We can also realize nanolayer-embedded high-quality-factor (Q-factor > 10(4)) PPC cavities using the TM PPC bandgap. We believe that the proposed TM PPCs will play an important role in the strong interaction of ultrathin nanolayer materials with photonic crystal modes.",10.1088/1361-6528/ab3d74,307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Fang, JS; Yu, KY; Chen, ST; Cheng, YL; Wang, YS; Chen, GS",Reliability Enhancement of Copper/Porous SiOCH Metallization Systems Using Nitrogen Stuffing and Bias-Filter Sputter Deposited Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Barrier,"A robust ultrathin barrier to retard Cu diffusion is needed for fabricating state-of-the-art Cu interconnects associated with porous dielectric materials. Gas stuffing of grain boundaries is widely used to strengthen conventional polycrystalline TiN and TaN barriers. Alternatively, a self-formed MnOx layer derived typically from sputter-deposited Cu(Mn) alloy film is a viable barrier. However, vacuum plasma generated during Cu(Mn) deposition tends to damage porous dielectric materials. Thus, this study combines the two approaches, proposing a strategy to enhance reliability of copper/porous carbon-doped organosilica (p-SiOCH) metallization systems using nitrogen stuffed p-SiOCH and bias-filter sputter deposited Mn2O3. An ultrathin (1-4 nm) Mn2O3 film, deposited by reactive sputtering with a biased-filter mechanism on nitrogen-stuffed p-SiOCH (p-SiOCH(N)), was proposed as a barrier layer to prevent Cu from diffusion. Electrical properties of the samples were evaluated by capacitance-voltage and current density-electric field measurements. The bias-filter mechanism eliminated plasma damage of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. Furthermore, stabilization annealing converted Mn2O3 to Mn2O3-x(N) (manganese sub-oxynitride), giving the highest barrier performance for the Cu metallization layer, while maintaining the pristine dielectric properties of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. The Cu/Mn2O3-x(N)/p-SiOCH(N) structure also exhibited extremely low leakage currents after reliability tests, indicting their applicability to Cu metallization.

J,"Firsova, NE; Ktitorov, SA",Extraction of the short-range defect potential parameters from available experimental data on the graphene resistance,"We consider a problem of obtaining information about the scattering potentials of the monolayer graphene sample using available experimental data on its resistance. For this purpose, we study theoretically the dependence of graphene resistance on Fermi energy having in mind to compare it with experimental data where super-high mobility electrons in suspended graphene samples without chemical doping were investigated. As far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the Coulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering potentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The empty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical shortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage of the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We consider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit formulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution of this scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function of the Fermi energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results are consistent with experiment, where the resistance was measured as a function of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene. This fact gives a possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the basis of the available experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with the gate voltage controlled Fermi level position. It is clear to be very important for applications.",10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686624,328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown that there is a continuous series of disordered solid solutions with a structure of the MgCu2 type. In all alloys, cobalt atoms have a magnetic moment mu(Co) = 0.5 mu(B). The ground magnetic state of the alloys depends on the composition. In the range 0 <= x <= 0.2, alloys are paramagnetic at a temperature T = 2 K, in the alloys with 0.4 <= x <= 0.8, ferromagnetic order occurs in clusters of cobalt atoms due to the exchange interaction of Co - Co. Their magnetization in small magnetic fields is realized via turnabout, by 180 degrees, of the magnetic moments of individual clusters. In the alloys with 1.0 <= x <= 2.0, the long-range ferromagnetic order is established. The processes of technical magnetization reversal in them are effected via the motion of domain walls and rotation of the vectors of spontaneous magnetization. In all alloys, magnetic saturation is not achieved at T = 5 K even in a magnetic field of 200 kOe, which is associated with a large splitting of the ground J multiple of Pr3+ ions by the crystal field. Numerical calculations of the magnetization curves are performed. In the approximation of the independence of the parameters of the crystal field on the concentration, a satisfactory agreement between the calculated and experimental curves was obtained.",10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165489,329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Heldin, M; Wiklund, U",Influences of load and temperature on groundwood pulping with well-defined tools,"Groundwood pulping is an industrial process with a high energy demand, although only a minor part of the energy is used for actually separating the fibres and the rest for working them. Traditionally, the separation process employs a grinding stone having particles embedded in a softer matrix. The position and distribution of the particles have been random, causing their interaction with the wood to also be random. This makes studies of the mechanisms during the separation process difficult. Knowledge of the mechanisms in the separation process helps when designing future tools aimed at energy efficiency or tailored fibre properties. Recently, grinding surfaces having diamond particles brazed to a steel backing at fixed positions have been developed and commercialised. In this work, individual particles are not positioned at the tool surfaces. Instead, well-defined structured diamond films, soldered to a backing, are used as grinding tools. The grinding asperities of such films can be tailored to shapes that are not possible to achieve by using particles. Using this kind of tool in a lab scale grinding equipment, confirms the well-known fact that increased load or increased temperature both lead to lower energy consumption for fibre separation and longer, less damaged fibres.",10.1016/j.wear.2019.203051,330,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

The creep strain and matrix cracking stress (sigma(mc)) were used to determine the creep strengthening effect. Moreover, the stress redistribution model was applied to explain the stress transfer from the matrix to fibre, and therefore the creep strengthening mechanisms. The results indicate that 2D-C/SiC can be strengthened by creep at certain conditions. The ability to resist the creep strain and sigma(mc) can be improved by certain creep treatments with creep temperature of 1400 degrees C, lower stress and longer time. The strengthening effect is resulted from the stress redistribution during the creep. The tensile residual stress is relaxed in the matrix and transferred to the fibre.

The variation of both lattice parameters and crystallite size, as a function of Ni content, indicated that the Ni doping enhance the structural properties of the deposited films. In Raman spectra, the band at 667.9 cm(-1) appeared for doped samples, was attributed to the Zn sites occupied by Ni atoms in the ZnO lattice.

The present work explores the method of decoupling the anisotropic MPs directly for bulk soft FSMs. The small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were performed on the [1 0 0]-oriented alloys Fe1-xGax (Galfenol) under a series of magnetic fields. Those two-dimensional (2D) SANS patterns were decomposed and reconstructed by the spherical harmonic approaches. The scattering intensities, which are respectively decomposed into isotropic and anisotropic components, show clearly the pathway of three types of magnetic domains. The 90 degrees domain process is thus quantified directly in the bulk Galfenol. The evolution trend for the domain process is consistent with that for the lattice strain and magnetization responses, which has been respectively evidenced by the in-situ neutron diffraction and initial magnetization measurement. Meanwhile, the quantitatively addressed domain process agrees well with the simulated results by the energy-based domain rotation modelling. These observations indicate that the anisotropic magnetization processes correlate tightly with the lattice strain response, which are of significant importance for the understanding and design of large magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS). The present approach provides a quantitative method for decoupling the magnetization processes, which would be also applicable to other ferromagnetic systems besides Galfenol.

Furthermore, compared with freshly poled ceramics, the thermally stimulated current (TSC) peak of the aged ones shifts toward a higher temperature (10 degrees C). And the temperature of the TSC peak in the aged ceramics is exactly equal to their Curie temperature. Such features indicate that aging for the poled ceramics could stabilize the alignment of ordered ferroelectric domains.

The problem is linearized by the method of secant modulus. The mechanical behavior of rectangular elongated three-layer plates with a weak honeycomb core in cylindrical bending is investigated. An analysis of dependence of flexibility of such structures on the reinforcement parameters of bearing layers is carried out. It is found that, at different values of the reinforcement parameters (angles and densities), two different deformation ""mechanisms"" can be realized in the sandwich panel: ""classical"" (bending dominates) and ""nonclassical"" (transverse shear dominates). When the classical mechanism is realized, the flexibility of the plate greatly depends on the variation of reinforcement parameters of the bearing layers.

Gelation of PVC is complex because of a narrow processing window. At low temperature, gelation is incomplete and leads to poor mechanical properties, while at high temperature, degradation may occur.

Gelation in various conditions of temperature and shear was firstly studied in a capillary device that ensures both pre-shearing and extrusion through a circular die. This provided a reference basis for comparison with gelation state obtained in the co-kneader. Samples were collected in the co-kneader by means of opening the barrel. The gelation state was particularly examined in connection with the measured temperature at a fixed position along the screw at which a temperature sensor was positioned.

Rev. Lett. 104, 107201 (2010)]. While the nature of these states is well understood, the dynamical mechanisms underpinning their formation remain largely unexplored and are the subject of this study. We find that the long-range tail of the Coulomb interactions between monopoles plays a central role by suppressing the monopole-assisted decay of noncontractible pairs with respect to monopole-antimonopole annihilation. In conjunction with low final quench temperatures, where the system enters a nonhydrodynamic regime in which the monopoles effectively move at terminal velocity in the direction of the local force acting on them, the interactions lead to a metastable plateau that persists in the thermodynamic limit. This is a remarkable phenomenon, reminiscent of jamming and some instances of glassiness: A transient modification of the short-time dynamics of the system allows it to enter a metastable state whose lifetime can easily be astronomically large at (experimentally relevant) low temperatures. We demonstrate this using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field population dynamics theory, and we provide an analytical understanding of the mechanisms at play. When the interactions between monopoles are truncated to finite range, the metastable plateau reduces to a finite size effect. We derive the finite size scaling behavior of the density of noncontractible pairs in the metastable plateau for both short- and long-range interactions and discuss the experimental implications of our results.",10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184411,351,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The whole forming process is divided into five stages. Compared with traditional tube hydroforming, the thickness can be increased by axial compression deformation to reduce the thinning ratio and enhance the forming capacity of the tube in hydro-forging stage and double-stepped hydro-forging stage, respectively. The proposed multistage axial hydro-forging sequence process was implemented by experiments along with the finite element simulation to validate its feasibility. The suitable loading path to prevent defects such as wrinkle and thinning was discussed. The results showed that double-stepped tube with large expansion ratio can be produced successfully with movable dies' design. There is no thinning in the final tube, particularly in all stepped area, and a better thickness distribution could be achieved.

For the insertion of lumped inductors along the wires, dispersion diagram and the Bloch-impedance are numerically estimated, and converted to effective permittivity and permeability. The numerical simulation results clearly show almost 3-D isotropic propagation characteristics in a specific frequency region and enhancement of the Bloch-impedance close to free space in the left-handed region.

J,"Oh, T",Double Junction Characteristics of Amorphous TiO<sub>2</sub> Thin Film Due to Various Potential Barriers,"This report investigated the chemical, physical and electrical properties of TiO2 that was prepared with various oxygen gas flows and annealing temperatures to create different Schottky barriers. The thin films of the Schottky contact with double barriers were observed as increments of the capacitance. The oxygen vacancy increased at the film with the crystal structure and decreased at the film with the amorphous structure. It was confirmed that the current-voltage characteristics differ when observed in the low current area because the formation of potential barrier varies depending on the condition of the interfacing even in thin films with similar amorphous characteristics. Because the size of the potential barrier is mostly small, current is not observed in areas high at mu A level, but at nA level, the electrical properties of the potential barrier could be observed more closely by the effect of relatively large potential barriers. It was found that the single and double connections were made depending on the size of the potential barrier at Schottky contact according to the after annealing treatment temperature.",10.1007/s42341-019-00133-7,377,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no

In the study, the following variables are alternated: high-speed steel (HSS) vs. hard metal (HM), and with and without the assistance of high-density electropulses. The corrosion rates are determined using comparative studies such as gravimetric analysis, salt spray chamber test, electrochemical polarization curve techniques (PC), and linear polarization resistance (LPR). Differences in surface microhardness were evaluated by applying optical microscopy and planimetric procedures. Specimens subjected to electropulses and turned with HM reported greater reductions of corrosion rates. Changes in corrosion behavior can be explained in terms of grain shape factor h variation.

The upper age limit of reconstruction is not determined because tenocytes from old individuals have less proliferative ability than young ones. Dexamethasone is commonly used to deal with musculoskeletal disorder with dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward tenocytes. Ascorbic acid is essential for tenocytes culture and collagen secretion and can alleviate the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone. In the current study, a microfluidic platform was used to screen the best dexamethasone and ascorbic acid combination treatment for tenocytes from young and old donors because it has been proven to provide a high throughput analysis platform. Comparison of their proliferation under three concentrations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone was performed. Tenocytes proliferation among young and old donors was also measured when exposed to nine combinations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone. The result confirmed the differences in cells proliferation when hamstring tenocytes from different ages of donors are exposed to different concentrations of dexamethasone and ascorbic acid.

During the quasistatic loading of the samples at a constant speed, a weak impact is produced on the lateral surface of the sample during a specified period of time, and an electrical response to this impact is measured. Consistent patterns in the changes of the parameters of the electric response with various loads have been identified.

Our study aimed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the CAD/CAM-based template for maxillary orthognathic surgery using dry skulls. After reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual skull model, a surface-based surgical template for Le Fort I osteotomy was designed and fabricated using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology. To determine accuracy, the deviation of the template between the planned and the actual position and the fitness of the template were evaluated. The mean deviation was 0.41 +/- 0.30 mm in the medio-lateral direction, 0.55 +/- 0.59 mm in the antero-posterior direction, and 0.69 +/- 0.59 mm in the supero-inferior direction. The root mean square deviation between the planned and the actual position of the template was 1.21 +/- 0.54 mm. With respect to the fitness of the template, the mean distance between the inner surface of the template and the underlying bone surface was 0.76 +/- 0.24 mm.

J,"Kajiya, D",An agar sandwich method for patterning transparent conducting oxides,"Transparent electrodes are frequently used to drive opto-electronic devices, and the patterning of these electrodes is essential. The present work demonstrates a facile means of removing transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) from a glass substrate in selected areas. When agarose gel (agar), a material typically used in desserts, is sandwiched between two TCO-coated glass substrates and connected to a dry cell, the TCO is removed from the glass at the agar stamping area within 2 min. This method allows etching of TCOs using acid-free, inexpensive, and readily available starting materials. Analyses by optical microscopy, transmission spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that this etching occurs as a result of reduction of the TCO in conjunction with the electrolysis of water at the interface between the TCO and agar surfaces. Using this technique, high-throughput patterning of TCOs with an edge resolution of several micrometres was achieved. Furthermore, the shape of the agar template can be readily changed simply by cutting the agar using scissors. Therefore, this method provides a useful means for both researchers and students to easily fabricate patterned substrates for use in electronics and related technologies.",10.1007/s10854-019-02440-4,383,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Three-dimensional visualization of information is expected to facilitate visual search for radiologists. However, as the differences in user performance, depending on radiologist experience, have not yet been assessed for real three-dimensional images, it is difficult to estimate the usability of new visualization systems for radiologists with different amounts of professional search experience. In this study, we aimed to determine how three-dimensional visual search is affected by radiologist experience and the physical properties of stimuli. Radiologists, residents, and medical students accomplished visual search tasks with varying set sizes and target-distractor similarities. Search items were presented on multiple display planes and image manipulation was conducted using a computer keyboard. We compared the search outcome and strategy among three groups of participants.

However, in contrast to radiologists and residents, it took a considerably longer time for students to find the targets. The major differences were evident in search strategy when comparing the image manipulations of radiologists with those of residents and students.

Conventional word-level error resilience techniques such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC) suffer from high physical overhead and inability to correct increasingly reported multiple bit flip errors. On the other hands, state-of-the-art applications such as image processing and machine learning loosen the requirement on the levels of data protection, which result in dedicated techniques of approximated fault tolerance. In this work, we introduce a novel error protection scheme for memory, based on feature extraction through Principal Component Analysis and the modular-wise technique to segment the data before PCA. The extracted features can be protected by replacing the fault vector with the averaged confinement vectors. This approach confines the errors with either single or multi-bit flips for generic data blocks, whilst achieving significant savings on execution time and memory usage compared to traditional ECC techniques. Experimental results of image processing demonstrate that the proposed technique results in a reconstructed image with PSNR over 30 dB, while robust against both single bit and multiple bit flip errors, with reduced memory storage to just 22.4% compared to the conventional ECC-based technique.",10.3390/app9224733,390,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction. This also demonstrates that the effect of the DQDs can be replaced a thermal reservoir when the rate difference of a photon absorbed and emitted by DQDs is larger than zero; otherwise, it is irreplaceable.

To achieve the objective of the research study, a congestion control after fast-recovery module for congestion control scheme of Multistream Fast TCP is proposed. The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol.

The incorporation of up to 10 at.% of Ac ions into the ZnS quantum dots (QDs) allows preservation of the cubic crystal structure as was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and the selected area electron diffraction. The transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the increase of the Ac ion doping give rise to the increase of the particle size from 4.8 +/- 0.3 nm to 17.9 +/- 0.3 nm. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements indicated that the Zn1-xAcxS powders are stoichiometric at all Ac ion substitutions. The substitution of Zn ions by Ac ions in the Zn1-xAcxS nanocrystals was also verified by the Raman and FTIR spectroscopy measurements. The incorporation of the Ac ions into the ZnS QDs showed a red shift of the optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. An enhancement of the PL intensity and a decrease of the PL spectrum width were observed due to the partial substitution by the Ac ions in the Zn sites of the ZnS nanocrystals.

AA6060 profiles were extruded at a range of ram speeds using a specialized die with internal geometry purposely designed to produce thermomechanical variation throughout the profile. Subsequently, the extrudates underwent an industrial anodization pretreatment process that revealed the presence of streaks throughout three designated regions. The optical appearance, microstructure and surface topography of streaked and surrounding regions of the extrudate surface were analyzed using colorimetry, electron backscattered diffraction, and optical profilometry. Differences in perceived lightness, roughness, and grain size were observed between streaked and surrounding regions. Changes in appearance of the surface directly correlated with the surface roughness, with rougher surfaces yielding an increase in the perceived lightness. The surface roughness was determined to be primarily dependent on the size and distribution of grain etching steps as related to the surface grain size. A difference in grain size in the regions surrounding the streaks was determined to be the microstructural origin of the visual defect.

J,"Baek, YJ",On Non-Completeness and G-Equivariance,"With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.",10.3390/app9214692,406,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

The proposal analyzes the situation of missing data and appropriately weaves the aspect and the application together, thereby decreasing the complexity in handling the interpolating data.

However, there remains an inability to establish a method of consensus for determining whether a surface is slip resistant. Two current walkway-safety standards illustrate two different approaches to this issue-ANSI A137.1, American National Standards Specifications for Ceramic Tile, and ANSI/NFSI B101.3, Test Method for Measuring Wet DCOF of Common Hard-Surface Floor Materials, promotes a numeric threshold model, while ASTM F2508, Standard Practice for Validation, Calibration, and Certification of Walkway Tribometers Using Reference Surfaces, is a validation standard based on the relative ranking of walkway surface materials. The goal of this study was to determine whether these two standards are compatible in how they rank/evaluate surfaces. To do this, two tribometers, (the BOT-3000E (BOT) (Regan Scientific Instruments, Southlake, TX, USA) and English XL Variable Incidence Tribometer (XL) (Excel Tribometers, Chesapeake, VA, USA)) were used to take slip resistance measurements using the four reference surfaces designated in the ASTM F2508 standard. Measurements for the BOT were taken under three conditions: (1) styrene-butadiene-rubber (SBR) test foot with distilled water and surfactant (consistent with ANSI/NFSI B101.3), (2) SBR test foot with distilled water, and (3) Neolite test foot with distilled water. Measurements for the XL were taken using a Neolite test foot with distilled water. Results indicate that the vinyl composite tile was the reference surface nearest to the ANSI threshold for high slip resistance but fell approximately 11 % below the threshold value of 0.42. The two most slippery reference surfaces (granite and porcelain) fell well below the ANSI threshold for high slip resistance, while the most slip resistant (ceramic tile) was well above the threshold. Unexpectedly, we also found a strong linear correlation (R-2 = 0.99) between the measurements from the XL versus the BOT with SBR and surfactant test condition, which allowed for conversion of slip resistance readings between the two tribometers under these conditions. These results provide new data that allow aspects of the ASTM and ANSI standards to be directly compared.",10.1520/JTE20170501,410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficiency of nanosomes is highly dependent on their physicochemical nature. Therefore, in this study, we presented a rigorous method for examining the physicochemical characteristics and biological efficacy of nanosomes. Nanosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Specificity of nanosomes for type II collagen was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Release kinetics of nanosomes was determined by dialysis method using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye. The biological efficacy of targeted nanosomes encapsulating TGF-beta 3 was determined in porcine chondrocytes (pChon). Moreover, the binding specificity of targeted nanosomes to the damaged cartilage was confirmed onto the cartilage explants and in a mouse model of spontaneous osteoarthritis (OA).

We start from weak microwave pulses which lead to only trivial pyroelectric peak response. However, when the microwave pulses become intense, the normally expected pyroelectric signal seems to be suppressed and the sign of the voltage signal can even be completely changed. Analysis indicates that while the traditional pyroelectric model, which is a linear model and works fine for our data in the small regime, it does not work anymore in the large signal regime. Since the small-signal model is the key foundation of electromagnetic-wave sensors based on pyroelectric effects, such as pyroelectric infrared detecters, the observation in this work suggests that one should be cautious when using these devices in intense fields. In addition, the evolution of detector signal with respect to excitation strength suggests that the main polarisation process is changed in the large signal regime.

Additions of 1.9 to 5.9 mass pct. of NaF was found to depolymerize the structural units in the flux system. Depending on the flux composition, the dominant hydrogen dissolution mechanism varied. At C/S values less than 1.06, the incorporated-hydroxyl dissolution mechanism was dominant in the present flux system, in which SiO2-based complex structural units were pronounced. At C/S values above 1.06, the free-hydroxyl dissolution mechanism was pronounced due to the strong network-modifying CaO content supplemented by NaF. A combination of Fourier transformed infrared, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis was used to determine the structural implications of NaF additions and C/S, which were correlated to the hydroxyl capacity of the flux. High NaF contents and C/S values were found to depolymerize the complex structural units of the molten flux by supplying greater amounts of network-modifying free oxygen (O2-) and fluorine (F-) anions to the flux system in the compositional range of this work.",10.1007/s12540-019-00296-1,421,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

One of the key goals for this review was refining the document such that it may eventually be transitioned to a full-fledged test method. However, before such a goal could be realized, it was necessary to determine the practical limitations of the technique relative to the expected precision, repeatability, and reproducibility. To that end, interlaboratory studies were carried out in two stages. Stage one served as a pilot study and the participating laboratories were given limited guidance. This allowed identification of key control variables that would need to be defined in subsequent broader studies and ultimately in the future method. In stage two, the key variables identified in stage one were controlled and the precision of the technique was elucidated for three material types: polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, and low-density polyethylene.

The resultant method allows the use of projectors with short or even long throw ratios to achieve ultrashort throw projection through a parameterized algorithm to stitch multiple images into one single frame, alleviating the trade-off between the resolution and frame rate in conventional laser MEMS displays. To evaluate the effectiveness, we construct a test system that consists of three off-the-shelf projectors with a throw ratio of 1.3 and three planar reflective mirrors. Using our method, the integrated system yields an ultrashort throw ratio of 0.26, greatly reducing the projection distance from 12 to 2.6 ft for the 120-in. screen in diagonal.

J,"de Oliveira, VF; Bagatini, MC",Experimental evaluation of the usage of residues for sintermaking,"The shifts in quality of global reserves of iron ore, as well as the progressive advances in environmental legislations, are tendencies that have motivated researches on the usage of iron and carbon-bearing residues in the production of sinter for blast furnace ironmaking. These residues, however, are commonly limited in use due to their physical (particle size distribution) and chemical (heavy metals, alkali and zinc contents) properties as compared to sinter feed. In that sense, it is necessary to verify the impact of these materials on sinter quality and on sintering process parameters. In order to assess the recycling potential of residues via sintermaking, mixtures with increasing proportions (4.5-50%) of iron and steel-making residues were prepared and tested in controlled laboratory conditions representing those of the sintering machine. The effect of residues on sinter mineral phases and chemical quality was evaluated and showed few differences in sinter quality for a mixture resulting from recycling 100% of a plant's residue generation (4.5% of the mix). The greatest impact was an increased presence of wustite in the produced sinter, beyond 25% of residues in the mixture. The results indicated that there are opportunities, in the industry, for increasing the recycling of residues via sintermaking. (C) 2019 The Authors.

At -15 degrees and 0 degrees approach angles, the deformation influence was dominant on surface roughness and chip morphology, while the cutting effect taking place at the cutting edge was dominant at 30 degrees and 45 degrees approach angles. Primarily at 45 degrees, the most significant roughness values and the shortest cut fibers were achieved due to the occurrence of maximum shear stress according to Tresca. However, fibers were removed from samples on the whole form as bundles, without any cutting, at -15 degrees and 0 degrees approach angles, by the effect of deformation. According to ANOVA, regression and variance analysis results were obtained with p-values and probability results of surface roughness smaller than 0.05 and 5 %, respectively. These results showed that the feed rate was the most influential parameter for turning of CFRP material, followed by the approach angle and spindle speed, respectively.

Compared to conventional steel reinforcement, FRP reinforcement is different in terms of modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and bond behaviour. If concrete compression failure can be excluded, members with the same mechanical ratio of longitudinal reinforcement have the same bending load bearing capacity. The high tensile strengths of FRP reinforcement can lead to a reduced required reinforcement area and thus geometric ratio of longitudinal reinforcement. This effect leads to a reduced shear strength and increased crack widths and spacings. This article presents and evaluates experimental investigations on the shear strength of concrete members without shear reinforcement. Two different member types were analysed: slabs with textile carbon reinforcement and beams with carbon bars. For a direct comparison with conventionally reinforced members, reference tests with steel reinforcement and comparable mechanical reinforcement ratio were carried out. In addition to a detailed description of the specific properties of the used materials and a comparison of the load-bearing and deformation behaviour of the members, a precise evaluation of the cracking behaviour is shown.

Although several studies have been conducted to screen the susceptibility of the commercially grown families to these fungi, little information exists on wood properties associated with the susceptible and resistant families. Thus, the objectives of this study were (1) to understand variation in wood quality parameters among the families regarded as susceptible and tolerant to SPD, (2) to evaluate the utility of acoustic tool to differentiate between those families. The results indicated the velocity, fiber length, microfibril angle and slenderness of the susceptible families are comparable or superior to those of the tolerant families. The mean error rate of classification associated with acoustic tool ranged from 35 to 40% depending on the distance between the transmitter and receiver probes.

It is particularly on this market segment that the main current challenges have been focussed, according to the growing requirement of technological innovation, sustainability and product quality. Light-coloured leathers, with particular reference to white items, belong to the category of materials designed especially for the luxury market. For this type of articles, the uniformity of colour and the agreeable appeal of the overall surface appearance are crucial requirements for the most international fashion and luxury brands. One of the most common and undesirable defects of this type of article is the alteration of the colour, with particular reference to the localised or diffused effects of yellowing of the surface of the material. There are several causes able to contribute to the production of this type of defects, due to the complexity of the matrix and to the variability of traditional or innovative production processes used: from the intrinsic fragility, photosensitivity and thermo-sensitivity of the finishing polymers, to the chemical instability of some components of the finishing pigments, further the presence of photosensitive chemical additives, the migration of skin components or assembly components of the manufactured articles (fats, fillers, plasticisers, glues etc.), up to the indirect contribution of environmental and thermo-climatic factors able to affect negatively the performance of the material. SSIP, which has always been involved in research and consulting activities for the leather industry with regards to defect monitoring, through this work, would offer an overview of all the main tools for advanced diagnostics (with particular reference to Scanning Electronic Microscopy and to chromatographic and spectroscopic methods) aimed to the identification of the causes of yellowing, beside to explore innovative solutions for the development of strategies for the resolution and/or minimisation of the problem of yellowing.

However, it is presently not clear how the type of doped-O species affects the capacitive performance. In this paper, an attempt has been made to probe into the possible correlation between the type of doped-O species and the corresponding capacitive performance. Three O species (C=O, C-O and O-C=O) have been introduced onto TiC-derived carbon (TiC-CDC) by using a facile room-temperature oxidation strategy with three typical oxidizing agents (H2O2, HNO3 and (NH4)(2)S2O8), respectively. The results have shown that as the content of the C=O species increases, both the specific capacitance and the capacitance retention for the oxidized TiC-CDC samples become higher, showing a positively correlative performance. This work suggests that optimizing the type of doped-O species will be great potential for obtaining the optimal electrochemical performances for the O-doped carbon materials.",10.1142/S179329201950142X,444,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sample with HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm) laminated dielectric shows a high barrier height phi(B) of 1.66 eV at 30 degrees C which was extracted from the Schottky emission mechanism, and this can be explained by fewer In-O and As-O states on the interface, as detected by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test.

Black titanium thin film is deposited on stainless steel wire and Cu thin plate at a pressure of about 12 Pa, but lustrous thin film is deposited at lower pressure. The black titanium thin film has a larger apparent thickness than that of the glossy thin film. As a result of scanning electron microscope observation, it is seen that the black thin film has an extremely porous structure and consists of a separated column with periodic step differences on the sides. In this configuration, due to the shadowing effect, the nuclei formed on the substrate periodically grow to form a step. The surface area of the black thin film on the Cu thin plate changes with the bias potential. It has been found that the bias of the small negative is effective in increasing the surface area of the black titanium thin film.

One of the issues to fabricate the nitride thin films via sputtering is the control of N deficiency. In this work, it was demonstrated that the use of atomic diffusion improved the insulating property of amorphous BN (a-BN): BN deposition caused the nitridation of Co underlayer, and the diffusion of N from Co-N into BN reduced the N deficiency of BN. The a-BN formed via this sequence showed flat interfaces and no pinholes and could be used as a tunneling barrier layer. This provides an insight into synthesizing stoichiometric BN thin films. A negative tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of -0.2% was observed at room temperature. The TMR ratio increased with a decrease in temperature to -0.7% at 10 K.

Analyzing the surface and cross-section of the oxide layers via SEM-EDS, XRD, Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns and Raman spectroscopy, it was revealed that Si-free ODS steel consisted of outer Fe2O3 and inner FeCr2O4 layers which were porous and possessed whisker-like morphology.

The control of the electrode thickness could be useful to manipulate the energy confinement and the band dispersion of the surface guided mode. It has been demonstrated recently that high aspect ratio (HAR) electrode could produce a dispersive shear horizontal and vertically polarized surface modes in the bulk piezoelectric substrate. In this theoretical study, we propose to employ a high aspect ratio electrode on top of the GaN/sapphire-layered substrate enabling the presence of Sezawa surface mode. Based from the dispersion band, we obtained a higher frequency of surface guided mode in the non-radiative zone in the GaN/sapphire heterostructure configuration compared to the bulk GaN substrate. Indeed, these guided modes are induced by the hybridization between Sezawa surface mode and the mechanical resonance of the HAR electrode producing nearly a flat band at the limit of First Brillouin Zone. Furthermore, the displacement of each guided modes indicates the confinement of energy mostly in the electrode with a slight amount of energy in the top layer of the substrate. We demonstrated also the frequency tuning of guided mode using diverse materials for the electrode but also the thickness of GaN layer.

Despite the low energy input of the laser welding process and also the short cooling times t8/5, tendency to cold crack was found neither in the weld metal nor in the heat affected zone. The carbon equivalent (CET), determined by the chemical analysis of the experimental melt, was just 0.341, indicating moderate tendency to increase hardness after welding because of martensitic transformation. It was found that the energy input has a clear influence on the microstructure and the impact toughness of the weld metal. The weld metal of the test butt joint welded at the energy input of 198 J/mm showed the average impact toughness at approximately 80 % of the base metal, whereas the weld metal of the test butt joint welded at a lower energy input of 132 J/mm showed the average impact toughness at the level of just 60 % of the base metal of Domex 960 steel.",10.1520/MPC20190,466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the performances of vegetable tanned leathers still need a further improvement. In this work, a kind of nonionic gemini aliphatic polyurethane surfactants (GPUs) with different hydrophobic chain lengths as a retanning agent combined with polyacrylic acid (PAA) for condensed tannin tanned leathers to improve their performances. The effects of the alone or combined use of the PAA and GPU, the hydrophobic chain length of GPU, and the offer percentage of retanning agent were studied by evaluating the organoleptic properties, shrinkage temperature, mechanical properties of the obtained leathers. The best performance was found in the leather retanned with PAA and 12-GPU-550 complex retanning agent, and the mechanical properties of leather could be improved when the total offer percentage was controlled at 4 wt%. Moreover, the collagen fibers morphologies and lightfastness properties of leathers retanned with different retanning agents were investigated. The results showed that the total color difference Delta E and the yellowness index Delta b decreased significantly with the introduction of 12-GPU-550, and the leather retanned with PAA and 12-GPU-550 complex retanning agent showed the lowest value of Delta E, demonstrating that the lightfastness properties were improved significantly. Therefore, it was an attractive way to combine use of PAA and 12-GPU-550 as complex retanning agent, which can improve the mechanical and lightfastness properties of vegetable tanned leathers simultaneously.",,467,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

To fabricate the glass, refused coal ore with calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in it (which are added as supplementary materials) is put into an alumina crucible, melted at 1,200 similar to 1,500 degrees C for 1 hr, and then annealed at 600 degrees C for 2 hrs. We fabricate a black colored glass. The properties of the glass are measured by XRD (X-ray diffractometry) and TG-DTA (thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis). Glass samples manufactured at more than 1,300 degrees C with more than 60 % of refused coal ore are found by XRD to be non-crystalline in nature. In the case of the glass sample with 40 % of refused coal ore, from the sample melted at 1,200 degrees C, a sodium aluminum phosphate peak, a disodium calcium silicate peak, and an unknown peak are observed. On the other hand, in the sample melted at 1,300 degrees C, only the sodium aluminum phosphate peak and unknown peak are observed. And, peak changes that affect crystallization of the glass according to melting temperature are found. Therefore, it is concluded that glass with refused coal ore has good melting conditions at more than 1,200 degrees C and so can be applied to the construction field for materials such as glass tile, foamed glass panels, etc.",10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.11.727,468,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

Interestingly, the 1 at % Ga- and 20 at% Ga-doped samples showed shrinkage values of 19.5% and 23.0%, respectively, despite the fact they both starting shrinking at the same temperature. In addition, the second phase Ga3-xIn5+xSn2O16 was formed at 5 at% Ga-doped ITO. Moreover, the ITO lattice parameters decreased up to 40 at% Ga doping, since the ionic radius of Ga3+ is smaller than that of In3+. Furthermore, as the Ga concentration increased, the carrier concentration and mobility decreased and resistivity increased.

It is found that the higher the electrolyte temperature, the lower is the breakdown voltage of oxide layer. This is probably because films formed at higher temperatures are thinner and denser. Moreover, electrolyte temperature plays an important role in the physical properties of the films. As the electrolyte temperature increases from 20 to 50 degrees C, the hardness of the oxide layer increases. Friction test against steel balls indicates that wear scars become narrower for films formed at higher temperatures because the films are harder, as indicated by the Vickers hardness. The thinner and denser nature of the oxide film formed at 50 degrees C is also advantageous for heat transfer when film is used as a heat sink.

Although lipases have been applied in leather making in the past, the previously reported lipase degreasing ratio is still not very high, i.e. less than 60%. In order to correctly understand the mechanism of lipase degreasing and to choose lipases and optimize the degreasing process for achieving efficient degreasing, a novel method of evaluating the catalytic hydrolysis properties of lipases towards skin fats based on a greasy skin powder substrate in an aqueous medium was established. This simulated the actual leather degreasing process and detected the amount of fatty acids produced. The special substrate was prepared; the determination conditions were optimized; then the performances of several typical lipases were evaluated. The results revealed that the lipase performances determined by the novel method were quite different from the standard method using emulsified olive oil substrate. There was a strong product-inhibition characteristic in the catalytic hydrolysis reaction of lipase, and the inhibition concentration of fatty acids varied with the lipase type, thus the maximum hydrolysis ratio of fats was only 67%. The lipases exhibited ""super-activity"" at pH around 9.5. This occurred because the fatty acids produced transformed into soluble soaps, thus the product-inhibition was weakened. According to the above results, a two-step lipase processing was made, i.e., beginning at pH 7.5 then 9.5. The hydrolysis ratio of fats rose to 82.57% from 46.23%, and the degreasing ratio increased from 50.78% to 89.68%.

The thermodynamic analysis of both phases was accomplished with the scheme for a complex oxygen compound consisting of solid oxides, not having polymorphic transformations and melting congruently. The assumptions made do not contradict the data on the phase formation and thermometry in the phylogenetic series, their primary and final members being PQS and BI. The obtained data are appropriate for correct tetrahedration of the BeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system, and for calculating the probability of the formation of its phases.

First, the ECG signal is acquired via Ag-AgCl electrodes, preprocessed using the adaptive Wiener filter to remove the noises and classified with the help of feature extraction techniques and fuzzy decision making (FDM) algorithm. The FDM also finds the type of heart abnormality based on ECG features, such as RRp interval, R peak amplitude detection, and QRS complex interval, and then sends the classified type to the doctor wirelessly via a ZigBee module.

J,"Masoumi, M; de Lima, NB; Tressia, G; Sinatora, A; Goldenstein, H",Microstructure and crystallographic orientation evolutions below the superficial white layer of a used pearlitic rail,"Although several studies have been conducted on the mechanism of the formation of white layer by cyclic large shear deformation, and its effect on rolling contact fatigue, limited research has been carried out to find a correlation between sub-superficial layer of running contact surface and the crystallographic orientation, microstructural changes, and distribution of shear deformation and dislocation density. In order to understand the microstructural evolution (i.e., microstructure and crystallographic orientation) a used pearlitic rail sample removed from the heavy-haul railroad was investigated in the current work. A very thin superficial white layer was observed, approximately 15 mu m below the running contact surface. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a supersaturated ferrite phase with carbon content of approximately 3.78 C wt%. It could be attributed to the cementite dissolution due to severe shear and compressive stresses, during intense shear plastic deformation, from the rail-wheel interaction. The dominance of {110} ferrite grains parallel to the rail direction was characterised, in the transition layer between white layer and non-deformed pearlite structure, by X-ray diffraction and electron backscattered diffraction techniques. Formation of these grains, corresponding to the closed-pack plane of the ferrite matrix at the transition region, leads to great ductility and retarded crack formation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The resin was prepared by cross-linking epoxydized oil and wheat gluten using I, 2, and 3% zinc chloride as the catalyst. The experiment was carried out over 0.1-0.9 water activity (a(w)) range using gravimetric sorption analyzer (Q 2000, TA Instruments, New Castle, PA, USA). The resin isotherms were found to be type III shape where the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) was higher at lower temperatures. The EMC of gluten epoxy resin was dependent on the degree of cross-linking because more cross-linking decreased EMC. The Guggenheim Anderson-de Boer (GAB) parameters support the theory of the free volume as it relates to monolayer absorption. This could be attributed to the decrease in the number of water binding sites due to the development of dense areas during cross-linking and increase in the free volume. The GAB and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller were found to be suitable for predicting the water sorption isotherm for gluten protein resin because it provided low root mean square error.

Conventional microwave synthesis processes of electrocatalysts include ultrasonication, stirring, pH adjustment, and microwave irradiation of the precursor mixture. Ethylene glycol (EG), which serves as a reductant and solvent was added during the ultrasonication or stirring stage. However, this step and pH adjustment resulted in unintended multi-stage gradual nucleation. In this study, the microwave reduction approach was used to induce rapid nucleation and high supersaturation in order to fabricate small-sized reduced graphene oxide-supported palladium (Pd/rGO) electrocatalysts via the delayed addition of EG, elimination of the pH adjustment step, addition of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), prior microwave irradiation of the EG mixed with Na2CO3, and addition of room temperature precursor mixture. Besides its role as a second reducing agent, the addition of Na2CO3 was primarily intended to generate an alkaline condition, which is essential for the high-performance of electrocatalysts. Moreover, the microwave irradiation of the EG and Na2CO3 mixture generated highly reactive free radicals that facilitate rapid nucleation. Meanwhile, the room temperature precursor mixture increased supersaturation.

The chemical composition (X-ray diffraction pattern and Infrared spectrum), powder properties (scanning electron microscopy images and particle size distributions), the photo and oxidation catalytic activity, color phase (ultraviolet-visible reflectance spectra and L*a*b* values), and smoothness of the cerium phosphates were evaluated. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was assessed from the decomposition of methylene blue. The oxidation catalytic activity of samples was estimated with ascorbic acid solution. All samples prepared in this work indicated X-ray diffraction pattern of cerium phosphate hydrate. Samples prepared in this work had no photo and oxidation catalytic activities. They indicated the absorption at 300-330 nm and high reflectance within the range of visible light.

Among diverse variations of gradient descent method that have been developed for accelerating learning speed, the natural gradient learning is based on the theory of information geometry on stochastic neuromanifold, and is known to have ideal convergence properties. Despite its theoretical advantages, the pure natural gradient has some limitations that prevent its practical usage. In order to get the explicit value of the natural gradient, it is required to know true probability distribution of input variables, and to calculate inverse of a matrix with the square size of the number of parameters. Though an adaptive estimation of the natural gradient has been proposed as a solution, it was originally developed for online learning mode, which is computationally inefficient for the learning of large data set. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive natural gradient estimation for mini-batch learning mode, which is commonly adopted for big data analysis.

To achieve these features, a 3D morphable face model is fitted to a face region in a video frame and is deformed by the user's input. The video frame is then mapped as a texture to the deformed model, and the model is rendered on the video frame.

The structure of the films is found to be composed monoclinic MoO3, tetragonal indium and cubic In2O3. The phase percentage of In2O3 in the films increased to 26.3% upon annealing at 250 degrees C. The annealing process increased the microstrain, the defect density, the oxygen atomic content and lowered the crystallites and grains sizes in the films. Optically, two energy band gaps of values of 3.20 and 1.70 eV were detected for the MoO3/In/MoO3 system. In addition, nonlinear dielectric response associated with wide range of tunability in the dielectric constant value, in the optical conductivity and in the terahertz cutoff frequency was observed in the near IR spectral range. The annealing of the samples improved the nonlinearity in these parameters and make MoO3/In/MoO3 system more appropriates for optoelectronic technology applications as terahertz cavities and frequency convertors.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab5266,511,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,

J,"Rahman, TU; Amin, S; Haroon, SS",A novel methodology for volume reduction of HV capacitors using highly electronegative composite nano materials,"Capacitors play a key role in many electrical applications and devices. High voltage capacitors are commonly used in many stationary and mobile applications. Mobile applications of high voltage capacitors are of special interest for military installations and weapons. Size reduction of military equipment has always been a point of interest as it favours its easy handling, transportation and deployment. Capacitance offered by common dielectrics for high voltage capacitors is inversely proportional to thickness whereas withstand voltage is directly proportional to thickness. So, increasing the capacity of a high voltage capacitor without increasing its size is a daunting task. This research was aimed at reducing the size of high voltage capacitor while preserving its capacitance at same level by a novel method. Three of the common dielectric materials (polyethene, mylar and paper) for making high voltage capacitors, were surface treated with different concentrations of a nano powder specially formulated beforehand in a separate process. An increase in capacitance of about 12?35 times for different dielectrics was observed while keeping the size constant. This means a net reduction in volume while offering the same capacity. The method used in this work is promising way to decrease the volume of high voltage capacitors especially for mobile and military applications.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab51d5,513,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no

The effluents were collected from a textile industry at different stages of treatment, such as Collection Tank Effluent, Effluent after Anaerobic Treatment (EAT), Tertiary Treatment Effluent, and Reverse Osmosis Feed Effluent. The collected effluent samples have been analyzed to establish physicochemical characteristics and their effects on the properties of concrete, such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength. Higher salt content in effluent mix water significantly increased the final setting time of the binder. Furthermore, the workability of the concrete made with effluent mix water is relatively higher than that of the control concrete mix. Also, concrete mixes made with textile effluent mix water demonstrated greater strength than that of the control concrete. Furthermore, EAT mixes have exhibited maximum compressive strength compared with other mixes and also had superior durability compared with the control concrete mix. The higher strength can be attributed to the nucleation effect caused by the presence of a high concentration of total solids in the effluent.

J,"Sano, Y; Yamaguchi, M",Preventing Silica Scale Formation Using Hydroxide Ions Generated by Water Electrolysis,"The reaction of silica with various cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by water electrolysis was investigated as a means of preventing the formation of silica scales in geothermal binary power generation. Through batch and continuous experiments, it was found that all silica in the cathode phase of a reaction device could be removed if the necessary amounts of magnesium and calcium were present. This occurs because a silica-magnesium-calcium compound is produced via a polymerization reaction with cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by electrolysis. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows that this material has the formula 2CaO-5MgO-8SiO(2)-H2O, and thus is likely generated by the reaction proposed by Sheikholeslami et al. (2019). Increasing the current sent through the reaction solution subsequently produces calcium carbonate. This technique for the separation of silica and calcium from aqueous solutions can be operated continuously without channel clogging, which indicates the possibility of practical applications. However, overly high currents promote the migration of protons from the anode to cathode phases, which inhibits the formation of precipitates due to a neutralization reaction. The proposed method is an effective approach for removing silica from a solution in geothermal binary power generation; although, a means of suppressing the effects of proton generation will be necessary if the process is also to be used to remove calcium ions.",10.3390/membranes9110154,519,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

Thermogravimetric studies of the cured materials show that the thermal stability, the degradation pattern and the char yield are much dependent on the structure of the diphenol that is used for blending. The decreased thermal stability of materials from the blends is attributed to decreased cross links owing to the opening of the isomaleimide rings by diphenols during thermal polymerization. The materials with trimethylphenylindane and tetramethylspirobiindane units exhibit char residue of 21% at 800 degrees C. This is due to the thermal stability of the indane and spirobiindane moieties present in the diphenol molecules. The apparent activation energy for thermal degradation (E-a-D) and pre-exponential factor (ln A) are derived. The Friedman, corrected Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, corrected Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and advanced Vyazovkin methods are used to calculate the E-a-D values for various reaction extents (alpha s). The E-a-D values of poly(4,4 '-bisisomaleimido-diphenyl methane) vary from 168 to 226 kJ mol(-1). A slight decrease in E-a-D is noted for the initial alpha levels and increases constantly up to alpha = 0.3-0.75 and then the E-a-D values decrease with increasing alpha values. The highest values of E-a-D and ln A are observed for the polymer derived from the blend of VS with tetramethylspirobiindane diphenol.

J,"Tomozeiu, N",VIS-optical reflectometry: a method to investigate latex-based coatings,"In many applications, water-based dispersions of polymeric particles are dried under welldefined environmental conditions and/or technologies to form a continuous thin layer with special properties and morphology. The aim of this work is to present a recently developed noninvasive technique based on optical reflectometry in visible range used to study the film formation from aqueous mixtures layered up to 25 lm thickness. The sample holder is made of crystalline silicon (c-Si) because the interference fringes generated by the optical beams reflected at the air/liquid sample and liquid sample/c-Si are vital in determining the sample thickness. For the polymeric colloids with minimum film formation temperature higher than the room temperature, the setup is used to determine the evaporation rate and the temperature film formation. The versatility of the experimental setup is increased by a controlled temperature of the sample holder and a controlled microclimate chamber (temperature and relative humidity). Investigations on various aqueous dispersions considering the composition, the viscosity of the liquid, and different types of polymeric colloidal particles have been performed, and some results are discussed here.

Unfortunately, there are no methods that include this important criterion. The author aimed to fill this gap by determining the relative thickness of excess paste on aggregate grains parameter (t(rel)). This parameter is linearly correlated to minimal paste content needed to obtain a given SCC consistency level (V-paste min). Two such lines were recognized: minimum paste demand line and minimum relative thickness of excess paste line. The main parameters influencing obtaining these lines are: sand to total aggregate ratio (s/a), void content in a loose state (nu(l)), the coarsest fraction content, water-binder ratio (w/b), superplasticizer content, and aggregate fines content (or, alternatively, stone powder content). The proposed design procedure begins with assessment of both lines (using only four to six trial batches of extreme compositions in consideration).

The reduction of alpha phase precipitation in the alloy reduced the amount of Nb squeezed out from the Nb-depleted alpha phase, and consequently decreased the mean Nb content in the beta phase. Thus, the Ms temperature of Ti-13Nb alloy was successfully increased from lower temperature to near room temperature, which consequently enhanced the recoverable strain of the alloy by easier martensitic transformation. The sintered Ti-13Nb-18H alloy presented a Ms temperature of 22 degrees C and a remarkable recoverable strain of 3.9 pct at room temperature, which is the highest value ever reported in the sintered Ti-Nb based SMAs. Meanwhile, the Ti-13Nb-18H alloy exhibited a fracture strain of 23.1 pct and a fracture strength of 1321 MPa, both better than that of the Ti-13Nb alloy, which was attributed to the hydrogen atoms in the alloy which caused solid solution strengthening and also increased the content of the b phase with higher plasticity.

An accurate transient response is derived, and a generic circuit library is established for efficient and case-independent SPICE simulation. Using peak distortion analysis, the eye diagram versus loss parameters is plotted into unified design charts for eye height and width, which depicts the signal quality without the need for pseudorandom bit sequence simulation.

The AAO is chosen as the leak element because its conductance remains constant from vacuum to atmosphere. The container to be measured is connected to the vacuum system via the AAO leak element. The dynamic differential pressure decay with time between the inlet and outlet of AAO leak assembly was measured and fitted by an exponential function, followed by volume calculation. The volume of two different containers has been obtained using this method with nitrogen, helium, and argon, respectively. The influence of temperature fluctuation on experimental results under vacuum and atmospheric pressure outlet conditions was discussed. For vacuum outlet conditions, the temperature change caused by pressure decay in one single experiment is small enough to satisfy the isothermal hypothesis, which makes the influence of temperature fluctuation on the experimental results negligible. The preliminary results compared with the static expansion method demonstrate that this novel volume measurement technique is accurate, simple and efficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to present the design and construction of a novel holonomic mechanism to simplify the system. Air-based propulsion was applied to a land-based holonomic vehicle. A prototype with three roller balls was developed with a propeller for the propulsion of a triangular holonomic vehicle.

Pilot experiments were carried out at 1600 degrees C under a protective atmosphere. The results indicate that the temperature coefficient of resistance of the samples decreases whereas the bonding strength vastly increases, and the pulling forces of the bonding wires in the samples extends from 2 to 32 N. The pulling forces are progressively increased as the content of the spinel phase in the oxide additives increases. The mechanism of enhancement of the bonding strength is discussed herein. The microstructure characterization, element mapping, and element analysis of different samples were performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results indicate that the formation of a W-Si solid solution in the sample is the main reason for the decrease in temperature coefficient of resistance.

The growth of GaN was enhanced not only from bottom c-plane, but also from the sidewall of the micron-sized patterns. In this study, KOH solution was used to etch AlN (especially sidewall AlN) for the first time. The additional etching process is very simple. It was found that KOH etching 1 min did enhance the light output power (LOP) of LED. However, with the increase of etching time to 4 min, the LOP decreased. Besides, the effect of remained AlN on GaN growth mechanism was investigated in detail. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

The delay of the transition from off-state to on-state, when a switching voltage U-0 is applied to a sample, is related to the time t(don) required to heat a sample to the metal-semiconductor phase transition temperature in VO2. The delay time t(don) decreases with the increase of U-0. It is shown that the calculated dependence of t(don) on the voltage U-0, obtained with the simplified heat balance equation of a sample and the ""critical temperature"" model, is in good conformity with the experimental data. It was found that the delay of reverse transition from the on-state to the off-state controls the conductive channel, within which the crystallites of VO2 are in the metallic phase. The delay time t(doff) of this transition determines the time during which, after turning off the voltage U-0, a conductive channel exists in a sample. The value of t(doff) increases with the increase of U-0. The reason for this behavior is the expansion of conductive channel with the increase of U-0. As a consequence, takes place the increasing number of VO2 crystallites in the metallic phase. Therefore, t(doff) increases due to an increase in the time required for dissipation of the heat released during the transition of the VO2 crystallites from the metallic phase to the semiconducting phase.",10.1007/s10832-019-00187-2,585,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides the ideal case of well-defined Landau levels with small broadening, the effects of resonance degradation due to big broadenings and big fluctuations of Fermi energy along the sample are demonstrated. The maximum values of light absorption coefficients and their resonance positions in magnetic field scale B-max were studied in a wide range of Fermi energies from 0 up to 400 meV at frequency THz of the incident beam. The calculation shows that B-max increases when Fermi energy grows, but there are regions of plateaus resulting in semiladder type of this dependence. The peak values of light absorption manifest a periodic-like dependence on Fermi energy with a huge change in value (in several orders), although the increase in average of maximum value of absorption with Fermi energy is also observed.

In general, the bulk modulus(B), shear modulus(G) and Young's modulus(E) of pure Co and Co-W alloy increase approximately linearly with the increasing pressure.

This is crucial to clarify the functioning of a mechanism, which can improve the impurity electroactivity. However, this observation, which is usually performed by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), is limited by some restrictions in the microscopic imaging conditions, such as the microscope resolution, the defocus of the objective lens, the specimen thickness, and the projected orientation of the specimen (i.e. the zone axis).

We prepared redox cleavable PLL-g-PEG to switch adhesion on demand. Redox sensitivity was obtained by introducing disulfide linkers between the PLL backbone and PEG strands. This modification was done alone or in combination with an azide end on the PEG strands that enabled in situ conjugations of adhesion peptides or fluorescent labels (by a simple application of commercially available molecules for copper-free click chemistry compatible with cell survival). To balance the functional (adhesion-promoting) vs cell-repellent copolymers, mixed layers of adjusted compositions were obtained by coadsorption from mixed solutions of the cleavable copolymer with noncleavable and repellant PLL-g-PEG. The deposition of copolymers and quantitative cleavage as triggered by reductive conditions (application of solutions of tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine, dithiothreitol, or glutathione) were characterized by QCM-D, XPS, and fluorescence microscopy.

We demonstrate here that the direction of self-propulsion, relative to the particle orientation, may be as influential for the phase behavior as the pair interactions are for passive particles, and enable dynamic properties that are not available to passive systems. We perform simulations on ensembles of self-propelled squares, and find that squares that self-propel in the direction perpendicular to a side rapidly reach a steady state with a characteristic cluster distribution, positional order, and well-defined diffusion constant. After tuning the direction towards a corner, the particles form large and dense clusters that show a transient collective motion, and display remarkable fluctuations over long time scales, with a distinct periodicity. Clusters of these particles appear unstable beyond a critical size, and susceptible to a catastrophic disintegration. Directionality is found to effect equally sharp transitions in the mixing properties of active squares and passive squares, and the behavior of the passive ensemble. We relate directionality to the collision dynamics and the resulting reaction network of clusters, evolved by a Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, to correlate propulsion direction to the observed phase behavior. Understanding this behavior could offer new design rules for programmable materials, and grant further insights in the dynamic processes that nature employs for self-assembly.",10.1039/c9sm01120j,610,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

The structure and chemical composition of the ferrites were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The presence of peaks in the XRD patterns was confirmed by the formation of a cubic spinel structure, because the main peaks of the patterns were related to the single-phase cubic spinel structure with PDF-number of 008-0234. The XRD patterns showed a slight shifting in peaks position due to unstable spacing values with increasing Mg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ contents in all ferrites. The mean crystallite size and lattice constant were determined from the Scherer's formula and XRD data. They were found to have been increased by the increase of x concentration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images were used to analyze the ferrites' structures. In addition, room temperature magnetization and coercivity of ferrites were determined from the hysteresis loops in a magnetic field of 9 kOe by alternative gradient force magnetometer. It was found that the magnetization and coercivity of ferrites with increasing x contents were increased, which is discussed according to the site's occupation of the substituted cations on the sub-lattices. Among all synthesized ferrites, Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.8 showed the highest magnetization and coercively, whereas Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.0 displayed the lowest corresponding values.

From the analysis results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Hall-effect measurement, the amorphous GeSn film starts to crystallize at 450 degrees C while the crystallinity enhances at 500 degrees C by employing rapid thermal annealing (RTA) as the film crystallization process. With capping layer on the whole region, the hole concentration becomes too high to turn the JL P-TFTs off. However, by limiting capping layer on source/drain region to increase hole concentration, total series resistance is reduced due to lower sheet resistance and contact resistance, which consequently improves the drive current, I-ON/I-OFF ratio and field-effect mobility. Based on the best process conditions and structure to form the poly-GeSn JL P-TFTs, I-ON/I-OFF ratio up to 5.6 x 10(2) are achieved while peak field-effect mobility of 20.8 cm(2)/Vs is obtained.

The ESF mechanism uses a droplet of liquid material that is electrostatically deformed. ESF differs from Electrowetting and Electrowetting on Dielectric as the electrode used to apply the voltage is of a smaller diameter than the droplet being manipulated, and the electrode is located above the manipulated fluid. Modeling this movement requires adherence to the Lippmann and Young-Laplace equations simultaneously. In order to understand how the surface tension is specifically manipulated, as is required for the development of a model of representation of the phenomenon, a force-based interpretation of the Lippmann equation is outlined, with focus on how it compares to the force response provided by hydrostatic pressure under the influence of gravitational field forces. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a differential surface charge must be present of which the formulation is complex in nature, likely stemming from the combination of the internal pressure and a localized skin effect caused by an electric double layer that is present at the surface of the transformed liquid. In this study, a target liquid of gallium is manipulated under electrostatic charge in a physical experiment and compared against the geometry suggested by the developed model.

We observed oscillations of the melting transition line, in which the oscillating part of the melting temperature has sharp peaks when the number of vortices N exactly coincides with the triangular number n(n + 1)/2 (n is an integer number), at least for N < 50. This is in contrast to the case of square shapes where the enhancements appeared as broad peaks around N = n(2). Furthermore, the field ranges of the N-vortex state expand at the triangular numbers of N, suggesting that the triangular number of vortices has a more stable configuration than the others. Numerical studies on the configuration of vortices in a triangle shape show that geometrical matching with no defect structures is realized at the triangular numbers, whereas an edge dislocation often appears in the other nonmatching cases.

J,"Picandet, V; Challamel, N",Nonlocality of one-dimensional bilinear hardening-softening elastoplastic axial lattices,"The static behaviour of an elastoplastic axial lattice is studied in this paper through both discrete and nonlocal continuum analyses. The elastoplastic lattice system is composed of piecewise linear hardening-softening elastoplastic springs connected between each other via nodes, loaded by concentrated tension forces. This inelastic lattice evolution problem is ruled by some difference equations, which are shown to be equivalent to the finite difference formulation of a continuous elastoplastic bar problem under distributed tension load. Exact solutions of this inelastic discrete problem are obtained from the resolution of this piecewise linear difference equations system. Localization of plastic strain in the first elastoplastic spring, connected to the fixed end, is observed in the softening range. A continuous nonlocal elastoplastic theory is then built from the lattice difference equations using a continualization process, based on a rational asymptotic expansion of the associated pseudo-differential operators. The continualized lattice-based model is equivalent to a distributed nonlocal continuous elastoplastic theory coupled to a cohesive elastoplastic model, which is shown to capture efficiently the scale effects of the reference axial lattice. The hardening-softening localization process of the nonlocal elastoplastic continuous model strongly depends on the lattice spacing, which controls the size of the nonlocal length scales. An analogy with the one-dimensional lattice system in bending is also shown. The considered microstructured elastoplastic beam is a Hencky bar-chain connected by elastoplastic rotational springs. It is shown that the length scale calibration of the nonlocal model strongly depends on the degree of the difference equations of each lattice model (namely axial or bending lattice).

These phenomena are caused by the following temperature-dependent growth mechanisms. At 150 degrees C-200 degrees C, Au atoms are supplied into surface-regions of a-GeSn films from Au-islands by surface-diffusion, resulting in crystallization of only surface-regions. On the other hand, at 250 degrees C, layer-exchange of Au/GeSn occurs, which increases supply channel of Au for diffusion. This results in complete crystallization of GeSn to the bottom. Substitutional Sn concentrations in grown layers are increased with increasing annealing temperature. As a result, GeSn films (substitutional Sn concentration: similar to 3%) are obtained at similar to 250 degrees C. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

J,"Shi, YJ; Liu, L; Su, XL; Wang, S",Printing EGaIn nanodroplets out of liquid metal,"We report a method to fabricate surfactant-free eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) sessile nanodroplets out of liquid metal. The method takes advantage of weak adherence between the liquid metal and its ultrathin surface oxide layer. During the van der Waals exfoliation process of transferring the ultrathin oxide layer to a desired substrate, nanoscale liquid metal droplets could form due to dynamic wetting failure. Here we have prepared EGaIn nanodroplets on the surface of transferred Ga2O3 ultrathin films. Surface morphology measured by atomic force microscope shows the vast majority of nanodroplets are isolated and randomly distributed, with mean radius below 100 nm. This preparation method is facile, low cost and can be applied in fields such as Ga-catalyzed nanostructures growth and gallium plasmonics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, the head check is generated at the gauge corner of the rail surface of the high rail in the curved section. The initiation factors of the head check are thought to be a plastic deformation of the rail surface caused by the severe contact between the wheel and the rail. Hence, the occurrence situation and the initiation factor of the head check is widely known. On the other hand, occurrence of some head check was confirmed on the low rail in the curved section. However, the occurrence situation of the head check on the low rail is not clarified. Furthermore, the initiation factors of this typed head check is not also clarified. In this research, we conducted the on-site investigation and the analysis of the rail which had the head check on its surface, in order to clarify the occurrence situation of the head check on the low rail. In addition, we conducted the wheel and the rail contact analysis by use of multi-body dynamics and the measurement of the wheel and the rail contact forces on the service line to investigate the initiation factors of the head check. The results showed that the head check of the low rail is generated in the curved section with a radius of about 400-800m on the line where the tilting trains are operated. Furthermore, it is thought that the initiation factor of the head check seems to be the longitudinal creep force caused by the large differences between the diameter of the wheel on the high rail and that on the low rail in case of the tilting train running in the curved section.",10.1016/j.wear.2019.202989,629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it would result in energy loss. Especially, as the diameter of the silicon rod increases, the free space between the jacket and the silicon rod will vary, and the jacket's effect would be complicated. This work presents a numerical study of the polysilicon chemical vapor deposition (CVD), fines formation, and thermal loss during silane pyrolysis in a Komatsu reactor. The CFD software FLUENT with detailed chemical reaction model of silane decomposition was applied to predict the silicon deposition rates, fines formation and thermal loss produced by a water-cooled jacket. The effects of water-cooled jacket temperature, rod wall temperature, and the distance between water-cooled jacket and rod surface on the polysilicon deposition rate and the fines formation have been investigated. The model was verified by comparing the model predictions with the experimental measurements in the literature. The results show that the jacket wall temperature and rod diameter have a complex influence on the fines formation, CVD growth rate, and thermal loss. The jacket wall temperature should be adjusted as the rod diameter enlarges.

J,"Fujita, T; Doi, T; Arai, Y",Development of Flexible Fiber Conditioner in Chemical Mechanical Planarization,"A flexible fiber pad conditioner, which conforms well to the pad surface, has been developed. Conventional disc-type conditioners have a potential concern of uniform conditioning across the entire pad surface in terms of intermittent contact by face-to-face contact. In the flexible fiber conditioner, each fiber tip functions independently with constant contact force on the pad, by utilizing the bending effect of the flexible fiber. Therefore, the conditioner performs uniform and fine conditioning, following the height variation in the pad surface. Uniform conditioning was verified by a unique method using surface coloration on a pad with height variation. In addition, it was shown that, using the developed conditioner, the chips generated by pad conditioning were very small, and the pad surface was finely scraped and roughened. It was further demonstrated that the developed flexible fiber conditioner shortened the pad break-in process. Moreover, compared with the conventional disk-type conditioner, the developed flexible fiber conditioner resulted in a uniform polishing profile even in the midst of the break-in process. The results indicate that it is important for the break-in of the polishing pad, to uniformly scrape and roughen the entire area of the pad while following the pad surface, rather than planarizing the surface.

To demonstrate the effect, we confine long DNA to straight nanochannels of constant, rectangular cross-section (100 x 100 nm(2)) which are connected to large microfluidic reservoirs.

In this setup, the strength of electron-electron interactions in one of the arms (""tunneling tip"") is different from that in the other two arms (which form together the ""main wire""). For a generic single-particle S matrix of the junction, we find that the bias voltage V applied, even symmetrically, to the main wire generates a current proportional to vertical bar V vertical bar in the tip wire. We identify two mechanisms of this nonequilibrium-induced ""emergent chirality"" in a setup characterized by the time-reversal- and parity-symmetric Hamiltonian of the junction. These are (i) the emergence of an effective magnetic flux, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and (ii) the emergence of parity-breaking asymmetry of the setup, both proportional to the interaction strength and the sign of the voltage. The current in the tip wire generated by mechanism (i) is reminiscent of the Hall current in the linear response of a system the Hamiltonian of which breaks time-reversal symmetry; however, in the absence of any magnetic field or a local magnetic moment. Similarly, mechanism (ii) can be thought of as an emergent ""photogalvanic effect,"" however, in the presence of inversion symmetry within the main wire.

Capacitance-voltage measurements indicate that spray-deposited Al2O3 has a negative charge density of 3.19 x 10(12) cm(-2) for an 80-nm film, suggesting that it can serve as the passivation layer. Optical properties of spray-deposited Al2O3 are identical to the Al2O3/SiNx stack prepared by atomic layer deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, indicating that it can also serve as the optical trapping layer. Atomic force microscopy studies show that spray-deposited Al2O3 is crack and pore free, and its surface roughness has a root-mean-square value of 0.52 nm for an 80-nm film. Spray-deposited Al2O3 is amorphous as determined by X-ray diffraction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that spray-deposited Al2O3 is slightly Al-rich.

In particular, the highest Curie temperatures are achieved upon thermal annealing in a narrow temperature window around 200 degrees C, by promoting the diffusion of interstitial Mn towards the surface. In this work, we determined the thermal stability of both interstitial and substitutional Mn in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As thin films, using the emission channeling technique. At a higher Mn concentration, the temperatures at which substitutional and interstitial Mn become mobile not only decrease, but also become closer to each other.

Two important properties i.e. grain size and step coverage (S/C) of undoped channel hole poly-Si have attracted great attentions in practical manufacturing. The grain size affects the mobility of conductive poly-Si film and large grain size usually leads to high mobility. The step coverage influences the subthreshold swing (SS) and improved step coverage leads to small SS. In this paper, during the growth of poly-Si, the influence of different deposition conditions, such as temperature and gas source ratio between Si2H6 and SiH4, on the grain size and step coverage is investigated comprehensively. Grain size and step coverage are characterized using by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Precession Electron Diffraction (PED). It is found that as the decrease of deposition temperature, both the grain size and step coverage are improved. Compared to gas source SiH4, the employment of Si2H6 is beneficial in achieving large grain size to some degree and no further improvement can be obtained when the flow of Si2H6 is increased to a certain value. However, as-deposited poly-Si exhibits poorer step coverage using Si2H6 in contrast to SiH4.

First, the static and dynamic mathematical models of the output displacement and input force of the flexure hinge mechanism are established on the basis of J.M. PAROS's theory of flexure hinge design. Second, the geometric size of the flexure hinge is optimised through the numerical simulation analysis method, and the optimal design parameters are obtained in accordance with the requirement of the positioning stroke of the precision positioning worktable and the output displacement of the giant magnetostrictive actuator. Third, the vibration characteristics of the flexure hinge mechanism are analysed, and natural frequencies are obtained on the basis of an established dynamic equation.

Some of the energy of the system is irrevocably lost through various coupling mechanisms between the spin degrees of freedom and those of the underlying lattice, resulting in magnetic friction. In this work, we use micromagnetic simulations to study magnetic friction in a system of two thin ferromagnetic films containing quenched disorder mimicking a polycrystalline structure.

To proceed, the representation of material incompatibility is introduced into the EMMI model by incorporating the distribution of the geometrically necessary defects such as dislocations and disclination. To assess the newly proposed formulation, classical elastic solutions of benchmarks problems including far-field stress applied to the boundary of body containing a defect, e.g., voids, cracks, and dislocations, are used to compute the plastic velocity gradient for various states of the material in terms of assumed values of the internal state variables.

Using numerical analysis, the optimal superlattice parameters and annealing time at the growth temperature (similar to 180 degrees C) are found, which result in better control of the cut-off wavelength in superlattice absorbers compared to the corresponding HgCdTe alloy absorber. Simulations show that, by appropriate adjustment of annealing time, it is possible to achieve the same cut-off wavelength with a larger HgTe well width while the sensitivity of the SL to well width variations remains at 15 meV/nm.

The results show that the change in the length of the TC21 alloy during the continuous heating process results from the transformation of alpha phase with hexagonal close-packed to fl phase with body-centered cubic and macro volume variation which originates from redistribution of alpha-stabilizers and beta-stabilizers in the alloy during the continuous dissolution of a phase. It is found that the content of Al element decreases in the a phase with the dissolution of a phase, but it increases in the beta phase. Additionally, the increasing content of Al element leads to the decrease in volume of beta phase, which is also the main reason for shrinking of the alloy during alpha+beta ->beta phase transformation.

The phase transformations were studied by dilatometry and then the microstructures were evaluated. Mechanical properties were measured after various cycles of heat treatment. The results showed that the microstructure of this steel, at the cooling rates studied here, includes a mixture of bainite and martensite. The relatively high amounts of the substitutional elements such as Ni, as well as the low carbon content, resulted in the proximity of the bainite and martensite start temperatures. The B-s and M-s temperatures were determined to be 325 and 315 degrees C, respectively. This led to the formation of coalesced bainite in the microstructure. The maximum hardness of the alloy was obtained at the aging temperature of 450 degrees C. Additionally, the optimal combination of yield strength and impact energy was obtained by a single-stage aging treatment at 575 degrees C for 1 h.

AbstractJatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceaefamily) is a multipurpose plant with considerable potential in biodiesel production, and in cosmetic and medicinal uses. The part of J. curcas usually used is the oil obtained from its seeds, whereas the leaves generally represent the waste material. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and to preliminary investigate the biological activity of J. curcas leaves obtained from plants by a breeding program. To describe genomic structure, molecular markers were applied. For biological study, two genotypes (JA and JB) that are genetically divergent were selected by cluster analysis. A phytochemical analysis was carried out to characterize the chemical composition of the extracts, which resulted rich in biologically active compounds, whereas toxic phorbol esters were absent. Biological assays showed an antiproliferative effect on the Buffalo normal rat liver cell line (BRL-3A), with genotype B being more potent than that of the counterpart (JA). The purified compounds isolated did not show antiproliferative activity, suggesting that the effect observed was due to the phytocomplex and should involve several secondary metabolites.

Alternate prospective hermetic sealant candidates for transistor outline IR sensor packages were identified and evaluated. Hermetic sealant options for wafer-level IR sensor packaging were also investigated, which involves wafer-level hermetic cum vacuum packaging. Metallic hermetic sealant is preferred for this approach, since it facilitates integration with the getter material. However, the primary challenge encountered here is the requirement of high processing temperature for the getter activation. An activated getter adsorbs active gases inside the volume of the packages, resulting in lower internal pressure. It was determined that appropriate micro-alloying of the getter is required to minimize the getter activation temperature. This is achieved by selective micro-alloying of the getter material, which induces more grain boundaries and thereby promotes in-depth diffusion even at lower activation temperature. Integration of getter material with all three different types of metallic wafer-level bonding mechanisms was investigated.

First, calculations of the interface adhesion energy and Mulliken mean populations show that the aGNR/unilaminar NiO interface has good interface stability. Second, the current-voltage characteristics and the micro formation process of conducting filaments of graphene/NiO/graphene resistive random access memory with resistance layers of different widths are studied. The comprehensive performance of the device is fully exploited, and its storage window can satisfy the requirement of data storage when the width of the resistance layer is 17.6 angstrom. Finally, an increase in the concentration of excess oxygen causes an increase in power consumption and a decline in the current drive capacity, while the stability of the device is improved; moreover, the size of the storage window decreases but still meets the requirement of data storage. In summary, the storage performance is effectively improved by excess oxygen concentration of 3.82%.

By means of electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and atomic force microscopy, the influences of the nitrogen flow ratio on the phase constituents and microstructures of CrB2/Cr-B-O-N films were systematically investigated. Mechanical properties including the hardness and elastic modulus were explored by a nano-indentation tester. On increasing the nitrogen flow ratio, the N and O contents in films increased linearly and tended to become saturated, whereas the Cr and B contents decreased. With an increasing nitrogen flow ratio, the microstructure changed from a dense columnar structure to a bulky columnar structure, and then to a fine and stacked dense structure. Meanwhile, the deposition rate also changed with increasing nitrogen flow ratio, owing to the changes in structure.

Still, there are very limited studies on the metal deposition on polymeric substrates by thermal spray process due to various limitations and problems associated with this aspect, although some reports are available on the fabrication and characterization of bonding layers using low melt temperature materials. With this background, this study was taken up with the objectives of deposition of 309L stainless steel on some polymeric substrates (PP, Nylon 66 and PVC) by electric arc thermal spray process through a prior development of a bond coating. This bond coating was based on epoxy resin/micro silica with scattered and packed metal particles anchored over it, which changed the nature of the substrate surface creating a favorable topology for adhesion and scattering of the sprayed particles. Coatings having an average thickness of 129.06 mu m of stainless steel and 259.06 mu m of bonding layer (epoxy/micro silica) were obtained over a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) substrate, which had the smaller difference of coefficient of thermal expansion with the bond coat.

The first is an indirect approach using the water-retention curve (WRC) and the second is a direct approach using ebullition experiments. TheWRC along with the hydraulic conductivity of organophilic clay blankets in saturated and unsaturated conditions were measured using a flexible-wall permeameter with suction-saturation control. This device was also adapted to measure the ebullition pressure and the air permeability. The comparison of the experimental approaches was performed on organophilic clay blanket specimens in different initial conditions (unrinsed and rinsed to remove loose fines) under high and low effective confining stresses (20 and 5 kPa). The indirect estimates of air-entry suction from the WRC were similar to those obtained from the ebullition tests. This good agreement between the two approaches may add flexibility to the development of design specifications for capping systems.

Replacement is no longer an option, and ""retirement for cause"" is the current approach to maintenance and replacement. Consequently, there is an ever-increasing demand for efficient and robust nondestructive testing (NDT) methods and techniques that can determine the physical health of these structures. Large structures, which are primarily made of metals, either steel or aluminum, are susceptible to in-service corrosion and stress-induced cracking. Stress-induced cracks, particularly in heavily corroded steel members used in bridges, railroads, storage tanks, and similar structures, are difficult to detect using many of the standard NDT methods, increasing the risk of not being able to detect an existing crack. Microwave signals readily penetrate through dielectric materials such as paint and corrosion byproducts (such as rust) and can interact with the underlying metal, rendering cracks detectable. In this paper, the implementation of a microwave imaging system that utilizes the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) approach to detect surface-breaking cracks (in the form of manufactured narrow notches) in steel and aluminum samples under heavy corrosion and corrosion-preventive paints is investigated. In addition, the influence of signal polarization direction relative to crack direction and the cyclical severity of corrosion inducement are investigated.

Using the ability of dictionary learning (DL) in image feature extraction and sparse signal representation, a new iterative reconstruction algorithm, ART-DL-L1, is proposed to overcome the aforementioned limitations. This new algorithm is based on DL and an L1 norm constraint, combined with ART. An alternate iterative solving strategy based on an approach of 'ART first, then adaptive dictionary learning' is suggested and is explicitly described in a flowchart depicting the ART-DL-L1 algorithm. For both a noisy projection of 360 degrees sparse data and limited- angle data of 120 degrees, simulation reconstruction results from the classic Shepp-Logan image obtained using ART-DL-L1 appear to be better than those obtained using SART and total variation (TV) algorithms and also better than the cutting-edge ART-DL-L2 algorithm. Five evaluation metrics corresponding to the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the residuals and the structural similarity (SSIM) index are adopted to estimate the reconstruction effect. The results suggest that the five metrics obtained using ART-DL-L1 outperform those obtained using the other three algorithms. The impact of using patches of various sizes played by the DL part in ART-DL-L1 is considered in the simulations and the patch size achieving the best reconstructed image quality is identified in this case as 25 (5 x 5).

Although the trapped Fano-mode of the high-Q factor is found in asymmetric SRR, the conventional design limits the scaling down of resonators. As such, excitation and manipulation of multiple trapped modes of SRR is significant for driving innovative designs of terahertz metamaterials and metasurfaces. In this work, we present a novel approach to manipulating multiple terahertz modes by increasing the fractal levels as well as the geometric symmetry of complementary SRR. It is found that the multiple trapped modes become achievable only in the case that the gap of adjacent fractal SRR opposes each other. By increasing the fractal level, the intrinsic resonance modes change slightly, and more trapped modes appear in between the frequency range of the two major intrinsic modes. The map of surface currents and magnetic field distribution reveal that intrinsic LC resonance in the first or second level SRR dominates the intrinsic modes. By contrast, the trapped mode arises from the hybridization of high-order localized dipole oscillation as well as the multiple localized LC resonances. These findings create new design opportunities for scalable metasurfaces across the terahertz spectrum and beyond, with ability to create high-resolution sensors.

When the Al-Ni precursor is foamed in a hollow pipe, if the temperature distribution inside the precursor is uneven, the pore shape distribution becomes uneven. In free foaming, no anisotropy is observed in the foaming direction and the pore shape is isotropic. However, in the hollow pipe, the pipe expands in the pipe axis direction and fills the pipe. The interfacial adhesion between Al3Ni foam and steel pipe is excellent, and interfacial pore and reaction layer are not observed by SEM. In free foaming, the porosity is 90 %, but it decreases to about 80 % in the foam in the pipe. In the pipe foaming, most of the pore shape appears elongated in the pipe direction in the vicinity of the pipe, and this tendency is more remarkable when the inside pipe diameter is small. It can be seen that the pore size of the foam sample in the pipe is larger than that of free foam, because coarse pores remain after solidification of the foam because the shape of the foam is supported by the pipe. The vertical/horizontal length ratio expands along the pipe axis direction by foaming in the pipe, and therefore circularity is reduced.",10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.617,716,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no
J,"Han, W; Shang, T; Su, M; Gong, CY; Li, RN; Meng, B",Direct Sailing Variable Acceleration Dynamics Characteristics of Water-Jet Propulsion with a Screw Mixed-Flow Pump,"Strong nonlinearity and the relevance of time-varying dynamic parameters in the maneuverable process of water-jet propulsion were major problems encountered in the prediction of variable acceleration dynamics characteristics. The relationships between the thrust and rotation speed of a screw mixed-flow pump, drag and submerged speed of water-jet propulsion were obtained from flume experiments and numerical calculations, based on which a dynamic model of pump-jet propulsion was established in this paper. As an initial condition, the numerical solution of the submerged speed with respect to time was inputted to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for unsteady calculation based on a user-defined function (UDF). Thus, the relationships between the acceleration, drag, net thrust, propulsion torque and efficiency with respect to time were revealed. The results indicate that the relationship between the thrust and rotational speed of a water-jet propeller is a quadratic function, which agrees well with the experimental values. The variation of submerged speed with respect to time satisfies a hyperbolic tangent function distribution. The acceleration increases sharply at the beginning and then decreases gradually to zero, especially at high rotation speeds of the water-jet pump. The variations in drag and propulsion efficiency with respect to time coincide with the step response of a second-order system with critical damping. The method and results of this study can give a better understanding of the changes in dynamic parameters such as velocity, acceleration, thrust, and drag during the acceleration of a pump-jet submersible and helped to estimate the effects of pump performance on water-jet propulsion kinetic parameters.",10.3390/app9194194,717,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Han, ZQ; Sha, AM; Hu, LQ; Wu, RZ",Validation of the dynamic response of the HMA layer in an inverted pavement measured by strain foils,"Strain in pavement caused by traffic loading is a critical driver for various distress mechanisms. In this study, strain foils (SFs) are utilized to measure longitudinal strains at the bottom of a hot mixed asphalt (HMA) layer in an indoor inverted pavement. The validity and reliability of SF-measured strain are investigated through three tests using a heavy vehicle simulator (HVS). The three tests focus on the consistency and stability of strain measured by individual SFs and various SFs installed at similar positions, as well as the consistency of strain measured by SF and an asphalt strain gauge (ASG) at different test speeds, load levels, and loading cycles in an accelerated pavement test (APT). Fast Fourier transform is utilized to filter out interference in the raw SF strain data. Filtered SF-measured strains were converted into ASG-measured strain based on effective gauge lengths. Research results show that converted SF-measured strains did not reveal a significant statistical difference compared with strains simultaneously collected by ASG under different test loads and speeds throughout the APT at 300,000 repetitions. Moreover, individual SF can provide consistent results with the coefficient of variation (CV) less than 3.3 % under different speeds and load levels, and SFs installed at similar positions showed similar average maximum strain variations (MSVs) with a maximum difference of 5.8%. Moreover, the linear correlations between the average MSV and the test load, as well as the speed further verified the validity of SF-measured strain. It is believed that SF could be a viable alternative for strain monitoring in asphalt pavement.",10.3139/120.111414,718,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no
J,"Hayes, WW; Manson, JR",Calculations of Ar scattering from graphite,"Two recent experiments on the scattering of hyperthermal Ar atoms from clean and ordered graphite have been carried out in the classical regime, which is characterized by excitations of large numbers of phonons. The measured data, which consist primarily of angular distribution spectra, are shown here to be well explained by straight-forward classical scattering theory. The calculations confirm that the Ar-graphite scattering at energies of up to 14 eV is a single-hit collision process involving a large number of carbon atoms in the outermost graphene layers. This number is estimated here to be close to 9 carbon atoms. All of the measured angular distributions down to energies of 0.3 eV are supraspecular, but the present calculations predict that the angular distributions will become subspecular at lower energies. Calculations are also presented predicting the expected results of energy-resolved measurements under similar initial conditions. (c) 2019 Author(s).

Their structure and morphology can be controlled by tuning the precursor concentration. Microstructural analysis reveals that all the samples have distinct core/shell structure without impurities, and the NiO shells are built of many irregular nanosheets which enclose the surface of gamma-Fe2O3 core. As the precursor concentration decreases (i.e., more NiO content), the NiO grain grows significantly, and the thickness of NiO shells increases. Magnetic experiments are performed to analyze the influences of different microstructures on magnetic properties of samples and we have the following two results. First, at 5 K, along with increasing thickness of NiO shell, the saturation magnetization increases, while the residual magnetization decreases slightly. Second, the hysteresis loops under cooling field demonstrate that the value of exchange bias effect fluctuates between 13 Oe and 17 Oe. This is mainly because of the NiO shell that (i) is composed of irregular nanosheets with disordered orientations, and (ii) does not form a complete coating around gamma-Fe2O3 core.",10.1016/j.materresbull.2019.110495,720,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes

The specific insulation materials correspond to rigid closed-cell plastic foams, a type of polyisocyanurate (foam A) and a type of phenolic foam (foam B), whose thermal decomposition and flammability were characterised in previous studies. The assemblies were instrumented with thermocouples. The plasterboard facing was subjected to constant levels of irradiation of 15, 25, and 65 kW m(-2) using the heat-transfer rate inducing system. These experiments serve as (1) an assessment of the fire behaviour of these materials studied at the assembly scale and (2) an identification of the fire hazards that these systems pose in building construction. The manifestation of the hazards occurred via initial pyrolysis reactions and release of volatiles followed by various complex behaviours including char oxidation (smouldering), cracking, and expansion of the foam. Gas-phase conditions may support ignition of the volatiles, sustained burning, and ultimately spread of the flame through the unexposed insulation face.

Few works have studied the influence of the geometrical properties including annulus area, anterior / posterior disc height, and over the range of motion, but in general these properties have not been reported in the finite element models. This paper presents a probabilistic finite element analyses (Abaqus 6.14.2) intended to assess the effects of the average disc height (h(p)) and the area (A) of the annulus fibrosus on the biomechanics of the lumbar spine. The annulus model was loaded under flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation and analyzed for different combinations of h(p) and A in order to obtain their effects over the range of motion. A set of 50 combinations of h(p) (mean = 18.1 mm, SD = 3.5 mm) and A (mean = 49.8%, SD = 4.6%) were determined randomly according to a normal distribution. A Yeoh energy function was used for the matrix and an exponential function for the fibers. The range of motion was more sensitive to h(p) than to A. With regard to the range of motion the segment was more sensitive in the following order: flexion, axial rotation, extension, and lateral bending. An increase of the h(p) produces an increase of the range of motion, but this decreases when A increases. Comparing the range of motion with the experimental data, on average, 56.0% and 73.0% of the total of data were within the experimental range for the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, respectively.

The major factors affecting tensile strength measurements include the size of the specimen, tensile displacement pulling rate, and the shape of the tensile apparatus mold. The effect of the tensile displacement pulling rate and the behavior of crack propagation due to the shapes of the direct tension mold were investigated.

In addition, tests were conducted to measure the tensile strength of soils with different specimen depths and cross-sectional areas. The results show that there was no significant influence of the displacement rate associated with tensile force, crack propagation, and maximum tensile force. Triangular wedges are the best pick for direct tension tests.

The 0.6-1.0 mm salt beads were selected to form a ""salt bed"" in a steel die and the aluminum powder was filled into the ""salt bed"" gap via a tapping method by the Autotap instrument. The tapped mixture was cold pressed under 200 MPa to obtain the green compact parts. Then the salts were dissolved and removed in distilled water and three-dimensional open-cell green Al foam with controllable structure and high reproducibility was derived. After sintering at 460 degrees C for 2 h, the final Al foam was obtained and its relative density and porosity are 0.217 and 78.3%, respectively. The number of connectivity windows between cellular aluminum cells is 4 similar to 6 in average, and the window size is 120 similar to 200 mu m. The compressive load-displacement curve shows that the aluminum foam undergoes an elastic deformation stage, a plateau stress area, and a stress steep increase stage. The curve manifests the characteristics of foam metal compression mechanical properties, and its compressive strength and Young's modulus are 2.42 MPa and 0:38 GPa, respectively.",,741,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

Furthermore, the stress of prepared thin films is also calculated to investigate the relationship between stress and surface morphology after annealing process.

The reduction behavior of chromium ore using Si sludge is investigated precisely to determine the effects of carbon addition, reaction time, and reaction temperature. The pellets are dropped into the furnace after temperature stabilized. As the amount of C addition increases, the amounts of CO and CO2 gas generation increase. After the dropping of the pellets, the pellets are heated and the reaction starts at about 1,573 K or higher. The pellets maintain their shape until 10 min after the drop, and then melted. As the holding time increased, the size of the reduced metal particles increased. The chromium ore is rapidly reduced by the Si sludge, and the slag penetrated into the chromium ore and reduction progressed inside. As the reduction temperature increased, the reaction initiation time is shortened and the reaction fraction of the reduction reaction increased.

J,"Jyegal, J",Generalized Einstein relation for nonparabolic multiple energy-band degenerate semiconductors,"A generalized Einstein relation for electron gases of degenerate semiconductors with a system of typically two nonparabolic conduction band structures is derived and formulated in near-equilibrium condition based on using the semiclassical drift-diffusion equation. The result of this derivation shows that the Einstein relation for carrier gases in multiple energy bands generally depends on their mobilities unless the energy band structures are parabolic. The formulated results (a full formula and an approximate single-carrier-gas formula) are typically applied to GaAs and GaSb to calculate the values of the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to mobility for carriers in the lowest and upper conduction bands, and an in-depth investigation is made for the Einstein relation for conduction electrons in these semiconductors. It is shown, in particular, that highly degenerate GaAs exhibits the uncommon, peculiar property of the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to mobility for conduction electrons saturating in two different electron concentration, or Fermi energy, conditions, with increasing electron concentration or Fermi energy. It is also shown that for GaSb, the effect of the upper conduction band is so large that the use of any formula obtained for carriers in a single conduction band is generally unsuitable for describing the Einstein relation for conduction electrons in this semiconductor. In addition, a more generalized Einstein relation extended to a system of three nonparabolic energy band structures is also formulated and proposed in the paper, so as to be used to more accurately describe the Einstein relation for hole gases in degenerate semiconductors.

J,"Kamedaa, J; Jokl, ML",Ductile-brittle transition temperature shift controlled by grain boundary decohesion and thermally activated energy in Ni-Cr steels,"Temper embrittlement induced by segregation of metalloid solutes to grain boundary (GB) was evaluated by a shift of the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT). DBTT was found to be linearly correlated with the amount of metalloid on the GB (X-gb) for both dynamic and static displacement rates (d delta/dt) in high and medium hardness steels. Recent first-principles calculations have determined the GB embrittling potency (Delta e(p)) of segregated Sb, Sn and P. In both high and medium hardness steels, the slope (alpha) of DBTT vs. X-gb was found to be linearly dependent on Delta e(p) regardless of the segregated solutes. In high hardness steels, the slope is independent of d delta/dt, while in medium hardness steels the a is dependent on d delta/dt. An Arrhenius plot of d delta/dt vs. the reciprocal DBTT was used to drive the thermal activation energy (E-act), which represents a barrier to plasticity. It was found that E-act correlates to a reduction in the GB fracture surface energy. The Eact depends strongly on GB decohesion in high hardness steels but only weakly depends on it in medium hardness steels.",10.1515/corrrev-2019-0052,746,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Kang, B; Kang, S",Nanometer-Scale Surface Structure and Sterilization Characteristics of Na/Ag Ion-Exchanged Glass for Anti-Biofouling Application,"Most objects and structures exposed to a marine environment for more than a month undergo biofouling of the surface. Biofouling is a phenomenon in which micro-organisms attach to marine structures and may result in deterioration of the structure or breakage of the structure due to weight gain. In this study, glass, which can inhibit biofouling of marine structures, was prepared and its germicidal properties were analyzed. For this purpose, Ag ions were implanted into soda-lime-silicate glass by the ion-exchange method. For the glass immersed in seawater, the bactericidal effect of the glass specimen was than evaluated by inoculating the strain and counting the number of viable cells after 12 or 24 h. Experimental variables were ion exchange conditions, time immersed in seawater, and time spent inoculating the strain. In particular, the surface state of the ion exchange glass before and after immersion in seawater was observed at the nanometer level, and the elution amount of Ag ions with time was measured by the ICP mass analysis method. As the ion exchange time increased, the amount of ion exchange increased. The amount of ions was consistent with Fick's first law, which is proportional to the square root of time. When ion-exchanged specimens were immersed in seawater, the amount of Ag ions eluted was on the order of ppm. Si and Na ions were also eluted from the glass. As the ion exchange time increased, crystals of 60 similar to 80 nm, which are presumed to be Na2CO3 phase, formed densely on the surface of the specimen. However, when the glass specimens were immersed in seawater, crystals formed on the surface dissolved and disappeared. Cracks subsequently formed on the surface and finally the surface collapsed. After 30 days, a fresh glass surface appeared again. This is a very interesting result because it shows that the reaction between glass and seawater is very similar to that between aqueous solutions. When the glass implanted with Ag ions is immersed in seawater, the surface dissolves and the glass-network-structure collapses, resulting in considerable Ag ion elution, which enhances bactericidal action in seawater. For example, when a specimen immersed in seawater for 30 days was inoculated with the strain for 24 hours, the number of strains decreased from 2.1x10(6) cells/ml to 0 cell/ml, indicating 100% disinfection ability. In this study, soda-lime-silicate glass with Ag ion implantation by the Na/Ag ion exchange method showed an excellent germicidal effect when in contact with sea water. From this result, it can be expected that long-term marine biological pollution can be suppressed by applying the glass developed in this research to marine structures.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17041,747,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

To this goal, laminated composite samples with a distinct number of layers were bonded using ultrasonic consolidation. Then, tensile and biaxial hydraulic bulge tests at different strain rates and temperature conditions were conducted. The effect of the sample orientation on the mechanical response was also examined. Tensile and hydraulic bulge tests results were compared to observe differences in ultimate tensile strength and strain levels under uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. The effects of loading condition, strain rate, and temperature on the material response were analyzed and discussed on the basis of test results. In general, it was concluded that the maximum elongation values attained were higher for the samples subtracted along the sonotrode movement direction compared to those obtained from the normal to sonotrode movement direction. The elongation was obtained as high as 46% for seven bi-layered samples at high-temperature ranges of 200-300 degrees C.

J,"Khademi, V; Ikeda, M; Hernández-Escobar, D; Boehlert, CJ",The Elevated-Temperature Strength Enhancement of a Low-Cost β Titanium Alloy Through Thermomechanically-Induced Phase Transformation,"The effects of temperature and thermomechanical loading on the tensile strength and hardness were studied for a rolled, low-cost metastable beta titanium alloy, Ti-13Cr-1Fe-3Al (wt.%). Tensile tests were performed at temperatures between room temperature (RT) and 410 degrees C. The results indicated that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) decreased with increasing temperatures up to 300 degrees C. However, the UTS was 1400 MPa at 410 degrees C, which was approximately 150% higher than the RT UTS. It is believed that the formation of nanoscale omega and alpha precipitates, identified using transmission electron microscopy, hindered the dislocation motion, which resulted in the exceptionally high UTS at 410 degrees C. However, ductility was maintained, as the elongation-to-failure (epsilon(f)) was similar to 10% at 410 degrees C. Dynamic mechanical analysis suggested that phase transformations occurred between 370 degrees C-475 degrees C. To evaluate the effect of the phase transformations on the hardness, the as-received material was heat treated at 400 degrees C, 450 degrees C, and 500 degrees C for 2 h, which resulted in hardness values of approximately 340 Hv, 380 Hv, and 470 Hv, respectively. However, the greatest hardness value (500 Hv) was exhibited by the as-received material after it was tensile tested at 410 degrees C. This suggested that both temperature and loading history affected the phase transformations. As all the samples exhibited a ductile fracture mode, this work indicates that it is possible to maintain both high strength and adequate epsilon(f) for Ti-13Cr-1Fe-3Al (wt.%).",10.1007/s11837-019-03598-2,750,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A good combination of dopants would improve the optical response in visible regime and remove the isolated states from the band gap while keeping minimum structural distortion. Enhanced visible light absorption and effective utilization of photo-generated carriers would improve the photoactivity of TiO2 under solar irradiations. Mono-doped, co-doped and tri-doped models of molybdenum (Mo), carbon (c), and nitrogen (N) are developed in the structure of anatase TiO2 and the corresponding change in the geometrical structure, band structure, and optical response is noted. The Mo and C co-doping produced least structure modification when compared to a reference TiO2 system. The Mo 3d states are mixed with Ti 3d states reducing the band gap of Mo-doped TiO2. While shifting the Fermi level to the middle of the band gap, the C 2p states are introduced around the middle of the gap of C doped TiO2. The impurity states are occupied and maximum reduction in the band gap is found in Mo, C codoped TiO2. The addition of N in the Mo, C codoped TiO2 modified the band structure by creating isolated states in the band gap. The photo-response of Mo, C, N tri-doped TiO2 is prominent among the simulated models attributed to the step wise transition of electrons by the C 2p and N 2p states. The improved optical response allows more visible photons for absorptions but the isolated states may annihilate it.

The proposed HSR method first creates a low-resolution RGB image from a given HSI. Next, a histogram matching is performed on a high-resolution RGB image and a low-resolution RGB image obtained from an HSI. Finally, the proposed method optimizes endmember abundance of the high-resolution HSI towards the histogram-matched high-resolution RGB image. The entire procedure is evaluated using an open HSI dataset, the Harvard dataset, by adding spatial mismatch to the dataset. The spatial mismatch is implemented by shear transformation and cutting off the upper and left sides of the target RGB image.

If leakage occurs in buried piping, it is very difficult to find its cause and to repair it in a timely manner. In Korea, after the leakage has been identified, follow-up measures are implemented, such as temporary repair or maintenance. Therefore, the identification of potential damage, which is part of the integrity management of buried piping in soil and concrete, is fairly limited. Therefore, an effective buried-pipe aging management program that is applicable to Korean nuclear power plants and that includes the preventive management of damage is necessary.

When the level of gate voltage is low, the tunneling width of the TFETs is large. Thus, electrons move via the trap instead of tunneling directly. On the other hand, when the level of gate voltage is high, the tunneling width of the TFETs becomes narrow. Thus, when the gate voltage is low, the noise level of TFETs is high because electrons pass through the trap. However, when the gate voltage is high, electrons pass directly from valence band of source to conduction band of drain, so the noise level is low.

The switching-off process of SF6 arc discharges occurs at the region between the contacts during the opening sequence to interrupt the flow of excessive current in a faulty network. The arc is tolerated in a controlled manner until a natural current zero when the arc discharge is rapidly quenched to restrict the thermal and dielectric reignition to the interruption. An SF6 self-blast switching chamber combines two advantages of blowing by heat expansion of the SF6 and arc rotation by electromagnetic effect of coil to improve the switching performance on thermal and dielectric reignition. The thermal and aerodynamic behaviors of an SF6 rotating switching arc in the chamber physically are complex and difficult to understand only by measurement due to their three-dimensional effects. Since the late nineteen-eighties, significant progress has been made in the method of computational fluid dynamics describing the physical processes occurring in the switching arc. The final goal of computer simulation technology on the arc switching is to predict the switching phenomena on the thermal and dielectric reignition from an engineering point of view. In this paper, we have conducted quasi-three dimensional computations to predict the thermal and dielectric reignition of SF6 rotating arcs occurring after a current zero in the self-blast switching chamber.

The sample was crystallized in a rhombohedral structure with a space group of R-3c. XPS measurement of SNIO studies revealed Ni2+ and Ir4+ valence states. A systematic study of the temperature-dependent magnetization data revealed distinct magnetic anomalies: one was partially-disordered antiferromagnetic (PDAF) at T-N1 similar to 74 K and the second was a completely frozen state of PDAF at T-N2 similar to 18 K. Isothermal sweeping field, and field-cooling induced alteration of the PDAF state are responsible for the anomalous magnetic hysteresis loop in the vicinity of T-N2. Isothermal field-cooling caused significant vertical magnetization shift in the M-H loop is possibly related to the exchange bias like phenomena with field-cooled induced soft ferromagnetic phase in the PDAF phase and also attributed to the frozen state of partially disordered antiferromagnetism. This spin pinning mechanism is stable and robust against the sweeping field cycle, field-cooling and isothermal field-sweeping.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab3612,763,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

RTA, which is widely used in highly integrated short-channel silicon device manufacturing processes, deteriorates the electrical characteristics of SOI pseudo metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOS-FET) by affecting the interfacial properties between the top silicon and buried oxide layers. In order to replenish these interfacial properties, microwave annealing (MWA) was performed on the device under various conditions. Because MWA utilizes the direct energy transfer (DET) method, the RTA-induced thermal damage on the back interface was effectively removed despite a short processing time. The improvement was comparable to that of conventional thermal annealing at a higher temperature for a long period of time. Therefore, MWA is expected to be a very effective post-RTA heat-treatment technology for fabricating ultrathin-body SOI MOSFETs because of its low thermal budget.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17014,772,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

Thiol compounds encapsulated inside nanotubes in vacuum drastically change the electric properties of SWNTs by a charge transfer between the two species. The simplicity of the synthetic process offers a viable route for large-scale production of SWNTs with controlled doping states by using mat-type SWNTs. Optical characterization (Raman and near-infrared spectrum) and electric property (conductivity) reveals that a charge transfer between the SWNTs and compounds occurs through the difference in the ionization energy and electron affinity. We confirm an electron density change in SWNTs through optical spectroscopy and conductivity measurement in vacuum.

The results showed that the copper grains and ferrite grains of steel in CCS wires are elongated along the drawing direction and transformed to fiber microstructure. The microstructure of copper and steel in CCS wires experiences recovery, recrystallization and grain growth after annealing treatment. The elongated copper grains and ferrite grains of steel gradually transformed to equiaxed grains and the grain sizes increased with annealing temperature increasing. With the increase of deformation amounts, the misorientation angle of copper and steel changes from large angle to small angle and the texture variation of copper is not obvious, which is inconsistent with the texture change of pure copper wire. However, the texture variation of steel is consistent with that of a single steel wire, mainly the fiber texture in the direction of <110>. With the annealing temperatures increase, the misorientation angle of copper and steel changes from small angle to large angle. The variation of texture with annealing temperature is similar to that of single copper and steel wires. For copper, when annealing temperature is less than 850 degrees C, the intensity fluctuation of texture is not very obvious. The <111>-<211> texture becomes diffused.

Four surfactants were prepared to modify the glassy carbon electrode, including a cationic surfactant (CTAB), an anionic surfactant (SDBS) and two nonionic surfactants (Tween 80, OP-10). Each modified electrode was applied to detect the p-nitrophenol in sodium acetate buffer solution, and the reduction peak current and reduction peak potential of p-nitrophenol were measured by linear sweep voltammetry under different concentrations of each surfactant. The results show that the cationic surfactant reduced the peak current, reaching the optimal effect at the concentration of 2.95 x10-4 mol/L; the anionic surfactant and nonionic surfactants reduced the peak current, and the reduction effect depends on the micelle effect of the surfactants and other factors; the cationic surfactant suppressed the reduction peak potential at concentrations of 0 similar to 2 x10-4 mol/L, while the other three surfactants cannot reduce the reduction peak potential; the CTAB was proved as the most sensitive material for detecting p-nitrophenol on electrode surface.

The results show that the post-yield softening is observed due to the disentanglement of molecular chains, after the stress approaches the yield peak, and a localized temperature rise is induced by the friction between molecular chains; with the progressive increasing of load, the strain hardening occurs due to the preferred orientation of molecular chains in the direction of stretching, which induces the stress and temperature rise increase. In the meantime, it is found that both the yield peak and localized temperature rise are increased significantly with the increase of strain rates; however, the competition exists between the strain softening induced by the dissipation heat generation and the strain hardening, making the sensitivity of localized plastic flow on the strain rate decreased. Based on the finite element software ABAQUS, the finite element model of a plate specimen was established to study the thermo-mechanically coupled behavior on the tensile deformation of SMPU. By comparing the contours of plastic strain field with that of temperature field at different moments, it is found that the forming of the localized plastic flow and temperature rise start from the initial defect and gradually move towards the middle and the expand to the entire sample, simultaneously.

However, commercialization of the trivalent chromium method has been hindered because the resulting chromium films exhibit inferior mechanical properties compared to hexavalent chromium coated film. In this study, we enhanced the properties of trivalent chromium electroplated film using a pulse-reverse (PR) method. Firstly, the cathodic current density needed to produce a shiny surface was optimized using direct current (DC) electroplating. After optimizing the cathodic current density, the appropriate anodic current density for PR electroplating needed to achieve optimum crack density and corrosion resistance was investigated. The chromium coating prepared using PR electroplating exhibited higher corrosion resistance than that prepared by DC electroplating, because it suppressed crack formation. Concerning the electrochemical corrosion behavior in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, the optimized sample (PR2) electroplated at an anodic current density of 0.04 A cm(-2) showed a corrosion potential shift of 129.9 mV to the anodic direction, and an increase in electrochemical corrosion resistance which was bigger than the chromium film prepared using DC electroplating.

Both growth rates and Al/N ratios affect crystal qualities of AlN films. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of (10 (1) over bar5) X-ray rocking curves (XRCs) change from 0.22 to 0.31 degrees with changing of the Al/N ratios, but the curves of (0002) XRCs change from 0.04 to 0.45 degrees with changing of the Al/N ratios. This means that structural deformation due to dislocations is slightly affected by the Al/N ratio in the (10 (1) over bar5) XRCs but affected strongly for the (0002) XRCs. From the viewpoint of growth rate, the AlN films with high growth rate (HGR) show better crystal quality than the low growth rate (LGR) films overall, as shown by the FWHM values of the (0002) and (10 (1) over bar5) XRCs.

Substitutions of (SiO4)(4-) ions with (GeO4)(4-) in Ca-4(La4Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 ceramic increased its densification temperature and thus led to a significant grain growth; however, replacement of Ca2+ and (PO4)(3-) ions by Mg2+ ions and (VO4)(3-) ions, respectively, decreased its densification temperature and resulted in grain refinement. Various rare-earth-metal and (WO4)(2-) ion substitutions on La3+ and Pr3+ and (PO4)(3-) sites, respectively, of Ca-4(La4Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 ceramic had no impact on the sintering temperature.

Under the high voltage conditions, a high energy impulse causes breakdown discharge resulting in test equipment failure. In this article, several unique types of LC and RC filtering circuit models are proposed to protect the nonlinear dielectric conductivity measurement system. Simulation of the proposed design models are carried out using ""MATLAB Simulink"". The simulation results revealed that all LC and RC filtering circuit models have a protective function for the test equipment, and can buffer the voltage-raising amplitude. By comparison, it is observed that the LC filtering circuit model has a better buffer-function than RC filtering circuit model. The LC filtering circuit can make the voltage-output curve more lenitive, and significantly increase the safety of measurement system. In addition, the comparison of single LC/RC and pi LC/RC filtering circuit models show that the pi LC/RC filtering circuit model has a better buffer function. Furthermore, in the high electric-field breakdown the pi LC/RC model can make a less steeper voltage-output curve. The filtering principles of these kinds of filtering circuit models were discussed, and the correctness of simulation results were validated by experiments. (c) 2019 Author(s).

Various shapes of crystals of the zeolite phase formed in the geopolymers prepared in this study, such as needle-like crystals with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 40 nm and lengths of 200 to 300 nm, and plate-shaped crystals overlapped with each other, which is thought to be due to the uneven composition of the slag used as a raw material or to local compositional changes of the alkali activator. By measuring the pH of immersion liquid, the following facts can be seen: foamed geopolymers synthesized from IGCC slag require a room-temperature curing period of at least 7 days, whereas non-foamed specimens require a room-temperature curing period of at least 28 days to consume alkaline activators. This is due to the increase in the specific surface area of the foamed specimen as the specimen is expanded, which thereby increases the contact area between the alkali activator and the slag. The foamed specimens, however, produced larger cracks and pores when immersed in water, while a smaller cracks and pores occurred in the non-foamed specimens.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17046,809,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,

Eight sample types were fabricated with various Cu opening sizes and solder pastes. The Cu opening sizes of the component and substrate were 200 mu m or 380 mu m, respectively, and the component formed a Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) solder bump which was placed on the Sn-58Bi solder paste or epoxy Sn-58Bi solder paste printed on the substrate and then reflowed. The microstructures of the solder joints were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the chemical compositions were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron probe X-ray micro-analyzer (EPMA). Epoxy was formed around the solder joints after the reflow process, improving the bonding strength of the epoxy-contained solder joints. Specifically, the bonding strength of the epoxy Sn-58Bi solder joints increased about 2.9 times in the 200 mu m (opening size of component)/380 mu m (opening size of substrate) sample. When the opening size of the component and substrate differed, a fracture occurred at the smaller opening size. On the other hand, a fracture occurred at the substrate side for the SAC305 (solder paste of component)/Sn-58Bi (solder paste of substrate) solder joints, while a fracture occurred at the interface between SAC305 and Sn-58Bi at the SAC305/epoxy Sn-58Bi solder joints for samples with the same opening size between the component and substrate.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17063,810,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no
J,"Miodowska, J; Bielski, J",The Influence of Loading Program on the Stimulated Callus Mineralization,"The aim of this work is to describe the change of physical properties of the callus material with the use of the proposed mathematical model for callus remodeling. Callus tissue can be considered as a biomaterial where it's properties change over time due to the stimulated healing process. The proposed model is based on the mechanical stimulus theory. It is used to estimate the stress-stimulated change in the callus, Young's modulus, and the density in the case of a mandible fracture. Three healing loading programs are discussed and compared: optimal, intermittent, and intermittent with residual load. Here, the optimal loading program is understood as the in-time change of stimulating loads, which results in the shortest necessary healing time and, simultaneously, in the most uniform distribution of material density in the analyzed domain. The necessary healing time is a period after which the callus density (and hence the Young's modulus) reaches the desired value. The results of the study suggest a significant difference in the value of the callus maximal density between all three analyzed loading programs for a given healing time interval. The highest values of the density are obtained using the optimal loading program, however, all three programs provide satisfactory density distributions. The analytical results are compared with the callus density estimation based on the computer tomography (CT) medical data.",10.3390/app9204268,811,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

The effect of stabilization patterns on non-crimp fabric is crucial as they produce different mesoscale bundle shapes and bundle volume fractions which may affect the static and fatigue properties of non-crimp fabric composites. The studies show that tensile modulus and fatigue life decline with increasing amount of uniaxial stabilizations. Different stabilizations with different bundle shapes influence the final composite properties through various factors than just the volume fraction. The multiaxial stabilizations with higher static tensile strength have shorter fatigue life as compared to uniaxial stabilizations with lower tensile strength. As the areal weight of stabilizing yarns increases, fatigue life decreases at all stress levels which show the deleterious effects of stabilizations on the fatigue behavior of composites.

Shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of the bioreactor from the cell growth of E. coli KACC 91335P to those for its production of CMCase were investigated for development of the simple and economic process with the high productivity and low cost. The production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P with shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed from the cell growth to its production of CMCase in a 100 L pilot-scale bioreactor was 1.36 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for the production of CMCase and it was even 1.54 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for cell growth. The best time for the shift in the optimal conditions was found to be the mid-log phase of cell growth. Owing to the mixed-growth-associated production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P, shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of bioreactors from the cell growth to its production of CMCase seemed to result in relatively more cells for the participation in its production of CMCase, which in turn enhanced its production of CMCase.

The oxide coatings on die-cast AZ91D Mg alloy mainly consist of MgO and MgAl2O4 phases. The proportion of each crystalline phase depends on various electrical parameters, such as duty cycle and frequency. The surfaces of oxide coatings exhibit as craters of pancake-shaped oxide melting and solidification particles. The pore size and surface roughness of the oxide coating increase considerably with increase in the number of duty cycles, while the densification and thickness of oxide coatings increase progressively. Differences in the growth mechanism may be attributed to differences in oxide growth during PEO treatment that occur because the applied operating voltage is insufficient to reach breakdown voltage at higher frequencies. PEO treatment also results in the oxide coating having strong adhesion properties on the Mg alloy. The micro-hardness at the cross-section of oxide coatings is much higher not only compared to that on the surface but also compared to that of the conventional anodizing oxide coatings. The oxide coatings are found to improve the micro-hardness with the increase in the number of duty cycles, which suggests that various electrical parameters, such as duty cycle and frequency, are among the key factors controlling the structural and physical properties of the oxide coating.",10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.609,829,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no

Herein, we report on the bioinspired silicification of the nanostructured surfaces of hexagonally close-packed silica bead (hc-SB) arrays using a liquid-phase deposition (LPD) method. This process, governed by the kinetics of silicification, was controlled using the concentration of the reactants and the reaction temperature and monitored in real time using a quartz-crystal microbalance, which allowed the investigation of the silicification on the surface during the LPD reaction. These heterogeneous LPD reactions on hc-SB arrays were optimized to mimic natural 3D hierarchical structures. Anisotropic silicification of the nanostructures occurred owing to differences in the energy and local concentration of silicic acid on the nanostructured surface. A 3D hierarchical pore network was realized via a heterogeneous LPD reaction by controlling the size, location, and arrangement of the SBs. We believe that our silicification process on nanostructured surfaces can lead to great improvements in the bioinspired morphogenesis-based engineering of 3D hierarchical structures.",10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b01998,830,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

However, the authors intended the deposition of the SiCOH films, which does not need the post-deposition process to form the pores by using the dual precursors having different structures. The octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) have different structures which were of the ring shape and the linear shape, respectively. The OMCTS and TEOS were used to fabricate the plasma polymerized low dielectric constant SiCOH film by using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system in this work. A ratio of OMCTS and TEOS was adjusted by controlling flow rates of precursor carrier gases into the process chamber. The SiCOH films, which were deposited with dual precursors, showed the very low dielectric constants (relative dielectric constant k similar to 2.06 and 2.09) at plasma power of 10 W. All the fabricated SiCOH films showed the proper leakage current densities below 10(-6) A/cm(-2) at 1 MV/cm as the intermetallic dielectric material. The SiCOH films were investigated to study the relations between dielectric constants and chemical structures by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

In particular, we contrast the scattering of a spinon to that of a free spinless fermion in the XY model to highlight the effect of strong correlations. For the one-spinon scattering in an odd-site chain, we find regular behavior of the scattering coefficients. In contrast, in an even-site chain there is a transfer of transmission probability between the two spinon branches that grows exponentially with system size. We link the exponent of the exponential behavior to the dressed charge that characterizes the critical properties of the 1D Heisenberg model, an interplay of topological and critical properties.

By means of density functional theory calculations, films grown on SrTiO3 substrates with (001), (110) and (111) orientations have different amount of charge transfer across the interface. Different charge transfer induces different interfacial conductivity behavior and at the same time modifies the carrier density of adjacent LaNiO3 films. The manipulation of MIT by substrate orientation can be achieved through interfacial charge transfer induced interfacial conductive layer with the modified conductivity of LNO layer.

Exact solutions are derived for the case where the generalized screw dislocation is located in the matrix under a remote anti-plane shear stress field, an in-plane electric field, and a magnetic field. Based on the complex variable method, the complex potentials of both the matrix and the inhomogeneity are obtained in series, and analytic expressions for the generalized stress and strain field, the image force, the generalized stress intensity factor of the blunt crack tip, and the energy release rate are derived explicitly. The presented solutions include some previous solutions, such as pure elastic, piezoelectric, piezomagnetic, and circular inclusions. Typical numerical examples are presented and the influences of the dislocation position, the volume of inhomogeneity, and the elliptic hole on these physical quantities are discussed. The results show that the magneto-electro-elastic coupling effect has a great influence on the image force and the equilibrium position of dislocation, especially when the dislocation approaches the interface; the coupling effect makes the image force on the screw dislocation follow different variation laws in piezoelectric-piezomagnetic composite materials compared with elastic materials.",10.1177/1081286519832064,836,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no

In the past, it was known that the presence of 180 degrees domain walls of BFO hinders a plausible exchange bias interaction. To understand the role of the strain-induced effects on such 180 degrees domain walls and its effect on the exchange bias, NiFe, a soft ferromagnetic layer, was grown on the epitaxial BFO AFM layers. An approximately 80nm BFO layer was grown epitaxially in both the tetragonal (001) phase on the LaAlO3 (001) substrate and the rhombohedral (111) phase on the SrTiO3 (111) substrate, with a thin (10nm) layer of Ni80Fe20 on top of it. An exchange bias of 510 Oe was observed in the tetragonal phase of BFO with a c/a ratio of 1.22, which is comparable with the exchange bias shown by the (111) oriented rhombohedral phase (360 Oe). Both the tetragonal (001) and rhombohedral (111) layers possess ferroelectric polarization normal to the sample surface and so the domain walls are mostly 180 degrees oriented which is expected to have a minimum effect on the exchange bias.

In this paper, the split-ring resonator array-based evanescent amplification in the microwave regime is implemented for strongly enhancing radiation from an electrically small radiator. The electrically small radiator considered here is a chip inductor loaded open coplanar waveguide antenna. This weakly radiating source when placed in the vicinity of split-ring resonator array, it is seen that the radiated power could be greatly enhanced.

J,"Sarychev, V; Nevskii, S; Konovalov, S; Granovskii, A; Gromov, V",Disintegration mechanism of second phase particles under electron beams,"The paper suggests a disintegration mechanism of silicon particles in aluminum in the heat-impact zone of a low-energy high-current electron beam. This inclusion was modeled with a round plate (radius R and thickness h). Disintegration of silicon inclusion was assumed to be possible due to discrepancy of elasticity modulus and linear expansion thermal coefficient caused by the evolving dynamic instability. In conditions of high-speed cooling a silicon plate is subjected to compression stresses, since linear expansion coefficient of aluminum is above that of silicon. If these forces applied, instability and fracture of a plate are registered. Using methods of elasticity theory it was found out that the value of these stresses is around 1 GPa. The initial stage of this instability was analyzed by methods of Theory of Plates and Shells. In terms of this theory, a critical stress (similar to 10(7)-10(9) Pa) was determined close to the clamped ends of a plate and hinged plates. So, it was concluded, that a suggested mechanism of silicon particles disintegration in the heat-impact zone of an electron beam seems to be the most probable one. Relay-Taylor instability on the inclusion and matrix border is thought to be another mechanism of particles disintegration. According to the linear analysis of this instability, a wavelength with the maximal growth speed of disturbances is similar to 4 mu m, for inclusions similar to 1 mu m these findings exceed significantly the experimental data.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab39b3,855,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no

Unlike some of the previously reported studies, in which the PBTI lifetime of TFET is much longer than that of MOSFET, in this study, the PBTI lifetime of TFET is found to be shorter than that of MOSFET. This result is very interesting, because degradation of electrical parameters of TFET is mainly affected by local traps near the source junction rather than global traps in the channel region. Large degradation of the electrical parameters of TFET due to PBTI stress would result from large fluctuation of the vertical electric field caused by traps near the source junction. This electric field fluctuation near the local region in TFET has more impact on electrical parameter degradation than channel conductivity fluctuation in MOSFET. Therefore, to improve the reliability characteristics of TFET, evaluation of PBTI characteristics and improvement of the quality of gate oxide near the source junction are essential.",10.1166/jnn.2019.16992,866,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of seawater immersion on monotonic tensile, stress relaxation, and cyclic bending fatigue response of polyamide 66 nanocomposites containing 0%, 1%, and 5% hectorite organoclay were investigated. Seawater equilibrated nanocomposites demonstrated less moisture absorption compared to their pure counterparts. The imbibed seawater significantly increased the ductility, and reduced the tensile modulus and strength of nanocomposites. A nine-parameter Prony series viscoelastic constitutive model was used to estimate the influence of seawater on the viscoelastic behavior based on stress relaxation data. The phenomenological model evaluated a drop of 82% in the instantaneous and the residual elastic moduli indicating a significant plasticizing effect of seawater. However, the amount of increase in the rubbery nature of polyamide is observed from the reduction in stress relaxation time of first Maxwell element by about 40%. Nanocomposites exhibited improved fatigue life with an increase in organoclay content even after equilibration in seawater.

Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. (C) 2019 The Authors.

A methodology is developed to measure and to analyse the CTOD from experimental data. The vertical displacements obtained by implementing digital image correlation (DIC) on growing fatigue cracks are used to measure the CTOD. Two fatigue tests at stress ratios of 0.1 and 0.6 were conducted on compact tension (CT) specimens manufactured from a 1 mm thick sheet of commercially pure titanium. A sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of the position selected behind the crack tip for the MOD measurement was performed. The analysis of a full loading cycle allowed identifying the elastic and plastic components of the CTOD. The plastic CTOD was found to be directly related to the nonlinear zone (i.e., plastic deformation) generated at the crack tip during fatigue propagation. Moreover, a linear relationship between da/dN and Delta CTODp independent of the stress ratio was found. Results show that the CTOD can be used as a viable alternative to the stress intensity factor range (Delta K) in characterising fatigue crack propagation since the parameter considers the fatigue threshold and crack shielding in an intrinsic way.",10.3221/IGF-ESIS.50.56,882,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,

The hybrid TP modes possess enhanced confinement, controllable hybrid TP frequency, and broadened spectral width compared with that of TP mode within the gold film/DBR structure. Moreover, the hybrid TP mode that due to the in-phased localized lattice resonance is dominated when the nanodisk radius increases, while the hybrid TP mode resulted from weak coupling of in-phased and anti-phased localized lattice resonance is weakened, especially when the radii of binary arrays approach identical. Thus, the tunable dual confined TP states can be realized through adjusting the arrays radii rather than changing the properties of DBR.

The results show that solution heating rate has a strong influence on microstructure, quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties. As solution heating rate rises, the grain microstructure transforms from the elongated grains to equiaxed grains and the fraction of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) also decreases. Moreover, the equivalent average grain size first decreases, and then increases. The relationship between solution heating rate and mechanical property is monotonic, not depending on strain rate. As solution heating rate rises, the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation decrease. In contrast to quasi-static loading, dynamic loading always tends to improve strengths and elongation.

The electrical tunnel current passing through the switch is calculated and the growth of Ag nanowires between two electrodes is simulated. Our calculations show the switching time (the time that is required to decrease the resistance of switch below the resistance quantum R-Q approximate to 6.5 k ohm) exponentially decreases as the applied voltage increases that agrees very well with experimental findings. Furthermore, we assumed the Ag2S layer is a few atomic layer thick so the diffusion time of Ag+ ions within the Ag2S layer can be neglected compared to the formation of Ag nanowires.

In this study, we investigated several characteristics of the focus after optimization to evaluate the enhancement effect of the wavefront shaping method, including the spot size, the intensity, and two types of enhancement factor. In addition, we studied the influences of various experimental parameters on these characteristics, including the number of controlled segments N, diameter of the irradiated area at the front of the scattering medium D, and distance between the expected focusing spot and scattering medium Z. A larger N and smaller Z provided a smaller focus spot. For a brighter focus spot, a larger N and smaller D and Z were required, while for a high-resolution focus spot, larger N, D, and Z were required. (c) 2019 Author(s).

A hyperbolic slot-shaped resonant cavity sensor for measuring the thickness of the liquid film on the inner wall of a cylindrical cavity is designed in this paper. We establish the relationship between the liquid film thickness and resonant frequency theoretically by the medium perturbation method and verify the feasibility of measuring the liquid film thickness in the TE111 mode. The mathematical model of the current density distribution line at the end of the cavity in the TE111 mode is deduced by the method of the vector field equation. Based on the mathematical model, the sensor is designed by Full-wave simulation software. The simulation results show that the electromagnetic leakage rate of the sensor is basically 0% and the sampling error is no more than -1.3%. The liquid film thickness has a linear relationship with the frequency offsets. The experimental results show that it is feasible to accurately measure the liquid film thickness on the inner wall of a cylindrical cavity by measuring the resonant frequency of the resonator. When the thicknesses of the liquid film are within 100 um, the measuring error does not exceed 0.245, which is about 50% lower than the conductivity method. (c) 2019 Author(s).

We show that this emergent phase can also be characterized by a modified long-range string order, as well as fourfold degeneracy in the ground-state energies and entanglement spectra.

Aggregation is achieved by a single coating, which causes the colloidal to particles agglomerate into uneven clusters on the substrate. The gradual evolution step improves the quality of the films by filling the pinholes left by the initial coating.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17027,920,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

The single-camera SS-DIC allows accurate surface 3D deformation measurements using a single colour camera and a specially designed colour separation device. It not only effectively eliminates the unavoidable out-of-plane movement/rotation due to unideal in-plane loading but also delivers uniformly distributed measurement points that brings great simplicity and convenience for internal virtual work calculation in VFM. In addition, since only a single camera is used for stereovision, the proposed SS-DIC system requires no complicated synchronisation devices. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are evaluated by heterogeneous deformation experiments of a holed aluminium alloy and 304 stainless steel plate. Combined with a high-speed colour camera, the proposed method is expected to be a simple and practical method for the calibration of material constitutive model under intermediate and high strain rate conditions using VFM.",10.1111/str.12327,921,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,,

The photocatalytic results revealed that the ZnO prepared in the aerobic atmosphere at 800 degrees C had the optimum photocatalytic performance. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance of ZnO prepared in aerobic atmosphere with low specific surface area is apparently better than that prepared in anaerobic atmosphere with large specific surface area.

J,"Zhao, XH; Zhou, PP; Chen, LY; Watanabe, K; Taniguchi, T; Natelson, D",Tunneling noise and defects in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride,"Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has become a mainstay as an insulating barrier in stackable nanoelectronics because of its large bandgap and chemical stability. At mono- and bilayer thicknesses, hBN can function as a tunnel barrier for electronic spectroscopy measurements. Noise spectroscopy is of particular interest, as noise can be a sensitive probe for electronic correlations not detectable by first-moment current measurements. In addition to the expected Johnson-Nyquist thermal noise and nonequilibrium shot noise, low frequency (<100 kHz) noise measurements in Au/hBN/Au tunneling structures as a function of temperature and bias reveal the presence of thermally excited dynamic defects, as manifested through a flicker noise contribution at high bias that freezes out as temperature is decreased. In contrast, broad-band high frequency (similar to 250MHz - 580MHz) measurements on the same device show shot noise with no flicker noise contribution. The presence of the flicker noise through multiple fabrication approaches and processing treatments suggests that the fluctuators are in the hBN layer itself. Device-to-device variation and the approximate 1/f dependence of the flicker noise constrain the fluctuator density to on the order of a few per square micron. (c) 2019 Author(s).

Concentration series of the crystals were grown by Czochralski technique from the melts with different MgO/SiO2 molar ratios.

Our results indicate that cellulase concentration is an important parameter for the ethanol fermentation of corn stalks. When the cellulase concentration was 0.30 g/L, the ethanol yield reached a maximum of 39.04 g, and the anaerobic fermentation using the corn stalk residues showed the peak gas production at, as early as, 3 d.

The simulated data of gas production were in good agreement with measured data, illustrating that the established model could satisfactorily describe the influence of different ratios of sludge and restaurant garbage on the production of methane.

However, there is less research about the interlaminar toughening mechanism of PNF up to now. The finite element model based on cohesive zone model (CZM), which represents the PNF thickness and property, was constructed to predict the delamination onset and propagation of CFRP. In the double cantilever beams test, the main conclusions are as follows: There is little effect of thickness of PNF on the peak load in mode I delamination of CFRP, but the resistance of propagation reaches the maximum when the thickness is equal to 20 mu m. The shape of the delamination front can be directly obtained from the simulations by studying the distribution of the normal traction. For a specific ply-orientation composite, once delamination begins to propagate, the figure of delamination front is consistent.

The MLRL is formed by the diffusion of carbon atoms that diffuse from gray cast iron into the TiNb alloy. During the diffusion reaction, the MLRL is gradually formed in situ on the surface of the TiNb alloy. Thus, there is a good bonding interface between the MLRL and the substrate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis indicates that the MLRL is composed of three layers; the outer layer is micro-nano carbide particles, the middle layer is multi-sized carbide particles, and the inner layer is gradient micro-nano carbide particles. EDS results indicate that the different particles have different ratios of Ti/(Ti + Nb). The XRD results indicate that the MLRL is mainly composed of (Ti-x,Nb1-x)C particles; (t)he diffraction peaks are located at 2 theta positions between the corresponding peaks of TiC and NbC. Nanoindention test results show that the hardness of the MLRL obviously increases (compared to that of TiC or NbC); the highest micro-hardness of the MLRL is nearly 2366 HV0.05. Benefited from the solid-solution strengthening, the multi-sized and layered structures, the relationship between the strength and toughness of MLRL can be improved.

The addition of MgO in excess of its solubility in the FeCo alloy results in the formation of amorphous grain boundaries, leading to a dramatic increase of the resistivity with values over 20 times that of pure FeCo films. As a result, a large self-bias ferromagnetic resonance frequency f(FMR) of up to 9.87 GHz is obtained in the absence of an external magnetic field (H = 0 A/m) and an electric field tuning frequency range of 4.55 GHz was achieved in the as-deposited films at an electric field of 7 kV/cm.

Specifically, float glass was used as the insert, Chemlok CH456 and CH489 were utilized as the glass primer, and soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was adopted as the material for injection molding. The adhesive force of the mounting brackets was measured, and the adhesive behavior of the mounting brackets was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicated that the adhesive force of the mounting brackets obtained by insert injection molding can be as high as 1027 N. The results showed that the primer located in fracture regions was torn from PVC and the glass. Double-interface adhesion was found between the glass, the primer, and PVC. In particular, the primer and the glass surface formed strong adhesion by mechanical locking, diffusion existed between PVC and the primer, and the diffusion depth was greater than 10 mu m.

The samples were tested for crosslink density, rheometry, and morphology, and the vulcanization reaction parameters were determined and evaluated. Silane improved the interaction between MK and the polymer matrix, evidenced by the increase in crosslink density and vulcanization reaction rate, the same effect silane causes on silica-filled composites.

Composite reinforcement layers are modelled as transversely isotropic ones, while elastomer liners are described by a hyperelastic material model that assumes incompressibility. Force-displacement, equivalent strain, equivalent stress results along with oblateness and curvature results for the complete process have been presented. It is justified that bending leads to ovalization of the cross section and results in a loss of the load-carrying capacity of the tube. Strain states in reinforcement layers have been presented, which imply that the probable failure modes of the reinforcement layers are both delamination and yarn-matrix debonding. There is a significant increase in strains due to cross-sectional instability, which proves that the effect of cross-sectional instability on material behaviour of the tube is crucial. A parametric analysis has been performed to investigate the effect of the member slenderness ratio on cross-sectional instability of the composite tube. It shows that Brazier force is inversely proportional to the slenderness ratio. It further shows that higher oblateness parameters occur in case of a lower slenderness ratio and that cross-sectional instability takes place at a lower dimensionless displacement in case of a lower slenderness ratio.

The thickness of the (i) a-Si:H buffer layer is varied between 2 and 50 nm, well beyond the values used in heterojunction solar cells. The change in this thickness plays a role on band bending at the heterointerface and therefore impacts the level of inversion of carrier population at the c-Si surface. Measurements are compared with 1D analytical calculations and 2D electrical modeling. It is demonstrated that the deep defect density, related to silicon dangling bonds, in the (i) a-Si:H layer strongly increases from 1 x 10(17) to 4 x 10(18) cm(-3) when the (i) a-Si:H layer thickness is decreased from 50 to 2 nm. This result is interpreted in terms of defect formation and dependence of the defect density upon the position of the Fermi level with respect to the valence band edge. Quantitative analysis in the framework of the defect-pool model demonstrates that the strong increase of defect density is also promoted by an increase in the width of the valence band tail in the thin (i) a-Si:H layer, suggesting that a very thin layer also suffers from increased disorder.",10.1002/pssr.201900411,939,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,

It contains many interesting physical phenomena and has a high potential for spintronic applications. Most magnetic memory devices are based on the magnetization switching operation. Thus, finding the switching mechanism, as well as the exact understanding of it, is an essential implement for spintronic devices. Here, we show that the current can switch the magnetization via chiral buckling. To destabilize the uniform magnetization, a critical current value is needed. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) produces a shift in this critical current and the sign of this shift also depends on the domain polarity. Thus, a certain current can select a certain domain polarity. During the switching process, a fluctuation of magnetization is exponentially amplified by the current that forms the magnetization buckling.

The high concentration of the H-atoms in the plasma assist the silicon atoms on the growing film surface to crystallize. Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) method was used to determine the nano-scale structures of nc-SiOx:H thin films, for varying hydrogen dilution ratios. The size, shape and the distribution of the nano-formations are found to depend strongly on the preparation conditions. From FTIR absorption and Raman scattering experiments, atomic oxygen and hydrogen contents and also the crystal ratio of the samples are evaluated. As results of nano-structural analyses, the morphologies, sizes and distributions of the nano-aggregations are found to be closely related to the crystallization of the films. From the SAXS results of the samples prepared at the hydrogen dilution ratio of 90%, the nano-aggregations are found to form in uniformly distributed core-shells. However, as the hydrogen dilution is increased to higher ratios to 95% and further to 99%, the nano-scaled fractals are deduced to form. The oxygen and hydrogen contents in nc-SiOx:H are strictly related to the crystal ratio of the samples. The crystal ratio is determined by the hydrogen dilution ratio during the deposition. The two-phase structure of nc-SiOx:H samples and the dependence on the hydrogen dilution ratio may suggest these materials are candidates for phase change materials.

The characterisation of the samples has been carried out by transmission electron microscope, UV-Vis absorption spectroscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscope and zeta potential analysis. Further, a comparative study of catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles of two different sizes was performed by monitoring the reduction of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Experimental study showed that smaller nanoparticles are more efficient in their catalytic activity than their larger counter parts. The consistency in sizes and shapes, higher stability and rapid synthesis are the major advantages of this synthesis method. Thus, this procedure of synthesis of gold nanoparticles may offer an attractive alternative to the existing ones and opens a full range of possibilities for various analytical applications.",10.1049/mnl.2019.0020,943,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes

In this work, electrodes were exposed to a simulated dissolver solution containing a representative fraction of low-activity actinides and fission products in 11.5 N nitric acid in a mock-up of the service dissolver vessel. Platinum nanoparticles were coated onto anodised titanium coupons through a seed-mediated hydrothermal method. The coated coupons were then exposed in the simulated dissolver solution for about 1185 h at 110 degrees C. Morphological and compositional analyses confirmed the presence of metallic Pt nanoparticles on the electrode surface with some localised cracking.

Also the particles are catalytically more active due to their extremely high-density AgNPs immobilised on the surfaces of Fe3O4@C particles.

We examine the low vanadium substitution regime: x = 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02. The intercalation reaction significantly increases the critical temperature (T-c) and the superfluid stiffness for all x. The nonintercalated samples all exhibit T-c approximate to 8.5 K while the intercalated samples all show an enhanced T-c > 40 K. Vanadium substitution has a negligible effect on T-c, but seems to suppress the superfluid stiffness for the nonintercalated samples and weakly enhance it for the intercalated materials. The optimal substitution level for the intercalated samples is found to be x = 0.01, with T-c approximate to 41 K and lambda(ab)(0) approximate to 0.18 mu m. The nonintercalated samples can be modeled with either a single d-wave superconducting gap or with an anisotropic gap function based on recent quasiparticle imaging experiments, whereas the intercalates display multigap nodal behavior which can be fitted using s + d- or d + d-wave models.

TMAdaOH and Cu-TEPA were used as templates to prepare the precursor for Cu-SSZ-13, respectively. Results showed that, with participation of HT-SiC, SSZ-13 crystal was successfully obtained by using TMAdaOH template, while it would get only amorphous structure by using Cu-TEPA template. NH3-SCR(Selective Catalytic Reduction, SCR) exhibited catalytic activity and stability of Cu-SSZ-13/HT-SiC in medium and high temperature zones was more effective than those of Cu-SSZ-13 without HT-SiC, and NO consumption by the former was about 11-fold of the latter at 500 degrees C. Moreover, compared with Cu-SSZ-13/alpha-SiC catalyst prepared with pure SiC (alpha-SiC), Cu-SSZ-13/HT-SiC shows better catalytic activity in the whole temperature range. These favorable performances are attributed not only to the good thermal conductivity and thermal stability of SiC, but also to the 7.34wt% Fe component contained in HT-SiC, which acts as an active site for reducing NO in NH3-SCR.

Adiabatic shearing sensitivity increases with the increase of bond energy, and the decrease of lattice electron number.

To better understand the role of secreted fungal hydrolases and their role in Candida albicans virulence, we developed an in situ model system using luminescent Re(I) and Ir(III) containing probe molecules embedded in a biodegradable (poly(lactic-coglycolic acid), PLGA) polymer and tracked their uptake using epifluorescent imaging. We found that secretion of esterases can explain how physically embedded probes are acquired by fungal cells through the degradation of PLGA since embedded probes could not be liberated from nonbiodegradable polystyrene (PS). It was important to verify that epifluorescent imaging captured the fate of probe molecules rather than naturally occurring fungal autofluorescence. For this, we exploited the intense luminescent signals and long spectral relaxation times of the Re and Ir containing probe molecules, resolved in time using a gated imaging system. Results provide a visual demonstration of a key virulence trait of C. albicans: the use of hydrolases as a means to degrade materials and acquire hydrolysis products during fungal growth and hyphal development. These results help to explain the role of nonspecific hydrolases using a degradable material that is relevant to the study of fungal pathogenesis on biotic (tissues) surfaces. Additionally, understanding how fungal pathogens condition surfaces by using nonspecific hydrolases is important to the study of fungal attachment on abiotic surfaces, the first step in biofilm formation on medical devices.",10.1021/acsabm.9b00520,957,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the determined mechanical properties, the evaluation of the failure behavior is an important quality criterion. Maximum adhesive strength is achieved with cohesive failure and this joint strength can be predicted. Based on this fact it is more important to determine the failure percentages objectively and reproducibly. In addition, adhesive-specific, characteristic structures are formed in cohesive fracture surfaces which indicate the failure-relevant, locally acting loads. In industrial practice, there is no evaluation method to objectively evaluate and analyze the failure ratio of an adhesively bonded joint. The innovation of the developed, computer-aided analysis of the fracture surfaces involves the objective determination of the failure ratio according to international standards and the further analysis of the failure-relevant fracture processes. This enables the adhesive user to evaluate a large number of test specimens in a time-efficient, objective and automated manner. The automated evaluation method calculates the failure mode proportions based on digital images of the fracture surface. The segmentation and classification use a histogram-based color differentiation. The region growing algorithms were optimized and tested with a database of different adhesives and materials. Furthermore, it is possible to get knowledge about load conditions of the destroyed joint by analyzing the fracture surface. To quantify the relationship between load conditions and the resulting fracture structure a topographical 3d method and a 2d imaging method is investigated.

Furthermore, no holes were formed in films of P0CB which is a P11CB without alkyl spacers due to its hydrophilicity.

The observation and the follow-up of the loading history and the characterization of the damage accumulation were evaluated in the presence of an artificial surface defect. The results made it possible to highlight a strong nonlinearity of the damage accumulation. However, the absence of sequence effects encountered in a defect-free material has been found. In the perspective of developing an approach to evaluate the influence of the defects on cumulative damage under variable amplitude loading, this work consists of coupling a multiaxial fatigue criterion adapted to defective materials with a law of uniaxial damage solicited under variable amplitudes loading. A cumulative damage law has been used to analyze the validity of the proposed method. Introducing the equivalent multiaxial fatigue stress due to the presence of the defect allowed us to predict the residual lifetime of a defective material, and to find the effects of sequences usually observed for variable amplitude loading for the defect-free material.

We show that a threefold-degenerate S = 1 impurity coupled to a critical bath has a nondegenerate ground state with a quantized charge, in qualitative contrast to the spin-1/2 case where the impurity is partially screened.

We validate our conjecture with unbiased Monte Carlo simulations up to S = 2.

Severe plastic deformation (SPD) imposes additional requirements on SS-tests because some of deformation mechanisms, such as shear band sliding, micro-cracks, etc., prove to be suppressed due to specific character of stress-strain state: complex loading path, all-round high pressure, and high gradients of stress and strain tensor fields. In this work, a novel method of SPD SS-curve construction combining the classical uniaxial compression test with microhardness measurements is proposed. The barreling effect is negligibly small owing to specific experimental conditions. This renders spatially uniform the stress-strain state and allows avoiding the inverse finite element modeling. The cast leaded tin bronze alloy Cu85-Pb5-Sn5-Zn5 has been studied during upsetting process. An experimental force-displacement diagram appears to be strictly linear up to the moment of destruction under uniaxial compression. The dendritic structure evolution in both axial and cross sections of a cylindrical sample was studied by optical microscope. Local distortions in elements of this structure are evidence of spatial fluctuations in plastic strain at macroscopic level. Microhardness in these sections was also measured. Shear bands appear at strain epsilon(p) approximate to 0.14 and they are responsible of the softening behavior. In this work, softening is contrary to the experiments on deep rolling treatment where the monotonic increase in microhardness was observed. Microhardness measurements allow expanding the total strain into dislocation sliding and shear band sliding summands. This expansion makes it possible to discard the shear band sliding item and obtain an initial segment of SS-curve (up to strain epsilon(p) = 0.32 for bronze Cu85-Pb5-Sn5-Zn5) available for SPD simulation.",10.1016/j.msea.2019.05.020,984,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

Using specular X-ray reflectivity we show periodic fluctuations of the material density throughout the entire thickness of the resulting coating. The number of periods corresponds to the number of passes of the substrate through the plasma of the magnetron.

J,"Gao, YK; Yin, PG",Bond Nature of Raman Shift in CdSe<sub><i>x</i></sub>S<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub> Nanocrystals: A Bond-by-Bond Approach,"Owing to the alloying effect, the bond composition of CdSexS1-x nanocrystals is complex. To reveal the bond nature of the Raman red shift in complex-alloyed nanocrystals, we propose the concept of a basic bond unit for nanocrystalline alloy systems. An alloyed nanocrystal can be decomposed into basic bond units according to a bond-by-bond approach. A local-mode model of alloyed nanocrystals is developed, which is applied to determine the Raman red shift of the destination bonds in a basic bond unit. Using this theory, the Raman spectra of CdSexS1-x nanocrystals are obtained. The calculated Raman curves are in good agreement with the experimental ones, indicating that the concept of basic bond unit can well demonstrate the chemical bond nature of the Raman spectra of the alloyed nanocrystals. Based on the strategy of breaking up the whole alloyed nanocrystal into basic bond units, the nanosize effect of Raman shifts may be accurately predicted even just by a pocket calculator.",10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b04211,987,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

J,"Yu, M; Qi, SD; Ren, ZF; Zhou, H; Yan, SS; Hu, SJ; Xu, MC",High Density of End-Oxygens Induced by NO Adsorption on (2 x 1)Ni-O/Ni(110) Surfaces,"The end-oxygens (end-O) of metal-oxygen chains on transition-metal (TM) surfaces play a vital role in the decomposition of H-contained molecules, such as H2O and alcohols. However, the achievement of high density of ordered end-O structures on TM surfaces is still challenging so far. In this paper, based on the evidence of ultrahigh vacuum-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we successfully prepared the high density of ordered end-O structures on Ni(110) surfaces through breaking the long Ni-O chains to short Ni-O chains by NO adsorption on (2 x 1)Ni-O/Ni(110) reconstructed surfaces. The mechanism of end-O formation has been interpreted: at low NO coverage at 90 K, NO molecules tiltedly adsorb on Ni atoms in Ni-O chains causing a strong distortion; when NO coverage is increased close to saturation (similar to 0.5 ML), the accumulated stress of Ni-O chains finally breaks the Ni-O bonds, resulting in the release of the host Ni atoms in Ni-O chains to the hollow sites and the formation of two end-O for each released Ni. Furthermore, the ordering of end-O structures on Ni(110) surfaces can be greatly enhanced by the annealing of the sample to 250 K. Such an approach to prepare the high density of ordered end-O structures is expectedly applied to other TM surfaces.",10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b05658,990,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

This work proposes a consistent approach to design Bragg gratings employing the concept of graded profile in a planar hybrid metal-insulator-metal plasmonic waveguide. A comparative study of various width modulations such as triangular, parabolic and rectangular profiles is presented. The most striking observation is that Bragg gratings with parabolic profile offer best performance in terms of compact track length (3.48 mu m), wide stopband (168 nm) and good transmission characteristics with fewer side lobes. Additionally, a nanocavity analysis is performed by introducing a defect length of 140 nm in the Bragg grating structure with parabolic profile.

J,"Taghavi, MS; Akbarzadeh, A; Mahdian, R",Deregulation of <i>BCL2</i> family genes in glioblastoma cells consequent to poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles treatment,"Brain tumours develop resistance to chemotherapy mainly due to the presence of the blood brain barrier which partially blocks the penetration of drugs into the brain. Poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles have been extensively proposed for delivering drugs into the brain and have shown their ability to cross the blood brain barrier in vitro and in vivo. However, the application of nanoparticles could be limited by their potential side effects. In this study, two glioblastoma cell lines with the poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles were treated at different concentrations. Through MTT assay, the viability of treated cells was quantified. Induction of apoptosis was analysed by flowcytometry as well as quantitative PCR assay for the expression of BCL2 family genes. The results of this study showed that the treatment with poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles induced neither apoptosis nor necrosis in these cells. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed that poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles treatment caused significant changes in the expression of some BCL2 family members. In conclusion, it seems that poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles treatment at non-toxic dose can change the expression of some apoptosis-related genes in glioblastoma cells while has no significant effect on their viability.",10.1049/mnl.2019.0034,992,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no
J,"Kim, YH; Lee, JR",Carbon rod missing inspection method of multidimensional carbon preform based on image processing,"This paper shows that just taking a picture of the carbon preform can be a powerful detection method of missing rod. The poor quality of the carbon preforms including missing rods cannot provide tailored composite to meet desired properties. By the way, the carbon preform is manufactured manually now and often there happen a mistake that a carbon rod is omitted. Therefore, an effective solution for guaranteeing the quality of the carbon preform is needed. For that reason, this paper proposes new inspection method that can detect the missing rods of multidirectional carbon preform. This method utilized some image processing techniques to simplify the image of carbon preform. In this method, the carbon preform image is modified so that the carbon rods and background can be easily separated. Thus, this new method found all missing rods and marked missing space with red circle. Moreover, because the inspection method suggested in this paper can be easily converted into the form of software, it is expected to be applied effectively to the fields of manufacture of the multidirectional carbon preform.",10.1080/09243046.2019.1573464,993,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

It evaluates critical values of triaxiality for various convex and non-convex failure criteria, unlike the existing model. It shows the effects of Poisson's ratio and intermediate principal stress for materials whose strength in tension and compression is either equal or unequal. Further, on this basis, the crack initiation angles are predicted for various crack inclinations and compared with those obtained from other fracture criteria. The plastic zone shapes supplement the results. Critical yield stress factor, a significant parameter at the crack tip got lowered as the difference among the three principal stresses reduced to a minimum.

During dynamic loop testing, the fiber ends are accelerated at constant levels of 20.8, 50 and 343 m/s(2). The test method is used to study Kevlar (R) KM2-600, which fails in axial compression due to kink band formation. The compressive failure strain and strain rate at the onset of kink band formation is calculated from the critical loop diameter (D-C ), which is monitored throughout the test using a high-speed camera. The results showed that compressive failure strain increases with strain rates from quasi-static to a maximum strain rate of 116 s(-1) by a factor of similar to 3. Kink angles (phi) and kink band spacing (D-s) were 60 degrees +/- 2 degrees and 16 +/- 3 mu m, respectively, over the strain rates tested.

Since VLS is a catalyst-based method, we have initially modeled the gold droplet using a modified Young's equation to be more suitable for SnO2 nanowires. Apart from the droplet geometry, the flow profile of the source vapor can also affect the overall formation of nanowires. This effect is more predominant for solid sources of SnO vapor where highly variable density and length of nanowires are observed. To understand this complex phenomenon, we describe a spatial growth model to predict the observed profile of SnO2 nanowires at different locations on silicon substrates. The model is based on gas transportation over the nanosized catalyst droplets, leading to a gradual reduction in both the length and density of the grown wires. This theoretical model is applied to a randomly patterned distribution of gold catalysts, and the results are consistent with the experimental findings. Since gold is used as the growth catalyst for tin oxide nanowires, the parameters of gold droplets atop silicon nanowire and Young's angle are extracted.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab3250,997,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes

Potassium alkanoates, KCx, (potassium undecanoate, KC11, potassium dodecanoate, KC12, and potassium tridecanoate, KC13) were chosen as the surfactant molecules. The lyotropic mixtures, which were composed of KCx/potassium sulfate (K2SO4)/decanol (DeOH)/water/brucine, where brucine is a chiral dopant molecule, were studied. Partial phase diagrams were constructed to show how the surfactant alkyl chain affects the phase topologies in the phase diagrams. It was observed that the presence of a longer surfactant alkyl chain in the mixture favors the stabilization of the larger discotic cholesteric, Ch(D), and cholesteric biaxial, Ch(B), phase domains.
