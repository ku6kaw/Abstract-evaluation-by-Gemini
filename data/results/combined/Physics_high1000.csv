J,"Geim, AK; Novoselov, KS",The rise of graphene,"Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.",10.1038/nmat1849,1,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no
J,"Grimme, S; Antony, J; Ehrlich, S; Krieg, H",A consistent and accurate ab initio parametrization of density functional dispersion correction (DFT-D) for the 94 elements H-Pu,"The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C-6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.",10.1063/1.3382344,2,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Hasan, MZ; Kane, CL",Colloquium: Topological insulators,"Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe/CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1-xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.",10.1103/RevModPhys.82.3045,5,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,

The nature of the G and D vibration modes in graphite is analyzed in terms of the resonant excitation of pi states and the long-range polarizability of pi bonding. Visible Raman data on disordered, amorphous, and diamond like carbon are classified in a three-stage model to show the factors that control the position, intensity, and widths of the G and D peaks. It is shown that the visible Raman spectra depend formally on the configuration of the sp(2) sites in sp(2)-bonded clusters. In cases where the sp(2) clustering is controlled by the sp(3) fraction, such as in as-deposited tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) or hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films, the visible Raman parameters can be used to derive the sp(3) fraction.",10.1103/PhysRevB.61.14095,9,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes

By means of high-resolution resonant impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy, we identify vibrational wavepacket dynamics that evolve along different configurational coordinates for distinct excitons and photocarriers. Employing density functional theory calculations, we assign the observed coherent vibrational modes to various low-frequency (less than or similar to 50 cm(-1)) optical phonons involving motion in the lead iodide layers.

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.",10.1103/PhysRevE.69.026113,28,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

The Amber ff99SB force field improved protein secondary structure balance and dynamics from earlier force fields like ff99, but weaknesses in side chain rotamer and backbone secondary structure preferences have been identified. Here, we performed a complete refit of all amino acid side chain dihedral parameters, which had been carried over from ff94. The training set of conformations included multidimensional dihedral scans designed to improve transferability of the parameters. Improvement in all amino acids was obtained as compared to ff99SB. Parameters wer also generated for alternate protonation states of ionizable side chains. Average errors in relative energies of pairs of conformations were under 1.0 kcal/mol as compared to QM, reduced 35% from ff99SB. We also took the opportunity to make empirical adjustments to the protein backbone dihedral parameters as compared to ff99SB. Multiple small adjustments of phi and psi parameters were tested against NMR scalar coupling data and secondary structure content for short peptides. The best results were obtained from a physically motivated adjustment to the phi rotational profile that compensates for lack of ff99SB QM training data in the beta-ppII transition region. Together, these backbone and side chain modifications (hereafter called ff14SB) not only better reproduced their benchmarks, but also improved secondary structure content in small peptides and reproduction of NMR chi 1 scalar coupling measurements for proteins in solution. We also discuss the Amber ff12SB parameter set, a preliminary version of ff14SB that includes most of its improvements.",10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00255,30,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Schedin, F; Geim, AK; Morozov, SV; Hill, EW; Blake, P; Katsnelson, MI; Novoselov, KS",Detection of individual gas molecules adsorbed on graphene,"The ultimate aim of any detection method is to achieve such a level of sensitivity that individual quanta of a measured entity can be resolved. In the case of chemical sensors, the quantum is one atom or molecule. Such resolution has so far been beyond the reach of any detection technique, including solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity(1-4). The fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due to thermal motion of charges and defects(5), which lead to intrinsic noise exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many orders of magnitude. Here, we show that micrometre-size sensors made from graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene's surface. The adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic field or mechanical strain are required.",10.1038/nmat1967,31,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Herein we demonstrate a new avenue for halide perovskites by designing highly luminescent perovskite-based colloidal quantum dot materials. We have synthesized monodisperse colloidal nanocubes (4-15 nm edge lengths) of fully inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I or mixed halide systems Cl/Br and Br/I) using inexpensive commercial precursors. Through compositional modulations and quantum size-effects, the bandgap energies and emission spectra are readily tunable over the entire visible spectral region of 410-700 nm. The photoluminescence of CsPbX3 nanocrystals is characterized by narrow emission line-widths of 12-42 nm, wide color gamut covering up to 140% of the NTSC color standard, high quantum yields of up to 90%, and radiative lifetimes in the range of 1-29 ns. The compelling combination of enhanced optical properties and chemical robustness makes CsPbX3 nanocrystals appealing for optoelectronic applications, particularly for blue and green spectral regions (410-530 nm), where typical metal chalcogenide-based quantum dots suffer from photodegradation.",10.1021/nl5048779,32,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb(-1) collected at, root s = 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb(-1) at root s = 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H -> ZZ(()*()) -> 4l, H -> gamma gamma and H -> WW (()*()) -> ev mu v in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H -> ZZ(()*()), WW(*()), b (b) over bar and tau(+)tau(-) in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H -> ZZ(()*()) -> 4l and H -> gamma gamma channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0 +/- 0.4 (stat) +/- 0.4 (sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7 x 10(-9), is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.

J,"Yanai, T; Tew, DP; Handy, NC",A new hybrid exchange-correlation functional using the Coulomb-attenuating method (CAM-B3LYP),"A new hybrid exchange-correlation functional named CAM-B3LYP is proposed. It combines the hybrid qualities of B3LYP and the long-range correction presented by Tawada et al. [J. Chem. Phys., in press]. We demonstrate that CAM-B3LYP yields atomization energies of similar quality to those from B3LYP, while also performing well for charge transfer excitations in a dipeptide model, which B3LYP underestimates enormously. The CAM-B3LYP functional comprises of 0.19 Hartree-Fock (HF) plus 0.81 Becke 1988 (1388) exchange interaction at short-range, and 0.65 HF plus 0.35 B88 at long-range. The intermediate region is smoothly described through the standard error function with parameter 0.33. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Suspension similar to 150 nin above a Si/SiO2 gate electrode and electrical contacts to the graphene was achieved by a combination of electron beam lithography and etching. The specimens were cleaned in situ by employing current-induced heating, directly resulting in a significant improvement of electrical transport. Concomitant with large mobility enhancement, the widths of the characteristic Dirac peaks are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to traditional, nonsuspended devices. This advance should allow for accessing the intrinsic transport properties of graphene. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Tang, W; Sanville, E; Henkelman, G",A grid-based Bader analysis algorithm without lattice bias,"A computational method for partitioning a charge density grid into Bader volumes is presented which is efficient, robust, and scales linearly with the number of grid points. The partitioning algorithm follows the steepest ascent paths along the charge density gradient from grid point to grid point until a charge density maximum is reached. In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice ascent paths can be represented with respect to the grid points. This improvement maintains the efficient linear scaling of an earlier version of the algorithm, and eliminates a tendency for the Bader surfaces to be aligned along the grid directions. As the algorithm assigns grid points to charge density maxima, subsequent paths are terminated when they reach previously assigned grid points. It is this grid-based approach which gives the algorithm its efficiency, and allows for the analysis of the large grids generated from plane-wave-based density functional theory calculations.",10.1088/0953-8984/21/8/084204,37,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Kane, CL; Mele, EJ",Quantum spin Hall effect in graphene,"We study the effects of spin orbit interactions on the low energy electronic structure of a single plane of graphene. We find that in an experimentally accessible low temperature regime the symmetry allowed spin orbit potential converts graphene from an ideal two-dimensional semimetallic state to a quantum spin Hall insulator. This novel electronic state of matter is gapped in the bulk and supports the transport of spin and charge in gapless edge states that propagate at the sample boundaries. The edge states are nonchiral, but they are insensitive to disorder because their directionality is correlated with spin. The spin and charge conductances in these edge states are calculated and the effects of temperature, chemical potential, Rashba coupling, disorder, and symmetry breaking fields are discussed.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.226801,38,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Biesinger, MC; Payne, BP; Grosvenor, AP; Lau, LWM; Gerson, AR; Smart, RS","Resolving surface chemical states in XPS analysis of first row transition metals, oxides and hydroxides: Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni","Chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of first row transition metals and their oxides and hydroxides is challenging due to the complexity of their 2p spectra resulting from peak asymmetries, complex multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structure, and uncertain, overlapping binding energies. Our previous paper [M. C. Biesinger et al., Appl. Surf. Sci. 257 (2010) 887-898.] in which we examined Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn species, has shown that all the values of the spectral fitting parameters for each specific species, i.e. binding energy (eV), full wide at half maximum (FWHM) value (eV) for each pass energy, spin-orbit splitting values and asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, are not all normally provided in the literature and data bases, and are necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis. A more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve fitting was developed based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of literature references and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. This paper extends this approach to the chemical states of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni metals, and various oxides and hydroxides where intense, complex multiplet splitting in many of the chemical states of these elements poses unique difficulties for chemical state analysis. The curve fitting procedures proposed use the same criteria as proposed previously but with the additional complexity of fitting of multiplet split spectra which has been done based on spectra of numerous reference materials and theoretical XPS modeling of these transition metal species. Binding energies, FWHM values, asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, multiplet peak separation and peak area percentages are presented. The procedures developed can be utilized to remove uncertainties in the analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

J,"Vydrov, OA; Scuseria, GE",Assessment of a long-range corrected hybrid functional,"Common approximate exchange-correlation functionals suffer from self-interaction error, and as a result, their corresponding potentials have incorrect asymptotic behavior. The exact asymptote can be imposed by introducing range separation into the exchange component and replacing the long-range portion of the approximate exchange by the Hartree-Fock counterpart. The authors show that this long-range correction works particularly well in combination with the short-range variant of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange functional. This long-range-corrected hybrid, here denoted LC-omega PBE, is remarkably accurate for a broad range of molecular properties, such as thermochemistry, barrier heights of chemical reactions, bond lengths, and most notably, description of processes involving long-range charge transfer.

The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0 x 10(-21). It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 sigma. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410(-180)(+160) Mpc corresponding to a redshift z = 0.09(-0.01)(+0.03). In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36(-4)(+5)M(circle dot) and 29(-4)(+4)M(circle dot), and the final black hole mass is 62(-4)(+4) M-circle dot, with 3.0(-0.5)(+0.5) M(circle dot)c(2) radiated in gravitational waves.

The conductive mesoporous carbon framework precisely constrains sulphur nanofiller growth within its channels and generates essential electrical contact to the insulating sulphur. The structure provides access to Li+ ingress/egress for reactivity with the sulphur, and we speculate that the kinetic inhibition to diffusion within the framework and the sorption properties of the carbon aid in trapping the polysulphides formed during redox. Polymer modification of the carbon surface further provides a chemical gradient that retards diffusion of these large anions out of the electrode, thus facilitating more complete reaction. Reversible capacities up to 1,320m Ah g(-1) are attained.

The study of such states was originally inspired by the robustness to scattering of conducting edge states in quantum Hall systems. Recently, such analogies have resulted in the discovery of topologically protected states in two-dimensional and three-dimensional band insulators with large spin-orbit coupling. So far, the only known three-dimensional topological insulator is BixSb1-x, which is an alloy with complex surface states. Here, we present the results of first-principles electronic structure calculations of the layered, stoichiometric crystals Sb2Te3, Sb2Se3, Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3.

These topological insulators have robust and simple surface states consisting of a single Dirac cone at the Gamma point.

We show that the effective atomic C-6 coefficients depend strongly on the bonding environment of an atom in a molecule. Finally, we analyze the van der Waals radii and the damping function in the C6R-6 correction method for density-functional theory calculations.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.073005,62,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

Chem. Phys. 124, 221101 (2006)] is tested on solids for the calculation of band gaps. The agreement with experiment is very good for all types of solids we considered (e.g., wide band gap insulators, sp semiconductors, and strongly correlated 3d transition-metal oxides) and is of the same order as the agreement obtained with the hybrid functionals or the GW methods. This semilocal exchange potential, which recovers the local-density approximation (LDA) for a constant electron density, mimics very well the behavior of orbital-dependent potentials and leads to calculations which are barely more expensive than LDA calculations. Therefore, it can be applied to very large systems in an efficient way.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.226401,63,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

MXenes are produced by selective etching of the A element from the MAX phases, which are metallically conductive, layered solids connected by strong metallic, ionic, and covalent bonds, such as Ti2AlC, Ti3AlC2, and Ta4AlC3. MXenes combine the metallic conductivity of transition metal carbides with the hydrophilic nature of their hydroxyl or oxygen terminated surfaces. In essence, they behave as conductive clays. This article reviews progressboth experimental and theoreticalon their synthesis, structure, properties, intercalation, delamination, and potential applications. MXenes are expected to be good candidates for a host of applications. They have already shown promising performance in electrochemical energy storage systems. A detailed outlook for future research on MXenes is also presented.",10.1002/adma.201304138,66,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no
J,"Fan, FR; Tian, ZQ; Wang, ZL",Flexible triboelectric generator!,"Charges induced in triboelectric process are usually referred as a negative effect either in scientific research or technological applications, and they are wasted energy in many cases. Here, we demonstrate a simple, low cost and effective approach of using the charging process in friction to convert mechanical energy into electric power for driving small electronics. The triboelectric generator (TEG) is fabricated by stacking two polymer sheets made of materials having distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with metal films deposited on the top and bottom of the assembled structure. Once subjected to mechanical deformation, a friction between the two films, owing to the nano-scale surface roughness, generates equal amount but opposite signs of charges at two sides. Thus, a triboelectric potential layer is formed at the interface region, which serves as a charge ""pump"" for driving the flow of electrons in the external toad if there is a variation in the capacitance of the system. Such a flexible polymer TEG gives an output voltage of up to 3.3 V at a power density of similar to 10.4 mW/cm(3). TEGs have the potential of harvesting energy from human activities, rotating tires, ocean waves, mechanical vibration and more, with great applications in self-powered systems for personal electronics, environmental monitoring, medical science and even large-scale power.

J,"van Duin, ACT; Dasgupta, S; Lorant, F; Goddard, WA",ReaxFF: A reactive force field for hydrocarbons,"To make practical the molecular dynamics simulation of large scale reactive chemical systems (1000s of atoms), we developed ReaxFF, a force field for reactive systems. ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as R-ij --> 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.",10.1021/jp004368u,69,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Zweizig, J",GW170817: Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Neutron Star Inspiral,"On August 17, 2017 at 12:41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per 8.0 x 10(4) years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 M-circle dot, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17-1.60 M-circle dot, with the total mass of the system 2.74(-0.01)(+0.04) M-circle dot. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg(2) (90% probability) and had a luminosity distance of 40(-14)(+8) Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation, and cosmology.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101,73,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

This differs from the results of simple tight-binding calculations or solutions of the Dirac's equation based on them. Our ab initio calculations show that the origin of energy gaps for GNRs with armchair shaped edges arises from both quantum confinement and the crucial effect of the edges. For GNRs with zigzag shaped edges, gaps appear because of a staggered sublattice potential on the hexagonal lattice due to edge magnetization. The rich gap structure for ribbons with armchair shaped edges is further obtained analytically including edge effects.

The GPW method allows for accurate density functional calculations in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional, namely ionic forces and the Kohn-Sham matrix, can be computed in a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy and the Kohn-Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size, even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases. Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent. Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation methods. Energy conserving Born-Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed, and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation of the density matrix.

We also define the structural characteristics necessary for this process, termed intercalation pseudocapacitance, which are a crystalline network that offers two-dimensional transport pathways and little structural change on intercalation. The principal benefit realized from intercalation pseudocapacitance is that high levels of charge storage are achieved within short periods of time because there are no limitations from solid-state diffusion.

Quantum computers with 50-100 qubits may be able to perform tasks which surpass the capabilities of today's classical digital computers, but noise in quantum gates will limit the size of quantum circuits that can be executed reliably. NISQ devices will be useful tools for exploring many-body quantum physics, and may have other useful applications, but the 100-qubit quantum computer will not change the world right away - we should regard it as a significant step toward the more powerful quantum technologies of the future.

Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance. Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process. We used CH3NH3 Pb(I1-xBrx)(3) (x = 0.1-0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material. The use of a mixed solvent of gamma-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis. These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells.",10.1038/NMAT4014,91,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

We focus on describing the topological semimetal, a three-dimensional phase of a magnetic solid, and argue that it may be realized in a class of pyrochlore iridates (such as Y(2)Ir(2)O(7)) based on calculations using the LDA + U method. This state is a three-dimensional analog of graphene with linearly dispersing excitations and provides a condensed-matter realization of Weyl fermions that obeys a two-component Dirac equation. It also exhibits remarkable topological properties manifested by surface states in the form of Fermi arcs, which are impossible to realize in purely two-dimensional band structures. For intermediate correlation strengths, we find this to be the ground state of the pyrochlore iridates, coexisting with noncollinear magnetic order. A narrow window of magnetic ""axion"" insulator may also be present.

These devices, although early in their stage of development, are promising for large-scale grid storage applications due to the abundance and very low cost of sodium-containing precursors used to make the components. The engineering knowledge developed recently for highly successful Li ion batteries can be leveraged to ensure rapid progress in this area, although different electrode materials and electrolytes will be required for dual intercalation systems based on sodium. In particular, new anode materials need to be identified, since the graphite anode, commonly used in lithium systems, does not intercalate sodium to any appreciable extent. A wider array of choices is available for cathodes, including high performance layered transition metal oxides and polyanionic compounds. Recent developments in electrodes are encouraging, but a great deal of research is necessary, particularly in new electrolytes, and the understanding of the SEI films. The engineering modeling calculations of Na-ion battery energy density indicate that 210 Wh kg1 in gravimetric energy is possible for Na-ion batteries compared to existing Li-ion technology if a cathode capacity of 200 mAh g1 and a 500 mAh g1 anode can be discovered with an average cell potential of 3.3 V.",10.1002/adfm.201200691,97,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The search is performed in five decay modes: gamma gamma, ZZ, W+W-, tau(+)tau(-), and b (b) over bar. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, gamma gamma and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3 +/- 0.4(stat.) +/- 0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one. (C) 2012 CERN. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here we review the defect-induced Raman spectra of graphitic materials from both experimental and theoretical standpoints and we present recent Raman results on nanographites and graphenes. The disorder-induced D and D' Raman features, as well as the G'-band (the overtone of the D-band which is always observed in defect-free samples), are discussed in terms of the double-resonance (DR) Raman process, involving phonons within the interior of the 1st Brillouin zone of graphite and defects. In this review, experimental results for the D, D' and G' bands obtained with different laser lines, and in samples with different crystallite sizes and different types of defects are presented and discussed. We also present recent advances that made possible the development of Raman scattering as a tool for very accurate structural analysis of nano-graphite, with the establishment of an empirical formula for the in-and out-of-plane crystalline size and even fancier Raman-based information, such as for the atomic structure at graphite edges, and the identification of single versus multi-graphene layers. Once established, this knowledge provides a powerful machinery to understand newer forms of sp(2) carbon materials, such as the recently developed pitch-based graphitic foams. Results for the calculated Raman intensity of the disorder-induced D-band in graphitic materials as a function of both the excitation laser energy (E-laser) and the in-plane size (L-a) of nano-graphites are presented and compared with experimental results. The status of this research area is assessed, and opportunities for future work are identified.",10.1039/b613962k,99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This photo-induced charge transfer is reversible, ultrafast (within 100 fs) with a quantum efficiency approaching unity, and the charge-separated state is metastable (up to milliseconds at 80 K). Being similar to the first steps in natural photosynthesis, this photo-induced electron transfer leads To a number of potentially interesting applications, which include sensitization of the photoconductivity and photovoltaic phenomena.

J,"Kitaev, A",Anyons in an exactly solved model and beyond,"A spin-1/2 system on a honeycomb lattice is studied. The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, YY or ZZ type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static Z(2) gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number nu. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to nu = 0 and nu = L respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on nu mod 16, whereas nu itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] is a promising approach for including dispersion in approximate density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals. Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature. However, despite many applications, standard general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional ""hard"" matter such asmetals, ionic compounds, and insulators are lacking. Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and molecules on the surfaces of solids. Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring. We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers. However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs. Although the tests reported here are for hard solids, not normally materials for which dispersion forces are thought to be important, we find a systematic improvement in cohesive properties for the alkali metals and alkali halides when nonlocal correlations are accounted for.",10.1103/PhysRevB.83.195131,103,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

It is shown that only the Raman frequencies of E-2g(1) and A(1g) peaks vary monotonously with the layer number of ultrathin MoS2 flakes, while intensities or widths of the peaks vary arbitrarily. The coupling between electronic transitions and phonons are found to become weaker when the layer number of MoS2 decreases, attributed to the increased electronic transition energies or elongated intralayer atomic bonds in ultrathin MoS2. The asymmetric Raman peak at 454 cm-1, which has been regarded as the overtone of longitudinal optical M phonons in bulk MoS2, is actually a combinational band involving a longitudinal acoustic mode (LA(M)) and an optical mode (A(2u)).

J,"Biesinger, MC; Lau, LWM; Gerson, AR; Smart, RSC","Resolving surface chemical states in XPS analysis of first row transition metals, oxides and hydroxides: Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn","Chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of first row transition metals and their oxides and hydroxides is challenging due to the complexity of the 2p spectra resulting from peak asymmetries, complex multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structure, and uncertain, overlapping binding energies. A review of current literature shows that all values necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis are usually not provided. This paper reports a more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve-fitting the various chemical states in a variety of Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn metals, oxides and hydroxides. The curve-fitting procedures proposed are based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of the literature references, and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. Binding energies, full-width at half maximum (FWHM) values, spin-orbit splitting values, asymmetric peak-shape fitting parameters, and, for Cu and Zn, Auger parameters values are presented. The quantification procedure for Cu species details the use of the shake-up satellites for Cu(II)-containing compounds and the exact binding energies of the Cu(0) and Cu(I) peaks. The use of the modified Auger parameter for Cu and Zn species allows for corroborating evidence when there is uncertainty in the binding energy assignment. These procedures can remove uncertainties in analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A series of graphene-based composites(4-6) and macroscopic structures(7-11) have been recently fabricated using chemically derived graphene sheets. However, these composites and structures suffer from poor electrical conductivity because of the low quality and/or high inter-sheet junction contact resistance of the chemically derived graphene sheets.

J,"Nagaosa, N; Sinova, J; Onoda, S; MacDonald, AH; Ong, NP",Anomalous Hall effect,"The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in solids with broken time-reversal symmetry, typically in a ferromagnetic phase, as a consequence of spin-orbit coupling. Experimental and theoretical studies of the AHE are reviewed, focusing on recent developments that have provided a more complete framework for understanding this subtle phenomenon and have, in many instances, replaced controversy by clarity. Synergy between experimental and theoretical works, both playing a crucial role, has been at the heart of these advances. On the theoretical front, the adoption of the Berry-phase concepts has established a link between the AHE and the topological nature of the Hall currents. On the experimental front, new experimental studies of the AHE in transition metals, transition-metal oxides, spinels, pyrochlores, and metallic dilute magnetic semiconductors have established systematic trends. These two developments, in concert with first-principles electronic structure calculations, strongly favor the dominance of an intrinsic Berry-phase-related AHE mechanism in metallic ferromagnets with moderate conductivity. The intrinsic AHE can be expressed in terms of the Berry-phase curvatures and it is therefore an intrinsic quantum-mechanical property of a perfect crystal. An extrinsic mechanism, skew scattering from disorder, tends to dominate the AHE in highly conductive ferromagnets. The full modern semiclassical treatment of the AHE is reviewed which incorporates an anomalous contribution to wave-packet group velocity due to momentum-space Berry curvatures and correctly combines the roles of intrinsic and extrinsic (skew-scattering and side-jump) scattering-related mechanisms. In addition, more rigorous quantum-mechanical treatments based on the Kubo and Keldysh formalisms are reviewed, taking into account multiband effects, and demonstrate the equivalence of all three linear response theories in the metallic regime. Building on results from recent experiment and theory, a tentative global view of the AHE is proposed which summarizes the roles played by intrinsic and extrinsic contributions in the disorder strength versus temperature plane.

The common (non-Gly, -Pro) backbone CMAP potential has been refined against experimental solution NMR data for weakly structured peptides, resulting in a rebalancing of the energies of the alpha-helix and extended regions of the Ramachandran map, correcting the alpha-helical bias of CHARMM22/CMAP. The Gly and Pro CMAPs have been refitted to more accurate quantum-mechanical energy surfaces. Side-chain torsion parameters have been optimized by fitting to backbone-dependent quantum-mechanical energy surfaces, followed by additional empirical optimization targeting NMR scalar couplings for unfolded proteins.

This distinction is characterized by Z(2) topological invariants, which characterize the ground state. In two dimensions, there is a single Z(2) invariant that distinguishes the ordinary insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase. In three dimensions, there are four Z(2) invariants that distinguish the ordinary insulator from ""weak"" and ""strong"" topological insulators. These phases are characterized by the presence of gapless surface (or edge) states. In the two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall phase and the three-dimensional strong topological insulator, these states are robust and are insensitive to weak disorder and interactions. In this paper, we show that the presence of inversion symmetry greatly simplifies the problem of evaluating the Z(2) invariants. We show that the invariants can be determined from the knowledge of the parity of the occupied Bloch wave functions at the time-reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone. Using this approach, we predict a number of specific materials that are strong topological insulators, including the semiconducting alloy Bi1-xSbx as well as alpha-Sn and HgTe under uniaxial strain.

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: ACTU_v3_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 852 Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to. study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models.

J,"Mostofi, AA; Yates, JR; Lee, YS; Souza, I; Vanderbilt, D; Marzari, N",wannier90: A tool for obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions,"We present wannier90, a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWF) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWF in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWF can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 is able to output MLWF for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modem theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. wannier90 is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Solution method: In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space.

Little is known quantitatively about this balance as early scaffolds were not fabricated with precise porous architecture. Recent advances in both computational topology design ( CTD) and solid free- form fabrication ( SFF) have made it possible to create scaffolds with controlled architecture. This paper reviews the integration of CTD with SFF to build designer tissue- engineering scaffolds.

An extensive analysis of both basis set and relativistic effects is given. Results are compared with established pure density functionals. For lattice constants, HSE outperforms local spin-density approximation (LSDA) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.037 A for HSE vs 0.047 A for LSDA. For this specific test set, all pure functionals tested produce MAEs for band gaps of 1.0-1.3 eV, consistent with the very well-known fact that pure functionals severely underestimate this property. On the other hand, HSE yields a MAE smaller than 0.3 eV. Importantly, HSE correctly predicts semiconducting behavior in systems where pure functionals erroneously predict a metal, such as, for instance, Ge. The short-range nature of the exchange integrals involved in HSE calculations makes their computation notably faster than regular hybrid functionals. The current results, paired with earlier work, suggest that HSE is a fast and accurate alternative to established density functionals, especially for solid state calculations.

The screened HF exchange decay properties and screening efficiency are compared with traditional hybrid functional calculations on solids. The HSE functional is then assessed using 21 metallic, semiconducting, and insulating solids. The examined properties include lattice constants, bulk moduli, and band gaps. The results obtained with HSE exhibit significantly smaller errors than pure density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For structural properties, the errors produced by HSE are up to 50% smaller than the errors of the local density approximation, PBE, and TPSS functionals used for comparison. When predicting band gaps of semiconductors, we found smaller errors with HSE, resulting in a mean absolute error of 0.2 eV (1.3 eV error, for all pure DFT functionals). In addition, we present timing results which show the computational time requirements of HSE to be only a factor of 2-4 higher than pure DFT functionals. These results make HSE an attractive choice for calculations of all types of solids.

It targets a wide range of chemical environments, including the gas phase, interfaces, and the condensed phase. These generally contracted basis sets, which include diffuse primitives, are obtained minimizing a linear combination of the total energy and the condition number of the overlap matrix for a set of molecules with respect to the exponents and contraction coefficients of the full basis. Typically, for a given accuracy in the total energy, significantly fewer basis functions are needed in this scheme than in the usual split valence scheme, leading to a speedup for systems where the computational cost is dominated by diagonalization. More importantly, binding energies of hydrogen bonded complexes are of similar quality as the ones obtained with augmented basis sets, i.e., have a small (down to 0.2 kcal/mol) basis set superposition error, and the monomers have dipoles within 0.1 D of the basis set limit. However, contrary to typical augmented basis sets, there are no near linear dependencies in the basis, so that the overlap matrix is always well conditioned, also, in the condensed phase. The basis can therefore be used in first principles molecular dynamics simulations and is well suited for linear scaling calculations.

Describing these noncovalent interactions accurately, including their positions in real space, constitutes a first step in the process of decoupling the complex balance of forces that define noncovalent interactions. Because of the size of macromolecules, the most common approach has been to assign van der Waals interactions (vdW), steric dashes (SC), and hydrogen bonds (HBs) based on pairwise distances between atoms according to their vdW radii. We recently developed an alternative perspective, derived from the electronic density: the non-covalent interactions (NCI) index [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 6498]. This index has the dual advantages of being generally transferable to diverse chemical applications and being very fast to compute, since it can be calculated from promolecular densities. Thus, NCI analysis is applicable to large systems, including proteins and DNA, where analysis of noncovalent interactions is of great potential value. Here, we describe the NCI computational algorithms and their implementation for the analysis and visualization of weak interactions, using both self-consistent fully quantum-mechanical as well as promolecular densities.

This result leads us to a number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in networks and a centrality measure that identifies vertices that occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong.

Using primary hepatocytes as a liver model, we found that CdSe-core QDs were indeed acutely toxic under certain conditions. Specifically, we found that the cytotoxicity of QDs was modulated by processing parameters during synthesis, exposure to ultraviolet light, and surface coatings. Our data further suggest that cytotoxicity correlates with the liberation of free Cd2+ ions due to deterioration of the CdSe lattice. When appropriately coated, CdSe-core QDs can be rendered nontoxic and used to track cell migration and reorganization in vitro.

Remarking that most observations are consistent with models right up to the w = -1 or cosmological constant (A) limit, it is natural to ask what lies on the other side, at w less than or equal to 1. In this regard, we construct a toy model of a ""phantom"" energy component which possesses an equation of state w < -1. Such a component is found to be compatible with most classical tests of cosmology based on current data, including the recent type 1a SNe data as well as the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum.

The states are localized or extended, homogeneous or oscillating. Combined states are observed as well, like the coexistence of moving localized clusters and clusters pinned at road inhomogeneities, or regions of oscillating congested traffic upstream of nearly homogeneous congested traffic. The experimental findings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traffic near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a continuous microscopic single-lane model, the ""intelligent driver model,"" using empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way.

J,"Grimme, S",Semiempirical hybrid density functional with perturbative second-order correlation,"A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (a(x)) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G2/97 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum a(x) is found to be quite large (53% with c=27%) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G2/97 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5 kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minium errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10-20 kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.",10.1063/1.2148954,201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Ritchie, RO",The conflicts between strength and toughness,"The attainment of both strength and toughness is a vital requirement for most structural materials; unfortunately these properties are generally mutually exclusive. Although the quest continues for stronger and harder materials, these have little to no use as bulk structural materials without appropriate fracture resistance. It is the lower-strength, and hence higher-toughness, materials that find use for most safety-critical applications where premature or, worse still, catastrophic fracture is unacceptable. For these reasons, the development of strong and tough (damage-tolerant) materials has traditionally been an exercise in compromise between hardness versus ductility. Drawing examples from metallic glasses, natural and biological materials, and structural and biomimetic ceramics, we examine some of the newer strategies in dealing with this conflict. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between the mechanisms that individually contribute to strength and toughness, noting that these phenomena can originate from very different lengthscales in a material's structural architecture. We show how these new and natural materials can defeat the conflict of strength versus toughness and achieve unprecedented levels of damage tolerance within their respective material classes.",10.1038/NMAT3115,215,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes
J,"Lam, DCC; Yang, F; Chong, ACM; Wang, J; Tong, P",Experiments and theory in strain gradient elasticity,"Conventional strain-based mechanics theory does not account for contributions from strain gradients. Failure to include strain gradient contributions can lead to underestimates of stresses and size-dependent behaviors in small-scale structures. In this paper, a new set of higher-order metrics is developed to characterize strain gradient behaviors. This set enables the application of the higher-order equilibrium conditions to strain gradient elasticity theory and reduces the number of independent elastic length scale parameters from five to three. On the basis of this new strain gradient theory, a strain gradient elastic bending theory for plane-strain beams is developed. Solutions for cantilever bending with a moment and line force applied at the free end are constructed based on the new higher-order bending theory. In classical bending theory, the normalized bending rigidity is independent of the length and thickness of the beam. In the solutions developed from the higher-order bending theory, the normalized higher-order bending rigidity has a new dependence on the thickness of the beam and on a higher-order bending parameter, b(h). To determine the significance of the size dependence, we fabricated micron-sized beams and conducted bending tests using a nanoindenter. We found that the normalized beam rigidity exhibited an inverse squared dependence on the beam's thickness as predicted by the strain gradient elastic bending theory, and that the higher-order bending parameter, bh, is on the micron-scale. Potential errors from the experiments, model and fabrication were estimated and determined to be small relative to the observed increase in beam's bending rigidity. The present results indicate that the elastic strain gradient effect is significant in elastic deformation of small-scale structures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J,"Schnyder, AP; Ryu, S; Furusaki, A; Ludwig, AWW",Classification of topological insulators and superconductors in three spatial dimensions,"We systematically study topological phases of insulators and superconductors (or superfluids) in three spatial dimensions. We find that there exist three-dimensional (3D) topologically nontrivial insulators or superconductors in five out of ten symmetry classes introduced in seminal work by Altland and Zirnbauer within the context of random matrix theory, more than a decade ago. One of these is the recently introduced Z(2) topological insulator in the symplectic (or spin-orbit) symmetry class. We show that there exist precisely four more topological insulators. For these systems, all of which are time-reversal invariant in three dimensions, the space of insulating ground states satisfying certain discrete symmetry properties is partitioned into topological sectors that are separated by quantum phase transitions. Three of the above five topologically nontrivial phases can be realized as time-reversal invariant superconductors. In these the different topological sectors are characterized by an integer winding number defined in momentum space. When such 3D topological insulators are terminated by a two-dimensional surface, they support a number (which may be an arbitrary nonvanishing even number for singlet pairing) of Dirac fermion (Majorana fermion when spin-rotation symmetry is completely broken) surface modes which remain gapless under arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian that preserve the characteristic discrete symmetries, including disorder. In particular, these surface modes completely evade Anderson localization from random impurities. These topological phases can be thought of as three-dimensional analogs of well-known paired topological phases in two spatial dimensions such as the spinless chiral (p(x)+/- ip(y))-wave superconductor (or Moore-Read Pfaffian state). In the corresponding topologically nontrivial (analogous to ""weak pairing"") and topologically trivial (analogous to ""strong pairing"") 3D phases, the wave functions exhibit markedly distinct behavior. When an electromagnetic U(1) gauge field and fluctuations of the gap functions are included in the dynamics, the superconducting phases with nonvanishing winding number possess nontrivial topological ground-state degeneracies.",10.1103/PhysRevB.78.195125,220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron-neutral collisions and electron-electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems.

J,"Ferrari, AC; Robertson, J","Resonant Raman spectroscopy of disordered, amorphous, and diamondlike carbon","The Raman spectra of a wide range of disordered and amorphous carbons have been measured under excitation from 785 to 229 nm. The dispersion of peak positions and intensities with excitation wavelength is used to understand the nature of resonant Raman scattering in carbon and how to derive the local bonding and disorder from the Raman spectra. The spectra show three basic features, the D and G around 1600 and 1350 cm(-1) for visible excitation and an extra T peak, for UV excitation, at similar to 1060 cm(-1). The G peak, due to the stretching motion of sp(2) pairs, is a good indicator of disorder. It shows dispersion only in amorphous networks, with a dispersion rate proportional to the degree of disorder. Its shift well above 1600 cm(-1) under UV excitation indicates the presence of sp(2) chains. The dispersion of the D peak is strongest in ordered carbons. It shows little dispersion in amorphous carbon, so that in UV excitation it becomes like a density-of-states feature of vibrations of sp(2) ringlike structures. The intensity ratio I(D)/I(G) falls with increasing UV excitation in all forms of carbon, with a faster decrease in more ordered carbons, so that it is generally small for UV excitation. The T peak, due to sp(3) vibrations, only appears in UV Raman, lying around 1060 cm(-1) for H-free carbons and around 980 cm(-1) in hydrogenated carbons. In hydrogenated carbons, the sp(3) C-H-x stretching modes around 2920 cm(-1) can be clearly detected for UV excitation.

J,"Smith, DR; Vier, DC; Koschny, T; Soukoulis, CM",Electromagnetic parameter retrieval from inhomogeneous metamaterials,"We discuss the validity of standard retrieval methods that assign bulk electromagnetic properties, such as the electric permittivity epsilon and the magnetic permeability mu, from calculations of the scattering (S) parameters for finite-thickness samples. S-parameter retrieval methods have recently become the principal means of characterizing artificially structured metamaterials, which, by nature, are inherently inhomogeneous. While the unit cell of a metamaterial can be made considerably smaller than the free space wavelength, there remains a significant variation of the phase across the unit cell at operational frequencies in nearly all metamaterial structures reported to date. In this respect, metamaterials do not rigorously satisfy an effective medium limit and are closer conceptually to photonic crystals. Nevertheless, we show here that a modification of the standard S-parameter retrieval procedure yields physically reasonable values for the retrieved electromagnetic parameters, even when there is significant inhomogeneity within the unit cell of the structure. We thus distinguish a metamaterial regime, as opposed to the effective medium or photonic crystal regimes, in which a refractive index can be rigorously established but where the wave impedance can only be approximately defined. We present numerical simulations on typical metamaterial structures to illustrate the modified retrieval algorithm and the impact on the retrieved material parameters. We find that no changes to the standard retrieval procedures are necessary when the inhomogeneous unit cell is symmetric along the propagation axis; however, when the unit cell does not possess this symmetry, a modified procedure-in which a periodic structure is assumed-is required to obtain meaningful electromagnetic material parameters.",10.1103/PhysRevE.71.036617,235,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Here, using 3d-M hydr(oxy)oxides, with distinct stoichiometries and morphologies in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) regions, we establish the overall catalytic activities for these reaction as a function of a more fundamental property, a descriptor, OH-M2+delta bond strength (0 <= delta <= 1.5). This relationship exhibits trends in reactivity (Mn < Fe < Co < Ni), which is governed by the strength of the OH-M2+delta energetic (Ni < Co < Fe < Mn). These trends are found to be independent of the source of the OH, either the supporting electrolyte (for the OER) or the water dissociation product (for the HER).

J,"Miroshnichenko, AE; Flach, S; Kivshar, YS",Fano resonances in nanoscale structures,"Modern nanotechnology allows one to scale down various important devices (sensors, chips, fibers, etc.) and thus opens up new horizons for their applications. The efficiency of most of them is based on fundamental physical phenomena, such as transport of wave excitations and resonances. Short propagation distances make phase-coherent processes of waves important. Often the scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths and, as a consequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference corresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant suppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and theoretical work has revealed such patterns in different physical settings. The purpose of this review is to relate resonant scattering to Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of the main features of the Fano resonance is its asymmetric line profile. The asymmetry originates from a close coexistence of resonant transmission and resonant reflection and can be reduced to the interaction of a discrete (localized) state with a continuum of propagation modes. The basic concepts of Fano resonances are introduced, their geometrical and/or dynamical origin are explained, and theoretical and experimental studies of light propagation in photonic devices, charge transport through quantum dots, plasmon scattering in Josephson-junction networks, and matter-wave scattering in ultracold atom systems, among others are reviewed.",10.1103/RevModPhys.82.2257,244,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

Bundled single-walled carbon nanotubes are effectively dispersed in water by their sonication in the presence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements provide evidence for individually dispersed carbon nanotubes. Molecular modelling suggests that ssDNA can bind to carbon nanotubes through pi-stacking, resulting in helical wrapping to the surface. The binding free energy of ssDNA to carbon nanotubes rivals that of two nanotubes for each other.

Here, we introduce a layered sandwich-type architecture, the core of which comprises a bicontinuous three-dimensional nanocomposite of mesoporous (mp)-TiO2, with CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3) perovskite as light harvester, as well as a polymeric hole conductor. This platform creates new opportunities for the development of low-cost, solution-processed, high-efficiency solar cells. The use of a polymeric hole conductor, especially poly-triarylamine, substantially improves the open-circuit voltage V-oc and fill factor of the cells. Solar cells based on these inorganic-organic hybrids exhibit a short-circuit current density J(sc) of 16.5 mA cm(-2), V-oc of 0.997 V and fill factor of 0.727, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 12.0% under standard AM 1.5 conditions.",10.1038/NPHOTON.2013.80,254,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Liu, WF; Ren, XB",Large Piezoelectric Effect in Pb-Free Ceramics,"We report a non-Pb piezoelectric ceramic system Ba(Ti0.8Zr0.2)O-3-(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 which shows a surprisingly high piezoelectric coefficient of d(33)similar to 620 pC/N at optimal composition. Its phase diagram shows a morphortropic phase boundary (MPB) starting from a tricritical triple point of a cubic paraelectric phase (C), ferroelectric rhombohedral (R), and tetragonal (T) phases. The high piezoelectricity of the MPB compositions stems from the composition proximity of the MPB to the tricritical triple point, which leads to a nearly vanishing polarization anisotropy and thus facilitates polarization rotation between << 001 >> T and << 111 >> R states. We predict that the single-crystal form of the MPB composition of the present system may reach a giant d(33)=1500-2000 pC/N.

Featuring an optical bandgap of 1.3 eV, the CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite material can be incorporated into devices with the organic hole-transport layer spiro-OMeTAD and show an absorption onset at 950 nm, which is significantly redshifted compared with the benchmark CH3NH3PbI3 counterpart (1.55 eV). Bandgap engineering was implemented by chemical substitution in the form of CH3NH3SnI3-xBrx solid solutions, which can be controllably tuned to cover much of the visible spectrum, thus enabling the realization of lead-free solar cells with an initial power conversion efficiency of 5.73% under simulated full sunlight. Further efficiency enhancements are expected following optimization and a better fundamental understanding of the internal electron dynamics and corresponding interfacial engineering.

The photoconduction mechanism in these devices has been elucidated by means of time-resolved measurements spanning a wide temporal domain, from 10(-9) to 10(2) s, revealing the coexistence of fast (tau similar to 20 ns) and slow (tau similar to 10 s) components of the carrier relaxation dynamics. The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the NW surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears to be effective even at the shortest time scale investigated of t < 1 ns. Despite the slow relaxation time, the extremely high internal gain of ZnO NW photodetectors results in gain-bandwidth products (GB) higher than similar to 10 GHz. The high gain and low power consumption of NW photodetectors promise a new generation of phototransistors for applications such as sensing, imaging, and intrachip optical interconnects.",10.1021/nl070111x,257,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

The use of ZnO also results in improvements to device performance for cells prepared on rigid substrates.

This architecture is attractive both as a macroscopic analog of atomic physics experiments and for quantum computing and control, since it provides strong inhibition of spontaneous emission, potentially leading to greatly enhanced qubit lifetimes, allows high-fidelity quantum nondemolition measurements of the state of multiple qubits, and has a natural mechanism for entanglement of qubits separated by centimeter distances.

J,"Costa, M; Goldberger, AL; Peng, CK",Multiscale entropy analysis of complex physiologic time series,"There has been considerable interest in quantifying the complexity of physiologic time series, such as heart rate. However, traditional algorithms indicate higher complexity for certain pathologic processes associated with random outputs than for healthy dynamics exhibiting long-range correlations. This paradox may be due to the fact that conventional algorithms fail to account for the multiple time scales inherent in healthy physiologic dynamics. We introduce a method to calculate multiscale entropy (MSE) for complex time series. We find that MSE robustly separates healthy and pathologic groups and consistently yields higher values for simulated long-range correlated noise compared to uncorrelated noise.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.068102,262,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes

During the first observing run (O1), from September 12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which ran from November 30, 2016 to August 25, 2017, saw the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral, in addition to the observation of gravitational waves from a total of seven binary black hole mergers, four of which we report here for the first time: GW170729, GW170809, GW170818, and GW170823. For all significant gravitational-wave events, we provide estimates of the source properties. The detected binary black holes have total masses between 18.6(-0.7)(+3.2) M-circle dot and 84.4(-11.1)(+15.8) M-circle dot and range in distance between 320(-110)(+120) and 2840(-1360)(+1400) Mpc. No neutron star-black hole mergers were detected. In addition to highly significant gravitational-wave events, we also provide a list of marginal event candidates with an estimated false-alarm rate less than 1 per 30 days. From these results over the first two observing runs, which include approximately one gravitational-wave detection per 15 days of data searched, we infer merger rates at the 90% confidence intervals of 110 - 3840 Gpc(-3) y(-1) for binary neutron stars and 9.7 - 101 Gpc(-3) y(-1) for binary black holes assuming fixed population distributions and determine a neutron star-black hole merger rate 90% upper limit of 610 Gpc(-3) y(-1).",10.1103/PhysRevX.9.031040,263,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to graphene, monolayer MoS2 is a non-centrosymmetric material with a direct energy gap(2,5). Strong photoluminescence(2,3) a current on/off ratio exceeding 10(8) in field-effect transistors(6), and efficient valley and spin control by optical helicity(7-9) have recently been demonstrated in this material. Here we report the spectroscopic identification in a monolayer MoS2 field-effect transistor of tightly bound negative trions, a quasiparticle composed of two electrons and a hole. These quasiparticles, which can be optically created with valley and spin polarized holes, have no analogue in conventional semiconductors. They also possess a large binding energy (similar to 20 meV), rendering them significant even at room temperature. Our results open up possibilities both for fundamental studies of many-body interactions and for optoelectronic and valleytronic applications in 2D atomic crystals.",10.1038/NMAT3505,264,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

These new particles are poised to become the `atoms' and `molecules' of tomorrow's materials if they can be successfully assembled into useful structures. Here, we discuss the recent progress made in the synthesis of nanocrystals and colloidal particles and draw analogies between these new particulate building blocks and better-studied molecules and supramolecular objects. We argue for a conceptual framework for these new building blocks based on anisotropy attributes and discuss the prognosis for future progress in exploiting anisotropy for materials design and assembly.",10.1038/nmat1949,265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signal was observed with a three-detector network matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 18. The inferred masses of the initial black holes are 30.5(-3.0)(+5.7)M(circle dot) and 25.3(-4.2)(+2.8) M-circle dot (at the 90% credible level). The luminosity distance of the source is 540(-210)(+130) Mpc, corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.11(-0.04)(+0.03). A network of three detectors improves the sky localization of the source, reducing the area of the 90% credible region from 1160 deg(2) using only the two LIGO detectors to 60 deg(2) using all three detectors.

Hydrogen-treated rutile TiO2 (H:TiO2) nanowires were prepared by annealing the pristine TiO2 nanowires in hydrogen atmosphere at various temperatures in a range of 200-550 degrees C. In comparison to pristine TiO2 nanowires, H:TiO2 samples show substantially enhanced photocurrent in the entire potential window. More importantly, H:TiO2 samples have exceptionally low photocurrent saturation potentials of -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs RHE), indicating very efficient charge separation and transportation. The optimized H:TiO2 nanowire sample yields a photocurrent density of similar to 1.97 mA/cm(2) at -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, in 1 M NaOH solution under the illumination of simulated solar light (100 mW/cm(2) from 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter). This photocurrent density corresponds to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of similar to 1.63%. After eliminating the discrepancy between the irradiance of the xenon lamp and solar light, by integrating the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the H:TiO2 nanowire sample with a standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum, the STH efficiency is calculated to be similar to 1.1%, which is the best value for a TiO2 photoanode. IPCE analyses confirm the photocurrent enhancement is mainly due to the improved photoactivity of TiO2 in the UV region. Hydrogen treatment increases the donor density of TiO2 nanowires by 3 orders of magnitudes, via creating a high density of oxygen vacancies that serve as electron donors. Similar enhancements in photocurrent were also observed in anatase H:TiO2 nanotubes. The capability of making highly photoactive H:TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes opens up new opportunities in various areas, including PEC water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.",10.1021/nl201766h,270,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

In contrast to conventional estimators based on binnings, they are based on entropy estimates from k-nearest neighbor distances. This means that they are data efficient (with k=1 we resolve structures down to the smallest possible scales), adaptive (the resolution is higher where data are more numerous), and have minimal bias. Indeed, the bias of the underlying entropy estimates is mainly due to nonuniformity of the density at the smallest resolved scale, giving typically systematic errors which scale as functions of k/N for N points. Numerically, we find that both families become exact for independent distributions, i.e. the estimator (M) over cap (X,Y) vanishes (up to statistical fluctuations) if mu(x,y)=mu(x)mu(y). This holds for all tested marginal distributions and for all dimensions of x and y. In addition, we give estimators for redundancies between more than two random variables.

In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a predefined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far.,10.1103/PhysRevE.76.036106,286,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

This unique electrolyte not only enables dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping at nearly 100% CE, but also retains water in the open atmosphere, which makes hermetic cell configurations optional.

The highest efficiencies have been achieved using blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a fullerene derivative(8-12), but performance depends critically on the material properties and processing conditions. This variability is believed to be influenced by the self-organizing properties of P3HT, which means that both optical(13,14) and electronic(15,16) properties are sensitive to the molecular packing. However, the relationship between molecular nanostructure, optoelectronic properties of the blend material and device performance has not yet been demonstrated. Here we focus on the influence of polymer regioregularity (RR) on the molecular nanostructure, and hence on the resulting material properties and device performance.

It has the potential for technological applications as a successor of silicon in the post Moore's law era(5-7), as a single-molecule gas sensor(8), in spintronics(9-11), in quantum computing(12) or as a terahertz oscillator(13). For such applications, uniform ordered growth of graphene on an insulating substrate is necessary. The growth of graphene on insulating silicon carbide (SiC) surfaces by high-temperature annealing in vacuum was previously proposed to open a route for large-scale production of graphene-based devices(5,6). However, vacuum decomposition of SiC yields graphene layers with small grains (30-200 nm; refs 14-16). Here, we show that the ex situ graphitization of Si-terminated SiC(0001) in an argon atmosphere of about 1 bar produces monolayer graphene films with much larger domain sizes than previously attainable.

J,"Sinova, J; Valenzuela, SO; Wunderlich, J; Back, CH; Jungwirth, T",Spin Hall effects,"Spin Hall effects are a collection of relativistic spin-orbit coupling phenomena in which electrical currents can generate transverse spin currents and vice versa. Despite being observed only a decade ago, these effects are already ubiquitous within spintronics, as standard spin-current generators and detectors. Here the theoretical and experimental results that have established this subfield of spintronics are reviewed. The focus is on the results that have converged to give us the current understanding of the phenomena, which has evolved from a qualitative to a more quantitative measurement of spin currents and their associated spin accumulation. Within the experimental framework, optical-, transport-, and magnetization-dynamics-based measurements are reviewed and linked to both phenomenological and microscopic theories of the effect. Within the theoretical framework, the basic mechanisms in both the extrinsic and intrinsic regimes are reviewed, which are linked to the mechanisms present in their closely related phenomenon in ferromagnets, the anomalous Hall effect. Also reviewed is the connection to the phenomenological treatment based on spin-diffusion equations applicable to certain regimes, as well as the spin-pumping theory of spin generation used in many measurements of the spin Hall angle. A further connection to the spin-current-generating spin Hall effect to the inverse spin galvanic effect is given, in which an electrical current induces a nonequilibrium spin polarization. This effect often accompanies the spin Hall effect since they share common microscopic origins. Both can exhibit the same symmetries when present in structures comprising ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers through their induced current-driven spin torques or induced voltages. Although a short chronological overview of the evolution of the spin Hall effect field and the resolution of some early controversies is given, the main body of this review is structured from a pedagogical point of view, focusing on well-established and accepted physics.

After the jet flowed away from the droplet in a nearly straight line, it bent into a complex path and other changes in shape occurred, during which electrical forces stretched and thinned it by very large ratios. After the solvent evaporated, birefringent nanofibers were left. In this article the reasons for the instability are analyzed and explained using a mathematical model. The rheological complexity of the polymer solution is included, which allows consideration of viscoelastic jets. It is shown that the longitudinal stress caused by the external electric field acting on the charge carried by the jet stabilized the straight jet for some distance. Then a lateral perturbation grew in response to the repulsive forces between adjacent elements of charge carried by the jet. The motion of segments of the jet grew rapidly into an electrically driven bending instability. The three-dimensional paths of continuous jets were calculated, both in the nearly straight region where the instability grew slowly and in the region where the bending dominated the path of the jet. The mathematical model provides a reasonable representation of the experimental data, particularly of the jet paths determined from high speed videographic observations.

J,"Neese, F; Wennmohs, F; Hansen, A; Becker, U","Efficient, approximate and parallel Hartree-Fock and hybrid DFT calculations. A 'chain-of-spheres' algorithm for the Hartree-Fock exchange","In this paper, the possibility is explored to speed up Hartree-Fock and hybrid density functional calculations by forming the Coulomb and exchange parts of the Fock matrix by different approximations. For the Coulomb part the previously introduced Split-RI-J variant (F. Neese, J. Comput. Chem. 24 (2003) 1740) of the well-known 'density fitting' approximation is used. The exchange part is formed by semi-numerical integration techniques that are closely related to Friesner's pioneering pseudo-spectral approach. Our potentially linear scaling realization of this algorithm is called the 'chain-of-spheres exchange' (COSX). A combination of semi-numerical integration and density fitting is also proposed. Both Split-RI-J and COSX scale very well with the highest angular momentum in the basis sets. It is shown that for extended basis sets speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional implementations can be obtained in this way. Total energies are reproduced with an average error of <0.3 kcal/mol as determined from extended test calculations with various basis sets on a set of 26 molecules with 20-200 atoms and up to 2000 basis functions. Reaction energies agree to within 0.2 kcal/mol (Hartree-Fock) or 0.05 kcal/mol (hybrid DFT) with the canonical values. The COSX algorithm parallelizes with a speedup of 8.6 observed for 10 processes. Minimum energy geometries differ by less than 0.3 pm in the bond distances and 0.5 degrees in the bond angels from their canonical values. These developments enable highly efficient and accurate self-consistent field calculations including nonlocal Hartree-Fock exchange for large molecules. In combination with the RI-MP2 method and large basis sets, second-order many body perturbation energies can be obtained for medium sized molecules with unprecedented efficiency.

PSO technique is different with the genetic algorithm and has apparently avoided the use of evolution operators (e.g., crossover and mutation). The approach is based on an efficient global minimization of free-energy surfaces merging total-energy calculations via PSO technique and requires only chemical compositions for a given compound to predict stable or metastable structures at given external conditions (e.g., pressure). A particularly devised geometrical structure parameter which allows the elimination of similar structures during structure evolution was implemented to enhance the structure search efficiency. The application of designed variable unit-cell size technique has greatly reduced the computational cost. Moreover, the symmetry constraint imposed in the structure generation enables the realization of diverse structures, leads to significantly reduced search space and optimization variables, and thus fastens the global structure convergence.

It is based on a full iterative solution to the Boltzmann transport equation. Its main inputs are sets of second- and third-order interatomic force constants, which can be calculated using third-party ab-initio packages. Dirac delta distributions arising from conservation of energy are approximated by Gaussian functions. A locally adaptive algorithm is used to determine each process-specific broadening parameter, which renders the method fully parameter free. The code is free software, written in Fortran and parallelized using MPI. A complementary Python script to help compute third-order interatomic force constants from a minimum number of ab-initio calculations, using a real-space finite-difference approach, is also publicly available for download.

Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y = f (X-1 , X-2, ... , X-k) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X-1 , X-2, ... , X-k) needed to complete the analysis. as f(X-1 , X-2, ... , X-k) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices.

In this contribution we introduce a continuous surface charge (CSC) approach that leads to a smooth and robust formalism for the PCM models.

By exploiting analogies to ground state energy and gradient calculations, efficient techniques can be transferred to excited state methods. Benchmark results demonstrate that, for low-lying excited states, geometry optimizations are not substantially more expensive than for the ground state, independent of the molecular size. We assess the quality of calculated adiabatic excitation energies, structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies by comparison with accurate experimental data for a variety of excited states and molecules.

In the solid state, in particular, they often appear in the form of visual bonding indicators. Because the latter require the crystal orbitals to be constructed from local basis sets, the application of the most popular density-functional theory codes (namely, those based on plane waves and pseudopotentials) appears as being ill-fitted to retrieve the chemical bonding information. In this paper, we describe a way to re-extract Hamilton-weighted populations from plane-wave electronic-structure calculations to develop a tool analogous to the familiar crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) method.

J,"Zhou, P; Yu, JG; Jaroniec, M",All-Solid-State Z-Scheme Photocatalytic Systems,"The current rapid industrial development causes the serious energy and environmental crises. Photocatalyts provide a potential strategy to solve these problems because these materials not only can directly convert solar energy into usable or storable energy resources but also can decompose organic pollutants under solar-light irradiation. However, the aforementioned applications require photocatalysts with a wide absorption range, long-term stability, high charge-separation efficiency and strong redox ability. Unfortunately, it is often difficult for a single-component photocatalyst to simultaneously fulfill all these requirements. The artificial heterogeneous Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, mimicking the natural photosynthesis process, overcome the drawbacks of single-component photocatalysts and satisfy those aforementioned requirements. Such multi-task systems have been extensively investigated in the past decade. Especially, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems without redox pair have been widely used in the water splitting, solar cells, degradation of pollutants and CO2 conversion, which have a huge potential to solve the current energy and environmental crises facing the modern industrial development.

High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects.

The essential novelty in this so-called GFN2-xTB method is the inclusion of anisotropic second order density fluctuation effects via short-range damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments. Without noticeable increase in the computational demands, this results in a less empirical and overall more physically sound method, which does not require any classical halogen or hydrogen bonding corrections and which relies solely on global and element-specific parameters (available up to radon, Z = 86). Moreover, the atomic partial charge dependent D4 London dispersion model is incorporated self-consistently, which can be naturally obtained in a tight-binding picture from second order density fluctuations.

This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: the entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such ""area laws"" for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium the current status of area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models, and disordered systems, nonequilibrium situations, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. These questions are considered in classical and quantum systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a variety of correlation measures. A significant proportion is devoted to the clear and quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation.

These phenomena include the dynamics of large proteins and self-assembly of biological materials. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling allows computer simulations to be run on length and time scales that are 2-3 orders of magnitude larger compared to atomistic simulations, providing a bridge between the atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed a new CG model for proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force field. Here, we validate the model for its use in peptide-bilayer systems. In order to validate the model, we calculated the potential of mean force for each amino acid as a function of its distance from the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer. We then compared amino acid association constants, the partitioning of a series of model pentapeptides, the partitioning and orientation,of WALP23 in DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. A comparison with results obtained from atomistic models shows good agreement in all of the tests performed. We also performed a systematic investigation of the partitioning of five series of polyalanine-leucine peptides (with different lengths and compositions) in DPPC bilayers. As expected, the fraction of peptides partitioned at the interface increased with decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine content, demonstrating that the CG model is capable of discriminating partitioning behavior arising from subtle differences in the amino acid composition. Finally, we simulated the concentration-dependent formation of transmembrane pores by magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with atomistic simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In conclusion, the model is computationally efficient and effectively reproduces peptide-lipid interactions and the partitioning of amino acids and peptides in lipid bilayers.",10.1021/ct700324x,378,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has an ionic lattice conductivity of 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C, and the Gd3+ ion is the preferred dopant, compared to Sm3+ and Y3+, at this temperature. Thermodynamic investigations indicate that for CeO2-Re2O3 solid solutions at intermediate temperatures it becomes easier to reduce Ce4+ as the concentration of Re2O3 is increased. As the associated electron mobilities do not appear to be a strong function of composition it follows that Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has a wider ionic domain than Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 at intermediate temperatures. particular attention is drawn to the deleterious effects of impurities (principally SiO2) which are responsible for large dopant concentration dependent grain boundary resistivities. These grain boundary resistivities can obscure the intrinsic lattice ionic conductivities and cause investigators to select non-optimal dopant compositions. It follows that the use of clean (SiO2 < 50 ppm) powders is strongly recommended, particularly as these are now commercially available. At present there is also no compelling evidence to confirm that the intrinsic lattice electronic conductivity is significantly changed by co-doping with Pr6O11. Finally the I-V characteristics of single cells incorporating 25-mu m thick Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolytes are modelled, and the requirements for composite electrodes briefly discussed so that power densities of 0.4 W cm(-2) at 500 degrees C can be attained.

To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, we performed a range of NVT-MD simulations on various hydrocarbon/O-2 systems. From simulations on methane/O-2, o-xylene/O-2, propene/O-2, and benzene/O-2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene > o-xylene > methane > benzene), following the trend in the C-H bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO/CO2/H2O mixture and found that the pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition-and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and hydrocarbon radical species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system.

The two limits are identified as the cases of infinitely small and infinitely large upconversion rates, respectively. In the latter case, the dependence of luminescence intensities from intermediate excited states on pump power changes with the underlying upconversion and decay mechanisms. In certain situations, energy-transfer upconversion and excited-state absorption can be distinguished by the measured slopes. The competition between linear decay and upconversion in the individual excitation steps of sequential upconversion can be analyzed. The influence of nonuniform distributions of absorbed pump power or of a subset of ions participating in energy-transfer upconversion is investigated.

J,"Zak, AK; Majid, WHA; Abrishami, ME; Yousefi, R",X-ray analysis of ZnO nanoparticles by Williamson-Hall and size-strain plot methods,"ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were prepared by a sol-gel combustion method from a zinc acetate precursor and acetic acid. The ZnO-NPs were synthesized at calcination temperatures of 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C for 1 h. The synthesized ZnO-NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and TEM. The XRD results revealed that the sample product was crystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite phase. High-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed single-crystal ZnO-NPs with nearly spherical shapes. The crystalline development in the ZnO-NPs was investigated by X-ray peak broadening. The Williamson-Hall (W-H) analysis and size-strain plot method were used to study the individual contributions of crystallite sizes and lattice strain on the peak broadening of the ZnO-NPs. The physical parameters such as strain, stress and energy density values were calculated more precisely for all the reflection peaks of XRD corresponding to the wurtzite hexagonal phase of ZnO lying in the range of 20 degrees-100 degrees from the modified form of the W-H plot assuming a uniform deformation model (UDM), uniform stress deformation model (USDM), uniform deformation energy density model (UDEDM) and by the size-strain plot method (SSP). The results obtained showed that the mean particle size of the ZnO-NPs estimated from the TEM, W-H analysis and the SSP method were highly intercorrelated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The solute-solvent operator has been derived from a PCM approach depending on solute electrostatic potential: Recently, it has been shown that such an approach also provides an excellent treatment of the solute electronic charge lying far from the nuclei, being particularly reliable for this kind of applications. The method has been tested for formaldehyde in water and in diethyl-ether, and then applied to the calculation of solvent effects on the n --> pi* transition of diazabenzenes in different solvents.

A realistic first-principles computational study of such systems entails the inclusion of solvent effects. In this work, we implement an implicit solvation model that has a firm theoretical foundation into the widely used density-functional code Vienna ab initio Software Package. The implicit solvation model follows the framework of joint density functional theory. We describe the framework, our algorithm and implementation, and benchmarks for small molecular systems. We apply the solvation model to study the surface energies of different facets of semiconducting and metallic nanocrystals and the S(N)2 reaction pathway. We find that solvation reduces the surface energies of the nanocrystals, especially for the semiconducting ones and increases the energy barrier of the S(N)2 reaction.

It is semiconducting (the remaining phases are metallic) and contains diatomic N-N with the bond distance of 1.414 A. These characters are consistent with the experimental facts that IrN2 is in lower symmetry and nonmetallic. Our conclusion is also in agreement with the recent theoretical studies that the most stable phase of IrN2 is monoclinic P2(1)/c.

The method consistently indicates a loss of complexity with aging, with an erratic cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation), and with a life-threatening syndrome (congestive heart failure). Further, these different conditions have distinct MSE curve profiles, suggesting diagnostic uses. The results support a general ""complexity-loss"" theory of aging and disease.

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEDI_v1_1 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 182 (2011) 2404 Nature of problem: The program computes the Feynman rules of any quantum field theory, expressed in four-dimensional space-time, directly from the Lagrangian of the model. Various interfaces to Feynman diagram calculators are included that allow the exportation of the interaction vertices in a format readable by different Monte Carlo event generators or symbolic calculation tools. Solution method: FeynRules works in three steps: 1. If necessary, the model Lagrangian is written in terms of four-component fermions and the usual fields of particle physics, instead of Weyl fermions or superfields. 2. Derivation of the Feynman rules directly form the Lagrangian using canonical commutation relations among fields and creation operators. 3. Implementation of the new physics model into FeynArts as well as into various Monte Carlo programs via dedicated interfaces. Reasons for new version: Bug fixes. Summary of revisions: cleaning of unnecessary files bug related to epsilon tensors bug with multiple interaction order fixed bug when we have one mass parameter for several particles in the UFO Restrictions: Mathematica version 7.0 or higher. The Lagrangian must fulfill basic quantum field theory requirements, such as locality and Lorentz and gauge invariance. Fields with spin 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2 are supported. Unusual features: Translation interfaces to various Feynman diagram generators exist. Superfields are also supported and can be expanded in terms of their component fields, which allows the performance of various sets of superspace computations. Running time: The computation of the Feynman rules from a Lagrangian varies with the complexity of the model, and runs from a few seconds to several minutes.

Using transmission electron microscopy, we correlate lattice orientation, edge morphology and crystallinity with island shape to demonstrate that triangular islands are single crystals.

Density functional theory reveals localized mid-gap states arising from these 8- 4 defects.

Good agreement with experiment is found for barrier heights.

J,"Sheberla, D; Bachman, JC; Elias, JS; Sun, CJ; Shao-Horn, Y; Dinca, M",Conductive MOF electrodes for stable supercapacitors with high areal capacitance,"Owing to their high power density and superior cyclability relative to batteries, electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) have emerged as an important electrical energy storage technology that will play a critical role in the large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources, smart power grids, and electrical vehicles'. Because the capacitance and charge-discharge rates of EDLCs scale with surface area and electrical conductivity, respectively, porous carbons such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes and crosslinked or holey graphenes are used exclusively as the active electrode materials in EDLCs4-9. One class of materials whose surface area far exceeds that of activated carbons, potentially allowing them to challenge the dominance of carbon electrodes in EDLCs, is metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)(10). The high porosity of MOFs, however, is conventionally coupled to very poor electrical conductivity, which has thus far prevented the use of these materials as active electrodes in EDLCs. Here, we show that Ni-3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)(2) (Ni-3(HITP)(2)), a MOF with high electrical conductivity(11), can serve as the sole electrode material in an EDLC. This is the first example of a supercapacitor made entirely from neat MOFs as active materials, without conductive additives or other binders. The MOF-based device shows an areal capacitance that exceeds those of most carbon-based materials and capacity retention greater than 90% over 10,000 cycles, in line with commercial devices. Given the established structural and compositional tunability of MOFs, these results herald the advent of a new generation of supercapacitors whose active electrode materials can be tuned rationally, at the molecular level.",10.1038/NMAT4766,443,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Large plasmon losses occur in the interband regime (via excitation of electron-hole pairs), which can be pushed toward higher frequencies for higher-doping values. For sufficiently large dopings, there is a bandwidth of frequencies from omega(Oph) up to the interband threshold, where a plasmon decay channel via emission of an optical phonon together with an electron-hole pair is nonegligible. The calculation of losses is performed within the framework of a random-phase approximation and number conserving relaxation-time approximation. The measured DC relaxation-time serves as an input parameter characterizing collisions with impurities, whereas the contribution from optical phonons is estimated from the influence of the electron-phonon coupling on the optical conductivity. Optical properties of plasmons in graphene are in many relevant aspects similar to optical properties of surface plasmons propagating on dielectric-metal interface, which have been drawing a lot of interest lately because of their importance for nanophotonics.

We explain this asymmetry in ZnO via a study of its intrinsic defect physics, including Zn-O, Zn-i, V-O, O-i, and V-Zn and n-type impurity dopants, Al and F. We find that ZnO is n type at Zn-rich conditions. This is because (i) the Zn interstitial, Zn-i, is a shallow, donor, supplying electrons; (ii) its formation enthalpy is low for both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, so this defect is abundant; and (iii) the native defects that could compensate the n-type doping effect of Zn-i (interstitial O, O-i, and Zn vacancy, V-Zn), have high formation enthalpies for Zn-rich conditions, so these ""electron killers"" are not abundant. We find that ZnO cannot be doped p type via native defects (O-i, V-Zn) despite the fact that they are shallow (i.e., supplying holes at room temperature). This is because at both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, the defects that could compensate p-type doping (V-O, Zn-i, Zn-O) have low formation enthalpies so these ""hole killers"" form readily. Furthermore, we identify electron-hole radiative recombination at the V-O center as the source of the green luminescence. In contrast, a large structural relaxation of the same center upon double hole capture leads to slow electron-hole recombination (either radiative or nonradiative) responsible for the slow decay of photoconductivity.",10.1103/PhysRevB.63.075205,469,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The band gaps calculated within density functional theory using local density approximation are corrected by GW(0) method. Si and Ge in honeycomb structure are semimetal and have linear band crossing at the Fermi level which attributes massless Fermion character to charge carriers as in graphene. However, all binary compounds are found to be semiconductor with band gaps depending on the constituent atoms. We present a method to reveal elastic constants of 2D honeycomb structures from the strain energy and calculate the Poisson's ratio as well as in-plane stiffness values. Preliminary results show that the nearly lattice matched heterostructures of these compounds can offer alternatives for nanoscale electronic devices. Similar to those of the three-dimensional group-IV and group III-V compound semiconductors, one deduces interesting correlations among the calculated properties of present honeycomb structures.",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.155453,479,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

This theoretical procedure is the fourth in the Gaussian-n series of quantum chemical methods based on a sequence of single point energy calculations. The G4 theory modifies the Gaussian-3 (G3) theory in five ways. First, an extrapolation procedure is used to obtain the Hartree-Fock limit for inclusion in the total energy calculation. Second, the d-polarization sets are increased to 3d on the first-row atoms and to 4d on the second-row atoms, with reoptimization of the exponents for the latter. Third, the QCISD(T) method is replaced by the CCSD(T) method for the highest level of correlation treatment. Fourth, optimized geometries and zero-point energies are obtained with the B3LYP density functional. Fifth, two new higher level corrections are added to account for deficiencies in the energy calculations. The new method is assessed on the 454 experimental energies in the G3/05 test set [L. A.

J,"Lallemand, P; Luo, LS","Theory of the lattice Boltzmann method: Dispersion, dissipation, isotropy, Galilean invariance, and stability","The generalized hydrodynamics (the wave vector dependence of the transport coefficients) of a generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) is studied in detail. The generalized lattice Boltzmann equation is constructed in moment space rather than in discrete velocity space. The generalized hydrodynamics of the model is obtained by solving the dispersion equation of the linearized LEE either analytically by using perturbation technique or numerically. The proposed LEE model has a maximum number of adjustable parameters for the given set of discrete velocities. Generalized hydrodynamics characterizes dispersion, dissipation (hyperviscosities), anisotropy, and lack of Galilean invariance of the model, and can be applied to select the values of the adjustable parameters that optimize the properties of the model. The proposed generalized hydrodynamic analysis also provides some insights into stability and proper initial conditions for LEE simulations. The stability properties of some two-dimensional LEE models are analyzed and compared with each Ether in the parameter space of the mean streaming velocity and the viscous relaxation time. The procedure described in this work can be applied to analyze other LEE models. As examples, LEE models with various interpolation schemes are analyzed. Numerical results on shear how with an initially discontinuous velocity profile (shock) with or without a constant streaming velocity are shown to demonstrate the dispersion effects in the LEE model: the results compare favorably with our theoretical analysis. We also show that whereas linear analysis of the LEE evolution operator is equivalent to Chapman-Enskog analysis in the long-wavelength limit (wave vector k=0), it can also provide results for large values of k. Such results are important for the stability and other hydrodynamic properties of the LEE method and cannot be obtained through Chapman-Enskog analysis.",10.1103/PhysRevE.61.6546,491,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Weigend, F; Köhn, A; Hättig, C",Efficient use of the correlation consistent basis sets in resolution of the identity MP2 calculations,"The convergence of the second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) correlation energy with the cardinal number X is investigated for the correlation consistent basis-set series cc-pVXZ and cc-pV(X+d)Z. For the aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z series the convergence of the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole moment is studied. It is found that, when d-shell electrons cannot be frozen, the cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets converge much slower for third-row elements then they do for first- and second-row elements. Based on the results of these studies criteria are deduced for the accuracy of auxiliary basis sets used in the resolution of the identity (RI) approximation for electron repulsion integrals. Optimized auxiliary basis sets for RI-MP2 calculations fulfilling these criteria are reported for the sets cc-pVXZ, cc-pV(X+d)Z, aug-cc-pVXZ, and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z with X=D, T, and Q. For all basis sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation energy is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the usual basis-set error. For the auxiliary aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the usual basis set error. Therefore extrapolations towards the basis-set limit are possible within the RI approximation for both energies and properties. The reduction in CPU time obtained with the RI approximation increases rapidly with basis set size. For the cc-pVQZ basis an acceleration by a factor of up to 170 is observed.

Plasmonic nanoantennas create highly enhanced local fields when pumped resonantly, leading to increased Raman scattering(5), but whether fluorescence enhancement occurs depends upon a variety of factors. Although sharp metal tips(6) and colloids(7,8) can enhance fluorescence, the highly enhanced optical fields of lithographically fabricated bowtie nanoantennas(9) provide a structure that is more controllable and amenable to integration. Using gold bowties, we observe enhancements of a single molecule's fluorescence up to a factor of 1,340, ten times higher than reported previously(7,8,10-22). Electromagnetic simulations reveal that this is a result of greatly enhanced absorption and an increased radiative emission rate, leading to enhancement of the intrinsic quantum efficiency by an estimated factor of nine, despite additional non-radiative ohmic effects.

Here, an artificial tree with a reverse-tree design is demonstrated as a cost-effective, scalable yet highly efficient steam-generation device. The reverse-tree design implies that the wood is placed on the water with the tree-growth direction parallel to the water surface; accordingly, water is transported in a direction perpendicular to what occurs in natural tree. The artificial tree is fabricated by cutting the natural tree along the longitudinal direction followed by surface carbonization (called as C-L-Wood). The nature-made 3D interconnected micro-/nanochannels enable efficient water transpiration, while the layered channels block the heat effectively. A much lower thermal conductivity (0.11 W m(-1) K-1) thus can be achieved, only 1/3 of that of the horizontally cut wood. Meanwhile, the carbonized surface can absorb almost all the incident light. The simultaneous optimizations of water transpiration, thermal management, and light absorption results in a high efficiency of 89% at 10 kW m(-2), among the highest values in literature.

Stability tests showed a minimal loss of activity after 5,000 potential cycles and the ordered core-shell structure was maintained virtually intact, as established by atomic-scale elemental mapping.

J,"Frackowiak, E",Carbon materials for supercapacitor application,"The most commonly used electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors are activated carbons, because they are commercially available and cheap, and they can be produced with large specific surface area. However, only the electrochemically available surface area is useful for charging the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL formation is especially efficient in carbon pores of size below 1 nm because of the lack of space charge and a good attraction of ions along the pore walls. The pore size should ideally match the size of the ions. However, for good dynamic charge propagation, some small mesopores are useful. An asymmetric configuration, where the positive and negative electrodes are constructed from different materials, e. g., activated carbon, transition metal oxide or conducting polymer, is of great interest because of an important extension of the operating voltage. In such a case, the energy as well as power is greatly increased. It appears that nanotubes are a perfect conducting additive and/or support for materials with pseudocapacitance properties, e. g. MnO2, conducting polymers. Substitutional heteroatoms in the carbon network (nitrogen, oxygen) are a promising way to enhance the capacitance. Carbons obtained by one-step pyrolysis of organic precursors rich in heteroatoms (nitrogen and/or oxygen) are very interesting, because they are denser than activated carbons. The application of a novel type of electrolyte with a broad voltage window (ionic liquids) is considered, but the stability of this new generation of electrolyte during long term cycling of capacitors is not yet confirmed.",10.1039/b618139m,505,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no
J,"Grosvenor, AP; Biesinger, MC; Smart, RS; McIntyre, NS",New interpretations of XPS spectra of nickel metal and oxides,"A current interpretation of XPS spectra of Ni metal assumes that the main 6 eV satellite is due to a two hole c3d(9)4s(2) (c is a core hole) final state effect. We report REELS observation in AES at low voltages of losses (plasmons and inter-band transitions) corresponding to the satellite structures in Ni metal 2p spectra. The satellite near 6 eV is attributed to a predominant surface plasmon loss. A current interpretation of Ni 2p spectra of oxides and other compounds is based oil charge transfer assignments of the main peak at 854.6 eV and the broad satellite centred at around 861 eV to the cd(9)L and the unscreened cd(8) final-state configurations, respectively (L is a ligand hole). Multiplet splittings have been shown to be necessary for assignment of Fe 2p and Cr 2p spectral profiles and chemical states. The assignments of Ni 2p states are re-examined with intra-atomic multiplet envelopes applied to Ni(OH)(2), NiOOH and NiO spectra. It is shown that the free ion inultiplet envelopes for Ni2+ and Ni3+ simulate the main line and satellite structures for Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH. Fitting the NiO Ni 2p spectral profile is not as straightforward as the hydroxide and oxyhydroxide. It may involve contributions from interatomic. non-local electronic coupling and screening effects with multiplet structures significantly different from the free ions as found for MnO. A scheme for fitting these spectra using multiplet envelopes is proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.susc.2006.01.041,506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that the unphysical behavior of Mulliken populations obtained from extended basis set wave functions can lead to incomplete localization of orbitals by the Pipek-Mezey population localization method, and introduce a modification to correct this problem. The new localization procedure, called minimum population localization, is incorporated into the CBS-QB3 and the new CBS-4M model chemistries, and their performance is assessed on the G2/97 test set. The errors found for CBS-QB3 are comparable with those for the G3 and G3(MP2) (mean absolute deviation of 1.10, 0.94, and 1.21 kcal/mol, respectively, on the G2/97 test set). The CBS-4M is less accurate than the other models (mean absolute deviation of 3.26 kcal/mol on the G2/97 test set), but can be applied to much larger systems. The modified localization method resolves several problem cases found with CBS-4 and improves the reliability of CBS-QB3. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

The signal was measured on January 4, 2017 at 10: 11: 58.6 UTC by the twin advanced detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory during their second observing run, with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm rate less than 1 in 70 000 years. The inferred component black hole masses are 31.2(-6.0)(+8.4) M-circle dot and 19.4(-5.9)(+5.3)M(circle dot) (at the 90% credible level). The black hole spins are best constrained through measurement of the effective inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the spin components perpendicular to the orbital plane, chi(eff) = -0.12(-0.30)(+0.21) . This result implies that spin configurations with both component spins positively aligned with the orbital angular momentum are disfavored. The source luminosity distance is 880(-390)(+450) Mpc corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.18(-0.07)(+0.08) . We constrain the magnitude of modifications to the gravitational-wave dispersion relation and perform null tests of general relativity. Assuming that gravitons are dispersed in vacuum like massive particles, we bound the graviton mass to m(g) <= 7.7 x 10(-23) eV/c(2). In all cases, we find that GW170104 is consistent with general relativity.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.221101,512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also search for persistent gravitational waves from point sources with only minimal assumptions over the 20-1726 Hz frequency band.

Incorporating MOF nanosheets into polymer matrices endows the resultant composites with outstanding CO2 separation performance from CO2/CH4 gas mixtures, together with an unusual and highly desired increase in the separation selectivity with pressure. As revealed by tomographic focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, the unique separation behaviour stems from a superior occupation of the membrane cross-section by the MOF nanosheets as compared with isotropic crystals, which improves the efficiency of molecular discrimination and eliminates unselective permeation pathways.

Worldwide efforts to find materials with thermoelectric figure of merit, zT values significantly above unity, are frequently focused on crystalline semiconductors with low thermal conductivity(2). Here we report on Cu2-xSe, which reaches a zT of 1.5 at 1,000 K, among the highest values for any bulk materials. Whereas the Se atoms in Cu2-xSe form a rigid face-centred cubic lattice, providing a crystalline pathway for semiconducting electrons (or more precisely holes), the copper ions are highly disordered around the Se sublattice and are superionic with liquid-like mobility. This extraordinary 'liquid-like' behaviour of copper ions around a crystalline sublattice of Se in Cu2-xSe results in an intrinsically very low lattice thermal conductivity which enables high zT in this otherwise simple semiconductor. This unusual combination of properties leads to an ideal thermoelectric material.

However, very few feasible practical approaches exist at present. Surface plasmon polaritons(2,3) are among the most promising candidates for subwavelength optical confinement(3-10). However, studies of long-range surface plasmon polaritons have only demonstrated optical confinement comparable to that of conventional dielectric waveguides, because of practical issues including optical losses and stringent fabrication demands(3,11-13). Here, we propose a new approach that integrates dielectric waveguiding with plasmonics. The hybrid optical waveguide consists of a dielectric nanowire separated from a metal surface by a nanoscale dielectric gap. The coupling between the plasmonic and waveguide modes across the gap enables 'capacitor-like' energy storage that allows effective subwavelength transmission in non-metallic regions. In this way, surface plasmon polaritons can travel over large distances (40-150 mm) with strong mode confinement ( ranging from lambda(2)/400 to lambda(2)/40).

J,"Barabási, AL; Jeong, H; Néda, Z; Ravasz, E; Schubert, A; Vicsek, T",Evolution of the social network of scientific collaborations,"The co-authorship network of scientists represents a prototype of complex evolving networks. In addition, it offers one of the most extensive database to date on social networks. By mapping the electronic database containing all relevant journals in mathematics and neuro-science for an 8-year period (1991-98), we infer the dynamic and the structural mechanisms that govern the evolution and topology of this complex system. Three complementary approaches allow us to obtain a detailed characterization. First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topological measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities. The results indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution is governed by preferential attachment, affecting both internal and external links. However, in contrast with most model predictions the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases. Second, we propose a simple model that captures the network's time evolution. In some limits the model can be solved analytically, predicting a two-regime scaling in agreement with the measurements. Third, numerical simulations are used to uncover the behavior of quantities that could not be predicted analytically. The combined numerical and analytical results underline the important role internal links play in determining the observed scaling behavior and network topology. The results and methodologies developed in the context of the co-authorship network could be useful for a systematic study of other complex evolving networks as well, such as the world wide web, Internet, or other social networks.

J,"Peterson, KA; Dunning, TH","Accurate correlation consistent basis sets for molecular core-valence correlation effects: The second row atoms Al-Ar, and the first row atoms B-Ne revisited","Correlation consistent basis sets for accurately describing core-core and core-valence correlation effects in atoms and molecules have been developed for the second row atoms Al-Ar. Two different optimization strategies were investigated, which led to two families of core-valence basis sets when the optimized functions were added to the standard correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ). In the first case, the exponents of the augmenting primitive Gaussian functions were optimized with respect to the difference between all-electron and valence-electron correlated calculations, i.e., for the core-core plus core-valence correlation energy. This yielded the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets, which are analogous to the sets developed previously for the first row atoms [D. E. Woon and T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 103, 4572 (1995)]. Although the cc-pCVnZ sets exhibit systematic convergence to the all-electron correlation energy at the complete basis set limit, the intershell (core-valence) correlation energy converges more slowly than the intrashell (core-core) correlation energy. Since the effect of including the core electrons on the calculation of molecular properties tends to be dominated by core-valence correlation effects, a second scheme for determining the augmenting functions was investigated. In this approach, the exponents of the functions to be added to the cc-pVnZ sets were optimized with respect to just the core-valence (intershell) correlation energy, except that a small amount of core-core correlation energy was included in order to ensure systematic convergence to the complete basis set limit. These new sets, denoted weighted core-valence basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ), significantly improve the convergence of many molecular properties with n. Optimum cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row atoms were also developed and show similar advantages. Both the cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules (Al-2, Si-2, P-2, S-2, and Cl-2), as well as on selected diatomic molecules involving first row atoms (CO, SiO, PN, and BCl). For the calculation of core correlation effects on energetic and spectroscopic properties, the cc-pwCVnZ basis sets are recommended over the cc-pCVnZ ones.

Using classical molecular dynamics, we report the desalination performance of such membranes as a function of pore size, chemical functionalization, and applied pressure. Our results indicate that the membrane's ability to prevent the salt passage depends critically on pore diameter with adequately sized pores allowing for water flow while blocking ions. Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water flux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water flux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions. Overall, our results indicate that the water permeability of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reverse osmosis membranes, and that nanoporous graphene may have a valuable role to play for water purification.",10.1021/nl3012853,525,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Our results indicate that tunneling is much more interesting and complicated than the simple barrier model used previously. We obtain the following general results: (1) Tunneling conductance depends strongly on the symmetry of the Bloch states in the electrodes and of the evanescent states in the barrier layer. (2) Bloch states of different symmetry decay at different rates within the barrier. The decay rate is determined by the complex energy bands of the same symmetry in the barrier. (3) There may be quantum interference between the decaying states in the barrier. This leads to an oscillatory dependence of the tunneling current on kll and a damped oscillatory dependence on barrier thickness. (4) Interfacial resonance states can allow particular Bloch states to tunnel efficiently through the barrier. For Fe(100)(MgO(100)\Fe(100) our calculations indicate that quite different tunneling mechanisms dominate the conductance in the two spin channels. In the majority channel the conductance is primarily via Bloch electrons with small transverse momentum. One particular state with Delta (1) symmetry is able to effectively couple from the Fe into the MgO. In the minority channel the conductance is primarily through interface resonance states especially for thinner layers.

J,"Ryu, S; Schnyder, AP; Furusaki, A; Ludwig, AWW",Topological insulators and superconductors: tenfold way and dimensional hierarchy,"It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the different topological sectors can be distinguished, depending on the case, by a Z or a Z(2) topological invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we construct representatives of topological insulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using these representatives we demonstrate how topological insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and different classes can be related via 'dimensional reduction' by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in 'Kaluza-Klein'-like fashion). For Z-topological insulators (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one dimension at a time into a different class. The Z(2)-topological insulators (superconductors), on the other hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of parent Z-topological insulators in the same class, from which they inherit their topological properties. The eightfold periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or charge-conjugation/particle-hole symmetries) is a reflection of the eightfold periodicity of the spinor representations of the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). Furthermore, we derive for general spatial dimensions a relation between the topological invariant that characterizes topological insulators and superconductors with chiral symmetry (i.e., the winding number) and the Chern-Simons invariant. For lower-dimensional cases, this formula relates the winding number to the electric polarization (d = 1 spatial dimensions) or to the magnetoelectric polarizability (d = 3 spatial dimensions). Finally, we also discuss topological field theories describing the spacetime theory of linear responses in topological insulators (superconductors) and study how the presence of inversion symmetry modifies the classification of topological insulators (superconductors).",10.1088/1367-2630/12/6/065010,533,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes

In the ground state, by tracing out all degrees of freedom in the exterior of the disk, we obtain a marginal density operator rho for the degrees of freedom in the interior.

J,"Salahuddin, S; Dattat, S",Use of negative capacitance to provide voltage amplification for low power nanoscale devices,"It is well-known that conventional field effect transistors (FETs) require a change in the channel potential of at least 60 mV at 300 K to effect a change in the current by a factor of 10, and this minimum subthreshold slope S puts a fundamental lower limit on the operating voltage and hence the power dissipation in standard FET-based switches. Here, we suggest that by replacing the standard insulator with a ferroelectric insulator of the right thickness it should be possible to implement a step-up voltage transformer that will amplify the gate voltage thus leading to values of S lower than 60 mV/decade and enabling low voltage/low power operation. The voltage transformer action can be understood intuitively as the result of an effective negative capacitance provided by the ferroelectric capacitor that arises from an internal positive feedback that in principle could be obtained from other microscopic mechanisms as well. Unlike other proposals to reduce S, this involves no change in the basic physics of the FET and thus does not affect its current drive or impose other restrictions.",10.1021/nl071804g,537,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

J,"Xiu, ZM; Zhang, QB; Puppala, HL; Colvin, VL; Alvarez, PJJ",Negligible Particle-Specific Antibacterial Activity of Silver Nanoparticles,"For nearly a decade, researchers have debated the mechanisms by which AgNPs exert toxicity to bacteria and other organisms. The most elusive question has been whether the AgNPs exert direct ""particle-specific"" effects beyond the known antimicrobial activity of released silver ions (Ag+). Here, we infer that Ag+ is the definitive molecular toxicant. We rule out direct particle-specific biological effects by showing the lack of toxicity of AgNPs when synthesized and tested under strictly anaerobic conditions that preclude Ag(0) oxidation and Ag+ release. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the toxicity of various AgNPs (PEG- or PVP- coated, of three different sizes each) accurately follows the dose response pattern of E. coli exposed to Ag+ (added as AgNO3). Surprisingly, E. coli survival was stimulated by relatively low (sublethal) concentration of all tested AgNPs and AgNO3 (at 3-8 mu g/L Ag+, or 12-31% of the minimum lethal concentration (MLC)), suggesting a hormetic response that would be counterproductive to antimicrobial applications. Overall, this work suggests that AgNP morphological properties known to affect antimicrobial activity are indirect effectors that primarily influence Ag+ release. Accordingly, antibacterial activity could be controlled (and environmental impacts could be mitigated) by modulating Ag+ release, possibly through manipulation of oxygen availability, particle size, shape, and/or type of coating.",10.1021/nl301934w,539,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

One limitation of electrochemical capacitors is their low energy density and for this reason, there is widespread interest in pseudocapacitive materials that use Faradaic reactions to store charge. One candidate pseudocapacitive material is orthorhombic MoO3 (alpha-MoO3), a layered compound with a high theoretical capacity for lithium (279 mA h g(-1) or 1,005 C g(-1)). Here, we report on the properties of reduced alpha-MoO3-x(R-MoO3-x) and compare it with fully oxidized alpha-MoO3 (F-MoO3). The introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a larger interlayer spacing that promotes faster charge storage kinetics and enables the alpha-MoO3 structure to be retained during the insertion and removal of Li ions. The higher specific capacity of the R-MoO3-x is attributed to the reversible formation of a significant amount of Mo4+ following lithiation.

Intense research efforts over the past decade have been invested in unraveling spin transport properties in antiferromagnetic materials. Whether spin transport can be used to drive the antiferromagnetic order and how subsequent variations can be detected are some of the thrilling challenges currently being addressed. Antiferromagnetic spintronics started out with studies on spin transfer and has undergone a definite revival in the last few years with the publication of pioneering articles on the use of spin-orbit interactions in antiferromagnets. This paradigm shift offers possibilities for radically new concepts for spin manipulation in electronics. Central to these endeavors are the need for predictive models, relevant disruptive materials, and new experimental designs. This paper reviews the most prominent spintronic effects described based on theoretical and experimental analysis of antiferromagnetic materials. It also details some of the remaining bottlenecks and suggests possible avenues for future research. This review covers both spin-transfer-related effects, such as spin-transfer torque, spin penetration length, domain-wall motion, and ""magnetization"" dynamics, and spin-orbit related phenomena, such as (tunnel) anisotropic magnetoresistance, spin Hall, and inverse spin galvanic effects.

Research cloud models have been in development over the last 45 years and they continue to be an important tool for investigating clouds, cloud-systems, and other small-scale atmospheric dynamics. The latest generation are now being used for weather prediction. The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) model, representative of this generation and of a class of models using explicit time-splitting integration techniques to efficiently integrate the Euler equations, is described in this paper. It is the first fully compressible conservative-form nonhydrostatic atmospheric model suitable for both research and weather prediction applications. Results are presented demonstrating its ability to resolve strongly nonlinear small-scale phenomena, clouds, and cloud systems. Kinetic energy spectra and other statistics show that the model is simulating small scales in numerical weather prediction applications, while necessarily removing energy at the gridscale but minimizing artificial dissipation at the resolved scales.

The results are used to determine what conditions are most favorable for producing enhancements large enough to observe single molecule surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Most of the calculations refer to triangular prisms, which exhibit distinct dipole and quadrupole resonances that can easily be controlled by varying particle size. In addition, for the dimer calculations we study the influence of dimer separation and orientation, especially for dimers that are separated by a few nanometers. We find that the largest \E\(2) values for dimers are about a factor of 10 larger than those for all the monomers examined. For all particles and particle orientations, the plasmon resonances which lead to the largest E-fields are those with the longest wavelength dipolar excitation. The spacing of the particles in the dimer plays a crucial role, and we find that the spacing needed to achieve a given \E\(2) is proportional to nanoparticle size for particles below 100 nm in size. Particle shape and curvature are of lesser importance, with a head to tail configuration of two triangles giving enhanced fields comparable to head to head, or rounded head to tail.

By calculating vertical excitation energies of typical molecules, it was found that LC-TDDFT gives accurate excitation energies, within an error of 0.5 eV, and reasonable oscillator strengths, while TDDFT employing a pure functional provides 1.5 eV lower excitation energies and two orders of magnitude lower oscillator strengths for the Rydberg excitations. It was also found that LC-TDDFT clearly reproduces the correct asymptotic behavior of the charge-transfer excitation energy of ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene dimer for the long intramolecular distance, unlike a conventional far-nucleus asymptotic correction scheme. It is, therefore, presumed that poor TDDFT results for pure functionals may be due to their lack of a long-range orbital-orbital interaction.

J,"Janotti, A; Van de Walle, CG",Native point defects in ZnO,"We have performed a comprehensive first-principles investigation of native point defects in ZnO based on density functional theory within the local density approximation (LDA) as well as the LDA+U approach for overcoming the band-gap problem. Oxygen deficiency, manifested in the form of oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials, has long been invoked as the source of the commonly observed unintentional n-type conductivity in ZnO. However, contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find that native point defects are very unlikely to be the cause of unintentional n-type conductivity. Oxygen vacancies, which have most often been cited as the cause of unintentional doping, are deep rather than shallow donors and have high formation energies in n-type ZnO (and are therefore unlikely to form). Zinc interstitials are shallow donors, but they also have high formation energies in n-type ZnO and are fast diffusers with migration barriers as low as 0.57 eV; they are therefore unlikely to be stable. Zinc antisites are also shallow donors but their high formation energies (even in Zn-rich conditions) render them unlikely to be stable under equilibrium conditions. We have, however, identified a different low-energy atomic configuration for zinc antisites that may play a role under nonequilibrium conditions such as irradiation. Zinc vacancies are deep acceptors and probably related to the frequently observed green luminescence; they act as compensating centers in n-type ZnO. Oxygen interstitials have high formation energies; they can occur as electrically neutral split interstitials in semi-insulating and p-type materials or as deep acceptors at octahedral interstitial sites in n-type ZnO. Oxygen antisites have very high formation energies and are unlikely to exist in measurable concentrations under equilibrium conditions. Based on our results for migration energy barriers, we calculate activation energies for self-diffusion and estimate defect-annealing temperatures.

The key idea of this method is to take full advantages of a Riccati equation involving a parameter and use its solutions to replace the tanh function in the tanh-function method. It is quite interesting that the sign of the parameter can be used to exactly judge the numbers and types of these travelling wave solutions. In addition, by introducing appropriate transformations, it is shown that the extended tanh-function method still is applicable to nonlinear PDEs whose balancing numbers may be any nonzero real numbers. Some illustrative equations are investigated by this means and new travelling wave solutions are found. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J,"Basko, DM; Aleiner, IL; Altshuler, BL",Metal-insulator transition in a weakly interacting many-electron system with localized single-particle states,"We consider low-temperature behavior of weakly interacting electrons in disordered conductors in the regime when all single-particle eigenstates are localized by the quenched disorder. We prove that in the absence of coupling of the electrons to any external bath do electrical conductivity exactly vanishes as long as the temperature T does not exceed some finite value T-c. At the same time, it can be also proven that at high enough T the conductivity is finite. These two statements imply that the system undergoes a finite temperature metal-to-insulator transition, which can be viewed as Anderson-like localization of many-body wave functions in the Fock space. Metallic and insulating states are not different from each other by any spatial or discrete symmetries. We formulate the effective Hamiltonian description of the system at low energies (of the order of the level spacing in the single-particle localization volume). In the metallic phase quantum Boltzmann equation is valid, allowing to find the kinetic coefficients. In the insulating phase, T < T-c, we use Feynmann diagram technique to determine the probability distribution function for quantum-mechanical transition rates. The probability of an escape rate from a given quantum state to be finite turns out to vanish in every order of the perturbation theory in electron-electron interaction. Thus, electron-electron interaction alone is unable to cause the relaxation and establish the thermal equilibrium. As soon as some weak coupling to a bath is turned on, conductivity becomes finite even in the insulating phase. Moreover, in the vicinity of the transition temperature it is much larger than phonon-induced hopping conductivity of non-interacting electrons. The reason for this enhancement is that the stability of the insulating state is gradually decreasing as the transition point is approached.

J,"Goerigk, L; Grimme, S","A thorough benchmark of density functional methods for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions","A thorough energy benchmark study of various density functionals (DFs) is carried out with the new GMTKN30 database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions [Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2010, 6, 107; Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2011, 7, 291]. In total, 47 DFs are investigated: two LDAs, 14 GGAs, three meta-GGAs, 23 hybrids and five double-hybrids. Besides the double-hybrids, also other modern approaches, i.e., the M05 and M06 classes of functionals and range-separated hybrids, are tested. For almost all functionals, the new DFT-D3 correction is applied in order to consistently test the performance also for important noncovalent interactions; the parameters are taken from previous works or determined for the present study. Basis set and quadrature grid issues are also considered. The general aim of the study is to work out which functionals are generally well applicable and robust to describe the energies of molecules. In summary, we recommend on the GGA level the B97-D3 and revPBE-D3 functionals. The best meta-GGA is oTPSS-D3 although meta-GGAs represent in general no clear improvement compared to numerically simpler GGAs. Notably, the widely used B3LYP functional performs worse than the average of all tested hybrids and is also very sensitive to the application of dispersion corrections. We discourage its usage as a standard method without closer inspection of the results, as it still seems to be often done nowadays. Surprisingly, long-range corrected exchange functionals do in general not perform better than the corresponding standard hybrids. However, the omega B97X-D functional seems to be a promising method. The most robust hybrid is Zhao and Truhlar's PW6B95 functional in combination with DFT-D3. If higher accuracy is required, double-hybrids should be applied. The corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and PWPB95-D3 variants are the most accurate and robust functionals of the entire study. Additional calculations with MP2 and and its spin-scaled variants SCS-MP2, S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 revealed that double-hybrids in general outperform those. Only SCS-MP2 can be recommended, particularly for reaction energies. We suggest its usage when a large self-interaction error is expected that prohibits usage of double-hybrids. Perdews' metaphoric picture of Jacob's Ladder for the classification of density functionals' performance could unbiasedly be confirmed with GMTKN30.

From long to short geometries, the results presented here lead to three characteristic regions, which correspond to three different interaction states. While the extreme regions are associated to pure closed-shell (CS) and shared-shell (SS) interactions, the middle one has been related to the redistribution of rho(r) between those electronic states. The analysis carried out with this system has permitted to associate the transit region between pure CS and SS interactions to internuclear geometries involved in the building of the H-F bonding molecular orbital. A comparative analysis between the formation of this orbital and the behavior of some characteristic rho(r) properties has indicated their intrinsic correspondence, leading to the definition of a bond degree parameter [BD=H-CP/rho(CP); H-CP and rho(CP) being the total electron energy density and the electron density value at the H...F (3,-1) critical point].

The use of the CHARMM36 force field (C36 FF) in different MD simulation programs can result in disagreements with published simulations performed with CHARMM due to differences in the protocols used to treat the long-range and 14 nonbonded interactions. In this study, we systematically test the use of the C36 lipid FF in NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER, OpenMM, and CHARMM/OpenMM. A wide range of Lennard-Jones (LJ) cutoff schemes and integrator algorithms were tested to find the optimal simulation protocol to best match bilayer properties of six lipids with varying acyl chainsaturation and head groups. MD simulations of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer were used to obtain the optimal protocol for each program. MD simulations with all programs were found to reasonably match the DPPC bilayer properties (surface area per lipid, chain order parameters, and area compressibility modulus) obtained using the standard protocol used in CHARMM as well as from experiments. The optimal simulation protocol was then applied to the other five lipid simulations and resulted in excellent agreement between results from most simulation programs as well as with experimental data.

J,"Mostofi, AA; Yates, JR; Pizzi, G; Lee, YS; Souza, I; Vanderbilt, D; Marzari, N",An updated version of wannier90: A tool for obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions,"wannier90 is a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWFs in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWFs can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 is able to output MLWFs for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. We present here an updated version of wannier90, wannier90 2.0, including minor bug fixes and parallel (MPI) execution for band-structure interpolation and the calculation of properties such as density of states, Berry curvature and orbital magnetisation. wannier90 is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.orgi.",10.1016/j.cpc.2014.05.003,602,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

The important length scale in the problem is identified to be the ratio of the surface elastic modulus to the elastic modulus of the bulk. In general, the non-dimensional difference in the elastic properties from continuum predictions (D - D-c)/D-c is found to scale as alpha S/Eh, where alpha is a constant which depends on the geometry of the structural element considered, S is a surface elastic constant, E is a bulk elastic modulus and h a length defining the size of the structural element. Thus, the quantity S/E is identified as a material length scale for elasticity of nanosized structures.

The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors.

Some ZnO nanoparticles exhibit very strong blue emissions, the intensity of which first increase and then decrease with annealing. These visible emissions exhibit strong and interesting excitation dependences: 1) the optimal excitation energy for blue emissions is near the bandgap energy, but the effective excitation can obviously be lower, even 420 nm (2.95 eV < E-g = 3.26 eV); in contrast, green emissions can be excited only by energies larger than the bandgap energy; and, 2) there are several fixed emitting wavelengths at 415, 440, 455 and 488 nm in the blue wave band, which exhibit considerable stability in different excitation and annealing conditions. Mechanisms for blue emissions from ZnO are proposed with interstitial-zinc-related defect levels as initial states. EPR spectra reveal the predominance of interstitial zinc in as-prepared samples, and the evolutions of coexisting interstitial zinc and oxygen vacancies with annealing.

J,"Grimme, S",Improved second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory by separate scaling of parallel- and antiparallel-spin pair correlation energies,"A simple modification of second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) to improve the description of molecular ground state energies is proposed. The total MP2 correlation energy is partitioned into parallel- and antiparallel-spin components which are separately scaled. The two parameters (scaling factors), whose values can be justified by basic theoretical arguments, have been optimized on a benchmark set of 51 reaction energies composed of 74 first-row molecules. It is found, that the new method performs significantly better than standard MP2: the rms [mean absolute error (MAE)] deviation drops from 4.6 (3.3) to 2.3 (1.8) kcal/mol. The maximum error is reduced from 13.3 to 5.1 kcal/mol. Significant improvements are especially observed for cases which are usually known as MP2 pitfalls while cases already described well with MP2 remain almost unchanged. Even for 11 atomization energies not considered in the fit, uniform improvements [MAE: 8.1 kcal/mol (MP2) versus 3.2 kcal/mol (new)] are found. The results are furthermore compared with those from density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) and quadratic configuration interaction [QCISD/QCISD(T)] calculations. Also for difficult systems including strong (nondynamical) correlation effects, the improved MP2 method clearly outperforms DFT/B3LYP and yields results of QCISD or sometimes QCISD(T) quality. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for ten diatomic molecules also show consistent enhancements. The uniformity with which the new method improves upon MP2, thereby rectifying many of its problems, indicates significant robustness and suggests it as a valuable quantum chemical method of general use.

For such applications, it is important that the nanomaterials be harmlessly eliminated from the body in a reasonable period of time after they carry out their diagnostic or therapeutic function. Despite efforts to improve their targeting efficiency, significant quantities of systemically administered nanomaterials are cleared by the mononuclear phagocytic system before finding their targets, increasing the likelihood of unintended acute or chronic toxicity. However, there has been little effort to engineer the self-destruction of errant nanoparticles into non-toxic, systemically eliminated products. Here, we present luminescent porous silicon nanoparticles (LPSiNPs) that can carry a drug payload and of which the intrinsic near-infrared photoluminescence enables monitoring of both accumulation and degradation in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to most optically active nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles and quantum dots), LPSiNPs self-destruct in a mouse model into renally cleared components in a relatively short period of time with no evidence of toxicity. As a preliminary in vivo application, we demonstrate tumour imaging using dextran-coated LPSiNPs (D-LPSiNPs).

J,"Nicolis, A; Rattazzi, R; Trincherini, E",Galileon as a local modification of gravity,"In the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, the ""self-accelerating"" solution is plagued by a ghost instability, which makes the solution untenable. This fact, as well as all interesting departures from general relativity (GR), are fully captured by a four-dimensional effective Lagrangian, valid at distances smaller than the present Hubble scale. The 4D effective theory involves a relativistic scalar pi, universally coupled to matter and with peculiar derivative self-interactions. In this paper, we study the connection between self-acceleration and the presence of ghosts for a quite generic class of theories that modify gravity in the infrared. These theories are defined as those that at distances shorter than cosmological, reduce to a certain generalization of the DGP 4D effective theory. We argue that for infrared modifications of GR locally due to a universally coupled scalar, our generalization is the only one that allows for a robust implementation of the Vainshtein effect-the decoupling of the scalar from matter in gravitationally bound systems-necessary to recover agreement with solar-system tests. Our generalization involves an internal Galilean invariance, under which pi's gradient shifts by a constant. This symmetry constrains the structure of the pi Lagrangian so much so that in 4D there exist only five terms that can yield sizable nonlinearities without introducing ghosts. We show that for such theories in fact there are ""self-accelerating"" de Sitter solutions with no ghostlike instabilities. In the presence of compact sources, these solutions can support spherically symmetric, Vainshtein-like nonlinear perturbations that are also stable against small fluctuations. We investigate a possible infrared completion of these theories at scales of order of the Hubble horizon, and larger. There are however some features of our theories that may constitute a problem at the theoretical or phenomenological level: the presence of superluminal excitations; the extreme subluminality of other excitations, which makes the quasistatic approximation for certain solar-system observables unreliable due to Cherenkov emission; the very low strong-interaction scale for pi pi scatterings.",10.1103/PhysRevD.79.064036,642,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,,,

This serves as the basis to compute the fraction of each grid volume that belongs to a basin (Bader volume) and as a weight for the discrete integration of functions over the Bader volume. Compared with other grid-based algorithms, our approach is robust, more computationally efficient with linear computational effort, accurate, and has quadratic convergence. Moreover, it is straightforward to extend to nonuniform grids, such as from a mesh-refinement approach, and can be used to both identify basins of attraction of fixed points and integrate functions over the basins.

At liquid helium temperature in undoped crystals the neutral donor bound excitons dominate in the PL spectrum. Two electron satellite transitions (TES) of the donor bound excitons allow to determine the donor binding energies ranging from 46 to 73 meV. These results are in line with the temperature dependent Hall effect measurements. In the as-grown crystals a shallow donor with an activation energy of 30 meV controls the conductivity. Annealing annihilates this shallow donor which has a bound exciton recombination at 3.3628 eV. Correlated by magnetic resonance experiments we attribute this particular donor to hydrogen. The Al, Ga and In donor bound exciton recombinations are identified based on doping and diffusion experiments and using secondary ion mass spectroscopy. We give a special focus on the recombination around 3.333 eV, i.e. about 50 meV below the free exciton transition. From temperature dependent measurements one obtains a small thermal activation energy for the quenching of the luminescence of 10 +/- 2 meV despite the large localization energy of 50 meV. Spatially resolved CL measurements show that the 3.333 eV lines are particularly strong at crystal irregularities and occur only at certain spots hence are not homogeneously distributed within the crystal contrary to the bound exciton recombinations. We attribute them to excitons bound to structural defects (Y-line defect) very common in II-VI semiconductors. For the bound exciton lines which seem to be correlated with Li and Na doping we offer a different interpretation. Li and Na do not introduce any shallow acceptor level in ZnO which otherwise should show up in donor-acceptor pair recombinations. Nitrogen creates a shallow acceptor level in ZnO. Donor-acceptor pair recombination with the 165 meV deep N-acceptor is found in nitrogen doped and implanted ZnO samples, respectively. In the best undoped samples excited rotational states of the donor bound excitons can be seen in low temperature PL measurements. At higher temperatures we also see the appearance of the excitons bound to the B-valence band, which are approximately 4.7 meV higher in energy. (C) 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy sources covering the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

J,"Guinea, F; Katsnelson, MI; Geim, AK",Energy gaps and a zero-field quantum Hall effect in graphene by strain engineering,"Among many remarkable qualities of graphene, its electronic properties attract particular interest owing to the chiral character of the charge carriers, which leads to such unusual phenomena as metallic conductivity in the limit of no carriers and the half-integer quantum Hall effect observable even at room temperature(1-3). Because graphene is only one atom thick, it is also amenable to external influences, including mechanical deformation. The latter offers a tempting prospect of controlling graphene's properties by strain and, recently, several reports have examined graphene under uniaxial deformation(4-8). Although the strain can induce additional Raman features(7,8), no significant changes in graphene's band structure have been either observed or expected for realistic strains of up to similar to 15% (refs 9-11). Here we show that a designed strain aligned along three main crystallographic directions induces strong gauge fields(12-14) that effectively act as a uniform magnetic field exceeding 10 T. For a finite doping, the quantizing field results in an insulating bulk and a pair of countercirculating edge states, similar to the case of a topological insulator(15-20). We suggest realistic ways of creating this quantum state and observing the pseudomagnetic quantum Hall effect.

In the presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically nonequilibrium nature. A rich variety of recently observed photon hydrodynamical effects is presented, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While the review is mostly focused on a specific class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of the article is devoted to a review of the future perspectives in the direction of strongly correlated photon gases and of artificial gauge fields for photons.

These elements are implemented using the TcI scripting language to ensure a minimum of programming overhead and direct interpretation without the need for compilation, while maintaining the flexibility of a full-featured programming language. Basicly, there are no intrinsic limitations to the number of spins, types of interactions, sample conditions (static or spinning, powders, uniaxially oriented molecules, single crystals, or solutions), and the complexity or number of spectral dimensions for the pulse sequence. The applicability ranges from simple 1D experiments to advanced multiple-pulse and multiple-dimensional experiments, series of simulations, parameter scans, complex data manipulation/visualization, and iterative fitting of simulated to experimental spectra.

Our proposal can be implemented with standard optical components with low detection efficiency and highly lossy channels. In contrast to the previous solution of full device independent QKD, the realization of our idea does not require detectors of near unity detection efficiency in combination with a qubit amplifier (based on teleportation) or a quantum nondemolition measurement of the number of photons in a pulse.

The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations.

J,"Peres, NMR; Guinea, F; Castro Neto, AH",Electronic properties of disordered two-dimensional carbon,"Two-dimensional carbon, or graphene, is a semimetal that presents unusual low-energy electronic excitations described in terms of Dirac fermions. We analyze in a self-consistent way the effects of localized (impurities or vacancies) and extended (edges or grain boundaries) defects on the electronic and transport properties of graphene. On the one hand, point defects induce a finite elastic lifetime at low energies with the enhancement of the electronic density of states close to the Fermi level. Localized disorder leads to a universal, disorder independent, electrical conductivity at low temperatures, of the order of the quantum of conductance. The static conductivity increases with temperature and shows oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field. The graphene magnetic susceptibility is temperature dependent (unlike an ordinary metal) and also increases with the amount of defects. Optical transport properties are also calculated in detail. On the other hand, extended defects induce localized states near the Fermi level. In the absence of electron-hole symmetry, these states lead to a transfer of charge between the defects and the bulk, the phenomenon we call self-doping. The role of electron-electron interactions in controlling self-doping is also analyzed. We also discuss the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene, the role played by the edge states induced by a magnetic field, and their relation to the almost field independent surface states induced at boundaries.

Among the particles tested, ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) and cationic PS nanospheres were capable of inducing cellular ROS production, GSH depletion, and toxic oxidative stress. This toxicity involves mitochondrial injury through increased calcium uptake and structural organellar damage.

In addition to graphene, the most studied 2D material, monolayers of other layered materials such as semiconducting dichalcogenides MoS2 or WSe2 are gaining in importance as promising channel materials for field-effect transistors (FETs). The presence of a direct bandgap in monolayer MoS2 due to quantum-mechanical confinement allows room-temperature FETs with an on/off ratio exceeding 10(8). The presence of high-kappa dielectrics in these devices enhanced their mobility, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report on electrical transport measurements on MoS2 FETs in different dielectric configurations. The dependence of mobility on temperature shows clear evidence of the strong suppression of charged-impurity scattering in dual-gate devices with a top-gate dielectric. At the same time, phonon scattering shows a weaker than expected temperature dependence. High levels of doping achieved in dual-gate devices also allow the observation of a metal-insulator transition in monolayer MoS2 due to strong electron-electron interactions. Our work opens up the way to further improvements in 2D semiconductor performance and introduces MoS2 as an interesting system for studying correlation effects in mesoscopic systems.",10.1038/NMAT3687,701,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The key concept is to describe the excitations of the electronic system by the corresponding one- and two-particle Green's function. The method combines three computational techniques. First, the electronic ground state is treated within density-functional theory. Second, the single particle spectrum of the electrons and holes is obtained within the GW approximation to the electron self-energy operator. Finally, the electron-hole interaction is calculated and a Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved, yielding the coupled electron-hole excitations. The resulting solutions allow the calculation of the entire optical spectrum. This holds both for bound excitonic states below the band gap, as well as for the resonant spectrum above the band gap. We discuss a number of technical developments needed for the application of the method to real systems. To illustrate the approach, we discuss the excitations and optical spectra of spatially isolated systems (atoms, molecules, and semiconductor clusters) and of extended, periodic crystals (semiconductors and insulators).",10.1103/PhysRevB.62.4927,703,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,

We discuss the ground-state finite-size scaling properties of three different quantities-the Binder moment ratio, the spin stiffness, and the long-wavelength magnetic susceptibility-which we use to extract the critical value of the coupling ratio g=J(perpendicular to)/J. The individual estimates of g(c) are consistent provided that subleading finite-size corrections are properly taken into account. For both models, we find that the spin stiffness has the smallest subleading finite-size corrections; in the case of the incomplete bilayer we find that the first subleading correction vanishes or is extremely small. In agreement with predictions, we find that at the critical point the Binder ratio has a universal value and the product of the spin stiffness and the long-wavelength susceptibility scales as 1/L-2 with a universal prefactor. Our results for the critical coupling ratios are g(c)=2.5220(1) (full bilayer) and g(c)=1.3888(1) (incomplete bilayer), which represent improvements of more than an order of magnitude over the previous best estimates.

The NGO is functionalized with sulfonic acid groups, which render it stable in physiological solution, followed by covalent binding of folic acid (FA) molecules to the NGO, thus allowing it to specifically target MCF-7 cells, human breast cancer cells with FA receptors. Furthermore, controlled loading of two anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CPT), onto the FA-conjugated NGO (FA-NGO) via pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions is investigated. It is demonstrated that FA-NGO loaded with the two anticancer drugs shows specific targeting to MCF-7 cells, and remarkably high cytotoxicity compared to NGO loaded with either DOX or CPT only. Considering that the combined use of two or more drugs, a widely adopted clinical practice, often displays much better therapeutic efficacy than that of a single drug, the controlled loading and targeted delivery of mixed anticancer drugs using these graphene-based nanocarriers may find widespread application in biomedicine.",10.1002/smll.200901680,711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Delley, B",Hardness conserving semilocal pseudopotentials,"A new type of pseudopotentials for local orbital methods is presented. Hardness conserving semilocal pseudopotentials have been generated for all elements from H to Am. The construction is based on a minimization of errors with the norm conservation conditions for 2-3 relevant ionic configurations of the atom. Besides the transferability between atomic states, the portability among density functionals is also of interest. This paper explores if the norm-conservation errors can be kept reasonably small when minimized for two functionals, e.g., the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and local density approximation, simultaneously. It is found that the errors can be kept at roughly the same low level as for a single functional. Since these pseudopotentials are mainly designed for use with local orbital methods, semicore functions may be treated as valence functions, helping to increase the accuracy and portability. Therefore the name density functional semicore pseudopotential or DSPP is suggested. To further improve portability and, importantly, also aid numerical stability with GGA's, a core density (nonlinear core correction) is used. As with other pseudopotentials, scalar relativistic corrections to atomic scattering properties can easily be incorporated into this PP. Finally performance DSPP's versus all electron DSPP's with the same method, will be shown for an extensive set of test calculations.

J,"Aurbach, D; Zinigrad, E; Cohen, Y; Teller, H",A short review of failure mechanisms of lithium metal and lithiated graphite anodes in liquid electrolyte solutions,"Li electrodes in any relevant electrolyte solution (i.e., polar aprotic) are covered by surface films of a very complicated structure. It was found that even in cases where the surface films formed on lithium contain elastomers, or where the lithium metal reactivity is reduced by doping with elements such as N, As, Al, Mg, Ca, etc., it is impossible to achieve sufficient passivation with lithium electrodes and liquid solutions. Passivation is considerably worsened when Li electrodes are operated at high rates (especially at high charging, Li deposition rates). Thus, there is no way that rechargeable Li batteries can compete with Li-ion batteries in any application that requires high charging rates (e.g., in powering portable electronic devices). The electrochemical behavior of lithiated graphite electrodes also depends on passivation phenomena. The surface films formed on lithiated graphite are similar to those formed on Li metal in the same solutions. The volume changes of graphite electrodes during Li insertion-deinsertion are small enough to enable their reasonable passivation in a variety of electrolyte solutions. A critical factor that determines the stability of graphite electrodes is their morphology. It was found that the shape of graphite particles plays a key role in their application as active mass in anodes for Li-ion batteries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

These modes, referred to as Koopman modes, are associated with a particular observable, and may be determined directly from data (either numerical or experimental) using a variant of a standard Arnoldi method. They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid & Sesterhenn (Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes.

We consider ribbons with different edge nature including bare and hydrogen-terminated ribbons, several crystallographic orientations, and widths up to 3 nm. Our results can be extrapolated to wider ribbons providing a qualitative way of determining the electronic properties of ribbons with widths of practical significance. We predict that in order to produce materials with band gaps similar to Ge or InN, the width of the ribbons must be between 2 and 3 nm. If larger bang gap ribbons are needed (like Si, InP, or GaAs), their width must be reduced to 1-2 nm. According to the extrapolated inverse power law obtained in this work, armchair carbon nanoribbons of widths larger than 8 nm will present a maximum band gap of 0.3 eV, while for ribbons with a width of 80 nm the maximum possible band gap is 0.05 eV. For chiral nanoribbons the band gap oscillations rapidly vanish as a function of the chiral angle indicating that a careful design of their crystallographic nature is an essential ingredient for controlling their electronic properties.

According to the so-called Mermin-Wagner theorem(1), long-wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order of 2D crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be crumpled(2). These fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes meaning that a 2D membrane can exist but will exhibit strong height fluctuations(2-4). The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal(5,6), and the recent experimental observation of ripples in suspended graphene(7) make these issues especially important. Besides the academic interest, understanding the mechanisms of the stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic transport in this material that is attracting so much interest owing to its unusual Dirac spectrum and electronic properties(8-11). We address the nature of these height fluctuations by means of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for carbon(12).

In this paper, the two-dimensional chaotic cat map is generalized to 3D for designing a real-time secure symmetric encryption scheme. This new scheme employs the 3D cat map to shuffle the positions (and, if desired, grey values as well) of image pixels and uses another chaotic map to confuse the relationship between the cipher-image and the plain-image, thereby significantly increasing the resistance to statistical and differential attacks.

By carefully comparing the convergence behavior of D-e(O-2) and D-e(SO), we show that the cause of these errors is a result of two inter-related problems: near duplication of the exponents in two of the d sets and a lack of high-exponent functions in the early members of the sets. Similar problems exist for the f sets (and probably in higher angular momentum sets), but have only a minor effect on the calculated dissociation energies. A number of approaches to address the problems in the d sets were investigated. Well behaved convergence was obtained by augmenting the (1d) and (2d) sets with a high-exponent function and by replacing the (3d) set by the (4d) set and the (4d) set by the (5d) set and so on.

This agreement requires that the galactic halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high curvature in the presence of the low-curvature cosmological background. If the galactic halo and local environment in f(R) models do not have substantially deeper potentials than expected in Lambda CDM, then cosmological field amplitudes \f(R)\greater than or similar to 10(-6) will cause the galactic interior to evolve to low curvature during the acceleration epoch. Viability of large-deviation models therefore rests on the structure and evolution of the galactic halo, requiring cosmological simulations of f(R) models, and not directly on solar-system tests. Even small deviations that conservatively satisfy both galactic and solar-system constraints can still be tested by future, percent-level measurements of the linear power spectrum, while they remain undetectable to cosmological-distance measures. Although we illustrate these effects in a specific class of models, the requirements on f(R) are phrased in a nearly model-independent manner.",10.1103/PhysRevD.76.064004,748,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Although the capability and feasibility of this method have been successfully illustrated with the production of silver nanowires 30-60 nm in diameter and 1-50 mum in length, the growth mechanism of this process is yet to be elucidated. Here we report some progress on this matter: First, electron microscopy studies on microtomed samples indicated that the cross sections of such silver nanowires had a pentagonal shape, together with a 5-fold twinned crystal structure. Second, the side surfaces (bounded by {100} facets) and the ends (bounded by {111} facets) of each nanowire were shown to have significant difference in reactivity toward dithoil molecules, with the side surfaces being completely passivated by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and the ends being partially passivated (or essentially uncovered) by PVP. This result implied that the PVP macromolecules interacted more strongly with the {100} planes than with the {111} planes of silver. On the basis of these new results, we proposed that each silver nanowire evolved from a multiply twinned nanoparticle (MTP) of silver with the assistance of PVP at the initial stage of the Ostwald ripening process. The anisotropic growth was maintained by selectively covering the {100} facets with PVP while leaving the {111} facets largely uncovered by PVP and thus highly reactive.",10.1021/nl034312m,752,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

Thermoelectric materials are being investigated for electricity production from waste heat (co-generation) and natural heat sources. For temperatures below 200 degrees C, the best commercially available inorganic semiconductors are bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3)-based alloys, which possess a figure of merit ZT close to one(1). Most of the recently discovered thermoelectric materials with ZT > 2 exhibit one common property, namely their low lattice thermal conductivities(2,3). Nevertheless, a high ZT value is not enough to create a viable technology platform for energy harvesting. To generate electricity from large volumes of warm fluids, heat exchangers must be functionalized with TEGs. This requires thermoelectric materials that are readily synthesized, air stable, environmentally friendly and solution processable to create patterns on large areas. Here we show that conducting polymers might be capable of meeting these demands. The accurate control of the oxidation level in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) combined with its low intrinsic thermal conductivity (lambda = D 0.37W m(-1) K-1) yields a ZT = 0.25 at room temperature that approaches the values required for efficient devices.",10.1038/NMAT3012,755,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemistry of the samples is characterized using elemental analysis, Boehm titration, potentiometric titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

The results show that the surface chemistry is affected by the type of nitrogen precursor and the specific groups present on the surface before the treatment leading to the incorporation of nitrogen.

The data are used to search for the Standard Model Higgs boson. The search results of the four Collaborations are combined and examined in a likelihood test for their consistency with two hypotheses: the background hypothesis and the signal plus background hypothesis. The corresponding confidences have been computed as functions of the hypothetical Higgs boson mass. A lower bound of 114.4 GeV/c(2) is established, at the 95% confidence level, on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson. The LEP data are also used to set upper bounds on the HZZ coupling for various assumptions concerning the decay of the Higgs boson. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Regal, CA; Greiner, M; Jin, DS",Observation of resonance condensation of fermionic atom pairs,"We have observed condensation of fermionic atom pairs in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. A trapped gas of fermionic K-40 atoms is evaporatively cooled to quantum degeneracy and then a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance is used to control the atom-atom interactions. The location of this resonance is precisely determined from low-density measurements of molecule dissociation. In order to search for condensation on either side of the resonance, we introduce a technique that pairwise projects fermionic atoms onto molecules; this enables us to measure the momentum distribution of fermionic atom pairs. The transition to condensation of fermionic atom pairs is mapped out as a function of the initial atom gas temperature T compared to the Fermi temperature T-F for magnetic-field detunings on both the BCS and BEC sides of the resonance.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.040403,774,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes
J,"Amendola, L",Coupled quintessence,"A new component of the cosmic medium, a light scalar field or ""quintessence,"" has been proposed recently to explain cosmic acceleration with a dynamical cosmological constant. Such a field is expected to be coupled explicitly to ordinary matter, unless some unknown symmetry prevents it. I investigate the cosmological consequences of a coupled quintessence (CQ) model, assuming an exponential potential and a linear coupling. This model is conformally equivalent to Brans-Dicke Lagrangians with any power-law potential. I evaluate the density perturbations on the cosmic microwave background and on the galaxy distribution at the present and derive bounds on the coupling constant from the comparison with observational data. A novel feature of CQ is that during the matter dominated era the scalar field has a finite and almost constant energy density. This epoch, denoted as phi MDE, is a saddle point in the dynamical phase space. The phi MDE is responsible of several differences with respect to uncoupled quintessence: the multipole spectrum of the microwave background is tilted at large angles, the acoustic peaks are shifted, their amplitude is changed, and the present 8 Mpc/h density variance is diminished. The present data constrain the dimensionless coupling constant to \beta\less than or equal to 0.1 assuming Omega(m)=0.3 and a primordial fluctuation slope n(s)=1.",10.1103/PhysRevD.62.043511,775,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes
J,"Halim, J; Cook, KM; Naguib, M; Eklund, P; Gogotsi, Y; Rosen, J; Barsoum, MW",X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of select multi-layered transition metal carbides (MXenes),"In this work, a detailed high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is presented for select MXenes a recently discovered family of two-dimensional (2D) carbides and carbonitrides. Given their 2D nature, understanding their surface chemistry is paramount. Herein we identify and quantify the surface groups present before, and after, sputter-cleaning as well as freshly prepared vs. aged multi layered cold pressed discs. The nominal compositions of the MXenes studied here are Ti-3 C2Tx,Ti3CNTx, Nb2CTx and Nb4C3Tx where T represents surface groups that this work attempts to quantify. In all the cases, the presence of three surface terminations, O, OH and F, in addition to OH-terminations relatively strongly bonded to H2O molecules, was confirmed. From XPS peak fits, it was possible to establish the average sum of the negative charges of the terminations for the aforementioned MXenes. Based on this work, it is now possible to quantify the nature of the surface terminations.

The path integrals over the Levy paths are defined and fractional quantum and statistical mechanics have been developed via new fractional path integrals approach. A fractional generalization of the Schrodinger equation has been found. The new relation between the energy and the momentum of non-relativistic fractional quantum-mechanical particle has been established. We have derived a free particle quantum-mechanical kernel using Fox's H-function. The equation for the fractional plane wave function has been obtained.

Laboratory experiments with acid brown 14 as the model pollutant have been carried out to evaluate the performance of both ZnO and TiO2 catalysts. Solar light was used as the energy source for the photocatalytic experiments, These catalysts were examined for surface area, particle size and crystallinity. The effect of initial dye concentration, catalyst loading, irradiation time, pH, adsorption of acid brown 14 on ZnO and TiO2 intensity of light and comparison of photocatalytic activity with different commercial catalysts were Studied. The progress of photocatalytic degradation of the acid brown 14 has been observed by monitoring the change in substrate concentration of the model compound employing HPLC and measuring the absorbance in UV-Visible spectrophotometer for decolourisation. The photodegradation rate was determined for each experiment and the highest values were observed for ZnO suggesting that it absorbs large fraction of the solar spectrum and absorption of more light quanta than TiO2 The complete mineralisation was confirmed by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, COD measurement and estimation of the formation of inorganic ions such as NH4+, NO3, Cl- and SO42-.

They differ by the degree of contraction of the outer-space perturbers. Two types of zero-order Hamiltonians are proposed, both are bielectronic, incorporating the interactions between electrons in the active orbitals, therefore introducing a rational balance between the zero-order wave function and the outer-space. The use of Dyall's Hamiltonian, which puts the active electrons in a fixed core field, and of a partially contracted formalism seems a promising compromise. The formalism is generalizable to multireference spaces which are parts of a GAS. A few test applications of the simplest variant developed in this paper illustrate its potentialities.

J,"Rappoport, D; Furche, F",Property-optimized Gaussian basis sets for molecular response calculations,"With recent advances in electronic structure methods, first-principles calculations of electronic response properties, such as linear and nonlinear polarizabilities, have become possible for molecules with more than 100 atoms. Basis set incompleteness is typically the main source of error in such calculations since traditional diffuse augmented basis sets are too costly to use or suffer from near linear dependence. To address this problem, we construct the first comprehensive set of property-optimized augmented basis sets for elements H-Rn except lanthanides. The new basis sets build on the Karlsruhe segmented contracted basis sets of split-valence to quadruple-zeta valence quality and add a small number of moderately diffuse basis functions. The exponents are determined variationally by maximization of atomic Hartree-Fock polarizabilities using analytical derivative methods. The performance of the resulting basis sets is assessed using a set of 313 molecular static Hartree-Fock polarizabilities. The mean absolute basis set errors are 3.6%, 1.1%, and 0.3% for property-optimized basis sets of split-valence, triple-zeta, and quadruple-zeta valence quality, respectively. Density functional and second-order Moller-Plesset polarizabilities show similar basis set convergence. We demonstrate the efficiency of our basis sets by computing static polarizabilities of icosahedral fullerenes up to C-720 using hybrid density functional theory.

One of the main factors that has hampered widespread practical use of DSC is the poor thermostability encountered so far with these devices. Here we show a DSC with unprecedented stable performance under both thermal stress and soaking with light, matching the durability criteria applied to silicon solar cells for outdoor applications. The cell uses the amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizer cis-RuLL'(SCN)(2) (L = 4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine, L' = 4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine) in conjunction with a quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte, reaching an efficiency of >6% in full sunlight (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm(-2)). A convenient and versatile new route is reported for the synthesis of the heteroleptic ruthenium complex, which plays a key role in achieving the high-temperature stability. Ultramicroelectrode voltammetric measurements show that the triiodide/iodide couple can perform charge transport freely in the polymer gel. The cell sustained heating for 1,000 h at 80 degreesC, maintaining 94% of its initial performance.

A consistent physical theory of quantum mechanics can be built on a complex Hamiltonian that is not Hermitian but satisfies the less restrictive and more physical condition of space-time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry). One might expect a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to lead to a violation of unitarity. However, if PT symmetry is not spontaneously broken, it is possible to construct a previously unnoticed symmetry C of the Hamiltonian. Using C, an inner product whose associated norm is positive definite can be constructed. The procedure is general and works for any PT-symmetric Hamiltonian.

J,"Kim, HS; Gibbs, ZM; Tang, YL; Wang, H; Snyder, GJ",Characterization of Lorenz number with Seebeck coefficient measurement,"In analyzing zT improvements due to lattice thermal conductivity (kappa(L)) reduction, electrical conductivity (sigma) and total thermal conductivity (kappa(Total)) are often used to estimate the electronic component of the thermal conductivity (kappa(E)) and in turn kappa(L) from kappa(L) = similar to kappa(Total) - L sigma T. TheWiedemann-Franz law, kappa(E) = L sigma T, where L is Lorenz number, is widely used to estimate kappa(E) from sigma measurements. It is a common practice to treat L as a universal factor with 2.44 x 10(-8) W Omega K-2 (degenerate limit). However, significant deviations from the degenerate limit (approximately 40% or more for Kane bands) are known to occur for non-degenerate semiconductors where L converges to 1.5 x 10(-8) W Omega K-2 for acoustic phonon scattering. The decrease in L is correlated with an increase in thermopower (absolute value of Seebeck coefficient (S)). Thus, a first order correction to the degenerate limit of L can be based on the measured thermopower, vertical bar S vertical bar, independent of temperature or doping. We propose the equation: L = 1.5 + exp [ -vertical bar S vertical bar/116] (where L is in 10(-8) W Omega K-2 and S in mu V/K) as a satisfactory approximation for L. This equation is accurate within 5% for single parabolic band/acoustic phonon scattering assumption and within 20% for PbSe, PbS, PbTe, Si0.8Ge0.2 where more complexity is introduced, such as non-parabolic Kane bands, multiple bands, and/or alternate scattering mechanisms. The use of this equation for L rather than a constant value (when detailed band structure and scattering mechanism is not known) will significantly improve the estimation of lattice thermal conductivity.

J,"Handy, NC; Cohen, AJ",Left-right correlation energy,"We first attempt to determine a local exchange functional E-x[rho] which accurately reproduces the Hartree-Fock (HF) energies of the 18 first and second row atoms. E-x[rho] is determined from rho and \del rho\, and we rnd that we can improve significantly upon Becke's original generalized gradient approximation functional (commonly called B88X) by allowing the coefficient of the Dirac exchange term to be optimized (it is argued that molecules do not behave like the uniform electron gas). We call this new two parameter exchange functional OPTX. We rnd that neither del (2) rho or tau = Sigma\del phi (i)\(2) improve the fit to these atomic energies. These exchange functionals include not only exchange, but also left-right correlation. It is therefore proposed that this functional provides a definition for exchange energy plus left-right correlation energy when used in Kohn-Sham (KS) calculations. We call this energy the Kohn-Sham exchange (or KSX) energy. It is shown that for nearly all molecules studied these KSX energies are lower than the corresponding HF energies, thus giving values for the non-dynamic correlation energy. At stretched geometries, the KSX energies are always lower than the HF energies, and often substantially so. Furthermore all bond lengths from the KSX calculations are longer than HF bond lengths and experimental bond lengths, which again demonstrates the inclusion of left-right correlation effects in the functional. For these reasons we prefer to split the correlation energy into two parts: left-right correlation energy and dynamic correlation energy, arguing that the usage of the words 'non-dynamic' or 'static' or 'near-degeneracy' is less meaningful. We recognize that this definition of KSX is not precise, because the definition of a local E-x[rho] can never be precise. We also recognize that these ideas are not new, but we think that their importance has been insufficiently recognized in functional determination. When we include third row atoms in our analysis, we are unable to rnd a local exchange functional which is a substantial improvement over B88X for the reproduction of HF energies. This must arise from the effects of the core orbitals, and therefore we do not consider that this detracts from the improved accuracy of OPTX. We report some MCSCF calculations constructed from bonding-antibonding configurations, from which we attempt to calculate ab initio left-right correlation. There is only moderate agreement between the two approaches. Finally we combine the OPTX functional with established correlation functionals (LYP, P86, P91) to form OLYP, OP86 and OP91; OLYP is a great improvement on BLYP for both energy and structure, and OP86, OP91 are an improvement over BP86, BP91 for structure.

There are two inequivalent Dirac points in the Brillouin zone, related by time-reversal symmetry. Intervalley scattering is suppressed in pure samples(3-5). The independence and degeneracy of the valley degree of freedom suggests that it might be used to control an electronic device(6), in much the same way as the electron spin is used in spintronics(7) or quantum computing(8). A key ingredient for 'valleytronics' would be a controllable way of occupying a single valley in graphene, thereby producing a valley polarization.

Here, we report on the realization of a Nb-InSb nanowire-Nb hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap Delta(InSb) similar to 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value, at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is E-z similar to Delta(Insb), is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the InSb nanowire.",10.1021/nl303758w,800,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

One way to further reduce costs is to integrate (part of) the display drive circuitry, such as row shift registers, directly on the display substrate.

J,"Kirilyuk, A; Kimel, AV; Rasing, T",Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic order,"The interaction of subpicosecond laser pulses with magnetically ordered materials has developed into a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. From the discovery of subpicosecond demagnetization over a decade ago to the recent demonstration of magnetization reversal by a single 40 fs laser pulse, the manipulation of magnetic order by ultrashort laser pulses has become a fundamentally challenging topic with a potentially high impact for future spintronics, data storage and manipulation, and quantum computation. Understanding the underlying mechanisms implies understanding the interaction of photons with charges, spins, and lattice, and the angular momentum transfer between them. This paper will review the progress in this field of laser manipulation of magnetic order in a systematic way. Starting with a historical introduction, the interaction of light with magnetically ordered matter is discussed. By investigating metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics, the roles of (nearly) free electrons, charge redistributions, and spin-orbit and spin-lattice interactions can partly be separated, and effects due to heating can be distinguished from those that are not. It will be shown that there is a fundamental distinction between processes that involve the actual absorption of photons and those that do not. It turns out that for the latter, the polarization of light plays an essential role in the manipulation of the magnetic moments at the femtosecond time scale. Thus, circularly and linearly polarized pulses are shown to act as strong transient magnetic field pulses originating from the nonabsorptive inverse Faraday and inverse Cotton-Mouton effects, respectively. The recent progress in the understanding of magneto-optical effects on the femtosecond time scale together with the mentioned inverse, optomagnetic effects promises a bright future for this field of ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic order or femtomagnetism.",10.1103/RevModPhys.82.2731,807,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes

More interestingly, a much enhanced EMI-shielding effectiveness of approximate to 70 dB is achieved for the lightweight MXene foam as compared to its unfoamed film counterpart (53 dB) due to the highly efficient wave attenuation in the favorable porous structure.

The constants in the LJ potential are different for graphene-graphene and C-60-C-60 interactions. From these, the constants for tube-C-60 interactions were estimated using averaging rules from the theory of dispersion forces. For tubes in ropes, the cohesive energy per unit length, the compressibility, and the equilibrium separation distance were computed as a function of tube radius. For a C-60 molecule interacting with tubes, the binding energy inside a tube was much higher than on a tube or at the tube mouth. Within a tube, the binding energy was highest at a spherically capped end. The potential energies for tubes of all radii, as well as for interactions between C-60 molecules, for a C-60 molecule outside of a nanotube, between a C-60 molecule and a graphene sheet, and between graphene sheets, all fell on the same curve when plotted in terms of certain reduced parameters.

However, many present high-ZT materials are based on low-abundance elements that pose challenges for scale-up, as they entail high material costs in addition to brittleness and difficulty in large-area deposition. Here we demonstrate a strategy to improve ZT in conductive polymers and other organic semiconductors (OSCs) for which the base elements are earth-abundant.

We develop a method for obtaining the thermochemistry of the electrochemical water splitting process as a function of the bias directly from the electronic structure calculations. We consider electrodes of Pt(111) and Au(111) in detail and then discuss trends for a series of different metals. We show that the difficult step in the water splitting process is the formation of superoxy-type (OOH) species on the surface by the splitting of a water molecule on top an adsorbed oxygen atom. One conclusion is that this is only possible on metal surfaces that are (partly) oxidized. We show that the binding energies of the different intermediates are linearly correlated for a number of metals. In a simple analysis, where the linear relations are assumed to be obeyed exactly, this leads to a universal relationship between the catalytic rate and the oxygen binding energy. Finally, we conclude that for systems obeying these relations, there is a limit to how good a water splitting catalyst an oxidized metal surface can become. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Jaguar focuses on computational methods with reasonable computational scaling with the size of the system, such as density functional theory (DFT) and local second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory. The favorable scaling of the methods and the high efficiency of the program make it possible to conduct routine computations involving several thousand molecular orbitals. This performance is achieved through a utilization of the pseudospectral approximation and several levels of parallelization. The speed advantages are beneficial for applying Jaguar in biomolecular computational modeling. Additionally, owing to its superior wave function guess for transition-metal-containing systems, Jaguar finds applications in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry. The emphasis on larger systems and transition metal elements paves the way toward developing Jaguar for its use in materials science modeling. The article describes the historical and new features of Jaguar, such as improved parallelization of many modules, innovations in ab initio pKa prediction, and new semiempirical corrections for nondynamic correlation errors in DFT. Jaguar applications in drug discovery, materials science, force field parameterization, and other areas of computational research are reviewed.

J,"Sheppard, D; Terrell, R; Henkelman, G",Optimization methods for finding minimum energy paths,"A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum energy pathways (MEPs) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).

However its initial formulation, denoted DES97 from here on, can exhibit an incorrect behavior in thick boundary layers and shallow separation regions. This behavior begins when the grid spacing parallel to the wall Delta(parallel to) becomes less than the boundary-layer thickness delta, either through grid refinement or boundary-layer thickening. The grid spacing is then fine enough for the DES length scale to follow the LES branch (and therefore lower the eddy viscosity below the RANS level), but resolved Reynolds stresses deriving from velocity fluctuations (""LES content"") have not replaced the modeled Reynolds stresses. LES content may be lacking because the resolution is not fine enough to fully support it, and/or because of delays in its generation by instabilities.

For some research studies in small domains, Delta(parallel to) is made much smaller than delta, and LES content is generated intentionally. However for natural DES applications in useful domains, it is preferable to over-ride the DES limiter and maintain RANS behavior in boundary layers, independent of Delta(parallel to) relative to delta. For this purpose, a new version of the technique - referred to as DDES, for Delayed DES - is presented which is based on a simple modification to DES97, similar to one proposed by Menter and Kuntz for the shear-stress transport (SST) model, but applicable to other models. Tests in boundary layers, on a single and a multi-element airfoil, a cylinder, and a backward-facing step demonstrate that RANS function is indeed maintained in thick boundary layers, without preventing LES function after massive separation. The new formulation better fulfills the intent of DES. Two other issues are discussed: the use of DES as a wall model in LES of attached flows, in which the known log-layer mismatch is not resolved by DDES; and a correction that is helpful at low cell Reynolds numbers.",10.1007/s00162-006-0015-0,843,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that in these RTILs water molecules absorbed from the air are present mostly in the ""free"" (not self-associated) state, bound via H-bonding with [PF6](-), [BF4](-), [SbF6](-), [ClO4](-), [CF3SO3](-), [(CF3SO2)(2)N](-) with the concentrations of dissolved water in the range 0.2-1.0 mol dm(-3). It has been concluded that most of the water molecules at these concentrations exist in symmetric 1:2 type H-bonded complexes: anion . . . HOH . . . anion. Additional evidence that the preferred sites of interaction with water molecules are the anions has been obtained from the experiments with RTILs of the 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium and 1-butyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazolium cations. Water molecules can also form associated liquid-like formations in RTILs with anions of stronger basicity such as [NO3](-) and [CF3CO2](-). When these RTILs are exposed to air the water concentrations exceed 1.0 mol dm(-3). The strength of H-bonding between water molecules and anions increases in the order [PF6](-) <[SbF6](-) <[BF4](-) <[(CF3SO2)(2)N](-) <[ClO4](-) <[CF3SO3](-) <[NO3](-) <[CF3CO2](-).

The solitons were generated spontaneously when the laser frequency was tuned through the effective zero detuning point of a high-Q resonance, which led to an effective red-detuned pumping. Transition to soliton states were characterized by discontinuous steps in the resonator transmission. The solitons were stable in the long term and their number could be controlled via pump-laser detuning. These observations are in agreement with numerical simulations and soliton theory. Operating in the single-soliton regime allows the continuous output coupling of a femtosecond pulse train directly from the microresonator. This approach enables ultrashort pulse syntheses in spectral regimes in which broadband laser-gain media and saturable absorbers are not available.

The strengths of the interactions generally correlate well with the magnitudes of the positive and negative electrostatic potentials of the sigma-hole and the negative site.

Here we used carbon isotope labeling in conjunction with Raman spectroscopic mapping to track carbon during the growth process. The data clearly show that at high temperatures sequentially introduced isotopic carbon diffuses into the Ni first, mixes, and then segregates and precipitates at the surface of Ni forming graphene and/or graphite with a uniform mixture of C-12 and C-13 as determined by the peak position of the Raman G-band peak. On the other hand, graphene growth on Cu is clearly by surface adsorption where the spatial distribution of C-12 and C-13 follows the precursor time sequence and the linear growth rate ranges from about 1 to as high as 6 mu m/min depending upon Cu grain orientation.

J,"Arkani-Hamed, N; Finkbeiner, DP; Slatyer, TR; Weiner, N",A theory of dark matter,"We propose a comprehensive theory of dark matter that explains the recent proliferation of unexpected observations in high-energy astrophysics. Cosmic ray spectra from ATIC and PAMELA require a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle). with mass M-chi similar to 500-800 GeV that annihilates into leptons at a level well above that expected from a thermal relic. Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Limits on (p) over bar and pi(0)-gamma's constrain the hadronic channels allowed for dark matter. Taken together, we argue these facts imply the presence of a new force in the dark sector, with a Compton wavelength m(phi)(-1) less than or similar to 1 GeV-1. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the annihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak-scale annihilation cross section during dark matter freeze-out in the early universe. If the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier phi, its low mass can make hadronic modes kinematically inaccessible, forcing decays dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a non-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and splittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m(phi) similar to MeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to explain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the INTEGRAL satellite; the light boson invoked by XDM to mediate a large inelastic scattering cross section is identified with the phi here. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected, providing a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter (iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld enhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at redshift similar to 10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history of the universe. Because of the enhanced cross section, detection of substructure is more probable than with a conventional WIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way subhalos can increase the substructure annihilation signal by an additional order of magnitude or more.",10.1103/PhysRevD.79.015014,857,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The sensitivity indices are related to the decomposition of the variance of y into terms either due to each xi taken singularly (first order indices), as well as into terms due to the cooperative effects of more than one xi. In this paper we assume that one has computed the full set of first order sensitivity indices as well as the full set of total-order sensitivity indices (a fairly common strategy in sensitivity analysis), and show that in this case the same set of model evaluations can be used to compute double estimates of: the total effect of two factors taken to-ether, for all such ((k)(2)) couples, where k is the dimensionality of the model; the total effect of k - 2 factors taken together, for all ((k)(2)) such (k - 2) ples. We further introduce a new strategy for the computation of the full sets of first plus total order sensitivity indices that is about 50% cheaper in terms of model evaluations with respect to previously published works. We discuss separately the case where the input factors x(i)'s are not independent from each other. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In particular, fast-running synchrotron experiments require online data reduction and analysis in real time so that experimental parameters can be adjusted interactively.

Non-uniform metal deposition and dendrite formation on the negative electrode during repeated cycles of charge and discharge are major hurdles to commercialization of energy-storage devices based on each of these chemistries. A long-held view is that unstable electrodeposition is a consequence of inherent characteristics of these metals and their inability to form uniform electrodeposits on surfaces with inevitable defects. We report on electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolytes. We find that simple liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends exhibit stable long-term cycling at room temperature, often with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge and thousands of operating hours. We rationalize these observations with the help of surface energy data for the electrolyte/lithium interface and impedance analysis of the interface during different stages of cell operation. Our findings provide support for an important recent theoretical prediction that the surface mobility of lithium is significantly enhanced in the presence of lithium halide salts.

J,"Arvanitaki, A; Dimopoulos, S; Dubovsky, S; Kaloper, N; March-Russell, J",String axiverse,"String theory suggests the simultaneous presence of many ultralight axions, possibly populating each decade of mass down to the Hubble scale 10(-33) eV. Conversely the presence of such a plenitude of axions (an axiverse) would be evidence for string theory, since it arises due to the topological complexity of the extra-dimensional manifold and is ad hoc in a theory with just the four familiar dimensions. We investigate how several upcoming astrophysical experiments will be observationally exploring the possible existence of such axions over a vast mass range from 10(-33) eV to 10(-10) eV. Axions with masses between 10(-33) eV to 10(-28) eV can cause a rotation of the cosmic microwave background polarization that is constant throughout the sky. The predicted rotation angle is independent of the scale of inflation and the axion decay constant, and is of order alpha similar to 1/137 -within reach of the just launched Planck satellite. Axions in the mass range 10(-28) eV to 10(-18) eV give rise to multiple steps in the matter power spectrum, providing us with a snapshot of the axiverse that will be probed by galaxy surveys-such as BOSS, and 21 cm line tomography. Axions in the mass range 10(-22) eV to 10(-10) eV can affect the dynamics and gravitational wave emission of rapidly rotating astrophysical black holes through the Penrose superradiance process. When the axion Compton wavelength is of order of the black hole size, the axions develop superradiant atomic bound states around the black hole nucleus. Their occupation number grows exponentially by extracting rotational energy and angular momentum from the ergosphere, culminating in a rotating Bose-Einstein axion condensate emitting gravitational waves. For black holes lighter than similar to 10(7) solar masses accretion cannot replenish the spin of the black hole, creating mass gaps in the spectrum of rapidly rotating black holes that diagnose the presence of destabilizing axions. In particular, the highly rotating black hole in the X-ray binary LMC X-1 implies an upper limit on the decay constant of the QCD axion f(a) <= 2 X 10(17) GeV, much below the Planck mass. This reach can be improved down to the grand unification scale f(a) less than or similar to 2 X 10(16) GeV, by observing smaller stellar mass black holes.",10.1103/PhysRevD.81.123530,870,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Riplinger, C; Neese, F",An efficient and near linear scaling pair natural orbital based local coupled cluster method,"In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 10(5)-10(6) relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e. g., >100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below <0.05%, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD (""domain based LPNO-CCSD""). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured >8800 basis functions and >450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

The positive region on X corresponds to the electronically-depleted outer lobe of the half-filled p-type orbital of X that is involved in forming the covalent bond to R. This depletion is labeled a sigma-hole. The resulting positive electrostatic potential is along the extension of the R-X bond, which accounts for the directionality of halogen bonding. Positive sigma-holes can also be found on covalently-bonded Group IV-VI atoms, which can similarly interact electrostatically with negative sites. Since positive sigma-holes often exist in conjunction with negative potentials on other portions of the atom's surface, such atoms can interact electrostatically with both nucleophiles and electrophiles, as has been observed in surveys of crystallographic structures.

In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting ""universal"" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a ""plasmon ruler equation"" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band.

J,"Lim, CW; Zhang, G; Reddy, JN",A higher-order nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and its applications in wave propagation,"In recent years there have been many papers that considered the effects of material length scales in the study of mechanics of solids at micro- and/or nano-scales. There are a number of approaches and, among them, one set of papers deals with Eringen's differential nonlocal model and another deals with the strain gradient theories. The modified couple stress theory, which also accounts for a material length scale, is a form of a strain gradient theory. The large body of literature that has come into existence in the last several year has created significant confusion among researchers about the length scales that these various theories contain. The present paper has the objective of establishing the fact that the length scales present in nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory describe two entirely different physical characteristics of materials and structures at nanoscale. By using two principle kernel functions, the paper further presents a theory with application examples which relates the classical nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and it results in a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient theory. In this theory, a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient elasticity system which considers higher-order stress gradients and strain gradient nonlocality is proposed. It is based on the nonlocal effects of the strain field and first gradient strain field. This theory intends to generalize the classical nonlocal elasticity theory by introducing a higher-order strain tensor with nonlocality into the stored energy function. The theory is distinctive because the classical nonlocal stress theory does not include nonlocality of higher-order stresses while the common strain gradient theory only considers local higher-order strain gradients without nonlocal effects in a global sense. By establishing the constitutive relation within the thermodynamic framework, the governing equations of equilibrium and all boundary conditions are derived via the variational approach. Two additional kinds of parameters, the higher-order nonlocal parameters and the nonlocal gradient length coefficients are introduced to account for the size-dependent characteristics of nonlocal gradient materials at nanoscale. To illustrate its application values, the theory is applied for wave propagation in a nonlocal strain gradient system and the new dispersion relations derived are presented through examples for wave propagating in Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko nanobeams. The numerical results based on the new nonlocal strain gradient theory reveal some new findings with respect to lattice dynamics and wave propagation experiment that could not be matched by both the classical nonlocal stress model and the contemporary strain gradient theory. Thus, this higher-order nonlocal strain gradient model provides an explanation to some observations in the classical and nonlocal stress theories as well as the strain gradient theory in these aspects.

The solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the most exciting of these energy technologies; it is an all-ceramic device that operates at temperatures in the range 500-1,000degreesC. The SOFC offers certain advantages over lower temperature fuel cells, notably its ability to use carbon monoxide as a fuel rather than being poisoned by it, and the availability of high-grade exhaust heat for combined heat and power, or combined cycle gas-turbine applications. Although cost is clearly the most important barrier to widespread SOFC implementation, perhaps the most important technical barriers currently being addressed relate to the electrodes, particularly the fuel electrode or anode. In terms of mitigating global warming, the ability of the SOFC to use commonly available fuels at high efficiency, promises an effective and early reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and hence is one of the lead new technologies for improving the environment. Here, we discuss recent developments of SOFC fuel electrodes that will enable the better use of readily available fuels.",10.1038/nmat1040,887,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

J,"Fadlun, EA; Verzicco, R; Orlandi, P; Mohd-Yusof, J",Combined immersed-boundary finite-difference methods for three-dimensional complex flow simulations,"A second-order accurate, highly efficient method is developed for simulating unsteady three-dimensional incompressible flows in complex geometries. This is achieved by using boundary body forces that allow the imposition of the boundary conditions on a given surface not coinciding with the computational grid. The governing equations, therefore, can be discretized and solved on a regular mesh thus retaining the advantages and the efficiency of the standard solution procedures. Two different forcings are tested showing that while the quality of the results is essentially the same in both cases, the efficiency of the calculation strongly depends on the particular expression. A major issue is the interpolation of the forcing over the grid that determines the accuracy of the scheme; this ranges from zeroth-order for the most commonly used interpolations up to second-order for an ad hoc velocity interpolation. The present scheme has been used to simulate several hows whose results have been validated by experiments and other results available in the literature. Finally in the last example we show the flow inside an IC piston/cylinder assembly at high Reynolds number; to our knowledge this is the first example in which the immersed boundary technique is applied to a full three-dimensional complex how with moving boundaries and with a Reynolds number high enough to require a subgrid-scale turbulence model.

J,"Nakagawa, N; Hwang, HY; Muller, DA",Why some interfaces cannot be sharp,"A central goal of modern materials physics and nanoscience is the control of materials and their interfaces to atomic dimensions. For interfaces between polar and nonpolar layers, this goal is thwarted by a polar catastrophe that forces an interfacial reconstruction. In traditional semiconductors, this reconstruction is achieved by an atomic disordering and stoichiometry change at the interface, but a new option is available in multivalent oxides: if the electrons can move, the atoms do not have to. Using atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy, we have examined the microscopic distribution of charge and ions across the (001) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. We find that there is a fundamental asymmetry between the ionically compensated AlO2/SrO/TiO2 interface, and the electronically compensated AlO2/ LaO/TiO2 interface, both in interfacial sharpness and charge density. This suggests a general strategy to design sharp interfaces, remove interfacial screening charges, control the band offset and, hence, markedly improve the performance of oxide devices.",10.1038/nmat1569,896,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

J,"Zhang, XQ; Cheng, XB; Chen, X; Yan, C; Zhang, Q",Fluoroethylene Carbonate Additives to Render Uniform Li Deposits in Lithium Metal Batteries,"Lithium (Li) metal has been considered as an important substitute for the graphite anode to further boost the energy density of Li-ion batteries. However, Li dendrite growth during Li plating/stripping causes safety concern and poor lifespan of Li metal batteries (LMB). Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additives are used to form a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The FEC-induced SEI layer is compact and stable, and thus beneficial to obtain a uniform morphology of Li deposits. This uniform and dendrite-free morphology renders a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency of 98% within 100 cycles in a Li | Cu half-cell. When the FEC-protected Li metal anode matches a high-loading LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NMC) cathode (12 mg cm(-2)), a high initial capacity of 154 mAh g(-1) (1.9 mAh cm(-2)) at 180.0 mA g(-1) is obtained.

The prepared uGNMs show well packed layer structure formed by CCG sheets, as characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The performance of the uGNMs for water treatment was evaluated on a dead end filtration device and the pure water flux of uGNMs was high (21.8 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)). The uGNMs show high retention (>99%) for organic dyes and moderate retention (approximate to 20-60%) for ion salts. The rejection mechanism of this kind of negatively charged membranes is intensively studied, and the results reveal that physical sieving and electrostatic interaction dominate the rejection process. Because of the ultrathin nature of uGNMs, 34 mg of CCG is sufficient for making a square meter of nanofiltration membrane, indicating that this new generation graphene-based nanofiltration technology would be resource saving and cost-effective.

J,"Kurganov, A; Tadmor, E",New high-resolution central schemes for nonlinear conservation laws and convection-diffusion equations,"Central schemes may serve as universal finite-difference methods for solving nonlinear convection-diffusion equations in the sense that they are not tied to the specific eigenstructure of the problem, and hence can be implemented in a straightforward manner as black-box solvers for general conservation laws and related equations governing the spontaneous evolution of large gradient phenomena. The first-order Lax-Friedrichs scheme (P. D. Lax, 1954) is the forerunner for such central schemes. The central Nessyahu-Tadmor (NT) scheme (H. Nessyahu and E. Tadmor, 1990) offers higher resolution while retaining the simplicity of the Riemann-solver-free approach. The numerical viscosity present in these central schemes is of order O((Delta x)(2r)/Delta t). In the convective regime where Delta t similar to Delta x, the improved resolution of the NT scheme and its generalizations is achieved by lowering the amount of numerical viscosity with increasing r. At the same time, this family of central schemes suffers from excessive numerical viscosity when a sufficiently small time step is enforced, e.g., due to the presence of degenerate diffusion terms. In this paper we introduce a new family of central schemes which retain the simplicity of being independent of the eigenstructure of the problem, yet which enjoy a much smaller numerical viscosity (of the corresponding order O((Delta x)(2r-1))). In particular, our new central schemes maintain their high-resolution independent of O(1/Delta t), and letting Delta t down arrow 0, they admit a particularly simple semi-discrete formulation. The main idea behind the construction of these central schemes is the use of more precise information of the local propagation speeds. Beyond these CFL related speeds, no characteristic information is required. As a second ingredient in their construction, these central schemes realize the (nonsmooth part of the) approximate solution in terms of its cell averages integrated over the Riemann fans of varying size. The semi-discrete central scheme is then extended to multidimensional problems, with or without degenerate diffusive terms. Fully discrete versions are obtained with Runge-Kutta solvers. We prove that a scalar version of our high-resolution central scheme is nonoscillatory in the sense of satisfying the total-variation diminishing property in the one-dimensional case and the maximum principle in two-space dimensions. We conclude with a series of numerical examples, considering convex and nonconvex problems with and without degenerate diffusion, and scalar and systems of equations in one- and two-space dimensions. Time evolution is carried out by the: third- and fourth-order explicit embedded integration Runge-Kutta methods recently proposed by A. Medovikov (1998). These numerical studies demonstrate the remarkable resolution of our new family of central scheme. (C) 2000 Academic Press.",10.1006/jcph.2000.6459,918,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sheet carrier concentration and the confinement of the two dimensional electron gases located close to the AlGaN/GaN interface are sensitive to a large number of different physical properties such as polarity, alloy composition, strain, thickness, and doping of the AlGaN barrier. We have investigated these physical properties for undoped and silicon doped transistor structures by a combination of high resolution x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, Hall effect, and capacitance-voltage profiling measurements. The polarization induced sheet charge bound at the AlGaN/GaN interfaces was calculated from different sets of piezoelectric constants available in the literature. The sheet carrier concentration induced by polarization charges was determined self-consistently from a coupled Schrodinger and Poisson equation solver for pseudomorphically and partially relaxed barriers with different alloy compositions. By comparison of theoretical and experimental results, we demonstrate that the formation of two dimensional electron gases in undoped and doped AlGaN/GaN structures rely both on piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization induced effects.

We show that in this high-T regime, the localization transition may be studied numerically through exact diagonalization of small systems. We obtain spectra for one-dimensional lattice models of interacting spinless fermions in a random potential. As expected, the spectral statistics of finite-size samples cross over from those of orthogonal random matrices in the diffusive regime at weak random potential to Poisson statistics in the localized regime at strong randomness. However, these data show deviations from simple one-parameter finite-size scaling: the apparent mobility edge '' drifts '' as the system's size is increased.

We discuss a general approach to such states by perturbation of the critical point between a normal insulator (NI) and a topological insulator (TI), breaking either time-reversal (TR) or inversion symmetry. We give an explicit model realization of both types of states in a NI-TI superlattice structure with broken TR symmetry. Both the Weyl and the line-node semimetals are characterized by topologically protected surface states, although in the line-node case, some additional symmetries must be imposed to retain this topological protection. The edge states have the form of ""Fermi arcs"" in the case of the Weyl semimetal: these are chiral gapless edge states, which exist in a finite region in momentum space, determined by the momentum-space separation of the bulk Weyl nodes. The chiral character of the edge states leads to a finite Hall conductivity. In contrast, the edge states of the line-node semimetal are ""flat bands"": these states are approximately dispersionless in a subset of the two-dimensional edge Brillouin zone, given by the projection of the line node onto the plane of the edge.

J,"Hättig, C; Weigend, F",CC2 excitation energy calculations on large molecules using the resolution of the identity approximation,"A new implementation of the approximate coupled cluster singles and doubles method CC2 is reported, which is suitable for large scale integral-direct calculations. It employs the resolution of the identity (RI) approximation for two-electron integrals to reduce the CPU time needed for calculation and I/O of these integrals. We use a partitioned form of the CC2 equations which eliminates the need to store double excitation cluster amplitudes. In combination with the RI approximation this formulation of the CC2 equations leads to a reduced scaling of memory and disk space requirements with the number of correlated electrons (n) and basis functions (N) to, respectively, O(N-2) and O(nN(2)), compared to O(n(2)N(2)) in previous implementations. The reduced CPU, memory and disk space requirements make it possible to perform CC2 calculations with accurate basis sets on large molecules, which would not be accessible with conventional implementations of the CC2 method. We present an application to vertical excitation energies of alkenes C2nH2n+2, for n=1-12, and report results for the lowest lying dipole-allowed transitions for the TZVPP basis sets, which for n=12 contain 1108 basis functions. Comparison with conventional CC2 results for the smaller alkenes show that for CC2 ground state energies and for excitation energies of valence states, the error due to the RI approximation is negligible compared to the usual basis set error, if auxiliary basis sets are used, which have been optimized for MP2 energy calculations.

As driven by electrostatic interactions, the charged nanofibers were stretched to span across the gap and thus to become uniaxially aligned arrays over large areas. Because the nanofibers were suspended over the gap, they could be conveniently transferred onto the surfaces of other substrates for subsequent treatments and various applications.

J,"O'Hern, CS; Silbert, LE; Liu, AJ; Nagel, SR",Jamming at zero temperature and zero applied stress: The epitome of disorder,"We have studied how two- and three-dimensional systems made up of particles interacting with finite range, repulsive potentials jam (i.e., develop a yield stress in a disordered state) at zero temperature and zero applied stress. At low packing fractions phi, the system is not jammed and each particle can move without impediment from its neighbors. For each configuration, there is a unique jamming threshold phi(c) at which particles can no longer avoid each other, and the bulk and shear moduli simultaneously become nonzero. The distribution of phi(c) values becomes narrower as the system size increases, so that essentially all configurations jam at the same packing fraction in the thermodynamic limit. This packing fraction corresponds to the previously measured value for random close packing. In fact, our results provide a well-defined meaning for ""random close packing"" in terms of the fraction of all phase space with inherent structures that jam. The jamming threshold, point J, occurring at zero temperature and applied stress and at the random-close-packing density, has properties reminiscent of an ordinary critical point. As point J is approached from higher packing fractions, power-law scaling is found for the divergence of the first peak in the pair correlation function and in the vanishing of the pressure, shear modulus, and excess number of overlapping neighbors. Moreover, near point J, certain quantities no longer self-average, suggesting the existence of a length scale that diverges at J. However, point J also differs from an ordinary critical point: the scaling exponents do not depend on dimension but do depend on the interparticle potential. Finally, as point J is approached from high packing fractions, the density of vibrational states develops a large excess of low-frequency modes. Indeed, at point J, the density of states is a constant all the way down to zero frequency. All of these results suggest that point J is a point of maximal disorder and may control behavior in its vicinity-perhaps even at the glass transition.",10.1103/PhysRevE.68.011306,954,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The objective of this present work is to redevelop the CPI by leading a research effort to increase the usefulness and reliability of this inventory. We created eight new descriptors for consumer products, including information pertaining to the nanomaterials contained in each product. The project was motivated by the recognition that a diverse group of stakeholders from academia, industry, and state/ federal government had become highly dependent on the inventory as an important resource and bellweather of the pervasiveness of nanotechnology in society. We interviewed 68 nanotechnology experts to assess key information needs. Their answers guided inventory modifications by providing a clear conceptual framework best suited for user expectations. The revised inventory was released in October 2013. It currently lists 1814 consumer products from 622 companies in 32 countries. The Health and Fitness category contains the most products (762, or 42% of the total). Silver is the most frequently used nanomaterial (435 products, or 24%); however, 49% of the products (889) included in the CPI do not provide the composition of the nanomaterial used in them. About 29% of the CPI (528 products) contain nanomaterials suspended in a variety of liquid media and dermal contact is the most likely exposure scenario from their use. The majority (1288 products, or 71%) of the products do not present enough supporting information to corroborate the claim that nanomaterials are used. The modified CPI has enabled crowdsourcing capabilities, which allow users to suggest edits to any entry and permits researchers to upload new findings ranging from human and environmental exposure data to complete life cycle assessments. There are inherent limitations to this type of database, but these modifications to the inventory addressed the majority of criticisms raised in published literature and in surveys of nanotechnology stakeholders and experts.

The surface used in this report is, more specifically, an electrode covered with dielectrics, hence, called electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD). All the fluidic movement is confined between two plates, which we call parallel-plate channel, rather than through closed channels or on open surfaces. While transporting and merging droplets are easily verified, we discover that there exists a design criterion for a given set of materials beyond which the droplet simply cannot be cut by EWOD mechanism. The condition for successful cutting is theoretically analyzed by examining the channel gap, the droplet size and the degree of contact angle change by electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD). A series of experiments is run and verifies the criterion. A smaller channel gap, a larger droplet size and a larger change in the contact angle enhance the necking of the droplet, helping the completion of the cutting process. Creating droplets from a pool of liquid is highly related to cutting, but much more challenging. Although droplets may be created by simply pulling liquid out of a reservoir, the location of cutting is sensitive to initial conditions and turns out unpredictable. This problem of an inconsistent cutting location is overcome by introducing side electrodes, which pull the liquid perpendicularly to the main fluid path before activating the cutting. All four operations are carried out in air environment at 25 V-dc applied voltage.",10.1109/JMEMS.2002.807467,960,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atomic force microscopy, electrostatic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to characterize the structure and chemistry of the degradation process, suggesting that O-2 saturated H2O irreversibly reacts with BP to form oxidized phosphorus species. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that BP degradation occurs more rapidly on hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayers and on H-Si(111) versus hydrophilic SiO2. For unencapsulated BP field-effect transistors, the ambient degradation causes large increases in threshold voltage after 6 h in ambient, followed by a similar to 10(3) decrease in FET current on/off ratio and mobility after 48 h. Atomic layer deposited AlOx overlayers effectively suppress ambient degradation, allowing encapsulated BP FETs to maintain high on/off ratios of similar to 103 and mobilities of similar to 100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for over 2 weeks in ambient conditions.

The development is based on the concept of triples-natural orbitals that span the joint space of the three pair natural orbital (PNO) spaces of the three electron pairs that are involved in the calculation of a given triple-excitation contribution. The truncation error is very smooth and can be significantly reduced through extrapolation to the zero threshold. However, the extrapolation procedure does not improve relative energies. The overall computational effort of the method is asymptotically linear with the system size O(N). Actual linear scaling has been confirmed in test calculations on alkane chains. The accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) approximation relative to semicanonical CCSD(T-0) is comparable to the previously developed DLPNO-CCSD method relative to canonical CCSD. Relative energies are predicted with an average error of approximately 0.5 kcal/mol for a challenging test set of medium sized organic molecules.

In this paper, we present an alternative explanation which allows scalar fields to evolve cosmologically while having couplings to matter of order unity. In our scenario, the mass of the fields depends on the local matter density: the interaction range is typically of order 1 mm on Earth (where the density is high) and of order 10-10(4) AU in the solar system (where the density is low). All current bounds from tests of general relativity are satisfied.

For transition, noble, and group IV metals, the calculations are consistent with covalent bonding, and the adsorption is characterized by strong hybridization between adatom and graphene electronic states. For ionically bonded adatoms, the charge transfer is calculated quantitatively using two methods, one based on the DOS and the other based on the real-space-charge density.

Using the two-site density matrix, the entanglement of formation between any two sites is calculated for all parameter values and temperatures. We also study the entanglement in the transverse Ising model, a special case of the XY model, which exhibits a quantum phase transition. It is found that the next-nearest-neighbor entanglement (though not the nearest-neighbor entanglement) is a maximum at the critical point.

In particular, the underlying weak interaction of organic cations with surrounding iodides due to eight equivalent orientations of the organic cation along the body diagonals in unit cell and chemically non-inertness of organic cation result in photo- and moisture instability of organometal halide perovskite. Here, a perovskite light absorber incorporating organic-inorganic hybrid cation in the A-site of 3D APbI(3) structure with enhanced photo- and moisture stability is reported.

When 10% of HC(NH2)(2)(+) is replaced by Cs+, photo- and moisture stability of perovskite film are significantly improved, which is attributed to the enhanced interaction between HC(NH2)(2)(+) and iodide due to contraction of cubo-octahedral volume.

The basis sets are of cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ quality, and have been optimized for use with the large-core (valence-electrons only) Stuttgart-Dresden-Bonn (SDB) relativistic pseudopotentials. Validation calculations on a variety of third-row and fourth-row diatomics suggest them to be comparable in quality to the all-electron cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets for lighter elements. Especially the SDB-cc-pVQZ basis set in conjunction with a core polarization potential (CPP) yields excellent agreement with experiment for compounds of the later heavy p-block elements. For accurate calculations on Ga (and, to a lesser extent, Ge) compounds, explicit treatment of 13 valence electrons appears to be desirable, while it seems inevitable for In compounds. For Ga and Ge, we propose correlation consistent basis sets extended for (3d) correlation.

High-resolution spectra of the E-2(high), A(1)(LO), and E-1(LO) modes were recorded, and an analysis of the anharmonicity and lifetimes of these phonons is carried out. The E-2(high) mode displays a visibly asymmetric line shape.

The temperature dependence of the linewidth and frequency of the E-2(high) mode is well described by a perturbation-theory renormalization of the harmonic E-2(high) frequency resulting from the interaction with the acoustic two-phonon density of states.
