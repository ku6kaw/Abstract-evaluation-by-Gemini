J,"Geim, AK; Novoselov, KS",The rise of graphene,"Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.",10.1038/nmat1849,1,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no
J,"Radisavljevic, B; Radenovic, A; Brivio, J; Giacometti, V; Kis, A",Single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> transistors,"Two-dimensional materials are attractive for use in next-generation nanoelectronic devices because, compared to one-dimensional materials, it is relatively easy to fabricate complex structures from them. The most widely studied two-dimensional material is graphene(1,2), both because of its rich physics(3-5) and its high mobility(6). However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including transistors(7). Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon films(8-13) or requires high voltages(14,15). Although single layers of MoS2 have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8 eV (ref. 16), previously reported mobilities in the 0.5-3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) range(17) are too low for practical devices. Here, we use a halfnium oxide gate dielectric to demonstrate a room-temperature single-layer MoS2 mobility of at least 200 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), similar to that of graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate transistors with room-temperature current on/off ratios of 1 x 10(8) and ultralow standby power dissipation. Because monolayer MoS2 has a direct bandgap(16,18), it can be used to construct interband tunnel FETs19, which offer lower power consumption than classical transistors. Monolayer MoS2 could also complement graphene in applications that require thin transparent semiconductors, such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.",10.1038/NNANO.2010.279,2,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The nature of the G and D vibration modes in graphite is analyzed in terms of the resonant excitation of pi states and the long-range polarizability of pi bonding. Visible Raman data on disordered, amorphous, and diamond like carbon are classified in a three-stage model to show the factors that control the position, intensity, and widths of the G and D peaks. It is shown that the visible Raman spectra depend formally on the configuration of the sp(2) sites in sp(2)-bonded clusters. In cases where the sp(2) clustering is controlled by the sp(3) fraction, such as in as-deposited tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) or hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films, the visible Raman parameters can be used to derive the sp(3) fraction.",10.1103/PhysRevB.61.14095,4,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

Here we establish that such dynamic structural complexity in a prototypical two-dimensional lead iodide perovskite gives rise to the coexistence of diverse excitonic resonances, each with a distinct degree of polaronic character. By means of high-resolution resonant impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy, we identify vibrational wavepacket dynamics that evolve along different configurational coordinates for distinct excitons and photocarriers. Employing density functional theory calculations, we assign the observed coherent vibrational modes to various low-frequency (less than or similar to 50 cm(-1)) optical phonons involving motion in the lead iodide layers. We thus conclude that different excitons induce specific lattice reorganizations, which are signatures of polaronic binding.

Currently, Hummers' method (KMnO4, NaNO3, H2SO4) is the most common method used for preparing graphene oxide. We have found that excluding the NaNO3, increasing the amount of KMnO4, and performing the reaction in a 9:1 mixture of H2SO4/H3PO4 improves the efficiency of the oxidation process. This improved method provides a greater amount of hydrophilic oxidized graphene material as compared to Hummers' method or Hummers' method with additional KMnO4. Moreover, even though the GO produced by our method is more oxidized than that prepared by Hummers' method, when both are reduced in the same chamber with hydrazine, chemically converted graphene (CCG) produced from this new method is equivalent in its electrical conductivity. In contrast to Hummers' method, the new method does not generate toxic gas and the temperature is easily controlled.

J,"Henkelman, G; Arnaldsson, A; J√≥nsson, H",A fast and robust algorithm for Bader decomposition of charge density,"An algorithm is presented for carrying out decomposition of electronic charge density into atomic contributions. As suggested by Bader [R. Bader, Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory, Oxford University Press, New York, 1990], space is divided up into atomic regions where the dividing surfaces are at a minimum in the charge density, i.e. the gradient of the charge density is zero along the surface normal. Instead of explicitly finding and representing the dividing surfaces, which is a challenging task, our algorithm assigns each point on a regular (x, y, z) grid to one of the regions by following a steepest ascent path on the grid. The computational work required to analyze a given charge density grid is approximately 50 arithmetic operations per grid point. The work scales linearly with the number of grid points and is essentially independent of the number of atoms in the system. The algorithm is robust and insensitive to the topology of molecular bonding. In addition to two test problems involving a water molecule and NaCl crystal, the algorithm has been used to estimate the electrical activity of a cluster of boron atoms in a silicon crystal. The highly stable three-atom boron cluster, B3I is found to have a charge of -1.5 e, which suggests approximately 50% reduction in electrical activity as compared with three substitutional boron atoms.

In the case of chemical sensors, the quantum is one atom or molecule. Such resolution has so far been beyond the reach of any detection technique, including solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity(1-4). The fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due to thermal motion of charges and defects(5), which lead to intrinsic noise exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many orders of magnitude. Here, we show that micrometre-size sensors made from graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene's surface. The adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic field or mechanical strain are required.",10.1038/nmat1967,19,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Our previous paper [M. C. Biesinger et al., Appl. Surf. Sci. 257 (2010) 887-898.] in which we examined Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn species, has shown that all the values of the spectral fitting parameters for each specific species, i.e. binding energy (eV), full wide at half maximum (FWHM) value (eV) for each pass energy, spin-orbit splitting values and asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, are not all normally provided in the literature and data bases, and are necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis. A more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve fitting was developed based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of literature references and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. This paper extends this approach to the chemical states of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni metals, and various oxides and hydroxides where intense, complex multiplet splitting in many of the chemical states of these elements poses unique difficulties for chemical state analysis. The curve fitting procedures proposed use the same criteria as proposed previously but with the additional complexity of fitting of multiplet split spectra which has been done based on spectra of numerous reference materials and theoretical XPS modeling of these transition metal species. Binding energies, FWHM values, asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, multiplet peak separation and peak area percentages are presented. The procedures developed can be utilized to remove uncertainties in the analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality(13,14), this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2.

J,"Inoue, A",Stabilization of metallic supercooled liquid and bulk amorphous alloys,"Bulk metallic materials have ordinarily been produced:by melting and solidification processes for the last several thousand years. However, metallic liquid is unstable at temperatures below the melting temperature and solidifies immediately into crystalline phases. Consequently, all bulk engineering alloys are composed of a crystalline structure. Recently, this common concept was exploded by the findings of the stabilization phenomenon of the supercooled liquid for a number of alloys in the Mg-, lanthanide-, Zr-, Ti-, Fe-, Co-, Pd-Cu- and Ni-based systems. The alloys with the stabilized, supercooled liquid state have three features in their alloy components, i.e. multicomponent systems, significant atomic size ratios above 12%, and negative heats of mixing. The stabilization mechanism has also been investigated from experimental data of structure analyses and fundamental physical properties. The stabilization has enabled the production of bulk amorphous alloys in the thickness range of 1-100 mm by using various casting processes. Bulk amorphous Zr-based alloys exhibit high mechanical strength, high fracture toughness and good corrosion resistance and have been used for sporting goods materials. The stabilization also leads to the appearance of a large supercooled liquid region before crystallization and enables high-strain rate super-plasticity through Newtonian flow. The new Fe- and Go-based amorphous alloys exhibit a large super-cooled liquid region and good soft magnetic properties which are characterized by low coercive force and high permeability. Furthermore, homogeneous dispersion of nanoscale -particles into Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys was found to cause an improvement of tensile strength without detriment to good ductility. The discovery of the stabilization phenomenon, followed by the clarification of the stabilization criteria of the supercooled liquid, will promise the future definite development of bulk amorphous alloys as new basic science and engineering materials.

Here, we demonstrate a simple, low cost and effective approach of using the charging process in friction to convert mechanical energy into electric power for driving small electronics. The triboelectric generator (TEG) is fabricated by stacking two polymer sheets made of materials having distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with metal films deposited on the top and bottom of the assembled structure. Once subjected to mechanical deformation, a friction between the two films, owing to the nano-scale surface roughness, generates equal amount but opposite signs of charges at two sides. Thus, a triboelectric potential layer is formed at the interface region, which serves as a charge ""pump"" for driving the flow of electrons in the external toad if there is a variation in the capacitance of the system. Such a flexible polymer TEG gives an output voltage of up to 3.3 V at a power density of similar to 10.4 mW/cm(3).

We also define the structural characteristics necessary for this process, termed intercalation pseudocapacitance, which are a crystalline network that offers two-dimensional transport pathways and little structural change on intercalation. The principal benefit realized from intercalation pseudocapacitance is that high levels of charge storage are achieved within short periods of time because there are no limitations from solid-state diffusion.

J,"Pei, SF; Cheng, HM",The reduction of graphene oxide,"Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene. Different reduction processes result in different properties of reduced GO (rGO), which in turn affect the final performance of materials or devices composed of rGO. In this contribution, we review the state-of-art status of the reduction of GO on both techniques and mechanisms. The development in this field will speed the applications of graphene.

In this paper, we consider another contribution, that of the capacitive effects, which become increasingly important at nanoscale dimensions. Nanocrystalline TiO2 (anatase) was studied over a dimensional regime where both capacitive and lithium intercalation processes contribute to the total stored charge. An analysis of the voltammetric sweep data was used to distinguish between the amount of charge stored by these two processes. At particle sizes below 10 nm, capacitive contributions became increasingly important, leading to greater amounts of total stored charge (gravimetrically normalized) with decreasing TiO2 particle size. The area normalized capacitance was determined to be well above 100,mu F/cm(2), confirming that the capacitive contribution was pseudocapacitive in nature. Moreover, reducing the particle size to the nanoscale regime led to faster charge/discharge rates because the diffusion-controlled lithium ion intercalation process was replaced by faradaic reactions which occur at the surface of the material.

Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature.

Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and molecules on the surfaces of solids. Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring.

However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs.

Here, we report high-brightness light-emitting diodes based on solution-processed organometal halide perovskites. We demonstrate electroluminescence in the near-infrared, green and red by tuning the halide compositions in the perovskite. In our infrared device, a thin 15 nm layer of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite emitter is sandwiched between larger-bandgap titanium dioxide (TiO2) and poly(9,9'-dioctyl-fluorene) (F8) layers, effectively confining electrons and holes in the perovskite layer for radiative recombination.

A review of current literature shows that all values necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis are usually not provided. This paper reports a more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve-fitting the various chemical states in a variety of Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn metals, oxides and hydroxides. The curve-fitting procedures proposed are based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of the literature references, and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. Binding energies, full-width at half maximum (FWHM) values, spin-orbit splitting values, asymmetric peak-shape fitting parameters, and, for Cu and Zn, Auger parameters values are presented. The quantification procedure for Cu species details the use of the shake-up satellites for Cu(II)-containing compounds and the exact binding energies of the Cu(0) and Cu(I) peaks. The use of the modified Auger parameter for Cu and Zn species allows for corroborating evidence when there is uncertainty in the binding energy assignment. These procedures can remove uncertainties in analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The seven groups are as follows: (G-I) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM-Al/Ga, (G-II) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM-Metalloid (G-III) Al/Ga-LTM/BM-Metalloid, (G-IV) IIA-ETM/Ln-LTM/BM, (G-V) LTM/BM-Metalloid, (G-VI) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM and (G-VII) IIA-LTM/BM. where ETM. Ln, LTM, BM and IIA refer to early transition, lantlianide, late transition, group IIIB-IVB and group IIA-group metals, respectively. The main alloying element of ternary G-I, G-V and G-VII, ternary G-II and G-IV, and tertiary G-VI BMGs is the largest, intermediate and smallest atomic radius compared to the other alloying elements, respectively. The main alloying element of tertiary BMGs belonging to G-I. G-V. G-VI and G-VII is an element in the atomic pair with the largest and negative value of Delta H-mix (<(Delta H)under bar >(mix)(LN)). while the main element of ternary BMGs belonging to G-II and G-IV is independent of the atomic pair with <(Delta H)under bar >(mix)(LN). The characteristics of the main element derived for the ternary BMGs are directly applicable to multicomponent BMGs belonging to G-I. G-II, G-IV (Mg-based BMGs), G-V and G-VII.

The main element of BMGs belonging to G-VI tends to change from the element with the smallest atomic radius in a ternary system to an element with a relatively large atomic size in a in multicomponent system. The change is due to an increase in glass-forming ability through multicomponent alloying of BMGs belonging to G-VI.

This distinction is characterized by Z(2) topological invariants, which characterize the ground state. In two dimensions, there is a single Z(2) invariant that distinguishes the ordinary insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase. In three dimensions, there are four Z(2) invariants that distinguish the ordinary insulator from ""weak"" and ""strong"" topological insulators. These phases are characterized by the presence of gapless surface (or edge) states. In the two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall phase and the three-dimensional strong topological insulator, these states are robust and are insensitive to weak disorder and interactions. In this paper, we show that the presence of inversion symmetry greatly simplifies the problem of evaluating the Z(2) invariants.

This new paradigm requires scaffolds that balance temporary mechanical function with mass transport to aid biological delivery and tissue regeneration. Little is known quantitatively about this balance as early scaffolds were not fabricated with precise porous architecture. Recent advances in both computational topology design ( CTD) and solid free- form fabrication ( SFF) have made it possible to create scaffolds with controlled architecture. This paper reviews the integration of CTD with SFF to build designer tissue- engineering scaffolds.

Here we report a synthesis of r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of similar to 6 nm, and examine their OER activities in acid and alkaline solutions. Both r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 NPs were highly active for OER, with r-RuO2 exhibiting up to 10 A/g(oxide) at 1.48 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. When comparing the two, r-RuO2 NPs were found to have slightly higher intrinsic and mass OER activities than r-IrO2 in both acid and basic solutions. Interestingly, these oxide NPs showed higher stability under OER conditions than commercial Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts.

Using primary hepatocytes as a liver model, we found that CdSe-core QDs were indeed acutely toxic under certain conditions. Specifically, we found that the cytotoxicity of QDs was modulated by processing parameters during synthesis, exposure to ultraviolet light, and surface coatings. Our data further suggest that cytotoxicity correlates with the liberation of free Cd2+ ions due to deterioration of the CdSe lattice.

The toxicity of starch-coated silver nanoparticles was studied using normal human lung fibroblast cells (IMR-90) and human glioblastoma cells (U251). The toxicity was evaluated using changes in cell morphology, cell viability, metabolic activity, and oxidative stress. Ag-np reduced ATP content of the cell caused damage to mitochondria and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. DNA damage, as measured by single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) and cytokinesis blocked micronucleus assay (CBMN), was also dose-dependent and more prominent in the cancer cells. The nanoparticle treatment caused cell cycle arrest in G(2)/M phase possibly due to repair of damaged DNA. Annexin-V propidium iodide (PI) staining showed no massive apoptosis or necrosis. The transmission electron microscopic ITEM) analysis indicated the presence of Ag-np inside the mitochondria and nucleus, implicating their direct involvement in the mitochondrial toxicity and DNA damage. A possible mechanism of toxicity is proposed which involves disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by Ag-np leading to production of ROS and interruption of ATP synthesis, which in turn cause DNA damage. It is anticipated that DNA damage is augmented by deposition, followed by interactions of Ag-np to the DNA leading to cell cycle arrest in the G(2)/M phase.

The unique mechanical properties of these fibers provided important clinical repair options for many applications. During the past 20 years, some biocompatibility problems have been reported for silkworm silk; however, contamination from residual sericin (glue-like proteins) was the likely cause. More recent studies with well-defined silkworm silk fibers and films suggest that the core silk fibroin fibers exhibit comparable biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo with other commonly used biomaterials such as polylactic acid and collagen. Furthermore, the unique mechanical properties of the silk fibers, the diversity of side chain chemistries for 'decoration' with growth and adhesion factors, and the ability to genetically tailor the protein provide additional rationale for the exploration of this family of fibrous proteins for biomaterial applications. For example, in designing scaffolds for tissue engineering these properties are particularly relevant and recent results with bone and ligament formation in vitro support the potential role for this biomaterial in future applications. To date, studies with silks to address biomaterial and matrix scaffold needs have focused on silkworm silk.

Although the quest continues for stronger and harder materials, these have little to no use as bulk structural materials without appropriate fracture resistance. It is the lower-strength, and hence higher-toughness, materials that find use for most safety-critical applications where premature or, worse still, catastrophic fracture is unacceptable. For these reasons, the development of strong and tough (damage-tolerant) materials has traditionally been an exercise in compromise between hardness versus ductility. Drawing examples from metallic glasses, natural and biological materials, and structural and biomimetic ceramics, we examine some of the newer strategies in dealing with this conflict. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between the mechanisms that individually contribute to strength and toughness, noting that these phenomena can originate from very different lengthscales in a material's structural architecture.

J,"Lam, DCC; Yang, F; Chong, ACM; Wang, J; Tong, P",Experiments and theory in strain gradient elasticity,"Conventional strain-based mechanics theory does not account for contributions from strain gradients. Failure to include strain gradient contributions can lead to underestimates of stresses and size-dependent behaviors in small-scale structures. In this paper, a new set of higher-order metrics is developed to characterize strain gradient behaviors. This set enables the application of the higher-order equilibrium conditions to strain gradient elasticity theory and reduces the number of independent elastic length scale parameters from five to three. On the basis of this new strain gradient theory, a strain gradient elastic bending theory for plane-strain beams is developed. Solutions for cantilever bending with a moment and line force applied at the free end are constructed based on the new higher-order bending theory. In classical bending theory, the normalized bending rigidity is independent of the length and thickness of the beam. In the solutions developed from the higher-order bending theory, the normalized higher-order bending rigidity has a new dependence on the thickness of the beam and on a higher-order bending parameter, b(h). To determine the significance of the size dependence, we fabricated micron-sized beams and conducted bending tests using a nanoindenter. We found that the normalized beam rigidity exhibited an inverse squared dependence on the beam's thickness as predicted by the strain gradient elastic bending theory, and that the higher-order bending parameter, bh, is on the micron-scale. Potential errors from the experiments, model and fabrication were estimated and determined to be small relative to the observed increase in beam's bending rigidity. The present results indicate that the elastic strain gradient effect is significant in elastic deformation of small-scale structures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J,"Schnyder, AP; Ryu, S; Furusaki, A; Ludwig, AWW",Classification of topological insulators and superconductors in three spatial dimensions,"We systematically study topological phases of insulators and superconductors (or superfluids) in three spatial dimensions. We find that there exist three-dimensional (3D) topologically nontrivial insulators or superconductors in five out of ten symmetry classes introduced in seminal work by Altland and Zirnbauer within the context of random matrix theory, more than a decade ago. One of these is the recently introduced Z(2) topological insulator in the symplectic (or spin-orbit) symmetry class. We show that there exist precisely four more topological insulators. For these systems, all of which are time-reversal invariant in three dimensions, the space of insulating ground states satisfying certain discrete symmetry properties is partitioned into topological sectors that are separated by quantum phase transitions. Three of the above five topologically nontrivial phases can be realized as time-reversal invariant superconductors. In these the different topological sectors are characterized by an integer winding number defined in momentum space. When such 3D topological insulators are terminated by a two-dimensional surface, they support a number (which may be an arbitrary nonvanishing even number for singlet pairing) of Dirac fermion (Majorana fermion when spin-rotation symmetry is completely broken) surface modes which remain gapless under arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian that preserve the characteristic discrete symmetries, including disorder. In particular, these surface modes completely evade Anderson localization from random impurities. These topological phases can be thought of as three-dimensional analogs of well-known paired topological phases in two spatial dimensions such as the spinless chiral (p(x)+/- ip(y))-wave superconductor (or Moore-Read Pfaffian state).

Here we show that electron-acoustic phonon scattering(4-6) is indeed independent of n, and contributes only 30 V to graphene's room-temperature resistivity. At a technologically relevant carrier density of 1 x10(12) cm(-2), we infer a mean free path for electron-acoustic phonon scattering of > 2 mm and an intrinsic mobility limit of 2 x 10(5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1).

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e. g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.

The dispersion of peak positions and intensities with excitation wavelength is used to understand the nature of resonant Raman scattering in carbon and how to derive the local bonding and disorder from the Raman spectra. The spectra show three basic features, the D and G around 1600 and 1350 cm(-1) for visible excitation and an extra T peak, for UV excitation, at similar to 1060 cm(-1). The G peak, due to the stretching motion of sp(2) pairs, is a good indicator of disorder. It shows dispersion only in amorphous networks, with a dispersion rate proportional to the degree of disorder. Its shift well above 1600 cm(-1) under UV excitation indicates the presence of sp(2) chains. The dispersion of the D peak is strongest in ordered carbons. It shows little dispersion in amorphous carbon, so that in UV excitation it becomes like a density-of-states feature of vibrations of sp(2) ringlike structures. The intensity ratio I(D)/I(G) falls with increasing UV excitation in all forms of carbon, with a faster decrease in more ordered carbons, so that it is generally small for UV excitation. The T peak, due to sp(3) vibrations, only appears in UV Raman, lying around 1060 cm(-1) for H-free carbons and around 980 cm(-1) in hydrogenated carbons. In hydrogenated carbons, the sp(3) C-H-x stretching modes around 2920 cm(-1) can be clearly detected for UV excitation.

J,"Holzapfel, GA; Gasser, TC; Ogden, RW",A new constitutive framework for arterial wall mechanics and a comparative study of material models,"In this paper we develop a new constitutive law for the description of the (passive) mechanical response of arterial tissue. The artery is modeled as a thick-walled nonlinearly elastic circular cylindrical tube consisting of two layers corresponding to the media and adventitia (the solid mechanically relevant layers in healthy tissue). Each layer is treated as a fiber-reinforced material with the fibers corresponding to the collagenous component of the material and symmetrically disposed with respect to the cylinder axis. The resulting constitutive law is orthotropic in each layer. Fiber orientations obtained from a statistical analysis of histological sections from each arterial layer are used. A specific form of the law, which requires only three material parameters for each layer, is used to study the response of an artery under combined axial extension, inflation and torsion. The characteristic and very important residual stress in an artery in vitro is accounted for by assuming that the natural (unstressed and unstrained) configuration of the material corresponds to an open sector of a tube, which is then closed by an initial bending to form a load-free, but stressed, circular cylindrical configuration prior to application of the extension, inflation and torsion. The effect of residual stress on the stress distribution through the deformed arterial wall in the physiological state is examined. The model is fitted to available data on arteries and its predictions are assessed for the considered combined loadings. It is explained how the new model is designed to avoid certain mechanical, mathematical and computational deficiencies evident in currently available phenomenological models.

However, progress has been delayed by difficulties in understanding and controlling the coupled electronic and ionic phenomena that dominate the behaviour of nanoscale oxide devices. An analytic theory of the 'memristor' (memory-resistor) was first developed from fundamental symmetry arguments in 1971, and we recently showed that memristor behaviour can naturally explain such coupled electron-ion dynamics. Here we provide experimental evidence to support this general model of memristive electrical switching in oxide systems. We have built micro- and nanoscale TiO2 junction devices with platinum electrodes that exhibit fast bipolar nonvolatile switching. We demonstrate that switching involves changes to the electronic barrier at the Pt/TiO2 interface due to the drift of positively charged oxygen vacancies under an applied electric field. Vacancy drift towards the interface creates conducting channels that shunt, or short-circuit, the electronic barrier to switch ON. The drift of vacancies away from the interface annilihilates such channels, recovering the electronic barrier to switch OFF. Using this model we have built TiO2 crosspoints with engineered oxygen vacancy profiles that predictively control the switching polarity and conductance.",10.1038/nnano.2008.160,160,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,

Undissociated 1/2 < 1 1 0 > dislocations were observed, as were numerous stacking faults, which imply the dissociation of several of these dislocations into 1/6 < 1 1 2 > Shockley partials. At later stages (similar to 20% strain), nanoscale deformation twins were observed after interrupted tests at 77 K, but not in specimens tested at room temperature, where plasticity occurred exclusively by the aforementioned dislocations which organized into cells. Deformation twinning, by continually introducing new interfaces and decreasing the mean free path of dislocations during tensile testing (""dynamic Hall-Petch""), produces a high degree of work hardening and a significant increase in the ultimate tensile strength. This increased work hardening prevents the early onset of necking instability and is a reason for the enhanced ductility observed at 77 K. A second reason is that twinning can provide an additional deformation mode to accommodate plasticity. However, twinning cannot explain the increase in yield strength with decreasing temperature in our high-entropy alloy since it was not observed in the early stages of plastic deformation. Since strong temperature dependencies of yield strength are also seen in binary fcc solid solution alloys, it may be an inherent solute effect, which needs further study.

Due to their unique physicochemical, optical and electrical properties, a wide variety of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have been designed to drive various reduction and oxidation reactions under light irradiation with suitable wavelengths. In this review, we have systematically summarized the photocatalytic fundamentals of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, including fundamental mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis, advantages, challenges and the design considerations of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. The versatile properties of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are highlighted, including their crystal structural, surface phisicochemical, stability, optical, adsorption, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and electronic properties. Various design strategies are also thoroughly reviewed, including band-gap engineering, defect control, dimensionality tuning, pore texture tailoring, surface sensitization, heterojunction construction, co-catalyst and nanocarbon loading. Many important applications are also addressed, such as photocatalytic water splitting (H-2 evolution and overall water splitting), degradation of pollutants, carbon dioxide reduction, selective organic transformations and disinfection. Through reviewing the important state-of-the-art advances on this topic, it may provide new opportunities for designing and constructing highly effective g-C(3)N(4-)based photocatalysts for various applications in photocatalysis and other related fields, such as solar cell, photoelectrocatalysis, electrocatalysis, lithium battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell and separation and purification.

Bundled single-walled carbon nanotubes are effectively dispersed in water by their sonication in the presence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements provide evidence for individually dispersed carbon nanotubes. Molecular modelling suggests that ssDNA can bind to carbon nanotubes through pi-stacking, resulting in helical wrapping to the surface. The binding free energy of ssDNA to carbon nanotubes rivals that of two nanotubes for each other.

The mechanical properties measured were the Young's modulus, ultimate tensile strength, fracture toughness, fracture energy, and the material's resistance to fatigue crack propagation. The results indicate that grapheme platelets significantly out-perform carbon nanotube additives. The Young's modulus of the graphene nanocomposite was similar to 31% greater than the pristine epoxy as compared to similar to 3% increase for single-walled Carbon nanotubes. The tensile strength of the baseline epoxy was enhanced by similar to 40% with graphene platelets compared to similar to 14% improvement for multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The mode I fracture toughness of the nanocomposite with graphene platelets showed similar to 53% increase over the epoxy compared to similar to 20% improvement for multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The fatigue resistance results also showed significantly different trends. While the fatigue suppression response of nanotube/epoxy composites degrades dramatically as the stress intensity factor amplitude is increased, the reverse effect is seen for graphene-based nanocomposites. The superiority of graphene platelets over carbon nanotubes in terms of mechanical properties enhancement may be related to their high specific surface area, enhanced nanofiller-matrix adhesion/interlocking arising from their wrinkled (rough) surface, as well as the two-dimensional (planar) geometry of graphene platelets.",10.1021/nn9010472,172,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

J,"Leyland, A; Matthews, A",On the significance of the <i>H/E</i> ratio in wear control:: a nanocomposite coating approach to optimised tribological behaviour,"Although hardness has long been regarded as a primary material property which defines wear resistance, there is strong evidence to suggest that the elastic modulus can also have an important influence on wear behaviour. In particular, the elastic strain to failure, which is related to the ratio of hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E), has been shown by a number of authors to be a more suitable parameter for predicting wear resistance than is hardness alone. There is presently considerable interest in the development of nanostructured and nanolayered coatings, due to the fact that materials with extreme mechanical properties (which are difficult to synthesise by other methods) can be created, particularly when using plasma-assisted vacuum processing techniques. Until now, scientific research has been directed mainly towards the achievement of ultra-high hardness, with associated high elastic modulus, the latter of which, conventional fracture mechanics theory would suggest, is also desirable for wear improvement (by preventing crack propagation). In this study, we discuss the concept of nanocomposite coatings with high hardness and low elastic modulus, which can exhibit improved toughness, and are therefore better suited for optimising the wear resistance of 'real' industrial substrate materials (i.e. steels and Light alloys, with similarly low moduli). Recent advances in the development of ceramic-ceramic, ceramic-amorphous and ceramic-metal nanocomposite coatings are summarised and discussed in terms of their relevance to practical applications. We also discuss the significance of elastic strain to failure (which is related to H/E) and fracture toughness in determining tribological behaviour and introduce the topic of metallic nanocomposite coatings which, although not necessarily exhibiting extreme hardness, may provide superior wear resistance when deposited on the types of substrate material which industry needs to use.

In order to purify the as-received material, a non-oxidative treatment (with hydrochloric acid) was also applied. Electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis clearly revealed that the nitric acid-treated material under reflux conditions suffered the highest degree of degradation, such as, nanotube shortening and additional defect generation in the graphitic network. Basic oxidative treatment led to the complete removal of amorphous carbon and metal oxide impurities but the structural integrity was found to be intact. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to confirm the different functionalities produced for each oxidation agent, whereas titration measurements determined the relative concentration of carboxylic functions onto the graphitic surface. Moreover, a general relationship between the chemical treatment and the amount of non-graphitic carbon was established by means of Raman spectroscopy measurements.

The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the NW surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears to be effective even at the shortest time scale investigated of t < 1 ns.

Hydrogen-treated rutile TiO2 (H:TiO2) nanowires were prepared by annealing the pristine TiO2 nanowires in hydrogen atmosphere at various temperatures in a range of 200-550 degrees C. In comparison to pristine TiO2 nanowires, H:TiO2 samples show substantially enhanced photocurrent in the entire potential window. More importantly, H:TiO2 samples have exceptionally low photocurrent saturation potentials of -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs RHE), indicating very efficient charge separation and transportation. The optimized H:TiO2 nanowire sample yields a photocurrent density of similar to 1.97 mA/cm(2) at -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, in 1 M NaOH solution under the illumination of simulated solar light (100 mW/cm(2) from 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter). This photocurrent density corresponds to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of similar to 1.63%. After eliminating the discrepancy between the irradiance of the xenon lamp and solar light, by integrating the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the H:TiO2 nanowire sample with a standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum, the STH efficiency is calculated to be similar to 1.1%, which is the best value for a TiO2 photoanode. IPCE analyses confirm the photocurrent enhancement is mainly due to the improved photoactivity of TiO2 in the UV region.

Graphene has strong cytotoxicity toward bacteria. To better understand its antimicrobial mechanism, we compared the antibacterial activity of four types of graphene-based materials (graphite (Gt), graphite oxide (GtO), graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) toward a bacterial model Escherichia coli. Under similar concentration and incubation conditions, GO dispersion shows the highest antibacterial activity, sequentially followed by rGO, Gt, and GtO.

The general approach to the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene (NG), such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) performed in gas phases, requires transitional metal catalysts which could contaminate the resultant products and thus affect their properties. In this paper, we propose a facile, catalyst-free thermal annealing approach for large-scale synthesis of NG using low-cost Industrial material melamine as the nitrogen source. This approach can completely, avoid the contamination of transition metal catalysts, and thus the intrinsic catalytic performance of pure NGs can be investigated. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectrum analysis of the resultant products shows that the atomic percentage of nitrogen In doped graphene samples can be adjusted up to 10.1%. Such a high doping level has not been reported previously. High-resolution N1s spectra reveal that the as-made NG mainly contains pyridine-like nitrogen atoms. Electrochemical characterizations clearly demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic activity of NG toward die oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) In alkaline electrolytes, which is Independent of nitrogen doping level.

However, the connection is seldom made between those efforts and the crystal structures of cellulose that have been proposed with synchrotron X-radiation and neutron diffraction over the past decade or so. In part, this desirable connection is thwarted by the use of different conventions for description of the unit cells of the crystal structures. In the present work, powder diffraction patterns from cellulose I alpha, I beta, II, IIII, and IIIII were calculated based on the published atomic coordinates and unit cell dimensions contained in modified ""crystal information files"" (.cif) that are supplied in the Supplementary Information. The calculations used peak widths at half maximum height of both 0.1 and 1.5A degrees 2 theta, providing both highly resolved indications of the contributions of each contributing reflection to the observable diffraction peaks as well as intensity profiles that more closely resemble those from practical cellulose samples. Miller indices are shown for each contributing peak that conform to the convention with c as the fiber axis, a right-handed relationship among the axes and the length of a < b. Adoption of this convention, already used for crystal structure determinations, is also urged for routine studies of polymorph and crystallinity. The calculated patterns are shown with and without preferred orientation along the fiber axis.

The modeling of an open device system is reduced to a calculation defined on a finite region of space using a screening approximation. The interaction between the device scattering region and the electrodes is accounted for by self-energies within the NEGF formalism.

Despite containing many constituents, both alloys had a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure that remained not only stable after exposure to 1400 degrees C, but also disordered, as confirmed by the absence of superlattice reflections in neutron diffraction data. Compressive flow properties and microstructure development of these alloys were determined from room temperature up to 1600 degrees C. Limited compressive plasticity and quasi-cleavage fracture at room temperature suggest that the ductile-to-brittle transition for these alloys occurs above room temperature. At 600 degrees C and above, both alloys showed extensive compressive plastic strain. The yield stress of both alloys dropped by 30-40% between room temperature and 600 degrees C, but was relatively insensitive to temperature above 600 degrees C, comparing favorably with conventional superalloys.

However, vacuum decomposition of SiC yields graphene layers with small grains (30-200 nm; refs 14-16).

Therefore, much effort has been made to synthesize and tailor the microstructures of porous carbon materials via various activation procedures (physical and chemical activation). In particular, the chemical activation of various carbon sources using KOH as the activating reagent is very promising because of its lower activation temperature and higher yields, and well-defined micropore size distribution and ultrahigh specific surface area up to 3000 m(2) g(-1) of the resulting porous carbons. In this feature article, we will cover recent research progress since 2007 on the synthesis of KOH-activated carbons for hydrogen and electrical energy storage (supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur batteries). The textural properties and surface chemistry of KOH-activated carbons depend on not only the synthesis parameters, but also different carbon sources employed including fossil/biomass-derived materials, synthetic organic polymers, and various nanostructured carbons (e.g. carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon aerogels, carbide-derived carbons, graphene, etc.).

This is about ten times longer than their spherical counterparts and is more persistent than any known synthetic nanoparticle. Under fluid flow conditions, spheres and short filomicelles are taken up by cells more readily than longer filaments because the latter are extended by the flow.

Silicon anodes can be used both in traditional lithium-ion batteries and in more recent Li-O-2 and Li-S batteries as a replacement for the dendrite-forming lithium metal anodes. The main challenges associated with silicon anodes are structural degradation and instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase caused by the large volume change (similar to 300%) during cycling, the occurrence of side reactions with the electrolyte, and the low volumetric capacity when the material size is reduced to a nanometre scale(4-7). Here, we propose a hierarchical structured silicon anode that tackles all three of these problems. Our design is inspired by the structure of a pomegranate, where single silicon nanoparticles are encapsulated by a conductive carbon layer that leaves enough room for expansion and contraction following lithiation and delithiation. An ensemble of these hybrid nanoparticles is then encapsulated by a thicker carbon layer in micrometre-size pouches to act as an electrolyte barrier. As a result of this hierarchical arrangement, the solid-electrolyte interphase remains stable and spatially confined, resulting in superior cyclability (97% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles). In addition, the microstructures lower the electrode-electrolyte contact area, resulting in high Coulombic efficiency (99.87%) and volumetric capacity (1,270 mAh cm(-3)), and the cycling remains stable even when the areal capacity is increased to the level of commercial lithium-ion batteries (3.7 mAh cm(-2)).",10.1038/NNANO.2014.6,223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PSO technique is different with the genetic algorithm and has apparently avoided the use of evolution operators (e.g., crossover and mutation). The approach is based on an efficient global minimization of free-energy surfaces merging total-energy calculations via PSO technique and requires only chemical compositions for a given compound to predict stable or metastable structures at given external conditions (e.g., pressure). A particularly devised geometrical structure parameter which allows the elimination of similar structures during structure evolution was implemented to enhance the structure search efficiency. The application of designed variable unit-cell size technique has greatly reduced the computational cost. Moreover, the symmetry constraint imposed in the structure generation enables the realization of diverse structures, leads to significantly reduced search space and optimization variables, and thus fastens the global structure convergence. The PSO algorithm has been successfully applied to the prediction of many known systems (e.g., elemental, binary, and ternary compounds) with various chemical-bonding environments (e.g., metallic, ionic, and covalent bonding).

J,"Brousse, T; B√©langer, D; Long, JW",To Be or Not To Be Pseudocapacitive?,"There are an increasing number of studies regarding active electrode materials that undergo faradaic reactions but are used for electrochemical capacitor applications. Unfortunately, some of these materials are described as ""pseudocapacitive"" materials despite the fact that their electrochemical signature (e.g., cyclic voltarnmogram and charge/discharge curve) is analogous to that of a ""battery"" material, as commonly observed for Ni(OH)(2) and cobalt oxides in KOH electrolyte. Conversely, true pseudocapacitive electrode materials such as MnO2 display electrochemical behavior typical of that observed for a capacitive carbon electrode. The difference between these two classes of materials will be explained, and we demonstrate why it is inappropriate to describe nickel oxide or hydroxide and cobalt oxide/hydroxide as pseudocapacitive electrode materials.

J,"Akhavan, O; Ghaderi, E",Toxicity of Graphene and Graphene Oxide Nanowalls Against Bacteria,"Bacterial toxicity of graphene nanosheets in the form of graphene nanowalls deposited on stainless steel substrates was investigated for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative models of bacteria. The graphene oxide nanowalls were obtained by electrophoretic deposition of Mg2+-graphene oxide nanosheets synthesized by a chemical exfoliation method. On the basis of measuring the efflux of cytoplasmic materials of the bacteria, it was found that the cell membrane damage of the bacteria caused by direct contact of the bacteria with the extremely sharp edges of the nanowalls was the effective mechanism in the bacterial inactivation. In this regard, the Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria with an outer membrane were more resistant to the cell membrane damage caused by the nanowalls than the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus lacking the outer membrane. Moreover, the graphene oxide nanowalls reduced by hydrazine were more toxic to the bacteria than the unreduced graphene oxide nanowalls. The better antibacterial activity of the reduced nanowalls was assigned to the better charge transfer between the bacteria and the more sharpened edges of the reduced nanowalls, during the contact interaction.",10.1021/nn101390x,237,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no

A novel poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) structure with a unique architecture produced by an electrospinning process has been developed for tissue-engineering applications. Electrospinning is a process whereby ultra-fine fibers are formed in a high-voltage electrostatic field. The electrospun structure, composed of PLGA fibers ranging from 500 to 800 rim in diameter, features a morphologic similarity to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of natural tissue, which is characterized by a wide range of pore diameter distribution, high porosity, and effective mechanical properties. Such a structure meets the essential design criteria of an ideal engineered scaffold. The favorable cell-matrix interaction within the cellular construct supports the active biocompatibility of the structure. The electrospun nanofibrous structure is capable of supporting cell attachment and proliferation. Cells seeded on this structure tend to maintain phenotypic shape and guided growth according to nanofiber orientation. This novel biodegradable scaffold has potential applications for tissue engineering based upon its unique architecture, which acts to support and guide cell growth.

The aim of this study was to investigate the degradation mechanism at the bone-implant interface of different degrading magnesium alloys in bone and to determine their effect on the surrounding bone. Sample rods of four different magnesium alloys and a degradable polymer as a control were implanted intramedullary into the femora of guinea pigs. After 6 and 18 weeks, uncalcified sections were generated for histomorphologic analysis. The bone-implant interface was characterized in uncalcified sections by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), element mapping and X-ray diffraction. Results showed that metallic implants made of magnesium alloys degrade in vivo depending on the composition of the alloying elements. While the corrosion layer of all magnesium alloys accumulated with biological calcium phosphates, the corrosion layer was in direct contact with the surrounding bone. The results further showed high mineral apposition rates and an increased bone mass around the magnesium rods, while no bone was induced in the surrounding soft tissue. From the results of this study, there is a strong rationale that in this research model, high magnesium ion concentration could lead to bone cell activation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Cytotoxicity in L929 mouse fibroblasts was monitored using the MTT assay and the release of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Microscopic observations were carried out as indicators for cell viability. Furthermore, hemolysis of erythrocytes was quantified spectrophotometrically. To determine the nature of cell death induced by the polycations, the nuclear morphology after DAPI staining and the inhibition of the toxic effects by the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk were investigated. All assays yielded comparable results and allowed the following ranking of the polymers with regard to cytotoxicity: Poly(ethylenimine) = poly(L-lysine) > poly(diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride) > diethylaminoethyl-dextran > poly (vinyl pyridinium bromide) > Starburst dendrimer > cationized albumin > native albumin. The magnitude of the cytotoxic effects of all polymers were found to be time- and concentration dependent. The molecular weight as well as the cationic charge density of the polycations were confirmed as key parameters for the interaction with the cell membranes and consequently, the cell damage. Evaluating the nature of cell death induced by poly(ethylenimine), we did not detect any indication for apoptosis suggesting that the polymer induced a necrotic cell reaction. Cell nuclei retained their size, chromatin was homogenously distributed and cell membranes lost their integrity very rapidly at an early stage. Furthermore, the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk did not inhibit poly(ethylenimine)-induced cell damage. Insights into the structure-toxicity relationship are necessary to optimize the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of non-viral gene delivery systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, despite its intriguing properties, one of the biggest hurdles for graphene to be useful as an electronic material is the lack of an energy gap in its electronic spectra. This, for example, prevents the use of graphene in making transistors. Although several proposals have been made to open a gap in graphene's electronic spectra, they all require complex engineering of the graphene layer. Here, we show that when graphene is epitaxially grown on SiC substrate, a gap of approximate to 0.26 eV is produced. This gap decreases as the sample thickness increases and eventually approaches zero when the number of layers exceeds four. We propose that the origin of this gap is the breaking of sublattice symmetry owing to the graphene-substrate interaction. We believe that our results highlight a promising direction for bandgap engineering of graphene.",10.1038/nmat2003,245,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Three metal oxide nanoparticles that are currently being produced in high tonnage, TiO2 ZnO, and CeO2 were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis process and compared in a mechanistic study to elucidate the physicochemical characteristics that determine cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and toxic effects based on a test paradigm that was originally developed for oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 and BEAS-2B cell lines. ZnO induced toxicity in both cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidant injury, excitation of inflammation, and cell death. Using ICP-MS and fluorescent-labeled ZnO, it is found that ZnO dissolution could happen in culture medium and endosomes. Nondissolved ZnO nanoparticles enter caveolae in BEAS-2B but enter lysosomes in RAW 264.7 cells in which smaller particle remnants dissolve. In contrast, fluorescent-labeled CeO2 nanoparticles were taken up intact into caveolin-1 and LAMP-1 positive endosomal compartments, respectively, in BEAS-2B and RAW 264.7 cells, without inflammation or cytotoxicity. Instead, CeO2 suppressed ROS production and induced cellular resistance to an exogenous source of oxidative stress. Fluorescent-labeled TiO2 was processed by the same uptake pathways as CeO2 but did not elicit any adverse or protective effects. These results demonstrate that metal oxide nanoparticles induce a range of biological responses that vary from cytotoxic to cytoprotective and can only be properly understood by using a tiered test strategy such as we developed for oxidative stress and adapted to study other aspects of nanoparticle toxicity.",10.1021/nn800511k,247,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects.

FITC labeled protamine sulfate (FITC-PS) loaded RhB-CMCNP and camptothecin (CPT) loaded RhB-CHNP with high encapsulation efficiency were prepared. The fluorescence stability in plasma and towards I was investigated, and the result indicated it was sufficient for qualitative and quantitative analysis. NPs with high surface charge and large particle size were phagocytized more efficiently by murine macrophage. Slight particle size and surface charge differences and different cell lines had significant implications in the cellular uptake of NPs, and various mechanisms were involved in the uptake process.

The two limits are identified as the cases of infinitely small and infinitely large upconversion rates, respectively. In the latter case, the dependence of luminescence intensities from intermediate excited states on pump power changes with the underlying upconversion and decay mechanisms.

Although these samples had similar distributions of particle size and graphite structure in their carbon cores, the surface state gradually varied among the samples, especially the degree of oxidation.

J,"Chen, XQ; Niu, HY; Li, DZ; Li, YY",Modeling hardness of polycrystalline materials and bulk metallic glasses,"Though extensively studied, hardness, defined as the resistance of a material to deformation, still remains a challenging issue for a formal theoretical description due to its inherent mechanical complexity. The widely applied Teter's empirical correlation between hardness and shear modulus has been considered to be not always valid for a large variety of materials. The main reason is that shear modulus only responses to elastic deformation whereas the hardness links both elastic and permanent plastic properties. We found that the intrinsic correlation between hardness and elasticity of materials correctly predicts Vickers hardness for a wide variety of crystalline materials as well as bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Our results suggest that, if a material is intrinsically brittle (such as BMGs that fail in the elastic regime), its Vickers hardness linearly correlates with the shear modulus (H-v = 0.151G). This correlation also provides a robust theoretical evidence on the famous empirical correlation observed by Teter in 1998. On the other hand, our results demonstrate that the hardness of polycrystalline materials can be correlated with the product of the squared Pugh's modulus ratio and the shear modulus (H-v = 2(k(2)G)(0.585) - 3 where k =G/B is Pugh's modulus ratio). Our work combines those aspects that were previously argued strongly, and, most importantly, is capable to correctly predict the hardness of all hard compounds known included in several pervious models.

It is semiconducting (the remaining phases are metallic) and contains diatomic N-N with the bond distance of 1.414 A. These characters are consistent with the experimental facts that IrN2 is in lower symmetry and nonmetallic. Our conclusion is also in agreement with the recent theoretical studies that the most stable phase of IrN2 is monoclinic P2(1)/c.

J,"Liu, XH; Zhong, L; Huang, S; Mao, SX; Zhu, T; Huang, JY",Size-Dependent Fracture of Silicon Nanoparticles During Lithiation,"Lithiation of individual silicon nanopartides was studied in real time with in situ transmission electron microscopy. A strong size dependence of fracture was discovered; that Is, there exists a critical particle diameter of similar to 150 nm, below which the particles neither cracked nor fractured upon first lithiation, and above which the particles initially formed surface cracks and then fractured due to lithiation-induced swelling. The unexpected surface cracking arose owing to the buildup of large tensile hoop stress, which reversed the initial compression, in the surface layer. The stress reversal was attributed to the unique mechanism of lithiation in crystalline Si, taking place by movement of a two-phase boundary between the inner core of pristine Si and the outer shell of amorphous Li-Si alloy. While the resulting hoop tension tended to initiate surface cracks, the small-sized nanoparticles nevertheless averted fracture. This is because the stored strain energy from electrochemical reactions was insufficient to drive crack propagation, as dictated by the interplay between the two length scales, that is, particle diameter and crack size, that control the fracture. These results are diametrically opposite to those obtained previously from single-phase modeling, which predicted only compressive hoop stress In the surface layer and thus crack initiation from the center in lithiated Si particles and wires.

We utilized a synthesis specifically designed for long and thin wires for improved performance in terms of sheet resistance and optical transmittance. Twenty Omega/sq and similar to 80% specular transmittance, and 8 ohms/sq and 80% diffusive transmittance in the visible range are achieved, which fall in the same range as the best indium tin oxide (ITO) samples on plastic substrates for flexible electronics and solar cells.

The characteristic properties of aluminium, high strength stiffness to weight ratio, good formability, good corrosion resistance, and recycling potential make it the ideal candidate to replace heavier materials (steel or copper) in the car to respond to the weight reduction demand within the automotive industry. This paper summarises the recent developments covering aluminium's use in castings, extrusions and sheet; two specific examples will be given. The first deals with hang-on parts manufactured by Hoogovens Rolled Products Duffel, for which the weight saving potential can be 50%. Currently, the highly formable 5000 alloys are used mostly for inner panel applications, whilst the heat-treatable 6000 alloys are preferred for outer panel applications. This presentation reviews recent developments in aluminium alloys to improve formability, surface quality in both 5000 and 6000 alloys, and the bake hardening response of 6000 alloys. It also indicates the trend to develop a unialloy system to improve the aluminium scrap recycling. The second area deals with brazing sheet. Over the last 10 years there has been an increasing trend to replace copper heat exchangers with ones manufactured from brazed aluminium. Hoogovens Aluminium Walzprodukte Koblenz is one of the world's leading supplier of aluminium brazing sheet and is in the forefront of developing alloys with the combination of strength, formability, brazing performance and long life required by its customers. Materials have been development for both vacuum and controlled atmosphere brazing. The current status and future trends in aluminium brazing sheet for automotive applications will be presented. Particular emphasis has been placed on the development of long life alloys with superior corrosion performance over the more conventional materials. Using these two examples the technical and commercial aspects of the manufacturing processes of aluminium automotive components and engineering design support of materials producers are illustrated. The essential feature is the close co-operation at all stages between the material's supplier and the automotive manufacture. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

It is demonstrated that advances in materials and processing technology and understanding has enabled much of the progress that has been made since the inception of manned, heavier than air flight. The recent constraints of cost, as determined by customer value, have changed the way new materials are introduced and these trends appear to be the new paradigm for the aircraft and aircraft engine industry. While the focus of this paper is aircraft and aircraft engines, the broader focus is on the role of materials in creating lightweight structures. There are examples used in this paper that are relevant to automotive applications once they are adjusted for cost. This matter is briefly discussed at the end of the paper.

J,"Jablan, M; Buljan, H; Soljacic, M",Plasmonics in graphene at infrared frequencies,"We point out that plasmons in doped graphene simultaneously enable low losses and significant wave localization for frequencies below that of the optical phonon branch h omega(Oph)approximate to 0.2 eV. Large plasmon losses occur in the interband regime (via excitation of electron-hole pairs), which can be pushed toward higher frequencies for higher-doping values. For sufficiently large dopings, there is a bandwidth of frequencies from omega(Oph) up to the interband threshold, where a plasmon decay channel via emission of an optical phonon together with an electron-hole pair is nonegligible. The calculation of losses is performed within the framework of a random-phase approximation and number conserving relaxation-time approximation. The measured DC relaxation-time serves as an input parameter characterizing collisions with impurities, whereas the contribution from optical phonons is estimated from the influence of the electron-phonon coupling on the optical conductivity. Optical properties of plasmons in graphene are in many relevant aspects similar to optical properties of surface plasmons propagating on dielectric-metal interface, which have been drawing a lot of interest lately because of their importance for nanophotonics. Therefore, the fact that plasmons in graphene could have low losses for certain frequencies makes them potentially interesting for nanophotonic applications.",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.245435,327,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

A number of materials challenges must be successfully resolved for nuclear energy to continue to make further improvements in reliability, safety and economics. The operating environment for materials in current and proposed future nuclear energy systems is summarized, along with a description of materials used for the main operating components. Materials challenges associated with power uprates and extensions of the operating lifetimes of reactors are described. The three major materials challenges for the current and next generation of water-cooled fission reactors are centered on two structural materials aging degradation issues (corrosion and stress corrosion cracking of structural materials and neutron-induced embrittlement of reactor pressure vessels), along with improved fuel system reliability and accident tolerance issues. The major corrosion and stress corrosion cracking degradation mechanisms for light-water reactors are reviewed. The materials degradation issues for the Zr alloy-clad UO2 fuel system currently utilized in the majority of commercial nuclear power plants are discussed for normal and off-normal operating conditions. Looking to proposed future (Generation IV) fission and fusion energy systems, there are five key bulk radiation degradation effects (low temperature radiation hardening and embrittlement; radiation-induced and -modified solute segregation and phase stability; irradiation creep; void swelling; and high-temperature helium embrittlement) and a multitude of corrosion and stress corrosion cracking effects (including irradiation-assisted phenomena) that can have a major impact on the performance of structural materials.

We explain this asymmetry in ZnO via a study of its intrinsic defect physics, including Zn-O, Zn-i, V-O, O-i, and V-Zn and n-type impurity dopants, Al and F. We find that ZnO is n type at Zn-rich conditions. This is because (i) the Zn interstitial, Zn-i, is a shallow, donor, supplying electrons; (ii) its formation enthalpy is low for both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, so this defect is abundant; and (iii) the native defects that could compensate the n-type doping effect of Zn-i (interstitial O, O-i, and Zn vacancy, V-Zn), have high formation enthalpies for Zn-rich conditions, so these ""electron killers"" are not abundant. We find that ZnO cannot be doped p type via native defects (O-i, V-Zn) despite the fact that they are shallow (i.e., supplying holes at room temperature). This is because at both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, the defects that could compensate p-type doping (V-O, Zn-i, Zn-O) have low formation enthalpies so these ""hole killers"" form readily. Furthermore, we identify electron-hole radiative recombination at the V-O center as the source of the green luminescence. In contrast, a large structural relaxation of the same center upon double hole capture leads to slow electron-hole recombination (either radiative or nonradiative) responsible for the slow decay of photoconductivity.",10.1103/PhysRevB.63.075205,350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we demonstrate the possibility to precipitate nanosized coherent reinforcing phase, i.e., L1(2)-Ni-3(TLA1), in a fcc-FeCoNiCr HEA matrix using minor additions of Ti and Al. Through thermomechanical processing and microstructure controlling, extraordinary balanced tensile properties at room temperature were achieved, which is due to a well combination of various hardening mechanisms, particularly precipitation hardening. The applicability and validity of the conventional strengthening theories are also discussed. The current work is a successful demonstration of using integrated strengthening approaches to manipulate the properties of fcc-HEA systems, and the resulting findings are important not only for understanding the strengthening mechanisms of metallic materials in general, but also for the future development of high-performance HEAs for industrial applications.

J,"Williams, DF",On the mechanisms of biocompatibility,"The manner in which a mutually acceptable co-existence of biomaterials and tissues is developed and sustained has been the focus of attention in biomaterials science for many years, and forms the foundation of the subject of biocompatibility. There are many ways in which materials and tissues can be brought into contact such that this co-existence may be compromised, and the search for biomaterials that are able to provide for the best performance in devices has been based upon the understanding of all the interactions within biocompatibility phenomena. Our understanding of the mechanisms of biocompatibility has been restricted whilst the focus of attention has been long-term implantable devices. In this paper, over 50 years of experience with such devices is analysed and it is shown that, in the vast majority of circumstances, the sole requirement for biocompatibility in a medical device intended for long-term contact with the tissues of the human body is that the material shall do no harm to those tissues, achieved through chemical and biological inertness. Rarely has an attempt to introduce biological activity into a biomaterial been clinically successful in these applications. This essay then turns its attention to the use of biomaterials in tissue engineering, sophisticated cell, drug and gene delivery systems and applications in biotechnology, and shows that here the need for specific and direct interactions between biomaterials and tissue components has become necessary, and with this a new paradigm for biocompatibility has emerged. It is believed that once the need for this change is recognised, so our understanding of the mechanisms of biocompatibility will markedly improve. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design.

Based on structure optimization and phonon-mode calculations, we determine that 22 different honeycomb materials are stable and correspond to local minima on the Born-Oppenheimer surface. We also find that all the binary compounds containing one of the first row elements, B, C, or N have planar stable structures. On the other hand, in the honeycomb structures of Si, Ge, and other binary compounds the alternating atoms of hexagons are buckled since the stability is maintained by puckering. For those honeycomb materials which were found stable, we calculated optimized structures, cohesive energies, phonon modes, electronic-band structures, effective cation and anion charges, and some elastic constants. The band gaps calculated within density functional theory using local density approximation are corrected by GW(0) method.

Alumina-rich SCMs increase the Al-uptake in C-S-H and the amounts of aluminate containing hydrates. In general the changes in phase assemblages are well captured by thermodynamic modelling, although better knowledge of the C-S-H is needed.

Here, an artificial tree with a reverse-tree design is demonstrated as a cost-effective, scalable yet highly efficient steam-generation device. The reverse-tree design implies that the wood is placed on the water with the tree-growth direction parallel to the water surface; accordingly, water is transported in a direction perpendicular to what occurs in natural tree. The artificial tree is fabricated by cutting the natural tree along the longitudinal direction followed by surface carbonization (called as C-L-Wood). The nature-made 3D interconnected micro-/nanochannels enable efficient water transpiration, while the layered channels block the heat effectively. A much lower thermal conductivity (0.11 W m(-1) K-1) thus can be achieved, only 1/3 of that of the horizontally cut wood. Meanwhile, the carbonized surface can absorb almost all the incident light. The simultaneous optimizations of water transpiration, thermal management, and light absorption results in a high efficiency of 89% at 10 kW m(-2), among the highest values in literature.

Whereas the Se atoms in Cu2-xSe form a rigid face-centred cubic lattice, providing a crystalline pathway for semiconducting electrons (or more precisely holes), the copper ions are highly disordered around the Se sublattice and are superionic with liquid-like mobility. This extraordinary 'liquid-like' behaviour of copper ions around a crystalline sublattice of Se in Cu2-xSe results in an intrinsically very low lattice thermal conductivity which enables high zT in this otherwise simple semiconductor.

Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water flux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water flux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions.

(3) There may be quantum interference between the decaying states in the barrier. This leads to an oscillatory dependence of the tunneling current on kll and a damped oscillatory dependence on barrier thickness. (4) Interfacial resonance states can allow particular Bloch states to tunnel efficiently through the barrier. For Fe(100)(MgO(100)\Fe(100) our calculations indicate that quite different tunneling mechanisms dominate the conductance in the two spin channels. In the majority channel the conductance is primarily via Bloch electrons with small transverse momentum. One particular state with Delta (1) symmetry is able to effectively couple from the Fe into the MgO. In the minority channel the conductance is primarily through interface resonance states especially for thinner layers. We predict a large magnetoresistance that increases with barrier thickness.,10.1103/PhysRevB.63.054416,400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Salahuddin, S; Dattat, S",Use of negative capacitance to provide voltage amplification for low power nanoscale devices,"It is well-known that conventional field effect transistors (FETs) require a change in the channel potential of at least 60 mV at 300 K to effect a change in the current by a factor of 10, and this minimum subthreshold slope S puts a fundamental lower limit on the operating voltage and hence the power dissipation in standard FET-based switches. Here, we suggest that by replacing the standard insulator with a ferroelectric insulator of the right thickness it should be possible to implement a step-up voltage transformer that will amplify the gate voltage thus leading to values of S lower than 60 mV/decade and enabling low voltage/low power operation. The voltage transformer action can be understood intuitively as the result of an effective negative capacitance provided by the ferroelectric capacitor that arises from an internal positive feedback that in principle could be obtained from other microscopic mechanisms as well. Unlike other proposals to reduce S, this involves no change in the basic physics of the FET and thus does not affect its current drive or impose other restrictions.",10.1021/nl071804g,402,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

J,"Xiu, ZM; Zhang, QB; Puppala, HL; Colvin, VL; Alvarez, PJJ",Negligible Particle-Specific Antibacterial Activity of Silver Nanoparticles,"For nearly a decade, researchers have debated the mechanisms by which AgNPs exert toxicity to bacteria and other organisms. The most elusive question has been whether the AgNPs exert direct ""particle-specific"" effects beyond the known antimicrobial activity of released silver ions (Ag+). Here, we infer that Ag+ is the definitive molecular toxicant. We rule out direct particle-specific biological effects by showing the lack of toxicity of AgNPs when synthesized and tested under strictly anaerobic conditions that preclude Ag(0) oxidation and Ag+ release. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the toxicity of various AgNPs (PEG- or PVP- coated, of three different sizes each) accurately follows the dose response pattern of E. coli exposed to Ag+ (added as AgNO3). Surprisingly, E. coli survival was stimulated by relatively low (sublethal) concentration of all tested AgNPs and AgNO3 (at 3-8 mu g/L Ag+, or 12-31% of the minimum lethal concentration (MLC)), suggesting a hormetic response that would be counterproductive to antimicrobial applications. Overall, this work suggests that AgNP morphological properties known to affect antimicrobial activity are indirect effectors that primarily influence Ag+ release. Accordingly, antibacterial activity could be controlled (and environmental impacts could be mitigated) by modulating Ag+ release, possibly through manipulation of oxygen availability, particle size, shape, and/or type of coating.",10.1021/nl301934w,405,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The effects of various experimental parameters have been investigated using a batch adsorption technique to obtain information on treating effluents from the dye industry. The extent of dye removal increased with decrease in the initial concentration of the dye and particle size of the adsorbent and also increased with increase in contact time, amount of adsorbent used and the initial pH of the solution.

The kinetics of adsorption were found to be first order with regard to intra-particle diffusion rate. The adsorption capacities of indigenous activated carbons have been compared with that of the commercial activated carbon.

One limitation of electrochemical capacitors is their low energy density and for this reason, there is widespread interest in pseudocapacitive materials that use Faradaic reactions to store charge. One candidate pseudocapacitive material is orthorhombic MoO3 (alpha-MoO3), a layered compound with a high theoretical capacity for lithium (279 mA h g(-1) or 1,005 C g(-1)). Here, we report on the properties of reduced alpha-MoO3-x(R-MoO3-x) and compare it with fully oxidized alpha-MoO3 (F-MoO3). The introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a larger interlayer spacing that promotes faster charge storage kinetics and enables the alpha-MoO3 structure to be retained during the insertion and removal of Li ions. The higher specific capacity of the R-MoO3-x is attributed to the reversible formation of a significant amount of Mo4+ following lithiation.

A t value between 0.8 and 1.0 is favorable for cubic perovskite structure, and larger (>1) or smaller (<0.8) values of tolerance factor usually result in nonperovskite structures. CH(NH2)(2)PbI3 (FAPbI(3)) can exist in the perovskite a-phase (black phase) with good photovoltaic properties. However, it has a large tolerance factor and is more stable in the hexagonal delta(H)-phase (yellow phase), with delta(H)-to-alpha phase-transition temperature higher than room temperature. On the other hand, CsPbI3 is stabilized to an orthorhombic structure (delta(o)-phase) at room temperature due to its small tolerance factor. We find that, by alloying FAPbI(3) with CsPbI3, the effective tolerance factor can be tuned, and the stability of the photo active a-phase of the mixed solid-state perovskite alloys FA(1-x)C(sx)bI(3) is enhanced, which is in agreement with our first-principles calculations.

Due to phase stabilization, the FA(0.86)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) solid-state alloy showed better solar cell performance and device stability than its FAPbI(3) counterparts.

Recent inventions of several tough hydrogels show their potential as structural biomaterials, such as cartilage. Any given application, however, requires a combination of mechanical properties including stiffness, strength, toughness, damping, fatigue resistance and self-healing, along with biocompatibility. This combination is rarely realized. Here, we report that polyampholytes, polymers bearing randomly dispersed cationic and anionic repeat groups, form tough and viscoelastic hydrogels with multiple mechanical properties. The randomness makes ionic bonds of a wide distribution of strength. The strong bonds serve as permanent crosslinks, imparting elasticity, whereas the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. These physical hydrogels of supramolecular structure can be tuned to change multiple mechanical properties over wide ranges by using diverse ionic combinations.

J,"Janotti, A; Van de Walle, CG",Native point defects in ZnO,"We have performed a comprehensive first-principles investigation of native point defects in ZnO based on density functional theory within the local density approximation (LDA) as well as the LDA+U approach for overcoming the band-gap problem. Oxygen deficiency, manifested in the form of oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials, has long been invoked as the source of the commonly observed unintentional n-type conductivity in ZnO. However, contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find that native point defects are very unlikely to be the cause of unintentional n-type conductivity. Oxygen vacancies, which have most often been cited as the cause of unintentional doping, are deep rather than shallow donors and have high formation energies in n-type ZnO (and are therefore unlikely to form). Zinc interstitials are shallow donors, but they also have high formation energies in n-type ZnO and are fast diffusers with migration barriers as low as 0.57 eV; they are therefore unlikely to be stable. Zinc antisites are also shallow donors but their high formation energies (even in Zn-rich conditions) render them unlikely to be stable under equilibrium conditions. We have, however, identified a different low-energy atomic configuration for zinc antisites that may play a role under nonequilibrium conditions such as irradiation. Zinc vacancies are deep acceptors and probably related to the frequently observed green luminescence; they act as compensating centers in n-type ZnO. Oxygen interstitials have high formation energies; they can occur as electrically neutral split interstitials in semi-insulating and p-type materials or as deep acceptors at octahedral interstitial sites in n-type ZnO. Oxygen antisites have very high formation energies and are unlikely to exist in measurable concentrations under equilibrium conditions. Based on our results for migration energy barriers, we calculate activation energies for self-diffusion and estimate defect-annealing temperatures. Our results provide a guide to more refined experimental studies of point defects in ZnO and their influence on the control of p-type doping.",10.1103/PhysRevB.76.165202,427,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

Solvent effects can be treated using continuum models or by combining quantum chemical calculations with molecular dynamics or Monte-Carlo simulations. MOLCAS is especially adapted to treat systems with a complex electronic structure, where the simplest quantum chemical models do not work. These features together with the inclusion of relativistic effects makes it possible to treat with good accuracy systems including atoms from the entire periodic system.

In this work, the scientific and technical impact of these materials is contrasted with the various families of ""soft"" and ""hard"" PZTs. On the scientific front, the intrinsic nature of the dielectric and piezoelectric properties are presented in relation to their respective Curie temperatures (T-C) and the existence of a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Analogous to PZT, enhanced properties are noted for MPB compositions in the (Na,Bi)TiO3-BaTiO3 and ternary system with (K,Bi)TiO3, but offer properties significantly lower. The consequences of a ferroelectric to antiferroelectric transition well below T (C) further limits their usefulness. Though comparable with respect to T (C), the high levels of piezoelectricity reported in the (K,Na)NbO3 family are the result of enhanced polarizability associated with the orthorhombic-tetragonal polymorphic phase transition being compositionally shifted downward. As expected, the properties are strongly temperature dependent, while degradation occurs through the thermal cycling between the two distinct ferroelectric domain states. Extrinsic contributions arising from domains and domain wall mobility were determined using high field strain and polarization measurements. The concept of ""soft"" and ""hard"" lead-free piezoelectrics were discussed in relation to donor and acceptor modified PZTs, respectively.

Hydrocarbon, siloxane, and fluorocarbon surfaces were prepared. The surfaces contain posts of different sizes, shapes, and separations. Surfaces containing square posts with X-Y dimensions of 32 mu m and less exhibited ultrahydrophobic behavior with high advancing and receding water contact angles. Water droplets moved very easily on these surfaces and rolled off of slightly tilted surfaces. Contact angles were independent of the post height from 20 to 140 mu m and independent of surface chemistry. Water droplets were pinned on surfaces containing square posts with larger dimensions. Increasing the distance between posts and changing the shape of the posts from square to staggered rhombus, star, or indented square caused increases in receding contact angles. We ascribe these contact angle increases to decreases in the contact length and increases in tortuosity of the three-phase contact line.

J,"Kokubo, T; Kim, HM; Kawashita, M",Novel bioactive materials with different mechanical properties,"Some ceramics, such as Bioglass((R)), sintered hydroxyapatite, and glass-ceramic A-W, spontaneously bond to living bone. They are called bioactive materials and are already clinically used as important bone substitutes. However, compared with human cortical bone, they have lower fracture toughness and higher elastic moduli. Therefore, it is desirable to develop bioactive materials with improved mechanical properties. All the bioactive materials mentioned above form a bone-like apatite layer on their surfaces in the living body, and bond to bone through this apatite layer. The formation of bone-like apatite on artificial material is induced by functional groups, such as Si-OH, Ti-OH, Zr-OH, Nb-OH, Ta-OH, -COOH, and PO4H2. These groups have specific structures revealing negatively charge, and induce apatite formation via formations of an amorphous calcium compound, e.g., calcium silicate, calcium titanate, and amorphous calcium phosphate. These fundamental findings provide methods for preparing new bioactive materials with different mechanical properties. Tough bioactive materials can be prepared by the chemical treatment of metals and ceramics that have high fracture toughness, e.g., by the NaOH and heat treatments of titanium metal, titanium alloys, and tantalum metal, and by H3PO4 treatment of tetragonal zirconia. Soft bioactive materials can be synthesized by the sol-gel process, in which the bioactive silica or titania is polymerized with a flexible polymer, such as polydimethylsiloxane or polytetramethyloxide, at the molecular level to form an inorganic-organic nano-hybrid. The biomimetic process has been used to deposit nano-sized bone-like apatite on fine polymer fibers, which were textured into a three-dimensional knit framework. This strategy is expected to ultimately lead to bioactive composites that have a bone-like structure and, hence, bone-like mechanical properties. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In contrast, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers are semiconductors with intrinsic in-plane asymmetry, leading to direct electronic bandgaps, distinctive optical properties and great potential in optoelectronics(5,6). Apart from their in-plane inversion asymmetry, an additional degree of freedom allowing spin manipulation can be induced by breaking the out-of-plane mirror symmetry with external electric fields(7,8) or, as theoretically proposed, with an asymmetric out-of-plane structural configuration(9).

However, the diffusion kinetics in high-entropy alloys has never been probed directly. Here, the diffusion couple method was used to measure the diffusion parameters of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni in ideal-solution-like Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni alloys. These parameters were compared with those in various conventional face-centered cubic metals. The results show that the diffusion coefficients in the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni alloys are indeed lower than those in the reference metals. Correspondingly, the activation energies in the high-entropy alloys are higher than those in the reference metals. Moreover, the trend of the normalized activation energy is positively related to the number of composing elements in the matrix. A quasi-chemical model is proposed to analyze the fluctuation of lattice potential energy in different matrices and to explain the observed trend in activation energies. Greater fluctuation of lattice potential energy produces more significant atomic traps and blocks, leading to higher activation energies, and thus accounts for the sluggish diffusion in high-entropy alloys.

The important length scale in the problem is identified to be the ratio of the surface elastic modulus to the elastic modulus of the bulk. In general, the non-dimensional difference in the elastic properties from continuum predictions (D - D-c)/D-c is found to scale as alpha S/Eh, where alpha is a constant which depends on the geometry of the structural element considered, S is a surface elastic constant, E is a bulk elastic modulus and h a length defining the size of the structural element. Thus, the quantity S/E is identified as a material length scale for elasticity of nanosized structures.

For this reason surface roughness has been the subject of experimental and theoretical investigations for many decades. The real surface geometry is so complicated that a finite number of parameters cannot provide a full description. If the number of parameters used is increased, a more accurate description can be obtained. This is one of the reasons for introducing new parameters for surface evaluation. Surface roughness parameters are normally categorised into three groups according to its functionality. These groups are defined as amplitude parameters, spacing parameters, and hybrid parameters. This paper illustrates the definitions and the mathematical formulae for about 59 of the roughness parameters. This collection of surface roughness parameter was used in a new software computer vision package called Surf Vision developed by the authors. In the package, these definitions were extended to calculate the 3D surface topography of different specimens. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study set out to investigate the effect of mean pore size, in a series of collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffolds with mean pore sizes ranging from 85 mu m to 325 mu m, on osteoblast adhesion and early stage proliferation up to 7 days post-seeding. The results show that cell number was highest in scaffolds with the largest pore size of 325 mu m. However, an early additional peak in cell number was also seen in scaffolds with a mean pore size of 120 mu m at time points up to 48 h post-seeding. This is consistent with previous studies from our laboratory which suggest that scaffold specific surface area plays an important role on initial cell adhesion. This early peak disappears following cell proliferation indicating that while specific surface area may be important for initial cell adhesion, improved cell migration provided by scaffolds with pores above 300 mu m overcomes this effect. An added advantage of the larger pores is a reduction in cell aggregations that develop along the edges of the scaffolds. Ultimately scaffolds with a mean pore size of 325 mu m were deemed optimal for bone tissue engineering. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors.

However, compared to the best-performing device, the average efficiency was as low as 12%, with a large standard deviation (s.d.). Here, we report perovskite solar cells with an average efficiency exceeding 16% and best efficiency of 17%. This was enabled by the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids with a controlled size via a two-step spin-coating procedure. Spin-coating of a solution of CH3NH3I with different concentrations follows the spin-coating of PbI2, and the cuboid size of CH3NH3PbI3 is found to strongly depend on the concentration of CH3NH3I. Light-harvesting efficiency and charge-carrier extraction are significantly affected by the cuboid size. Under simulated one-sun illumination, average efficiencies of 16.4% (s.d. +/- 0.35), 16.3% (s.d. +/- 0.44) and 13.5% (s.d. +/- 0.34) are obtained from solutions of CH3NH3I with concentrations of 0.038 M, 0.050 M and 0.063 M, respectively. By controlling the size of the cuboids of CH3NH3PbI3 during their growth, we achieved the best efficiency of 17.01% with a photocurrent density of 21.64 mA cm(-2), open-circuit photovoltage of 1.056 V and fill factor of 0.741.",10.1038/NNANO.2014.181,471,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

Surfaces that presented derivatives of oligo(sarcosine), N-acetylpiperazine, and permethylated sorbitol groups were particularly effective in resisting the adsorption of proteins. Incorporation of these groups into single-component SAMs resulted in surfaces that are comparable to (but slightly less good than) single-component SAMs that present oligo(ethylene glycol) in their ability to resist the adsorption of proteins. In the group of surfaces examined, those that resisted the adsorption of proteins had the following properties: they were hydrophilic; they contained groups that were hydrogen-bond acceptors but not hydrogen-bond donors; and they were overall electrically neutral.",10.1021/la010384m,472,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

However, to date, there has been little success in the development of high-performance solid-state batteries using these exceptional materials, the major challenge being the high solid-solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and electrode materials. In this work, we effectively address the large interfacial impedance between a lithium metal anode and the garnet electrolyte using ultrathin aluminium oxide (Al2O3) by atomic layer deposition. Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLCZN) is the garnet composition of choice in this work due to its reduced sintering temperature and increased lithium ion conductivity. A significant decrease of interfacial impedance, from 1,710 Omega cm(2) to 1 Omega cm(2), was observed at room temperature, effectively negating the lithium metal/garnet interfacial impedance. Experimental and computational results reveal that the oxide coating enables wetting of metallic lithium in contact with the garnet electrolyte surface and the lithiated-alumina interface allows effective lithium ion transport between the lithium metal anode and garnet electrolyte.

Some ZnO nanoparticles exhibit very strong blue emissions, the intensity of which first increase and then decrease with annealing. These visible emissions exhibit strong and interesting excitation dependences: 1) the optimal excitation energy for blue emissions is near the bandgap energy, but the effective excitation can obviously be lower, even 420 nm (2.95 eV < E-g = 3.26 eV); in contrast, green emissions can be excited only by energies larger than the bandgap energy; and, 2) there are several fixed emitting wavelengths at 415, 440, 455 and 488 nm in the blue wave band, which exhibit considerable stability in different excitation and annealing conditions. Mechanisms for blue emissions from ZnO are proposed with interstitial-zinc-related defect levels as initial states.

The formation of different types of oxygen containing functional groups in GO, and their influences on its structure were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), zeta potential analysis and Raman spectroscopy. XRD studies showed a disruption of the graphitic AS stacking order during the increase in oxidation levels. XPS analysis revealed the formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at lower oxidation levels and epoxide groups at higher oxidation levels. The influence of the oxidation degree on the properties of GO was evaluated by zeta potential analysis, which showed a linear increase in the zeta potential with increasing oxidation levels. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed that increasing oxidation levels results in a transition from a crystalline to an amorphous structure. The electrochemical properties of GO is highly influenced by the variation in degree of oxidation.

The steel with higher martensite fraction has a lower elastic limit, a higher yield strength and a higher tensile strength. These effects are attributed to the higher second phase fraction and the inhomogeneous transformation strain accommodation in ferrite. The latter assumption is analyzed using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). We quantify orientation gradients, pattern quality and GND density variations at ferrite-ferrite and ferrite-martensite interfaces. Using 3D EBSD, additional information is obtained about the effect of grain volume and of martensite distribution on strain accommodation. Two methods are demonstrated to calculate the GND density from the EBSD data based on the kernel average misorientation measure and on the dislocation density tensor, respectively.

J,"Sevilla, M; Fuertes, AB",The production of carbon materials by hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose,"Highly functionalized carbonaceous materials were produced by means of the hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose at temperatures in the 220-250 degrees C range. The formation of this material follows essentially the path of a dehydration process, similar to that previously observed for the hydrothermal transformation of saccharides such as glucose, sucrose or starch. The materials so formed are composed of agglomerates of carbonaceous microspheres (size similar to 2-5 mu m), as evidenced by SEM. The combination of the results of the elemental analysis with that obtained by different spectroscopic techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and XPS) has allowed us to inferred that, from a chemical point of view, the solid product consists of small clusters of condensed benzene rings that form stable groups with oxygen in the core (i.e. ether, quinone, pyrone), whereas the shell possesses more reactive/hydrophilic oxygen functionalities (i.e. hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic, ester).

New metallurgical processing might offer the possibility of overcoming this. Here we report that austenitic 316L stainless steels additively manufactured via a laser powder-bed-fusion technique exhibit a combination of yield strength and tensile ductility that surpasses that of conventional 316L steels. High strength is attributed to solidification-enabled cellular structures, low-angle grain boundaries, and dislocations formed during manufacturing, while high uniform elongation correlates to a steady and progressive work-hardening mechanism regulated by a hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure, with length scales spanning nearly six orders of magnitude. In addition, solute segregation along cellular walls and low-angle grain boundaries can enhance dislocation pinning and promote twinning.

We show that such a TiO2-GR nanocomposite exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity and stability than bare TiO2 toward the gas-phase degradation of benzene, a volatile aromatic pollutant in air. By investigating the effect of different addition ratios of graphene on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-GR systematically, we find that the higher weight ratio in TiO2-GR will decrease the photocatalytic activity. Analogous phenomenon is also observed for the liquid-phase degradation of dyes over TiO2-GR. In addition, the key features for TiO2-GR including enhancement of adsorptivity of pollutants, light absorption intensity, electron-hole pairs lifetime, and extended light absorption range have also been found in the composite of TiO2 and carbon nanotubes (TiO2-CNT). These strongly manifest that TiO2-GR is in essence the same as other TiO2-carbon (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and activated carbon) composite materials on enhancement of photocatalytic activity of TiO2, although graphene by itself has unique structural and electronic properties. Notably, this key fundamental question remains completely unaddressed in a recent report (ACS Nano 2010, 4, 380) regarding liquid-phase degradation of dyes over the TiO2-GR photocatalyst. Thus, we propose that TiO2-GR cannot provide truly new insights into the fabrication of TiO2-carbon composite as high-performance photocatalysts.

J,"Colombo, P; Mera, G; Riedel, R; Sorar√π, GD",Polymer-Derived Ceramics: 40 Years of Research and Innovation in Advanced Ceramics,"Preceramic polymers were proposed over 30 years ago as precursors for the fabrication of mainly Si-based advanced ceramics, generally denoted as polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs). The polymer to ceramic transformation process enabled significant technological breakthroughs in ceramic science and technology, such as the development of ceramic fibers, coatings, or ceramics stable at ultrahigh temperatures (up to 2000 degrees C) with respect to decomposition, crystallization, phase separation, and creep. In recent years, several important advances have been achieved such as the discovery of a variety of functional properties associated with PDCs. Moreover, novel insights into their structure at the nanoscale level have contributed to the fundamental understanding of the various useful and unique features of PDCs related to their high chemical durability or high creep resistance or semiconducting behavior. From the processing point of view, preceramic polymers have been used as reactive binders to produce technical ceramics, they have been manipulated to allow for the formation of ordered pores in the meso-range, they have been tested for joining advanced ceramic components, and have been processed into bulk or macroporous components. Consequently, possible fields of applications of PDCs have been extended significantly by the recent research and development activities. Several key engineering fields suitable for application of PDCs include high-temperature-resistant materials (energy materials, automotive, aerospace, etc.), hard materials, chemical engineering (catalyst support, food- and biotechnology, etc.), or functional materials in electrical engineering as well as in micro/nanoelectronics. The science and technological development of PDCs are highly interdisciplinary, at the forefront of micro- and nanoscience and technology, with expertise provided by chemists, physicists, mineralogists, and materials scientists, and engineers. Moreover, several specialized industries have already commercialized components based on PDCs, and the production and availability of the precursors used has dramatically increased over the past few years. In this feature article, we highlight the following scientific issues related to advanced PDCs research: (1) General synthesis procedures to produce silicon-based preceramic polymers.(2) Special microstructural features of PDCs.(3) Unusual materials properties of PDCs, that are related to their unique nanosized microstructure that makes preceramic polymers of great and topical interest to researchers across a wide spectrum of disciplines.(4) Processing strategies to fabricate ceramic components from preceramic polymers.(5) Discussion and presentation of several examples of possible real-life applications that take advantage of the special characteristics of preceramic polymers. Note: In the past, a wide range of specialized international symposia have been devoted to PDCs, in particular organized by the American Ceramic Society, the European Materials Society, and the Materials Research Society. Most of the reviews available on PDCs are either not up to date or deal with only a subset of preceramic polymers and ceramics (e.g., silazanes to produce SiCN-based ceramics). Thus, this review is focused on a large number of novel data and developments, and contains materials from the literature but also from sources that are not widely available.",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03876.x,505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interfaces of the metacrystals support helical edge states that exhibit spin-polarized one-way propagation of photons, robust against disorder. Our results demonstrate the possibility of attaining one-way photon transport without application of external magnetic fields or breaking of time-reversal symmetry.

This extends the types of material response that can be reproduced by peridynamic theory to include an explicit dependence on such collectively determined quantities as volume change or shear angle.

A similar object called a force state is defined, which contains the forces within bonds of all lengths and orientation. The relation between the deformation state and force state is the constitutive model for the material. In addition to providing a more general capability for reproducing material response, the new framework provides a means to incorporate a constitutive model from the conventional theory of solid mechanics directly into a peridynamic model.

Discrete electronic and optoelectronic components, such as field-effect transistors, sensors, and photodetectors made from few-layer MoS2 show promising performance as potential substitute of Si in conventional electronics and of organic and amorphous Si semiconductors in ubiquitous systems and display applications. An important next step is the fabrication of fully integrated multistage circuits and logic building blocks on MoS2 to demonstrate its capability for complex digital logic and high-frequency ac applications. This paper demonstrates an inverter, a NAND gate, a static random access memory, and a five-stage ring oscillator based on a direct-coupled transistor logic technology. The circuits comprise between 2 to 12 transistors seamlessly integrated side-by-side on a single sheet of bilayer MoS2.

J,"Peres, NMR; Guinea, F; Castro Neto, AH",Electronic properties of disordered two-dimensional carbon,"Two-dimensional carbon, or graphene, is a semimetal that presents unusual low-energy electronic excitations described in terms of Dirac fermions. We analyze in a self-consistent way the effects of localized (impurities or vacancies) and extended (edges or grain boundaries) defects on the electronic and transport properties of graphene. On the one hand, point defects induce a finite elastic lifetime at low energies with the enhancement of the electronic density of states close to the Fermi level. Localized disorder leads to a universal, disorder independent, electrical conductivity at low temperatures, of the order of the quantum of conductance. The static conductivity increases with temperature and shows oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field. The graphene magnetic susceptibility is temperature dependent (unlike an ordinary metal) and also increases with the amount of defects. Optical transport properties are also calculated in detail. On the other hand, extended defects induce localized states near the Fermi level. In the absence of electron-hole symmetry, these states lead to a transfer of charge between the defects and the bulk, the phenomenon we call self-doping. The role of electron-electron interactions in controlling self-doping is also analyzed. We also discuss the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene, the role played by the edge states induced by a magnetic field, and their relation to the almost field independent surface states induced at boundaries. The possibility of magnetism in graphene, in the presence of short-range electron-electron interactions and disorder is also analyzed.",10.1103/PhysRevB.73.125411,521,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perfectly aligned PLLA fibrous scaffolds were fabricated by an electrospinning technique under optimum condition and the diameter of the electrospun fibers can easily be tailored by adjusting the concentration of polymer solution. As the structure of PLLA scaffold was intended for neural tissue engineering, its suitability was evaluated in vitro using neural stem cells (NSCs) as a model cell line. Cell morphology, differentiation and neurite outgrowth were studied by various microscopic techniques. The results show that the direction of NSC elongation and its neurite outgrowth is parallel to the direction of PLLA fibers for aligned scaffolds. No significant changes were observed on the cell orientation with respect to the fiber diameters. However, the rate of NSC differentiation was higher for PLLA nanofibers than that of micro fibers and it was independent of the fiber alignment. Based on the experimental results, the aligned nanofibrous PLLA scaffold could be used as a potential cell carrier in neural tissue engineering. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent efforts in this direction have focused on high-capacity electrode materials such as lithium metal, silicon and tin as anodes, and sulphur and oxygen as cathodes. Lithium metal would be the optimal choice as an anode material, because it has the highest specific capacity (3,860 mAh g(-1)) and the lowest anode potential of all. However, the lithium anode forms dendritic and mossy metal deposits, leading to serious safety concerns and low Coulombic efficiency during charge/discharge cycles. Although advanced characterization techniques have helped shed light on the lithium growth process, effective strategies to improve lithium metal anode cycling remain elusive. Here, we show that coating the lithium metal anode with a monolayer of interconnected amorphous hollow carbon nanospheres helps isolate the lithium metal depositions and facilitates the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase. We show that lithium dendrites do not form up to a practical current density of 1 mA cm(-2). The Coulombic efficiency improvesto similar to 99% for more than 150 cycles. This is significantly better than the bare unmodified samples, which usually show rapid Coulombic efficiency decay in fewer than 100 cycles.

A possible downside of these capabilities is harmful interactions with biological systems, with the potential to generate toxicity. An approach to assess the safety of nanomaterials is urgently required. We compared the cellular effects of ambient ultrafine particles with manufactured titanium dioxide (TiO2), carbon black, fullerol, and polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs). The study was conducted in a phagocytic cell line ( RAW 264.7) that is representative of a lung target for NPs. Physicochemical characterization of the NPs showed a dramatic change in their state of aggregation, dispersibility, and charge during transfer from a buffered aqueous solution to cell culture medium. Particles differed with respect to cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under biotic and abiotic conditions. Spontaneous ROS production was compared by using an ROS quencher (furfuryl alcohol) as well as an NADPH peroxidase bioelectrode platform. Among the particles tested, ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) and cationic PS nanospheres were capable of inducing cellular ROS production, GSH depletion, and toxic oxidative stress. This toxicity involves mitochondrial injury through increased calcium uptake and structural organellar damage. Although active under abiotic conditions, TiO2 and fullerol did not induce toxic oxidative stress. While increased TNF-alpha production could be seen to accompany UFP-induced oxidant injury, cationic PS nanospheres induced mitochondrial damage and cell death without inflammation. In summary, we demonstrate that ROS generation and oxidative stress are a valid test paradigm to compare NP toxicity.

The presence of high-kappa dielectrics in these devices enhanced their mobility, but the mechanisms are not well understood.

The dependence of mobility on temperature shows clear evidence of the strong suppression of charged-impurity scattering in dual-gate devices with a top-gate dielectric. At the same time, phonon scattering shows a weaker than expected temperature dependence. High levels of doping achieved in dual-gate devices also allow the observation of a metal-insulator transition in monolayer MoS2 due to strong electron-electron interactions.

Natural fibers have recently become attractive to researchers, engineers and scientists as an alternative reinforcement for fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Due to their low cost, fairly good mechanical properties, high specific strength, non-abrasive, eco-friendly and bio-degradability characteristics, they are exploited as a replacement for the conventional fiber, such as glass, aramid and carbon. The tensile properties of natural fiber reinforce polymers (both thermoplastics and thermosets) are mainly influenced by the interfacial adhesion between the matrix and the fibers. Several chemical modifications are employed to improve the interfacial matrix-fiber bonding resulting in the enhancement of tensile properties of the composites. In general, the tensile strengths of the natural fiber reinforced polymer composites increase with fiber content, up to a maximum or optimum value, the value will then drop. However, the Young's modulus of the natural fiber reinforced polymer composites increase with increasing fiber loading. Khoathane et al. [1] found that the tensile strength and Young's modulus of composites reinforced with bleached hemp fibers increased incredibly with increasing fiber loading. Mathematical modelling was also mentioned. It was discovered that the rule of mixture (ROM) predicted and experimental tensile strength of different natural fibers reinforced HDPE composites were very close to each other. Halpin-Tsai equation was found to be the most effective equation in predicting the Young's modulus of composites containing different types of natural fibers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The key concept is to describe the excitations of the electronic system by the corresponding one- and two-particle Green's function. The method combines three computational techniques. First, the electronic ground state is treated within density-functional theory. Second, the single particle spectrum of the electrons and holes is obtained within the GW approximation to the electron self-energy operator. Finally, the electron-hole interaction is calculated and a Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved, yielding the coupled electron-hole excitations. The resulting solutions allow the calculation of the entire optical spectrum. This holds both for bound excitonic states below the band gap, as well as for the resonant spectrum above the band gap. We discuss a number of technical developments needed for the application of the method to real systems. To illustrate the approach, we discuss the excitations and optical spectra of spatially isolated systems (atoms, molecules, and semiconductor clusters) and of extended, periodic crystals (semiconductors and insulators).",10.1103/PhysRevB.62.4927,532,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,

We discuss the ground-state finite-size scaling properties of three different quantities-the Binder moment ratio, the spin stiffness, and the long-wavelength magnetic susceptibility-which we use to extract the critical value of the coupling ratio g=J(perpendicular to)/J. The individual estimates of g(c) are consistent provided that subleading finite-size corrections are properly taken into account. For both models, we find that the spin stiffness has the smallest subleading finite-size corrections; in the case of the incomplete bilayer we find that the first subleading correction vanishes or is extremely small. In agreement with predictions, we find that at the critical point the Binder ratio has a universal value and the product of the spin stiffness and the long-wavelength susceptibility scales as 1/L-2 with a universal prefactor. Our results for the critical coupling ratios are g(c)=2.5220(1) (full bilayer) and g(c)=1.3888(1) (incomplete bilayer), which represent improvements of more than an order of magnitude over the previous best estimates.

Hardness conserving semilocal pseudopotentials have been generated for all elements from H to Am. The construction is based on a minimization of errors with the norm conservation conditions for 2-3 relevant ionic configurations of the atom. Besides the transferability between atomic states, the portability among density functionals is also of interest. This paper explores if the norm-conservation errors can be kept reasonably small when minimized for two functionals, e.g., the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and local density approximation, simultaneously. It is found that the errors can be kept at roughly the same low level as for a single functional. Since these pseudopotentials are mainly designed for use with local orbital methods, semicore functions may be treated as valence functions, helping to increase the accuracy and portability. Therefore the name density functional semicore pseudopotential or DSPP is suggested. To further improve portability and, importantly, also aid numerical stability with GGA's, a core density (nonlinear core correction) is used. As with other pseudopotentials, scalar relativistic corrections to atomic scattering properties can easily be incorporated into this PP.

Therefore, black phosphorus is an appealing candidate for tunable photodetection from the visible to the infrared part of the spectrum. We study the photoresponse of field-effect transistors (FETs) made of few-layer black phosphorus (3-8 nm thick), as a function of excitation wavelength, power, and frequency. In the dark state, the black phosphorus FETs can be tuned both in hole and electron doping regimes allowing for ambipolar operation. We measure mobilities in the order of 100 cm(2)/V s and a current ON/OFF ratio larger than 10(3). Upon illumination, the black phosphorus transistors show a response to excitation wavelengths from the visible region up to 940 nm and a rise time of about 1 ms, demonstrating broadband and fast detection. The responsivity reaches 4.8 mA/W, and it could be drastically enhanced by engineering a detector based on a PN junction. The ambipolar behavior coupled to the fast and broadband photodetection make few-layer black phosphorus a promising 2D material for photodetection across the visible and near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.",10.1021/nl5008085,545,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Wang, ZL",On Maxwell's displacement current for energy and sensors: the origin of nanogenerators,"Self-powered system is a system that can sustainably operate without an external power supply for sensing, detection, data processing and data transmission. Nanogenerators were first developed for self-powered systems based on piezoelectric effect and triboelectrification effect for converting tiny mechanical energy into electricity, which have applications in internet of things, environmental/infrastructural monitoring, medical science and security. In this paper, we present the fundamental theory of the nanogenerators starting from the Maxwell equations. In the Maxwell's displacement current, the first term epsilon(0) partial derivative E/partial derivative t gives the birth of electromagnetic wave, which is the foundation of wireless communication, radar and later the information technology. Our study indicates that the second term partial derivative P/partial derivative t in the Maxwell's displacement current is directly related to the output electric current of the nanogenerator, meaning that our nanogenerators are the applications of Maxwell's displacement current in energy and sensors. By contrast, electromagnetic generators are built based on Lorentz force driven flow of free electrons in a conductor. This study presents the similarity and differences between pieozoelectric nanogenerator and triboelectric nanogenerator, as well as the classical electromagnetic generator, so that the impact and uniqueness of the nanogenerators can be clearly understood.

Selective laser melting creates complex functional products by selectively melting powder particles of a powder bed layer after layer using a high-energy laser beam. The high-energy density applied to the material and the additive character of the process result in a unique material structure. To investigate this material structure, cube-shaped SLM parts were made using different scanning strategies and investigated by microscopy, X-ray diffraction and electron backscattered diffraction. The experimental results show that the high thermal gradients occurring during SLM lead to a very fine microstructure with submicron-sized cells. Consequently, the AlSi10Mg SLM products have a high hardness of 127 +/- 3 Hv0.5 even without the application of a precipitation hardening treatment. Furthermore, due to the unique solidification conditions and the additive character of the process, a morphological and crystallographic texture is present in the SLM parts. Thanks to the knowledge gathered in this paper on how this texture is formed and how it depends on the process parameters, this texture can be controlled. A strong fibrous < 1 0 0 > texture can be altered into a weak cube texture along the building and scanning directions when a rotation of 90 degrees of the scanning vectors within or between the layers is applied.

J,"Barone, V; Hod, O; Scuseria, GE",Electronic structure and stability of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons,"We present a systematic density functional theory study of the electronic properties, optical spectra, and relative thermodynamic stability of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons. We consider ribbons with different edge nature including bare and hydrogen-terminated ribbons, several crystallographic orientations, and widths up to 3 nm. Our results can be extrapolated to wider ribbons providing a qualitative way of determining the electronic properties of ribbons with widths of practical significance. We predict that in order to produce materials with band gaps similar to Ge or InN, the width of the ribbons must be between 2 and 3 nm. If larger bang gap ribbons are needed (like Si, InP, or GaAs), their width must be reduced to 1-2 nm. According to the extrapolated inverse power law obtained in this work, armchair carbon nanoribbons of widths larger than 8 nm will present a maximum band gap of 0.3 eV, while for ribbons with a width of 80 nm the maximum possible band gap is 0.05 eV. For chiral nanoribbons the band gap oscillations rapidly vanish as a function of the chiral angle indicating that a careful design of their crystallographic nature is an essential ingredient for controlling their electronic properties. Optical excitations show important differences between ribbons with and without hydrogen termination and are found to be sensitive to the carbon nanoribbon width.

After electrostatic assembly, rGO nanosheets are inserted in-between MXene layers. As a result, the self-restacking of MXene nanosheets is effectively prevented, leading to a considerably increased interlayer spacing. Accelerated diffusion of electrolyte ions enables more electroactive sites to become accessible.

However, broken inversion symmetry can lift the chiral degeneracy, leading to topologically rich spin textures such as spin spirals(1,2) and skyrmions(3-5) through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction(6) (DMI). Here we show that in ultrathin metallic ferromagnets sandwiched between a heavy metal and an oxide, the DMI stabilizes chiral domain walls(2,7) (DWs) whose spin texture enables extremely efficient current-driven motion(8-11). We show that spin torque from the spin Hall effect(12-15) drives DWs in opposite directions in Pt/CoFe/MgO and Ta/CoFe/MgO, which can be explained only if the DWs assume a Neel configuration(7,16) with left-handed chirality.

J,"Fasolino, A; Los, JH; Katsnelson, MI",Intrinsic ripples in graphene,"The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is the subject of a long-standing theoretical debate. According to the so-called Mermin-Wagner theorem(1), long-wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order of 2D crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be crumpled(2). These fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes meaning that a 2D membrane can exist but will exhibit strong height fluctuations(2-4). The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal(5,6), and the recent experimental observation of ripples in suspended graphene(7) make these issues especially important. Besides the academic interest, understanding the mechanisms of the stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic transport in this material that is attracting so much interest owing to its unusual Dirac spectrum and electronic properties(8-11). We address the nature of these height fluctuations by means of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for carbon(12). We find that ripples spontaneously appear owing to thermal fluctuations with a size distribution peaked around 80 A which is compatible with experimental findings(7) (50-100 angstrom ).

Herein, we present working inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells for the first time. CsPbI3 normally resides in a yellow non-perovskite phase at room temperature, but by careful processing control and development of a low-temperature phase transition route we have stabilised the material in the black perovskite phase at room temperature. As such, we have fabricated solar cell devices in a variety of architectures, with current-voltage curve measured efficiency up to 2.9% for a planar heterojunction architecture, and stabilised power conversion efficiency of 1.7%. The well-functioning planar junction devices demonstrate long-range electron and hole transport in this material. Importantly, this work identifies that the organic cation is not essential, but simply a convenience for forming lead triiodide perovskites with good photovoltaic properties. We additionally observe significant rate-dependent current-voltage hysteresis in CsPbI3 devices, despite the absence of the organic polar molecule previously thought to be a candidate for inducing hysteresis via ferroelectric polarisation. Due to its space group, CsPbI3 cannot be a ferroelectric material, and thus we can conclude that ferroelectricity is not required to explain current-voltage hysteresis in perovskite solar cells.

Electric-field control over domain structure allows the photovoltaic effect to be reversed in polarity or turned off. This new degree of control, and the high voltages produced, may find application in optoelectronic devices.",10.1038/NNANO.2009.451,565,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Wu, Z; Bei, H; Pharr, GM; George, EP",Temperature dependence of the mechanical properties of equiatomic solid solution alloys with face-centered cubic crystal structures,"Compared to decades-old theories of strengthening in dilute solid solutions, the mechanical behavior of concentrated solid solutions is relatively poorly understood. A special subset of these materials includes alloys in which the constituent elements are present in equal atomic proportions, including the high-entropy alloys of recent interest. A unique characteristic of equiatomic alloys is the absence of ""solvent"" and ""solute"" atoms, resulting in a breakdown of the textbook picture of dislocations moving through a solvent lattice and encountering discrete solute obstacles. To clarify the mechanical behavior of this interesting new class of materials, we investigate here a family of equiatomic binary, ternary and quaternary alloys based on the elements Fe, Ni, Co, Cr and Mn that were previously shown to be single-phase face-centered cubic (fcc) solid solutions. The alloys were arc-melted, drop-cast, homogenized, cold-rolled and recrystallized to produce equiaxed microstructures with comparable grain sizes. Tensile tests were performed at an engineering strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1) at temperatures in the range 77-673 K. Unalloyed fcc Ni was processed similarly and tested for comparison. The flow stresses depend to varying degrees on temperature, with some (e.g. NiCoCr, NiCoCrMn and FeNiCoCr) exhibiting yield and ultimate strengths that increase strongly with decreasing temperature, while others (e.g. NiCo and Ni) exhibit very weak temperature dependencies. To better understand this behavior, the temperature dependencies of the yield strength and strain hardening were analyzed separately. Lattice friction appears to be the predominant component of the temperature-dependent yield stress, possibly because the Peierls barrier height decreases with increasing temperature due to a thermally induced increase of dislocation width. In the early stages of plastic flow (5-13% strain, depending on material), the temperature dependence of strain hardening is due mainly to the temperature dependence of the shear modulus. In all the equiatomic alloys, ductility and strength increase with decreasing temperature down to 77 K. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles, we found that proteins in the media can shield transferrin from binding to both its targeted receptors on cells and soluble transferrin receptors. Although nanoparticles continue to enter cells, the targeting specificity of transferrin is lost.

Although the capability and feasibility of this method have been successfully illustrated with the production of silver nanowires 30-60 nm in diameter and 1-50 mum in length, the growth mechanism of this process is yet to be elucidated. Here we report some progress on this matter: First, electron microscopy studies on microtomed samples indicated that the cross sections of such silver nanowires had a pentagonal shape, together with a 5-fold twinned crystal structure. Second, the side surfaces (bounded by {100} facets) and the ends (bounded by {111} facets) of each nanowire were shown to have significant difference in reactivity toward dithoil molecules, with the side surfaces being completely passivated by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and the ends being partially passivated (or essentially uncovered) by PVP. This result implied that the PVP macromolecules interacted more strongly with the {100} planes than with the {111} planes of silver. On the basis of these new results, we proposed that each silver nanowire evolved from a multiply twinned nanoparticle (MTP) of silver with the assistance of PVP at the initial stage of the Ostwald ripening process. The anisotropic growth was maintained by selectively covering the {100} facets with PVP while leaving the {111} facets largely uncovered by PVP and thus highly reactive.",10.1021/nl034312m,573,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

Thermoelectric materials are being investigated for electricity production from waste heat (co-generation) and natural heat sources. For temperatures below 200 degrees C, the best commercially available inorganic semiconductors are bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3)-based alloys, which possess a figure of merit ZT close to one(1). Most of the recently discovered thermoelectric materials with ZT > 2 exhibit one common property, namely their low lattice thermal conductivities(2,3). Nevertheless, a high ZT value is not enough to create a viable technology platform for energy harvesting. To generate electricity from large volumes of warm fluids, heat exchangers must be functionalized with TEGs. This requires thermoelectric materials that are readily synthesized, air stable, environmentally friendly and solution processable to create patterns on large areas.

The chemistry of the samples is characterized using elemental analysis, Boehm titration, potentiometric titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Sorption of nitrogen and carbon dioxide is used to determine the textural properties. The results show that the surface chemistry is affected by the type of nitrogen precursor and the specific groups present on the surface before the treatment leading to the incorporation of nitrogen. Analysis of the electrochemical behavior of urea- and melamine-treated samples reveal pseudocapacitance from both the oxygen and the nitrogen containing functional groups located in the pores larger than 10 angstrom. On the other hand, pores between 5 angstrom and 6 angstrom are most effective in a double-layer formation, which correlates well with the size of hydrated ions.

One of the main factors that has hampered widespread practical use of DSC is the poor thermostability encountered so far with these devices. Here we show a DSC with unprecedented stable performance under both thermal stress and soaking with light, matching the durability criteria applied to silicon solar cells for outdoor applications. The cell uses the amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizer cis-RuLL'(SCN)(2) (L = 4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine, L' = 4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine) in conjunction with a quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte, reaching an efficiency of >6% in full sunlight (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm(-2)). A convenient and versatile new route is reported for the synthesis of the heteroleptic ruthenium complex, which plays a key role in achieving the high-temperature stability.

J,"Kim, HS; Gibbs, ZM; Tang, YL; Wang, H; Snyder, GJ",Characterization of Lorenz number with Seebeck coefficient measurement,"In analyzing zT improvements due to lattice thermal conductivity (kappa(L)) reduction, electrical conductivity (sigma) and total thermal conductivity (kappa(Total)) are often used to estimate the electronic component of the thermal conductivity (kappa(E)) and in turn kappa(L) from kappa(L) = similar to kappa(Total) - L sigma T. TheWiedemann-Franz law, kappa(E) = L sigma T, where L is Lorenz number, is widely used to estimate kappa(E) from sigma measurements. It is a common practice to treat L as a universal factor with 2.44 x 10(-8) W Omega K-2 (degenerate limit). However, significant deviations from the degenerate limit (approximately 40% or more for Kane bands) are known to occur for non-degenerate semiconductors where L converges to 1.5 x 10(-8) W Omega K-2 for acoustic phonon scattering. The decrease in L is correlated with an increase in thermopower (absolute value of Seebeck coefficient (S)). Thus, a first order correction to the degenerate limit of L can be based on the measured thermopower, vertical bar S vertical bar, independent of temperature or doping. We propose the equation: L = 1.5 + exp [ -vertical bar S vertical bar/116] (where L is in 10(-8) W Omega K-2 and S in mu V/K) as a satisfactory approximation for L. This equation is accurate within 5% for single parabolic band/acoustic phonon scattering assumption and within 20% for PbSe, PbS, PbTe, Si0.8Ge0.2 where more complexity is introduced, such as non-parabolic Kane bands, multiple bands, and/or alternate scattering mechanisms. The use of this equation for L rather than a constant value (when detailed band structure and scattering mechanism is not known) will significantly improve the estimation of lattice thermal conductivity.

Considering the importance of protein interactions with injected colloidal dug carriers with regard to their in vivo fate, we analysed plasma protein adsorption onto biodegradable PEG-coated poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). A series of corona/core nanoparticles of sizes 160-270 nm were prepared from diblock PEG-PLA, PEG-PLGA and PEG-PCL and from PEG-PLA:PLA blends. The PEG Mw was varied from 2000-20 000 g/mole and the particles were prepared using different PEG contents. It was thus possible to study the influence of the PEG corona thickness and density, as well as the influence of the nature of the core (PLA, PLGA or PCL), on the competitive plasma protein adsorption, zeta potential and particle uptake by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. 2-D PAGE studies showed that plasma protein adsorption on PEG-coated PLA nanospheres strongly depends on the PEG molecular weight (Mw) (i.e. PEG chain length at the particle surface) as well as on the PEG content in the particles (i.e. PEG chain density at the surface of the particles). Whatever the thickness or the density of the corona, the qualitative composition of the plasma protein adsorption patterns was very similar, showing that adsorption was governed by interaction with a PLA surface protected more or less by PEG chains. The main spots on the gels were albumin, fibrinogen, IgG, Ig light chains, and the apolipoproteins apoA-I and apoE. For particles made of PEG-PLA45K with different PEG Mw, a maximal reduction in protein adsorption was found for a PEG Mw of 5000 g/mole. For nanospheres differing in their PEG content from 0.5 to 20 wt %, a PEG content between 2 and 5 wt % was determined as a threshold value for optimal protein resistance. When increasing the PEG content in the nanoparticles above 5 wt % no further reduction in protein adsorption was achieved. Phagocytosis by PMN studied using chemiluminescence and zeta potential data agreed well with these findings: the same PEG surface density threshold was found to ensure simultaneously efficient steric stabilization and to avoid the uptake by PMN cells. Supposing all the PEG chains migrate to the surface, this would correspond to a distance of about 1.5 nm between two terminally attached PEG chains in the covering 'brush'. Particles from PEG5K-PLA45K, PEG5K-PLGA45K; and PEG5K-PCL45K copolymers enabled to study the influence of the core on plasma protein adsorption, all other parameters (corona thickness and density) being kept constant. Adsorption patterns were in good qualitative agreement with each other. Only a few protein species were exclusively present just on one type of nanoparticle. However, the extent of proteins adsorbed differed in a large extent from one particle to another. In vivo studies could help elucidating the role of the type and amount of proteins adsorbed on the fate of the nanoparticles after intraveinous administration, as a function of the nature of their core. These results could be useful in the design of long circulating intravenously injectable biodegradable drug carriers endowed with protein resistant properties and low phagocytic uptake.

We believe this Is the highest conductivity ratio ever observed for nanostructured films and is matched only by doped metal oxide films. These nanowire films are electromechanically very robust, with all but the thinnest films showing no change in sheet resistance when flexed over >1000 cycles. Such results make these films ideal as replacements for indium tin oxide as transparent electrodes.

In neuromorphic engineering(5,6), emulation of known neural behaviour has proven to be difficult to implement in software because of the highly complex interconnected nature of thought processes. Here we report the discovery of a Ag2S inorganic synapse, which emulates the synaptic functions of both STP and LTP characteristics through the use of input pulse repetition time. The structure known as an atomic switch(7,8), operating at critical voltages, stores information as STP with a spontaneous decay of conductance level in response to intermittent input stimuli, whereas frequent stimulation results in a transition to LTP. The Ag2S inorganic synapse has interesting characteristics with analogies to an individual biological synapse, and achieves dynamic memorization in a single device without the need of external preprogramming. A psychological model related to the process of memorizing and forgetting is also demonstrated using the inorganic synapses. Our Ag2S element indicates a breakthrough in mimicking synaptic behaviour essential for the further creation of artificial neural systems that emulate characteristics of human memory.",10.1038/NMAT3054,612,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The structures of the two forms of UiO-66 are refined through an interactive XRPD/EXAFS approach and validated by ab initio calculations. Experimental and calculated IR spectra are reported and compared to enlighten the nature of vibrational modes upon dehydroxylation and to show the complete reversibility of the dehydration/hydration phenomenon.

Here, we report on the realization of a Nb-InSb nanowire-Nb hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap Delta(InSb) similar to 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value, at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is E-z similar to Delta(Insb), is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the InSb nanowire.",10.1021/nl303758w,617,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Kempton, W; Tomic, J",Vehicle-to-grid power fundamentals: Calculating capacity and net revenue,"As the light vehicle fleet moves to electric drive (hybrid, battery, and fuel cell vehicles), an opportunity opens for ""vehicle-to-grid"" (V2G) power. This article defines the three vehicle types that can produce V2G power, and the power markets they can sell into. V2G only makes sense if the vehicle and power market are matched. For example, V2G appears to be unsuitable for baseload power-the constant round-the-clock electricity supply-because baseload power can be provided more cheaply by large generators, as it is today. Rather, V2G's greatest near-term promise is for quick-response, high-value electric services. These quick-response electric services are purchased to balance constant fluctuations in load and to adapt to unexpected equipment failures; they account for 5-10% of electric cost-$12 billion per year in the US. This article develops equations to calculate the capacity for grid power from three types of electric drive vehicles. These equations are applied to evaluate revenue and costs for these vehicles to supply electricity to three electric markets (peak power, spinning reserves, and regulation). The results suggest that the engineering rationale and economic motivation for V2G power are compelling. The societal advantages of developing V2G include an additional revenue stream for cleaner vehicles, increased stability and reliability of the electric grid, lower electric system costs, and eventually, inexpensive storage and backup for renewable electricity.

Indeed, work over the past decade into such multi-principal-element alloys, which have fittingly been coined as ""high-entropy alloys"" (HE alloys), has found them to form simple phases with nanocrystalline and even amorphous structures.

The constants in the LJ potential are different for graphene-graphene and C-60-C-60 interactions. From these, the constants for tube-C-60 interactions were estimated using averaging rules from the theory of dispersion forces. For tubes in ropes, the cohesive energy per unit length, the compressibility, and the equilibrium separation distance were computed as a function of tube radius. For a C-60 molecule interacting with tubes, the binding energy inside a tube was much higher than on a tube or at the tube mouth. Within a tube, the binding energy was highest at a spherically capped end. The potential energies for tubes of all radii, as well as for interactions between C-60 molecules, for a C-60 molecule outside of a nanotube, between a C-60 molecule and a graphene sheet, and between graphene sheets, all fell on the same curve when plotted in terms of certain reduced parameters.

Our experimental data revealed that luminescence lifetimes up to 1.35 s, which are several orders of magnitude longer than those of conventional organic fluorophores(6,7), can be realized under ambient conditions.

Skyrmion lattices were initially observed in bulk non-centrosymmetric crystals, but have more recently been noted in ultrathin films, where their existence is explained by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced by the proximity to an adjacent layer with strong spin-orbit coupling. Skyrmions are promising candidates as information carriers for future information-processing devices due to their small size (down to a few nanometres) and to the very small current densities needed to displace skyrmion lattices. However, any practical application will probably require the creation, manipulation and detection of isolated skyrmions in magnetic thin-film nanostructures.

After corrections of noncompensated solution resistance from ac impedance spectroscopy and of hydrogen mass transport in the HOR branch, the kinetic current densities were fitted to the Butler-Volmer equation using a transfer coefficient of alpha = 0.5, from which HOR/HER exchange current densities on Pt(pc) and Pt/C were obtained, and the HOR/HER mechanisms in alkaline solution were discussed. Unlike the HOR/HER rates on Pt electrodes in alkaline solution, the HOR/HER rates on a Pt electrode in 0.1 M HClO(4) were limited entirely by hydrogen diffusion, which renders the quantification of the HOR/HER kinetics impossible by conventional RDE measurements. The simulation of the hydrogen anode performance based on the specific exchange current densities of the HOR/HER at 80 degrees C illustrates that in addition to the oxygen reduction reaction cell voltage loss on the cathode, the slow HOR kinetics are projected to cause significant anode potential losses in alkaline fuel cells for low platinum loadings (> 130 mV at 0.05 mg(Pt)/cm(anode)(2) and 1.5 A/cm(anode)(2)), contrary to what is reported for proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

These include: battery state-of-charge, power fade, capacity fade, and instantaneous available power.

In a series of three papers, we propose methods, based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF), that are able to accomplish these goals for a lithium ion polymer battery pack. We expect that they will also work well on other battery chemistries. These papers cover the required mathematical background, cell modeling and system identification requirements, and the final solution, together with results.

Plastic deformation by slip and twinning are considered as competitive mechanisms. The twinning stress is equated to the slip stress based on the plastic flow by thermally assisted movement of dislocations over obstacles, which leads to successful prediction of the slip-twinning transition. The model is applied to body centered cubic, face centered cubic, and hexagonal metals and alloys: Fe, Cu, brasses, and Ti, respectively. A constitutive expression for the twinning stress in BCC metals is developed using dislocation emission from a source and the formation of pile-ups, as rate-controlling mechanism. Employing an Eshelby-type analysis, the critical size of twin nucleus and twinning stress are correlated to the twin-boundary energy, which is directly related to the stacking-fault energy (SFE) for FCC metals. The effects of grain size and SFE are examined and the results indicate that the grain-scale pile-ups are not the source of the stress concentrations giving rise to twinning in FCC metals. The constitutive description of the slip-twinning transition are incorporated into the Weertman-Ashby deformation mechanism maps, thereby enabling the introduction of a twinning domain.

This groundbreaking approach to temporary metallic implants is one of the latest developments in biomaterials science that is being rediscovered. It is a challenging topic, and several secrets still remain that might revolutionize various biomedical implants currently in clinical use. Magnesium alloys were investigated as implant materials long ago. A very early clinical report was given in 1878 by the physician Edward C. Huse. He used magnesium wires as ligature for bleeding vessels. Magnesium alloys for clinical use were explored during the last two centuries mainly by surgeons with various clinical backgrounds, such as cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and general surgery. Nearly all patients benefited from the treatment with magnesium implants. Although most patients experienced subcutaneous gas cavities caused by rapid implant corrosion, most patients had no pain and almost no infections were observed during the postoperative follow-up.

J,"Agnew, SR; Duygulu, √ñ",Plastic anisotropy and the role of non-basal slip in magnesium alloy AZ31B,"Mechanistic explanations for the plastic behavior of a wrought magnesium alloy are developed using a combination of experimental and simulation techniques. Parameters affecting the practical sheet formability, such as strain hardening rate, strain rate sensitivity, the degree of anisotropy, and the stresses and strains at fracture, are examined systematically by conducting tensile tests of variously oriented samples at a range of temperatures (room temperature to 250 degreesC and strain rates (10(-5)-0.1s(-1)). Polycrystal plasticity simulations are used to model the observed anisotropy and texture evolution. Strong in-plane anisotropy observed at low temperatures is attributed to the initial texture and the greater than anticipated non-basal cross-slip of dislocations with dropadrop type Burgers vectors. The agreement between the measured and simulated anisotropy and texture is further validated by direct observations of the dislocation microstructures using transmission electron microscopy. The increase in the ductility with temperature is accompanied by a decrease in the flow stress, an increase in the strain rate sensitivity, and a decrease in the normal anisotropy. Polycrystal simulations indicate that an increased activity of non-basal, dropc + adrop, dislocations provides a self-consistent explanation for the observed changes in the anisotropy with increasing temperature.

J,"Gartner, E","Industrially interesting approaches to ""low-CO<sub>2</sub>"" cements","This article discusses the practicality of replacing portland cements with alternative hydraulic cements that could result in lower total CO2 emissions per unit volume of concrete of equivalent performance. Currently, the cement industry is responding rapidly to the perceived societal need for reduced CO2 emissions by increasing the production of blended portland cements using supplementary cementitious materials that are principally derived from industrial by-products, such as blast-furnace slags and coal combustion fly ashes. However, the supplies of such by-products of suitable quality are limited. An alternative solution is to use natural pozzolans, although they must still be activated either by portland cement or lime or by alkali silicates or hydroxides, the production of all of which still involves significant CO2 emissions. Moreover, concretes based on activated pozzolans often require curing at elevated temperatures, which significantly limits their field of application. The most promising alternative cementing systems for general concrete applications at ambient temperatures currently appear to be those based at least in part on calcium sulfates, the availability of which is increasing due to the widespread implementation of sulfur dioxide emission controls. These include calcium sulfoaluminate-belite-ferrite cements of the type developed in China under the generic name ""Third Cement Series"" (TCS) and other similar systems that make good use of the potential synergies among calcium sulfate, calcium silicate and calcium aluminate hydrates. However, a great deal more research is required to solve significant unresolved processing and reactivity questions and to establish the durability of concretes made from such cements. If we are to use these potentially more CO2-efficient technologies on a large enough scale to have a significant global impact, we will also have to develop the performance data needed to justify changes to construction codes and standards.

To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096 eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082 eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of similar to 3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.",10.1038/npjcompumats.2015.10,658,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Important MMC applications in the ground transportation (auto and rail), thermal management, aerospace, industrial, recreational and infrastructure industries have been enabled by functional properties that include high structural efficiency, excellent wear resistance, and attractive thermal and electrical characteristics. A suite of challenging technical issues has been overcome, including affordable primary and secondary processing, material design and development methodologies, and characterization and control of interfacial properties. This article describes the technological features that characterize the MMC industry. Matrix/reinforcement systems and primary and secondary processes of commercial significance will be broadly described. Several metrics that underscore the growing maturity of the MMC industry will be discussed, including the emergence of a second tier support industry and the growth of standardized materials and methods.

However, their use in ion sieving and desalination technologies is limited by a permeation cutoff of similar to 9 angstrom (ref. 4), which is larger than the diameters of hydrated ions of common salts(4,6). The cutoff is determined by the interlayer spacing (d) of similar to 13.5 angstrom, typical for graphene oxide laminates that swell in water(2,4). Achieving smaller d for the laminates immersed in water has proved to be a challenge. Here, we describe how to control d by physical confinement and achieve accurate and tunable ion sieving. Membranes with d from similar to 9.8 angstrom to 6.4 angstrom are demonstrated, providing a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions. In this regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with energy barriers of similar to 10-100 kJ mol(-1) depending on d. Importantly, permeation rates decrease exponentially with decreasing sieve size but water transport is weakly affected (by a factor of <2). The latter is attributed to a low barrier for the entry of water molecules and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries.

Here we used carbon isotope labeling in conjunction with Raman spectroscopic mapping to track carbon during the growth process. The data clearly show that at high temperatures sequentially introduced isotopic carbon diffuses into the Ni first, mixes, and then segregates and precipitates at the surface of Ni forming graphene and/or graphite with a uniform mixture of C-12 and C-13 as determined by the peak position of the Raman G-band peak. On the other hand, graphene growth on Cu is clearly by surface adsorption where the spatial distribution of C-12 and C-13 follows the precursor time sequence and the linear growth rate ranges from about 1 to as high as 6 mu m/min depending upon Cu grain orientation.

Design/methodology/approach - First, the origin of residual stresses is explored and a simple theoretical model is developed to predict residual stress distributions. Next, experimental methods are used to measure the residual stress profiles in a set of test samples produced with different process parameters. Findings - Residual stresses are found to be very large in SLM parts. In general, the residual stress profile consists of two zones of large tensile stresses at the top and bottom of the part, and a large zone of intermediate compressive stress in between. The most important parameters determining the magnitude and shape of the residual stress profiles are the material properties, the sample and substrate height, the laser scanning strategy and the heating conditions. Research limitations/implications - All experiments were conducted on parts produced from stainless steel powder (316L) and quantitative results cannot be simply extrapolated to other materials. However, most qualitative results can still be generalized. Originality/value - This paper can serve as an aid in understanding the importance of residual stresses in SLS/SLM and other additive manufacturing processes involving a localized heat input.

A long-held view is that unstable electrodeposition is a consequence of inherent characteristics of these metals and their inability to form uniform electrodeposits on surfaces with inevitable defects. We report on electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolytes. We find that simple liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends exhibit stable long-term cycling at room temperature, often with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge and thousands of operating hours. We rationalize these observations with the help of surface energy data for the electrolyte/lithium interface and impedance analysis of the interface during different stages of cell operation.

In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting ""universal"" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a ""plasmon ruler equation"" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band.

J,"Lim, CW; Zhang, G; Reddy, JN",A higher-order nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and its applications in wave propagation,"In recent years there have been many papers that considered the effects of material length scales in the study of mechanics of solids at micro- and/or nano-scales. There are a number of approaches and, among them, one set of papers deals with Eringen's differential nonlocal model and another deals with the strain gradient theories. The modified couple stress theory, which also accounts for a material length scale, is a form of a strain gradient theory. The large body of literature that has come into existence in the last several year has created significant confusion among researchers about the length scales that these various theories contain. The present paper has the objective of establishing the fact that the length scales present in nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory describe two entirely different physical characteristics of materials and structures at nanoscale. By using two principle kernel functions, the paper further presents a theory with application examples which relates the classical nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and it results in a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient theory. In this theory, a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient elasticity system which considers higher-order stress gradients and strain gradient nonlocality is proposed. It is based on the nonlocal effects of the strain field and first gradient strain field. This theory intends to generalize the classical nonlocal elasticity theory by introducing a higher-order strain tensor with nonlocality into the stored energy function. The theory is distinctive because the classical nonlocal stress theory does not include nonlocality of higher-order stresses while the common strain gradient theory only considers local higher-order strain gradients without nonlocal effects in a global sense. By establishing the constitutive relation within the thermodynamic framework, the governing equations of equilibrium and all boundary conditions are derived via the variational approach. Two additional kinds of parameters, the higher-order nonlocal parameters and the nonlocal gradient length coefficients are introduced to account for the size-dependent characteristics of nonlocal gradient materials at nanoscale. To illustrate its application values, the theory is applied for wave propagation in a nonlocal strain gradient system and the new dispersion relations derived are presented through examples for wave propagating in Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko nanobeams. The numerical results based on the new nonlocal strain gradient theory reveal some new findings with respect to lattice dynamics and wave propagation experiment that could not be matched by both the classical nonlocal stress model and the contemporary strain gradient theory. Thus, this higher-order nonlocal strain gradient model provides an explanation to some observations in the classical and nonlocal stress theories as well as the strain gradient theory in these aspects.

J,"Nakagawa, N; Hwang, HY; Muller, DA",Why some interfaces cannot be sharp,"A central goal of modern materials physics and nanoscience is the control of materials and their interfaces to atomic dimensions. For interfaces between polar and nonpolar layers, this goal is thwarted by a polar catastrophe that forces an interfacial reconstruction. In traditional semiconductors, this reconstruction is achieved by an atomic disordering and stoichiometry change at the interface, but a new option is available in multivalent oxides: if the electrons can move, the atoms do not have to. Using atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy, we have examined the microscopic distribution of charge and ions across the (001) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. We find that there is a fundamental asymmetry between the ionically compensated AlO2/SrO/TiO2 interface, and the electronically compensated AlO2/ LaO/TiO2 interface, both in interfacial sharpness and charge density. This suggests a general strategy to design sharp interfaces, remove interfacial screening charges, control the band offset and, hence, markedly improve the performance of oxide devices.",10.1038/nmat1569,704,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

J,"Nguyen, KT; West, JL",Photopolymerizable hydrogels for tissue engineering applications,"Photopolymerized hydrogels are being investigated for a number of tissue engineering applications because of the ability to form these materials in situ in a minimally invasive manner such as by injection. In addition, hydrogels, three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that are able to swell large amounts of water, can be made to resemble the physical characteristics of soft tissues. Hydrogel materials also generally exhibit high permeability and good biocompatibility making, these materials attractive for use in cell encapsulation and tissue engineering applications. A number of hydrogel materials can be formed via photopolymerization processes mild enough to be carried out in the presence of living cells. This allows one to homogeneously seed cells throughout the scaffold material and to form hydrogels in situ. This review presents advantages of photopolymerization of hydrogels and describes the photoinitiators and materials in current use.

These materials are alkali-activated aluminosilicates, with a much smaller CO2 footprint than traditional Portland cements, and display very good strength and chemical resistance properties as well as a variety of other potentially valuable characteristics. It is widely known that the widespread uptake of geopolymer technology is hindered by a number of factors, in particular issues to do with a lack of long-term (20+ years) durability data in this relatively young research field. There are also difficulties in compliance with some regulatory standards in Europe and North America, specifically those defining minimum clinker content levels or chemical compositions in cements. Work on resolving these issues is ongoing, with accelerated durability testing showing highly promising results with regard to salt scaling and freeze-thaw cycling. Geopolymer concrete compliance with performance-based standards is comparable to that of most other high-strength concretes. Issues to do with the distinction between geopolymers synthesised for cement replacement applications and those tailored for niche ceramic applications are also discussed. Particular attention is paid to the role of free alkali and silicate in poorly-formulated systems and its deleterious effects on concrete performance, which necessitates a more complete understanding of the chemistry of geopolymerisation for the technology to be successfully applied. The relationship between CO, footprint and composition in comparison with Portland-based cements is quantified. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we show that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, can deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice. To reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, mouse immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were used for exosome production. Tumor targeting was facilitated by engineering the imDCs to express a well-characterized exosomal membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused to alpha v integrin-specific iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC). Purified exosomes from imDCs were loaded with Dox via electroporation, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 20%. iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to am integrin-positive breast cancer cells in vitro as demonstrated by confocal imaging and flow cytometry. Intravenously injected targeted exosomes delivered Dox specifically to tumor tissues, leading to inhibition of tumor growth without overt toxicity. Our results suggest that exosomes modified by targeting ligands can be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications.

J,"Blomgren, GE",The Development and Future of Lithium Ion Batteries,"This year, the battery industry celebrates the 25th anniversary of the introduction of the lithium ion rechargeable battery by Sony Corporation. The discovery of the system dates back to earlier work by Asahi Kasei in Japan, which used a combination of lower temperature carbons for the negative electrode to prevent solvent degradation and lithium cobalt dioxide modified somewhat from Goodenough's earlier work. The development by Sony was carried out within a few years by bringing together technology in film coating from their magnetic tape division and electrochemical technology from their battery division. The past 25 years has shown rapid growth in the sales and in the benefits of lithium ion in comparison to all the earlier rechargeable battery systems.

The other potential was constructed previously using a traditional scheme. Excellent agreement is observed between ab initio, TB, and EAM results for the energies and stability of several nonequilibrium structures of Cu, as well as for energies along deformation paths between different structures.

J,"Vrancken, B; Thijs, L; Kruth, JP; Van Humbeeck, J",Heat treatment of Ti6Al4V produced by Selective Laser Melting: Microstructure and mechanical properties,"The present work shows that optimization of mechanical properties via heat treatment of parts produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is profoundly different compared to conventionally processed Ti6Al4V. In order to obtain optimal mechanical properties, specific treatments are necessary due to the specific microstructure resulting from the SLM process. SLM is an additive manufacturing technique through which components are built by selectively melting powder layers with a focused laser beam. The process is characterized by short laser-powder interaction times and localized high heat input, which leads to steep thermal gradients, rapid solidification and fast cooling. In this research, the effect of several heat treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V processed by SLM is studied. A comparison is made with the effect of these treatments on hot forged and subsequently mill annealed Ti6Al4V with an original equiaxed microstructure. For SLM produced parts, the original martensite alpha' phase is converted to a lamellar mixture of alpha and beta for heat treating temperatures below the beta-transus (995 degrees C), but features of the original microstructure are maintained. Treated above the beta-transus, extensive grain growth occurs and large beta grains are formed which transform to lamellar alpha + beta upon cooling. Post treating at 850 degrees C for 2 h, followed by furnace cooling increased the ductility of SLM parts to 12.84 +/- 1.36%, compared to 7.36 +/- 1.32% for as-built parts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

J,"Li, ZJ; Gu, XN; Lou, SQ; Zheng, YF",The development of binary Mg-Ca alloys for use as biodegradable materials within bone,"Binary Mg-Ca alloys with various Ca contents were fabricated under different working conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and optical microscopy observations showed that Mg-xCa (x = 1-3 wt%) alloys were composed of two phases, alpha(Mg) and Mg2Ca. The results of tensile tests and in vitro corrosion tests indicated that the mechanical properties could be adjusted by controlling the Ca content and processing treatment. The yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation decreased with increasing Ca content. The UTS and elongation of as-cast Mg-1Ca alloy (71.38 +/- 3.01 MPa and 1.87 +/- 0.14%) were largely improved after hot rolling (166.7 +/- 3.01 MPa and 3 +/- 0.78%) and hot extrusion (239.63 +/- 7.21 MPa and 10.63 +/- 0.64%). The in vitro corrosion test in simulated body fluid (SBF) indicated that the microstructure and working history of Mg-xCa alloys strongly affected their corrosion behaviors. An increasing content of Mg2Ca phase led to a higher corrosion rate whereas hot rolling and hot extrusion could reduce it. The cytotoxicity evaluation using L-929 cells revealed that Mg-1Ca alloy did not induce toxicity to cells, and the viability of cells for Mg-1Ca alloy extraction medium was better than that of control. Moreover, Mg-1Ca alloy pins, with commercial pure Ti pins as control, were implanted into the left and right rabbit femoral shafts, respectively, and observed for 1, 2 and 3 months. High activity of ostroblast and osteocytes were observed around the Mg-1Ca alloy pins as shown by hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections. Radiographic examination revealed that the Mg-1Ca alloy pins gradually degraded in vivo within 90 days and the newly formed bone was clearly seen at month 3. Both the in vitro and in vivo corrosion suggested that a mixture of Mg(OH)(2) and hydroxyapatite formed on the surface of Mg-1Ca alloy with the extension of immersion/implantation time. In addition, no significant difference (p > 0.05) of serum magnesium was detected at different degradation stages. All these results revealed that Mg-1Ca alloy had the acceptable biocompatibility as a new kind of biodegradable implant material. Based on the above results, a solid alloy/liquid solution interface model was also proposed to interpret the biocorrosion process and the associated hydroxyapatite mineralization.

The prepared uGNMs show well packed layer structure formed by CCG sheets, as characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The performance of the uGNMs for water treatment was evaluated on a dead end filtration device and the pure water flux of uGNMs was high (21.8 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)). The uGNMs show high retention (>99%) for organic dyes and moderate retention (approximate to 20-60%) for ion salts. The rejection mechanism of this kind of negatively charged membranes is intensively studied, and the results reveal that physical sieving and electrostatic interaction dominate the rejection process. Because of the ultrathin nature of uGNMs, 34 mg of CCG is sufficient for making a square meter of nanofiltration membrane, indicating that this new generation graphene-based nanofiltration technology would be resource saving and cost-effective.

In this study, the role of important factors such as solution ionic strength, pH, and particle surface chemistry that control nanoparticle dispersion was examined. The size and zeta potential of four TiO2 and three quantum dot samples dispersed in different solutions (including one physiological medium) were characterized. For 15 nm TiO2 dispersions, the increase of ionic strength from 0.001 M to 0.1 M led to a 50-fold increase in the hydrodynamic diameter, and the variation of pH resulted in significant change of particle surface charge and the hydrodynamic size. It was shown that both adsorbing multiply charged ions (e.g., pyrophosphate ions) onto the TiO2 nanoparticle surface and coating quantum dot nanocrystals with polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol) suppressed agglomeration and stabilized the dispersions. DLVO theory was used to qualitatively understand nanoparticle dispersion stability. A methodology using different ultrasonication techniques (bath and probe) was developed to distinguish agglomerates from aggregates (strong bonds), and to estimate the extent of particle agglomeration. Probe ultrasonication performed better than bath ultrasonication in dispersing TiO2 agglomerates when the stabilizing agent sodium pyrophosphate was used.

Recently, field-effect transistors have been demonstrated experimentally using a mechanically exfoliated MoS2 monolayer, showing promising potential for next generation electronics. Here we project the ultimate performance limit of MoS2 transistors by using nonequilibrium Green's function based quantum transport simulations.

Our comparison of monolayer MoS2 transistors to the state-of-the-art III-V materials based transistors, reveals that while MoS2 transistors may not be ideal for high-performance applications due to heavier electron effective mass (m* = 0.45m(0)) and a lower mobility, they can be an attractive alternative for low power applications thanks to the large band gap and the excellent electrostatic integrity inherent in a two-dimensional system.",10.1021/nl2018178,732,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Greer, JR; De Hosson, JTM",Plasticity in small-sized metallic systems: Intrinsic versus extrinsic size effect,"A material strength depends on its microstructure, which in turn, is controlled by an engineering process. Strengthening mechanisms like work hardening, precipitate, and grain boundary strengthening can alter the strength of a material in a predictive, quantitative manner and are readily linked to the deformation mechanism. This quantification strongly depends on the characteristic length scale of a particular microstructure, thereby dictating bulk material's strength as a function of, for example, grain or precipitate size, twin boundary spacing, or dislocation density. This microstructural, or intrinsic, size governs the mechanical properties and post-elastic material deformation at all sample dimensions, as the classical definition of ""ultimate tensile strength"" deems it to be ""an intensive property, therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen."" Yet in the last 5 years, the vast majority of uniaxial deformation experiments and computations on small-scale metallic structures unambiguously demonstrated that at the micron and sub-micron scales, this definition no longer holds true. In fact, it has been shown that in single crystals the ultimate tensile strength and the yield strength scale with external sample size in a power law fashion, sometimes attaining a significant fraction of material's theoretical strength, and exhibiting the now-commonly-known phenomenon ""smaller is stronger."" Understanding of this ""extrinsic size effect"" at small scales is not yet mature and is currently a topic of rigorous investigations. As both the intrinsic (i.e. microstructural) and extrinsic (i.e. sample size) dimensions play a non-trivial role in the mechanical properties and material deformation mechanisms, it is critical to develop an understanding of their interplay and mutual effects on the mechanical properties and material deformation, especially in small-scale structures. This review focuses on providing an overview of metal-based material classes whose properties as a function of external size have been investigated and provides a critical discussion on the combined effects of intrinsic and extrinsic sizes on the material deformation behavior.

We show that in this high-T regime, the localization transition may be studied numerically through exact diagonalization of small systems. We obtain spectra for one-dimensional lattice models of interacting spinless fermions in a random potential. As expected, the spectral statistics of finite-size samples cross over from those of orthogonal random matrices in the diffusive regime at weak random potential to Poisson statistics in the localized regime at strong randomness. However, these data show deviations from simple one-parameter finite-size scaling: the apparent mobility edge '' drifts '' as the system's size is increased.

J,"Assadi, H; G√§rtner, F; Stoltenhoff, T; Kreye, H",Bonding mechanism in cold gas spraying,"Cold gas spraying is a relatively new coating process by which coatings can be produced without significant heating of the sprayed powder. In contrast to the well-known thermal spray processes such as flame, arc, and plasma spraying, in cold spraying there is no melting of particles prior to impact on the substrate. The adhesion of particles in this process is due solely to their kinetic energy upon impact. Experimental investigations show that successful bonding is achieved only above a critical particle velocity, whose value depends on the temperature and the thermomechanical properties of the sprayed material. This paper supplies a hypothesis for the bonding of particles in cold gas spraying, by making use of numerical modelling of the deformation during particle impact. The results of modelling are assessed with respect to the experimentally evaluated critical velocities, impact morphologies and strengths of coatings. The analysis demonstrates that bonding can be attributed to adiabatic shear instabilities which occur at the particle surface at or beyond the critical velocity. On the basis of this criterion, critical velocities can be predicted and used to optimise process parameters for various materials. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the observed decrease in electrophosphorescent intensity in organic light-emitting devices at high current densities [M. A. Baldo et al., Nature 395, 151 (1998)] is principally due to triplet-triplet annihilation. Using parameters extracted from transient phosphorescent decays, we model the quantum efficiency versus current characteristics of electrophosphorescent devices. It is found that the increase in luminance observed for phosphors with short excited-state lifetimes is due primarily to reduced triplet-triplet annihilation. We also derive an expression for a limiting current density (J(0)) above which triplet-triplet annihilation dominates.

One approach that shows immense potential is based on the biosynthesis of nanoparticles using biological micro-organisms such as bacteria. In this laboratory, we have concentrated on the use of fungi in the intracellular production of metal nanoparticles. As part of our investigation, we have observed that aqueous silver ions when exposed to the fungus Fusarium oxysporum are reduced in solution, thereby leading to the formation of an extremely stable silver hydrosol. The silver nanoparticles are in the range of 5-15 nm in dimensions and are stabilized in solution by proteins secreted by the fungus.

Information to the degree of functionalisation was ascertained by argon ion bombardment of the samples followed by XPS analysis to detect the functional groups, the percentage atomic concentration of various elements present and whether or not the detected functional groups imposed a chemical shift on the CNT atoms. The results show that true chemical functionalisation was achieved and by argon ion bombardment these functional groups can be altered relative to the C Is carbon atoms of the CNT. The choice of chemicals used for functionalisation, the techniques employed and the types of nanotubes treated are important factors in chemical characterisation. The carbon atom on the nanotube ring to which the functional group (atom) is bonded, the chirality of the CNT, the electronegativity of the functional group, the bond type and whether the CNT is single-wall or multi-wall, or cut (short) could play a role in determining the chemical shift on the CNTs atoms.

In addition, platinum surface area loss for a short-stack of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) operated at open-circuit voltage (similar to 0.95 V) was shown to be higher than another operated under load (similar to 0.75 V). Both findings suggest that the formation of soluble platinum species (such as Pt2+) plays an important role in platinum surface loss in PEMFC electrodes. As accelerated platinum surface area loss in the cathode (from 63 to 23 m(2)/g(Pt) in similar to 100 h) was observed upon potential cycling, a cycled membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cathode was examined in detail by incidence angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to reveal processes responsible for observed platinum loss. In this study, TEM data and analyses of Pt/C catalyst and cross-sectional MEA cathode samples unambiguously confirmed that coarsening of platinum particles occurred via two different processes: (i) Ostwald ripening on carbon at the nanometer scale, which is responsible for platinum particle coarsening from similar to 3 to similar to 6 nm on carbon, and (ii) migration of soluble platinum species in the ionomer phase at the micrometer scale, chemical reduction of these species by crossover H-2 molecules, and precipitation of platinum particles in the cathode ionomer phase, which reduces the weight of platinum on carbon. It was estimated that each process contributed to similar to 50% of the overall platinum area loss of the potential cycled electrode.

For an energy-efficient HER, a catalyst must be able to trigger proton reduction with minimal overpotential(4) and have fast kinetics(5-9). The most efficient catalysts in acidic media are platinum-based, as the strength of the Pt-H bond(10) is associated with the fastest reaction rate for the HER11,12. The use of platinum, however, raises issues linked to cost and stability in non-acidic media. Recently, non-precious-metal-based catalysts have been reported, but these are susceptible to acid corrosion and are typically much inferior to Pt-based catalysts, exhibiting higher overpotentials and lower stability(13-15). As a cheaper alternative to platinum, ruthenium possesses a similar bond strength with hydrogen (similar to 65 kcal mol(-1))(16), but has never been studied as a viable alternative for a HER catalyst.

The objective of this present work is to redevelop the CPI by leading a research effort to increase the usefulness and reliability of this inventory. We created eight new descriptors for consumer products, including information pertaining to the nanomaterials contained in each product. The project was motivated by the recognition that a diverse group of stakeholders from academia, industry, and state/ federal government had become highly dependent on the inventory as an important resource and bellweather of the pervasiveness of nanotechnology in society. We interviewed 68 nanotechnology experts to assess key information needs. Their answers guided inventory modifications by providing a clear conceptual framework best suited for user expectations. The revised inventory was released in October 2013. It currently lists 1814 consumer products from 622 companies in 32 countries. The Health and Fitness category contains the most products (762, or 42% of the total). Silver is the most frequently used nanomaterial (435 products, or 24%); however, 49% of the products (889) included in the CPI do not provide the composition of the nanomaterial used in them. About 29% of the CPI (528 products) contain nanomaterials suspended in a variety of liquid media and dermal contact is the most likely exposure scenario from their use. The majority (1288 products, or 71%) of the products do not present enough supporting information to corroborate the claim that nanomaterials are used. The modified CPI has enabled crowdsourcing capabilities, which allow users to suggest edits to any entry and permits researchers to upload new findings ranging from human and environmental exposure data to complete life cycle assessments. There are inherent limitations to this type of database, but these modifications to the inventory addressed the majority of criticisms raised in published literature and in surveys of nanotechnology stakeholders and experts.

However, recent experiments on metals have shown that both the pressure effect and the effect of the third deviatoric stress invariant should be included in the constitutive description of the material. A general form of asymmetric metal plasticity, considering both the pressure sensitivity and the Lode dependence, is postulated. The calibration method for the new metal plasticity is discussed.

Atomic force microscopy, electrostatic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to characterize the structure and chemistry of the degradation process, suggesting that O-2 saturated H2O irreversibly reacts with BP to form oxidized phosphorus species. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that BP degradation occurs more rapidly on hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayers and on H-Si(111) versus hydrophilic SiO2. For unencapsulated BP field-effect transistors, the ambient degradation causes large increases in threshold voltage after 6 h in ambient, followed by a similar to 10(3) decrease in FET current on/off ratio and mobility after 48 h. Atomic layer deposited AlOx overlayers effectively suppress ambient degradation, allowing encapsulated BP FETs to maintain high on/off ratios of similar to 103 and mobilities of similar to 100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for over 2 weeks in ambient conditions.

This article examines the systems and processes needed to tap energy in vehicles and implement V2G. It quantitatively compares today's light vehicle fleet with the electric power system. The vehicle fleet has 20 times the power capacity, less than one-tenth the utilization, and one-tenth the capital cost per prime mover M Conversely, utility generators have 10-50 times longer operating life and lower operating costs per kWh. To tap V2G is to synergistically use these complementary strengths and to reconcile the complementary needs of the driver and grid manager. This article suggests strategies and, business models for doing so, and the steps necessary for the implementation of V2G. After the initial high-value, V2G markets saturate and production costs drop, V2G can provide storage for renewable energy generation. Our calculations suggest that V2G could stabilize large-scale (one-half of US electricity) wind power with 3% of the fleet dedicated to regulation for wind, plus 8-38% of the fleet providing operating reserves or storage for wind.

With ZnO2 as precursors, we introduce a high concentration of oxygen vacancies into ZnO successfully. The obtained ZnO exhibits a yellow color, and the absorption edge shifts to longer wavelength. Raman and XPS spectra reveal that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO decreased when the samples are annealed at higher temperature in air. It is consistent with the theory calculation.

We show that a combination of high-resolution in situ X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption spectroscopies offer a powerful approach to monitor the deoxygenation process and comprehensively evaluate the electronic structure of graphene oxide thin films at different stages of the thermal reduction process. It is established that the edge plane carboxyl groups are highly unstable, whereas carbonyl groups are more difficult to remove. The results consistently support the formation of phenol groups through reaction of basal plane epoxide groups with adjacent hydroxyl groups at moderate degrees of thermal activation (similar to 400 degrees C). The phenol groups are predominant over carbonyl groups and survive even at a temperature of 1000 degrees C. For the first time, a drastic increase in the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level at 600 degrees C is observed, suggesting a progressive restoration of aromatic structure in the thermally reduced graphene oxide.",10.1021/jp203741y,773,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Liu, F; Ming, PM; Li, J",Ab initio calculation of ideal strength and phonon instability of graphene under tension,"Graphene-based sp(2)-carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and nanofibers can fail near their ideal strengths due to their exceedingly small dimensions. We have calculated the phonon spectra of graphene as a function of uniaxial tension by density functional perturbation theory to assess the first occurrence of phonon instability on the strain path, which controls the strength of a defect-free crystal at 0 K. Uniaxial tensile strain is applied in the x (nearest-neighbor) and y (second nearest-neighbor) directions, related to tensile deformation of zigzag and armchair nanotubes, respectively. The Young's modulus E=1050 GPa and Poisson's ratio nu=0.186 from our small-strain results are in good agreement with previous calculations. We find that in both x and y uniaxial tensions, phonon instabilities occur near the center of the Brillouin zone, at (epsilon(xx)=0.194, sigma(xx)=110 GPa, epsilon(yy)=-0.016) and (epsilon(yy)=0.266, sigma(yy)=121 GPa, epsilon(xx)=-0.027), respectively. Both soft phonons are longitudinal elastic waves in the pulling direction, suggesting that brittle cleavage fracture may be an inherent behavior of graphene and carbon nanotubes at low temperatures.

By studying both soft films on hard substrates and hard films on soft substrates we are able to assess the effects of elastic and plastic inhomogeneity, as well as material pile-up, on the nanoindentation response. The data set includes Al/glass and W/sapphire, with the film and substrate having nearly the same elastic properties.

One of the significant improvements in nanoindentation testing is the continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) technique. It offers a direct measure of dynamic contact stiffness during the loading portion of an indentation test and, being somewhat insensitive to thermal drift, allows an accurate observation of small volume deformation. Nanoscale damage caused by fatigue is of critical importance to the reliability of ultrathin protective overcoats and micro/nanostructures. The cyclic loading used in the CSM makes the technique useful for the evaluation of nanofatigue. Methodologies of the CSM technique used for the characterization of layered materials and nonhomogeneous composites are reviewed and discussed. Applications of the CSM technique to the measurement of contact stiffness, elastic modulus, hardness, creep resistance, and fatigue properties of the materials used in magnetic storage devices are presented. The nanoindentation CSM technique, in conjunction with nanoscratch and friction and wear tests, can be satisfactorily used for the materials characterization of magnetic storage and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and should find more application.

When 10% of HC(NH2)(2)(+) is replaced by Cs+, photo- and moisture stability of perovskite film are significantly improved, which is attributed to the enhanced interaction between HC(NH2)(2)(+) and iodide due to contraction of cubo-octahedral volume.

Linear elasticity theory is employed to compute the additional effect of bulk mechanical forces on electrode stability.

Two-dimensional displacement distributions that satisfy force balances across a periodically deforming interface are derived; these allow computation of the stress and surface-tension forces. The incorporation of elastic effects into a kinetic model demonstrates regimes of electrolyte mechanical properties where amplification of surface roughness can be inhibited.

The samples were found to exhibit structural properties similar to those reported earlier. Our study confirmed that the size of primary mesopores of SBA-15 can be tailored by the choice of synthesis temperature and that SBA-15 exhibits a significant amount of disordered micropores and small mesopores, The volume and size of these complementary pores were found to be dependent to some extent on the synthesis/aging temperature. It was shown that the washing of as-synthesized SBA-15 in water or ethanol was accompanied by an appreciable structural shrinkage and led to the removal of a significant part of the polymeric template. Therefore, washing needs to be avoided if one wants to isolate SBA-15 without appreciable loss of the template. It was confirmed that water-washed SBA-15 samples have fully accessible primary mesopores. Ethanol-washed samples also were found to exhibit accessible porosity. Despite an appreciable content of the template in the water- and ethanol-washed samples, their pore sizes were usually larger than those of the calcined materials. The observed structural properties of SBA-15 and their dependence on the synthesis temperature and washing were attributed to the changes in the degree of penetration of the poly(ethylene oxide) chains of the triblock copolymer template within the siliceous walls of SBA-15.",10.1021/cm000164e,795,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

Second-order Raman features are interpreted in the light of recent ab initio phonon density of states calculations. The temperature dependence of the Raman intensities allows the assignment of difference modes to be made unambiguously. Some weak, sharp Raman peaks are detected whose temperature dependence suggests they may be due to impurity modes. High-resolution spectra of the E-2(high), A(1)(LO), and E-1(LO) modes were recorded, and an analysis of the anharmonicity and lifetimes of these phonons is carried out. The E-2(high) mode displays a visibly asymmetric line shape. This can be attributed to anharmonic interaction with transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonon combinations in the vicinity of the K point, where the two-phonon density of states displays a sharp edge around the E-2(high) frequency. The temperature dependence of the linewidth and frequency of the E-2(high) mode is well described by a perturbation-theory renormalization of the harmonic E-2(high) frequency resulting from the interaction with the acoustic two-phonon density of states. In contrast, the A(1)(LO) and E-1(LO) frequencies lie in a region of nearly flat two-phonon density of states, and they exhibit a nearly symmetric Lorentzian line shape with a temperature dependence that is well accounted for by a dominating asymmetric decay channel.",10.1103/PhysRevB.75.165202,797,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes

To elucidate the ROS generation mechanisms, we investigated the ROS production kinetics of seven selected metal-oxide NPs and their bulk counterparts under UV irradiation (365 nm). The results show that different metal oxides had distinct photogenerated ROS kinetics. Particularly, TiO2 nanoparticles and ZnO nanoparticles generated three types of ROS (superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen), whereas other metal oxides generated only one or two types or did not generate any type of ROS. Moreover, NPs yielded more ROS than their bulk counterparts likely due to larger surface areas of NPs providing more absorption sites for UV irradiation. The ROS generation mechanism was elucidated by comparing the electronic structures (i.e., band edge energy levels) of the metal oxides with the redox potentials of various ROS generation, which correctly interpreted the ROS generation of most metal oxides. To develop a quantitative relationship between oxidative stress and antibacterial activity of NPs, we examined the viability of E. coli cells in aqueous suspensions of NPs under UV irradiation, and a linear correlation was found between the average concentration of total ROS and the bacterial survival rates (R-2 = 0.84).

These types of electronics (e.g., wearable or implantable electronics, sensors for soft robotics, e-skin) must operate during deformation.

Such miniaturization is expected to lead to compact, nanoscale optical devices with applications in cameras, lighting, displays and wearable optics. However, retaining functionality while reducing device size has proven particularly challenging. For example, so far there has been no demonstration of broadband achromatic metalenses covering the entire visible spectrum. Here, we show that by judicious design of nanofins on a surface, it is possible to simultaneously control the phase, group delay and group delay dispersion of light, thereby achieving a transmissive achromatic metalens with large bandwidth.

Ultrafine-grained (UFG) bulk materials were fabricated through cryomilling, degassing, hot isostatic pressing and extrusion, followed by a subsequent heat treatment. The mechanical behavior and microstructure of the materials were analyzed and compared directly to the coarse-grained (CG) counterpart. Three-dimensional atom-probe tomography was utilized to investigate the intermetallic precipitates and oxide dispersoids formed in the as-extruded UFG material. UFG 7075 exhibits higher strength than the CG 7075 alloy for each equivalent condition. After a T6 temper, the yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of UFG 7075 achieved 734 and 774 MPa, respectively, which are similar to 120 MPa higher than those of the CG equivalent. The strength of as-extruded UFG 7075 (YS: 583 MPa, UTS: 631 MPa) is even higher than that of commercial 7075-T6. More importantly, the strengthening mechanisms in each material were established quantitatively for the first time for this complex precipitation-strengthened system, accounting for grain-boundary, dislocation, solid-solution, precipitation and oxide dispersoid strengthening contributions. Grain-boundary strengthening was the predominant mechanism in as-extruded UFG 7075, contributing a strength increment estimated to be 242 MPa, whereas Orowan precipitation strengthening was predominant in the as-extruded CG 7075 (similar to 102 MPa) and in the T6-tempered materials, and was estimated to contribute 472 and 414 MPa for CG-T6 and UFG-T6, respectively.

Using in situ transmission electron microscopy and ex situ X-ray diffraction techniques, we explain the large capacity of our anode through a dual mechanism of intercalation of sodium ions along the x axis of the phosphorene layers followed by the formation of a Na3P alloy. The presence of graphene layers in the hybrid material works as a mechanical backbone and an electrical highway, ensuring that a suitable elastic buffer space accommodates the anisotropic expansion of phosphorene layers along the y and z axial directions for stable cycling operation.",10.1038/NNANO.2015.194,847,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

The techniques reported here allow transfer onto three different classes of substrates: substrates covered with shallow depressions, perforated substrates, and flat substrates. A novel dry, transfer technique was used to make graphene-sealed microchambers without trapping-liquid inside. The dry transfer technique utilizes a polydimethylsiloxane frame that attaches to the poly(methyl methacrylate) spun over the graphene film, and the monolayer graphene was transferred onto shallow depressions with 300 nm depth. The improved wet transfer onto perforated substrates with 2.7 mu m diameter holes yields 98% coverage of holes covered with continuous films, allowing the ready use of Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to study the intrinsic properties of CVD-grown monolayer graphene. Additionally, monolayer graphene transferred onto flat substrates has fewer cracks and tears, as well as lower sheet resistance than previous transfer techniques. Monolayer graphene films transferred onto glass had a sheet resistance of similar to 980 Omega/sq and a transmittance of 97.6%.

J,"Agnew, SR; Yoo, MH; Tom√©, CN",Application of texture simulation to understanding mechanical behavior of Mg and solid solution alloys containing Li or Y,"The viscoplastic self-consistent model was used to interpret differences in the mechanical behavior of hexagonal close packed magnesium alloys. There are only subtle differences in the compression textures of magnesium and its solid solution alloys containing lithium or yttrium. However, the plane strain compression textures of the alloys showed an increasing tendency for the basal poles to rotate away from the ""normal direction"" towards the ""rolling direction"". Texture simulations enabled these distinctions to be attributed to the increased activity of the non-basal (c + a) slip mode. The alloys had improved compressive ductilities compared to pure magnesium, and the increased c + a slip mode activity provides a satisfying explanation for this improvement, since it can accommodate c-axis compression within individual grains. Accounting for individual deformation mode hardening enabled the flow curves to be simulated and the anisotropic plastic response of textured wrought alloys to be mechanistically understood and predicted.

J,"Arima, Y; Iwata, H",Effect of wettability and surface functional groups on protein adsorption and cell adhesion using well-defined mixed self-assembled monolayers,"Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols, which can provide flat and chemically well-defined surfaces, were employed as model surfaces to understand cellular interaction with artificial materials. SAMs presenting a wide range of wettabilities were prepared by mixing two kinds of alkanethiols carrying terminal methyl (CH3) hydroxyl (OH), carboxylic acid (COOH), or amino (NH2) groups. Adhesion behavior of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HeLa cells on these mixed SAMs were examined. The number of adhered HUVECs reached a maximum on CH3/OH mixed SAMs with a water contact angle of 40 degrees, while cell adhesion increased with decreasing water contact angle up to 60-70 degrees and then leveled off on CH3/COOH and CH3/NH2 mixed SAMs. Numbers of adhered HeLa cells showed a maximum on CH3/OH and CH3/COOH mixed SAMs with a water contact angle of 50 degrees. These facts suggest that cell adhesion is mainly determined by surface wettability, but is also affected by the surface functional group, its surface density, and the kinds of cells. The effect of exchange of adsorbed proteins on cell adhesion was also examined. HUVECs were cultured on the mixed SAMs preadsorbed with albumin. Cell adhesion was effectively prohibited on hydrophobic SAMs pretreated with albumin. Albumin strongly adsorbed and resisted replacement by cell adhesive proteins on hydrophobic SAMs. On the other hand, cells adhered to albumin-adsorbed hydrophilic SAW Displacement of preadsorbed albumin with cell adhesive proteins effectively occurs on these hydrophilic SAMs. This effect contributes to induce SAMs with moderate wettability to give suitable surfaces for cell adhesion.

For the reliable and cost-effective design of FRP jackets, an accurate stress-strain model is required for FRP-confined concrete. In this paper, a new design-oriented stress-strain model is proposed for concrete confined by FRP wraps with fibres only or predominantly in the hoop direction based on a careful interpretation of existing test data and observations. This model is simple, so it is suitable for direct use in design, but in the meantime, it captures all the main characteristics of the stress-strain behavior of concrete confined by different types of FRP. In addition, for unconfined concrete, this model reduces directly to idealized stress-strain curves in existing design codes. In the development of this model, a number of important issues including the actual hoop strains in FRP jackets at rupture, the sufficiency of FRP confinement for a significant strength enhancement, and the effect of jacket stiffness on the ultimate axial strain, were all carefully examined and appropriately resolved. The predictions of the model are shown to agree well with test data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The critical particle sizes that determine the superhydrophobicity and the anti-icing property are in two different length scales, The effect of particle size on ice formation is explained by using a classical heterogeneous nucleation theory. This result implies that the anti-icing property of a surface is not directly correlated with the superhydrophobicity, and thus, it is uncertain whether a superhydrophobic surface is anti-icing without detailed knowledge of the surface morphology, The result also opens up possibilities for rational design of anti-icing superhydrophobic surfaces by tuning surface textures in multiple length scales.",10.1021/la902882b,856,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Instead, matrix stiffness regulated integrin binding as well as reorganization of adhesion ligands on the nanoscale, both of which were traction dependent and correlated with osteogenic commitment of mesenchymal stem-cell populations.

These devices are highly dependent on the solid state nanoscale morphology of the two components (donor/acceptor) in the photoactive layer.

Typical distances that these photo-excitations can travel within a pristine material are around 10 - 20 nm. In an efficient bulk heterojunction the scale of phase separation is therefore closely related to the respective exciton diffusion lengths of the two materials involved. Once the excitons reach the donor/ acceptor interface, the photoinduced charge transfer results in the charge separation. After the charges have been separated they require percolated pathways to the respective charge extracting electrodes in order to supply an external direct current.

Coumarin-6 loaded PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by a modified solvent extraction/evaporation method and characterized by laser light scattering for size and size distribution, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for surface morphology, zeta-potential for surface charge, and spectrofluorometry for fluorescent molecule release from the nanoparticles. The effects of particle size and particle surface coating on the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles were quantified by spectrofluorometric measurement. Cellular uptake of vitamin E TPGS-coated PLGA nanoparticles showed 1.4 folds higher than that of PVA-coated PLGA nanoparticles and 4-6 folds higher than that of nude polystyrene nanoparticles.

Herein, 2D ultrathin Ti3C2 nanosheets, a kind of MXenes, are prepared by etching Ti3AlC2 with subsequent ultrasonic exfoliation. A novel 2D/2D heterojunction of ultrathin Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 nanosheets is then successfully prepared by in situ growth of Bi2WO6 ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of these Ti3C2 ultrathin nanosheets. The resultant Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 hybrids exhibit a short charge transport distance and a large interface contact area, assuring excellent bulk-to-surface and interfacial charge transfer abilities. Meanwhile, the improved specific surface area and pore structure endow Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 hybrids with an enhanced CO2 adsorption capability. As a result, the 2D/2D heterojunction of ultrathin Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 nanosheets shows significant improvement on the performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction under simulated solar irradiation. The total yield of CH4 and CH3OH obtained on the optimized Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 hybrid is 4.6 times that obtained on pristine Bi2WO6 ultrathin nanosheets.

Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on monolayer Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes are fabricated and their electronic properties are measured. Individual Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes exhibit a high conductivity of 4600 +/- 1100 S cm(-1) and field-effect electron mobility of 2.6 +/- 0.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The resistivity of multilayer Ti(3)C(2)Tx films is only one order of magnitude higher than the resistivity of individual flakes, which indicates a surprisingly good electron transport through the surface terminations of different flakes, unlike in many other 2D materials. Finally, the fabricated FETs are used to investigate the environmental stability and kinetics of oxidation of Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes in humid air. The high-quality Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes are reasonably stable and remain highly conductive even after their exposure to air for more than 24 h.

Cell spreading and differentiation were unaffected by polydimethylsiloxane stiffness. However, cells on polyacrylamide of low elastic modulus (0.5 kPa) could not form stable focal adhesions and differentiated as a result of decreased activation of the extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway. The differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells was also unaffected by PDMS stiffness but regulated by the elastic modulus of PAAm. Dextran penetration measurements indicated that polyacrylamide substrates of low elastic modulus were more porous than stiff substrates, suggesting that the collagen anchoring points would be further apart.

The luminescence quenching temperature is an important parameter, especially in high-power LEDs, but surprisingly no systematic research has been done to measure and understand the temperature quenching of the yellow Ce luminescence in YAG:Ce. Here we report on the luminescence temperature quenching in YAG:Ce. For a wide range of Ce concentrations (between 0.033% and 3.3%) the temperature dependence of the emission intensity and the luminescence lifetimes are reported. The intrinsic quenching temperature of the Ce luminescence is shown to be very high (>700 K). The lower quenching temperatures reported in the literature are explained by thermally activated concentration quenching (for highly doped systems) and the temperature dependence of the oscillator strength (for low doping concentrations). In addition, high-resolution spectra are reported, which provide insight into the position of the zero-phonon transition (20450 cm(-1)), the Stokes shift (2400 cm(-1)), the energy of the dominant phonon mode (200 cm(-1)), and the Huang-Rhys parameter (S = 6).

When subjected to time-dependent photoillumination, the hybrids could also function as a rewritable optoelectronic switch or memory, where the persistent state shows almost no relaxation or decay within experimental timescales, indicating near-perfect charge retention.

The hydrogenated TiO2 (denoted as H-TiO2) were obtained by calcination of anodized TiO2 NTAs in hydrogen atmosphere in a range of temperatures between 300 to 600 degrees C. The H TiO2 NTAs prepared at 400 degrees C yields the largest specific capacitance of 3.24 mF cm(-2) at a scan rate of 100 mV s(-1), which is 40 times higher than thecapacitance obtained from air-annealed TiO2 NTAs at the same conditions.

J,"Devaraj, S; Munichandraiah, N",Effect of crystallographic structure of MnO<sub>2</sub> on its electrochemical capacitance properties,"MnO2 is currently under extensive investigations for its capacitance properties. MnO2 crystallizes into several crystallographic structures, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and lambda structures. Because these structures differ in the way MnO6 octahedra are interlinked, they possess tunnels or interlayers with gaps of different magnitudes. Because capacitance properties are due to intercalation/deintercalation of protons or cations in MnO2, only some crystallographic structures, which possess sufficient gaps to accommodate these ions, are expected to be useful for capacitance studies. In order to examine the dependence of capacitance on crystal structure, the present study involves preparation of these various crystal phases of MnO2 in nanodimensions and to evaluate their capacitance properties. Results of alpha-MnO2 prepared by a microemulsion route (alpha-MnO2(m)) are also used for comparison. Spherical particles of about 50 nm, nanorods of 30-50 nm in diameter, or interlocked fibers of 10-20 nm in diameters are formed, which depend on the crystal structure and the method of preparation. The specific capacitance (SC) measured for MnO2 is found to depend strongly on the crystallographic structure, and it decreases in the following order: alpha(m) > alpha congruent to 6 > gamma > lambda > beta. A SC value of 297 F g(-1) is obtained for alpha-MnO2(m), whereas it is 9 F g(-1) for beta-MnO2. A wide (-similar to 4.6 angstrom) tunnel size and large surface area of alpha-MnO2(m) are ascribed as favorable factors for its high SC. A large interlayer separation (similar to 7 angstrom) also facilitates insertion of cations in delta-MnO2 resulting in a SC close to 236 F g(-1). A narrow tunnel size (1.89 A) does not allow intercalation of cations into beta-MnO2.

Such a screening requires automated high-throughput analysis tools that calculate structural properties for all materials contained in a database so they can be compared with search queries, grouped or classified. One important aspect of the structural analysis of materials such as zeolites and metal organic frameworks is the investigation of the geometrical parameters describing pores. Here, we present algorithms and tools to efficiently calculate some of these important parameters. Our tools are based on the Voronoi decomposition, which for a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph representation of the void space. The resulting Voronoi network is analyzed to obtain the diameter of the largest included sphere and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters that are frequently used to describe pore geometry. Accessibility of nodes in the network is also determined for a given guest molecule and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible surfaces and volumes. The presented algorithms are implemented in a software tool, Zeo++, which includes a modified version of the Voro++ library.

The adsorption energies of Na, K, and Ca decrease as coverage increases, while Li shows little sensitivity to variance in coverage. This observed relationship between adsorption energies and coverage of alkali ions on Ti3C2 can be explained by their effective ionic radii. A larger effective ionic radius increases interaction between alkali atoms, thus lower coverage is obtained.

So far, only very few MX2 compounds have been synthesized as suspended single layers, and some of them have been exfoliated as thin sheets. Using first-principles structure optimization and phonon calculations based on density functional theory, we predict that, out of 88 different combinations of MX2 compounds, several of them can be stable in free-standing, single-layer honeycomb-like structures. These materials have two-dimensional hexagonal lattices and have top-view appearances as if they consisted of either honeycombs or centered honeycombs. However, their bonding is different from that of graphene; they can be viewed as a positively charged plane of transition-metal atoms sandwiched between two planes of negatively charged oxygen or chalcogen atoms. Electron correlation in transition-metal oxides was treated by including Coulomb repulsion through LDA + U calculations. Our analysis of stability was extended to include in-plane stiffness, as well as ab initio, finite-temperature molecular dynamics calculations.

We show that, regardless of the excitation laser polarization, the emitted light from the monolayer is linearly polarized along the light effective mass direction and centres around 1.3 eV, a clear signature of emission from highly anisotropic bright excitons. Moreover, photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy suggests a quasiparticle bandgap of 2.2 eV, from which we estimate an exciton binding energy of similar to 0.9 eV, consistent with theoretical results based on first principles. The experimental observation of highly anisotropic, bright excitons with large binding energy not only opens avenues for the future explorations of many-electron physics in this unusual two-dimensional material, but also suggests its promising future in optoelectronic devices.",10.1038/NNANO.2015.71,924,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a crossover can be achieved by peeling off a multilayer sample to a single layer. For exploration of physical behavior and device applications, it is much desired to reversibly modulate such crossover in a multilayer sample. Here we demonstrate that, in a few-layer sample where the indirect bandgap and direct bandgap are nearly degenerate, the temperature rise can effectively drive the system toward the 2D limit by thermally decoupling neighboring layers via interlayer thermal expansion. Such a situation is realized in few-layer MoSe2, which shows stark contrast from the well-explored MoS2 where the indirect and direct bandgaps are far from degenerate. Photoluminescence of few-layer MoSe2 is much enhanced with the temperature rise, much like the way that the photoluminescence is enhanced due to the bandgap crossover going from the bulk to the quantum limit, offering potential applications involving external modulation of optical properties in 2D semiconductors.

With respect to the charge transport, it is demonstrated that the electron mobility dominates the transport of the cell, varying from 10(-8) m(2) V-1 S-1 in as-cast devices to approximate to 3 x 10(-7) m(2) V-1 s(-1) after thermal annealing. The hole mobility in the P3HT phase of the blend is dramatically affected by thermal annealing. It increases by more than three orders of magnitude, to reach a value of up to approximate to 2 x 10(4) m(2) V-1 s(-1) after the annealing process, as a result of an improved crystallinity of the film. Moreover, upon annealing the absorption spectrum of P3HT:PCBM blends undergo a strong red-shift, improving the spectral overlap with solar emission, which results in an increase of more than 60% in the rate of charge-carrier generation. Subsequently, the experimental electron and hole mobilities are used to study the photocurrent generation in P3HT:PCBM devices as a function of annealing temperature. The results indicate that the most important factor leading to a strong enhancement of the efficiency, compared with non-annealed devices, is the increase of the hole mobility in the P3HT phase of the blend. Furthermore, numerical simulations indicate that under short-circuit conditions the dissociation efficiency of bound electron-hole pairs at the donor/acceptor interface is close to 90%, which explains the large quantum efficiencies measured in P3HT:PCBM blends.",10.1002/adfm.200500420,930,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The imperfection of the current techniques has encouraged the use of a rapid prototyping technology known as fused deposition modeling (FDM). Our results show that FDM allows the design and fabrication of highly reproducible bioresorbable 3D scaffolds with a fully interconnected pore network. The mechanical properties and in vitro biocompatibility of polycaprolactone scaffolds with a porosity of 61 +/- 1% and two matrix architectures were studied. The honeycomblike pores had a size falling within the range of 360 x 430 x 620 mum. The scaffolds with a 0/60/120 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in air of 41.9 +/- 3.5 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degreesC) of 29.4 +/- 4.0 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. In comparison, the scaffolds with a 0/72/144/36/108 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in air of 20.2 +/- 1.7 and 2.4 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degreesC) of 21.5 +/- 2.9 and 2.0 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed that the five-angle scaffolds had significantly lower stiffness and 1% offset yield strengths under compression loading than those with a three-angle pattern under both testing conditions (p less than or equal to 0.05). The obtained stress-strain curves for both scaffold architectures demonstrate the typical behavior of a honeycomb structure undergoing deformation. In vitro studies were conducted with primary human fibroblasts and periosteal cells. Light, environmental scanning electron, and confocal laser microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry showed cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production on the polycaprolactone surface in the Ist culturing week. Over a period of 3-4 weeks in a culture, the fully interconnected scaffold architecture was completely 3D-filled by cellular tissue. Our cell culture study shows that fibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells can proliferate, differentiate, and produce a cellular tissue in an entirely interconnected 3D polycaprolactone matrix.

It can be very detrimental to the performance of a material or the life of a component. Alternatively, beneficial residual stresses can be introduced deliberately, Residual stresses are more difficult to predict than the in-service stresses on which they superimpose, For this reason, it is important to have reliable methods for the measurement of these stresses and to understand the level of information they can provide. In this paper, which is the first part of a two part overview, the effect of residual stresses on fatigue lifetimes and structural integrity are first summarised, followed by the definition and measurement of residual stresses. Different types of stress are characterised according to the characteristic length scale over which they self-equilibrate. By comparing this length to the gauge volume of each technique, the capability of a range of techniques is assessed.

In this work, porous PCL scaffolds were computationally designed and then fabricated via selective laser sintering (SLS), a rapid prototyping technique. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated scaffolds were assessed and compared to the designed porous architectures and computationally predicted properties. Scaffolds were then seeded with bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) transduced fibroblasts and implanted subcutaneously to evaluate biological properties and to demonstrate tissue in-growth. The work done illustrates the ability to design and fabricate PCL scaffolds with porous architecture that have sufficient mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering applications using SLS. Compressive modulus and yield strength values ranged from 52 to 67 MPa and 2.0 to 3.2 Mpa, respectively, lying within the lower range of properties reported for human trabecular bone. Finite element analysis (FEA) results showed that mechanical properties of scaffold designs and of fabricated scaffolds can be computationally predicted. Histological evaluation and micro-computed tomography (mu CT) analysis of implanted scaffolds showed that bone can be generated in vivo. Finally, to demonstrate the clinical application of this technology, we designed and fabricated a prototype mandibular condyle scaffold based on an actual pig condyle.

Here we report a hollow carbon nanofiber-encapsulated sulfur cathode for effective trapping of polysulfides and demonstrate experimentally high specific capacity and excellent electrochemical cycling of the cells. The hollow carbon nanofiber arrays were fabricated using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates, through thermal carbonization of polystyrene. The AAO template also facilitates sulfur infusion into the hollow fibers and prevents sulfur from coating onto the exterior carbon wall. The high aspect ratio of the carbon nanofibers provides an ideal structure for trapping polysulfides, and the thin carbon wall allows rapid transport of lithium ions. The small dimension of these nanofibers provides a large surface area per unit mass for Li2S deposition during cycling and reduces pulverization of electrode materials due to volumetric expansion.

A simple step-by-step procedure is presented to design the cantilever beam based energy harvester by incorporating piezoelectric material at maximum stress points in first and second resonance modes. Suitable piezoelectric material for vibration energy harvesting is characterized by the large magnitude of product of the piezoelectric voltage constant (g) and the piezoelectric strain constant (d) given as (d . g). The condition for obtaining large magnitude of d.g has been shown to be as vertical bar d vertical bar = epsilon(n), where E is the permittivity of the material and n is a material parameter having, lower limit of 0.5. The material can be in the form of polycrystalline ceramics, textured ceramics, thin films, and polymers. A brief coverage of various material systems is provided in all these categories.

ABO assumes that the lighter electrons adjust adiabatically to the motion of the heavier nuclei, remaining at any time in their instantaneous ground state. ABO is well justified when the energy gap between ground and excited electronic states is larger than the energy scale of the nuclear motion. In metals, the gap is zero and phenomena beyond ABO (such as phonon-mediated superconductivity or phonon-induced renormalization of the electronic properties) occur(3). The use of ABO to describe lattice motion in metals is, therefore, questionable(4,5). In spite of this, ABO has proved effective for the accurate determination of chemical reactions(6), molecular dynamics(7,8) and phonon frequencies(9-11) in a wide range of metallic systems.

Water-soluble SWNTs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) functionalization via these routes allow for surprisingly high degrees of pi-stacking of aromatic molecules, including a cancer drug (doxorubicin) with ultrahigh loading capacity, a widely used fluorescence molecule (fluorescein), and combinations of molecules. Binding of molecules to nanotubes and their release can be controlled by varying the pH. The strength of pi-stacking of aromatic molecules is dependent on nanotube diameter, leading to a method for controlling the release rate of molecules from SWNTs by using nanotube materials with suitable diameter. This work introduces the concept of ""functionalization partitioning"" of SWNTs, i.e., imparting multiple chemical species, such as PEG, drugs, and fluorescent tags, with different functionalities onto the surface of the same nanotube.

We show that predictions based on considerations of the energy of attachment of a single particle to the oil-water interface relate directly to the stability of emulsions. A combination of powder immersion, shelf stability, light diffraction, and microscopy measurements is used to characterize the systems. Emulsions stabilized by either very hydrophilic or very hydrophobic particles are large (>100 mum) and unstable to coalescence. Those with particles of intermediate hydrophobicity are submicrometer and stable to coalescence indefinitely For these, catastrophic inversion of emulsions occurs upon increasing the volume fraction of water, phi (w), and their stability to sedimentation or creaming increases approaching inversion. The stability of emulsions to gravity-induced separation passes through a sharp maximum upon increasing the particle hydrophobicity, alongside a minimum in the average drop diameter. This is universal and independent of phi (w) and the type of emulsion formed. In one system, an otherwise very stable water-in-oil emulsion is destabilized in an ultracentrifugal field leading to enhanced sedimentation and eventual coalescence.",10.1021/la000189s,965,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

The materials have been flax fibres and polylactic acid (PLA). PLA is a thermoplastic polymer made from lactic acid and has mainly been used for biodegradable products, such as plastic bags and planting cups, but in principle PLA can also be used as a matrix material in composites. Because of the brittle nature of PLA triacetin was tested as plasticizer for PLA and PLA/flax composites in order to improve the impact properties. The studied composite materials were manufactured with a twin-screw extruder having a flax fibre content of 30 and 40 wt.%. The extruded compound was compression moulded to test samples. The processing and material properties have been studied and compared to the more commonly used polypropylene flax fibre composites (PP/flax). Preliminary results show that the mechanical properties of PLA and flax fibre composites are promising. The composite strength is about 50% better compared to similar PP/flax fibre composites, which are used today in many automotive panels. The addition of plasticizer does not show any positive effect on the impact strength of the composites. The study of interfacial adhesion shows that adhesion needs to be improved to optimise the mechanical properties of the PLA/flax composites. The PLA/flax composites did not show any difficulties in the extrusion and compression moulding processes and they can be processed in a similar way as PP based composites.

Samples with grain sizes varying between 3 and 23 mum were prepared by altering the extrusion conditions. Compression testing of the extruded bar was carried out at temperatures between ambient and 200 degreesC. Twinning dominated the deformation at lower temperatures but this gave way to slip dominated flow when the temperature was raised. For tests carried out at intermediate temperatures, a similar transition was observed when the grain size was reduced. The transition was accompanied by a change in flow curve shape and Hall-Petch slope. The peak stresses achieved when twinning dominated the deformation were up to 100 MPa greater than those seen when slip dominated the flow. Critical grain sizes marking the twinning-slip transition were identified and these are described in terms of the deformation conditions. (C) 2004 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The low-voltage process is quite reversible over the 0.02 to 1.8 V range with a sustained capacity of about 150 mAh/g over a few hundred cycles. Within such a range of potential the polymer/gel-like is barely evolving while it vanishes as the oxidation potential is increased above 2 V. From the cyclic-voltammogram profiles we conclude that the origin of the low-voltage capacity is nested in the pseudocapacitive character of the in situ made polymeric/gel film. Tentative explanations based on comparisons with existing literature are made to explain such an unusual finding.

J,"Chevalier, J; Gremillard, L; Virkar, AV; Clarke, DR",The Tetragonal-Monoclinic Transformation in Zirconia: Lessons Learned and Future Trends,"Zirconia ceramics have found broad applications in a variety of energy and biomedical applications because of their unusual combination of strength, fracture toughness, ionic conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. These attractive characteristics are largely associated with the stabilization of the tetragonal and cubic phases through alloying with aliovalent ions. The large concentration of vacancies introduced to charge compensate of the aliovalent alloying is responsible for both the exceptionally high ionic conductivity and the unusually low, and temperature independent, thermal conductivity. The high fracture toughness exhibited by many of zirconia ceramics is attributed to the constraint of the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation and its release during crack propagation. In other zirconia ceramics containing the tetragonal phase, the high fracture toughness is associated with ferroelastic domain switching. However, many of these attractive features of zirconia, especially fracture toughness and strength, are compromised after prolonged exposure to water vapor at intermediate temperatures (similar to 30 degrees-300 degrees C) in a process referred to as low-temperature degradation (LTD), and initially identified over two decades ago. This is particularly so for zirconia in biomedical applications, such as hip implants and dental restorations. Less well substantiated is the possibility that the same process can also occur in zirconia used in other applications, for instance, zirconia thermal barrier coatings after long exposure at high temperature. Based on experience with the failure of zirconia femoral heads, as well as studies of LTD, it is shown that many of the problems of LTD can be mitigated by the appropriate choice of alloying and/or process control.",10.1111/j.1551-2916.2009.03278.x,985,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

In this article, we present processing, morphology, and properties of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) reinforced with exfoliated graphite. For the first time, we compare carbon sheets exfoliated from graphite oxide (GO) via two different processes: chemical modification (isocyanate treated GO, iGO) and thermal exfoliation (thermally reduced GO, TRG), and three different methods of dispersion: solvent blending, in situ polymerization, and melt compounding. Incorporation of as low as 0.5 wt % of TRG produced electrically conductive TPU. Up to a 10-fold increase in tensile stiffness and 90% decrease in nitrogen permeation of TPU were observed with only 3 wt % iGO, implying a high aspect ratio of exfoliated platelets. Real- and reciprocal-space morphological characterization indicated that solvent-based blending techniques more effectively distribute thin exfoliated sheets in the polymer matrix than melt processing. This observation is in good qualitative agreement with the dispersion level inferred from solid property enhancements. Although also processed in solvents, property increase via in situ polymerization was not as pronounced because of reduced hydrogen bonding in the TPU produced.",10.1021/cm100477v,990,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,

Furthermore, for further capacitance boost, a thin layer of MnO2 was additionally deposited onto e-CMG. The porous graphene structure with a large surface area facilitates fast ionic transport within the electrode while preserving decent electronic conductivity and thus endows MnO2/e-CMG composite electrodes with excellent electrochemical properties such as a specific capacitance of 389 F/g at 1 A/g and 97.7% capacitance retention upon a current Increase to 35 A/g.

An alternative way to induce a spin torque using an electric current has been proposed based on intrinsic spin-orbit magnetic fields(9,10) and recently realized in a strained low-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor(11). Here we demonstrate that strong magnetic fields can be induced in ferromagnetic metal films lacking structure inversion symmetry through the Rashba effect.

J,"Erturk, A; Inman, DJ",An experimentally validated bimorph cantilever model for piezoelectric energy harvesting from base excitations,"Piezoelectric transduction has received great attention for vibration-to-electric energy conversion over the last five years. A typical piezoelectric energy harvester is a unimorph or a bimorph cantilever located on a vibrating host structure, to generate electrical energy from base excitations. Several authors have investigated modeling of cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvesters under base excitation. The existing mathematical modeling approaches range from elementary single-degree-of-freedom models to approximate distributed parameter solutions in the sense of Rayleigh-Ritz discretization as well as analytical solution attempts with certain simplifications. Recently, the authors have presented the closed-form analytical solution for a unimorph cantilever under base excitation based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumptions. In this paper, the analytical solution is applied to bimorph cantilever configurations with series and parallel connections of piezoceramic layers. The base excitation is assumed to be translation in the transverse direction with a superimposed small rotation. The closed-form steady state response expressions are obtained for harmonic excitations at arbitrary frequencies, which are then reduced to simple but accurate single-mode expressions for modal excitations. The electromechanical frequency response functions (FRFs) that relate the voltage output and vibration response to translational and rotational base accelerations are identified from the multi-mode and single-mode solutions. Experimental validation of the single-mode coupled voltage output and vibration response expressions is presented for a bimorph cantilever with a tip mass. It is observed that the closed-form single-mode FRFs obtained from the analytical solution can successfully predict the coupled system dynamics for a wide range of electrical load resistance. The performance of the bimorph device is analyzed extensively for the short circuit and open circuit resonance frequency excitations and the accuracy of the model is shown in all cases.",10.1088/0964-1726/18/2/025009,997,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no

The present work developed a facile in situ method to construct g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free isotype heterojunction with molecular composite precursors with the aim to greatly promote the charge separation. Considering the fact that g-C3N4 samples prepared from urea and thiourea separately have different band structure, the molecular composite precursors of urea and thiourea were treated simultaneously under the same thermal conditions, in situ creating a novel layered g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free heterojunction (g-g CN heterojunction). This synthesis method is facile, economic, and environmentally benign using easily available earth-abundant green precursors. The confirmation of isotype g-g CN heterojunction was based on XRD, HRTEM, valence band XPS, ns-level PL, photocurrent, and EIS measurement. Upon visible-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons transfer from g-C3N4 (thiourea) to g-C3N4 (urea) driven by the conduction band offset of 0.10 eV, whereas the photogenerated holes transfer from g-C3N4 (urea) to g-C3N4 (thiourea) driven by the valence band offset of 0.40 eV. The potential difference between the two g-C3N4 components in the heterojunction is the main driving force for efficient charge separation and transfer. For the removal of NO in air, the g-g CN heterojunction exhibited significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity over g-C3N4 alone and physical mixture of g-C3N4 samples. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of g-g CN isotype heterojunction can be directly ascribed to efficient charge separation and transfer across the heterojunction interface as well as prolonged lifetime of charge carriers. This work demonstrated that rational design and construction of isotype heterojunction could open up a new avenue for the development of new efficient visible-light photocatalysts.",10.1021/am403653a,1000,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no
