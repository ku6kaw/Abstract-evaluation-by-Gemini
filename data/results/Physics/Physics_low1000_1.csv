0,"The novelty of this work is to fabricate the Nanosticks (NSs) like CdS sensitizer on the surface of TiO2 electrode by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method with a very high vacuum annealed at 350 degrees C for 30 min. Whereas, nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes have been prepared on FTO (SnO2: F) glass by a spin-coating method with high purity (99.99%, Degussa P25) TiO2 powder. The surface of the CdS layer has been covered by NSs like structures which are confirmed by the scanning electron microscope image. The 100 nm of platinum-coated FTO substrate and polysulfide-based electrolyte are used to assemble the Gratzel Solar cell (GSC). The performance of solar cell (SC) based on NSs like CdS has been compared with the nanoparticles (NPs) based CdS sensitized SC, where CdS NPs has synthesized by CBD without any post-annealing. The efficiency of NSs like CdS sensitized SC exhibits 2.44%, which is 2 folds of the efficiency of the CdS NPs sensitized SC.

1,"In nanoarchitectonics, the advanced technology of directional etching is highly demanded for the fabrication of modern electronic device with high anisotropy ratio of structures. To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle. The featured surface morphologies, including the pyramid, ripple, mounds and etch pits, are reproduced numerically, and these simulation results correspond well with the observations of directional etching experiments. This study provides the fundamental knowledge and detailed information for the advanced application of the directional etching technology.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,

4,A simple cost effective Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was fabricated for urea sensing. Urea is the key end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans. Increased level of urea leads to loss of kidney function. Thus determination of urea is important in analysis of kidney diseases. Al-TiO2 thin films were deposited with different concentration of Al by Spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the anatase phase of the Al-TiO2 thin films with tetragonal structure. A shift is observed in the XRD peak position compared to as prepared TiO2 thin film indicates the incorporation of Al ions into Ti ions. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study shows that the absorption increases and the absorption peak shifts towards the visible region for Al-TiO2 thin films compared with that of the as prepared TiO2 thin film. The optical band gap values changes with the change in the Al concentration in TiO2 thin films. The electrochemical analysis for optimized Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. CV studies of Al-TiO2 thin film electrode show the good stability and linearity which is essential to fabricate biosensor. The sensor response to urea is linear with correlation coefficient of 0.944 and the sensitivity is 3.17 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2).,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,
5,"Typical syntheses for the mesostructural design were performed with strategic deviations, being substantially powerful for changing the molecular structure of frameworks, from the synthetic conditions optimized for the preparation of lamellar and 2-d hexagonal mesostructured materials where the frameworks were constructed by aluminophosphate (AlPO) like units with and without organic groups in the molecular scale. A series of the materials such as mesostructured aluminum organophosphonate (AOP) and AlPO type ones were investigated according to the molecular structure and crystallinity of inorganic-organic hybrid and non-hybrid inorganic frameworks. Considering a uniqueness of AlPO based frameworks, a rational insight on strength of interactions between crystalline/amorphous AlPO based units and cationic surfactant molecules was surveyed as one of the most significant factors for understanding the mesostructural variation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"A nanocomposite of Polypyrrole (PPy) and zinc oxide (ZnO), termed as PPy-ZnO, was synthesized by two step route. In the first step, synthesis of PPy was carried out by chemical oxidative route. In the second step, the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The as-synthesized PPy-ZnO nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) and Ultra violet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy to reveal the phase, morphology, chemical and optical properties. The physical and chemical characterizations confirmed presence of both PPy and ZnO phases in the nanocomposite. In the present work, antimicrobial activity of the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite against human pathogen Y. lipolytica has been investigated. Attempts have been made to reveal the influence of PPy percentage on the antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, all PPy-ZnO nanocomposites, irrespective of PPy percentage showed 90 to 95% inhibited growth of Yarrowia lipolytica. The results obtained herein imply the potential of PPy-ZnO biofilm in inhibiting the growth of Y. lipolytica and thus preventing infections caused due to Y. lipolytica in humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"The microstructures and mechanical reliability of Sn-58Bi solder and epoxy Sn-58Bi composite solder joint were investigated with organic solderability preservative surface finishes. The mechanical reliabilities of Sn58Bi and epoxy Sn58Bi solder were evaluated by the board-level drop test and the 3-point bend test after temperature-humidity storage testing. The microstructure and chemical composition of the solder joints were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The addition of epoxy in solder paste did not affect the morphology of the intermetallic compound. The thickness of the scalloped-shaped Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound of solder/OSP joint increased with aging time. The drop number until fail for the epoxy Sn58Bi/OSP joint was higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint; the average numbers of drops withstood by the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint and epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint following the reflow process were fewer than 10 drops and 180 drops, respectively. The drop number of solder/OSP joints decreased with increasing aging time. The result of the 3-point bend tests shows that the number of bend cycles for the epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint was 30 times higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint. The number of bend cycles for solder/OSP joints was decreased with increasing aging time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Blending effect of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) in bulk-heterojunction P3HT:PC70BM layer was studied to improve the sensitivity of indirect X-ray detector. Scintillator-decoupled detectors with different contents (1, 3, 5 and 7 wt%) of Ag NPs were fabricated and tested using a solar simulator. Compared with the detector having pristine P3HT:PC70BM layer, the detector with 3 wt% Ag NPs blended in the P3HT:PC70BM layer showed 26% higher PCE and 19% higher J(sc). CsI(Tl) scintillator-coupled detectors were then tested under irradiation of X-ray source. The detector with 3 wt% Ag NPs-blended P3HT:PC70BM layer showed the highest CCD of 350.51 nA/cm(2) and the highest sensitivity of 2.20 mA/Gy.cm(2). At optimal Ag NPs blending condition, Ag NPs in the P3HT:PC70BM layer can enhance charge-generation by improving absorption of visible-photons and charge-extraction by improving carrier-mobility while lowering resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,"China, who was in charge of most of the poloidal field (PF) conductor unit lengths manufacturing for the ITER Project, has supplied all the required PF conductors and finished the PF package successfully. Around 130 t of NbTi strands were supplied and used for the PF conductors. During the package execution process, the Chinese Domestic Agency (CNDA) has organized the verification for the NbTi strand acceptance tests based on the requirements of the ITER procurement arrangement (PA). The verification tasks for NbTi strands were undertaken by the Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP). In total, about 550 billets of NbTi strands have been verified and supplied for the PF conductors. The verification levels fit the ITER PA requirements. The test results showed that the quality of the NbTi strands has been well controlled. In addition, in order to supply essential data for the conductor performance prediction and analysis, a full critical current I-c characterization of the NbTi strands, which requires a measurement of I-c versus field, B and temperature, T, has been obtained using the test facilities from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and ASIPP. The parameterization using the Bottura scaling law for the strand with I-c close to the average value from the verification results has been analyzed. The test methods and strand performances are reviewed and summarized in this article.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Here, a simple and general approach was developed for depositing metal nanoparticles on alkanedithiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) based on the spontaneous reduction of metal ions by the free SH sites of SAMs. By immersing the alkanedithiol SAM/Au in a corresponding metal containing solution (HAuCl4, AgNO3, H2PtCl6 and PdSO4), Au, Ag, Pt and Pd clusters, respectively, could be formed on top of the SAM/Au(111) electrode surface, which was confirmed by STM characterization. The size, morphology and coverage of clusters/islands can be tuned by modulating the immersion time, which allows for possible utilization of the metal/SAM/Au(111) in catalysis, nanoelectronics and biodetection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"In this paper, a single ultra-violet exposure for multi-height structure was used to fabricate an optical-fiber-integrated planar lightwave circuit (PLC) splitter using a thermal imprinting technique. The 1x8 tapered multi-mode PLC splitter was designed with a trench at a depth of 50 mu m and a variable width ranging from 50 mu m to 690 mu m for the insertion of waveguide and fiber structures measuring 125 mu mx87.5 mu m in order to minimize insertion loss. Photolithography with a Cr layer and bottom anti-reflection coating (BARC) was utilized to fabricate a multi-height photoresist structure, and the effect of the thick Cr layer and BARC on the geometry was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy of the fabricated structures showed that a Cr thickness of 50 nm and BARC provided the ideal geometry with a minimal undercut and sidewall roughness. Based on the characterization of the imprinted splitter, the average value and uniformity of optical loss between the channels were 10 dB and less than 0.42 dB, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"In this study, TiWVOx/TiO2 thin-films were fabricated using a bipolar pulsed magnetron sputtering technique and were characterized. The results obtained using the X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the anatase phase structure with a highly oriented TiO2 (101) plane. The surface images obtained through scanning electron microscopy revealed the uniform distribution of pebble-like or cell-like clusters with no noticeable crack formation. In this study, an increasing WV alloy pulse power was positively associated with increasing proportions of WOx and VOx in the films. The TiO2 with WV alloy sputtered at a power of 50 W was found to be more hydrophilic than TiO2 with WV alloy sputtered at 200 W, thereby exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"The compressive and shear resistances of the water droplet confined between the hydrophobic surfaces were investigated to evaluate the effect of the micro-scale surface pattern on the repulsive capillary force and friction of droplet. The hydrophobic surfaces covered with square pillar structures in the hexagonal array were prepared and the repulsive normal load and friction coefficient of the droplet were characterized. The force measurements in the vertical and lateral directions on the droplet confined between the prepared hydrophobic surfaces revealed that the compressive resistance to the vertical motion which is identical with the repulsive capillary force increases with deformation when the deformed droplet is horizontally symmetric. On the other hand, the friction coefficient of the squeezed droplet is inversely proportional to the repulsive capillary force. It was found that the reduced pressure acting on the solid-liquid interface results in the abnormal reduction in friction coefficient. In addition, the critical hydraulic pressure analysis confirmed that the partially wetted Cassie-Baxter (CB) state is maintained during sliding motion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"In this paper, we report on our study of the sensitivity of an indirect-type organic X-ray detector, which depends on the conductivity of the hole-transport layer composed of PEDOT:PSS. The polar solvent, dimethylformamide (DMF), was mixed with the PEDOT:PSS solution to improve the conductivity of the HTL. When the DMF was added to the PEDOT:PSS solution, the conductive PEDOT fragments distributed more uniformly because of the high dipole moment of the DMF. In order to find the optimal process condition, the blending ratio of DMF and the baking condition of the PEDOT:PSS layer were examined. The detector with the PEDOT:PSS layer fabricated with 50 wt% DMF added and 160 degrees C baking for 30 min had the highest sensitivity, of 1.988 mA/Gy.cm(2), which was 61.23% higher than the sensitivity of the detector with the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,"In this research, the effect of temperature and anodizing voltage on the morphology and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanotubes which were fabricated in the organic electrolyte containing sodium carbonate as an additive was investigated. The FESEM results indicate that by increasing temperature, the growth rate, wall thickness of nanotubes decreased and disordered nanotube was fabricated. Besides, the photocatalytic activity of nanotubes was decreased as well. Furthermore, enhancing the anodizing voltage from 30 to 50 V leads to improvement of morphology and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanotubes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"Porous biocompatible microgranules, such as hydroxyapatite (HAp), are potential candidates for various bio-medical applications including drug delivery and remediation. Using the principle of evaporation-induced assembly in contact free dispersion droplets, we have synthesized porous micrometric HAp granules consist of interlocked ellipsoidal nanoparticles. We have shown that the shape of the microgranules can be tuned from spherical to doughnut solely by controlling the drying temperature during assembly. The structure and interparticle correlation in the synthesized granules have been probed by electron microscopy and small-angle scattering. The observed morphological transition has been attributed to the buckling of elastic shell made of interlocked HAp nanoparticles. Alteration of granular morphology at higher drying rate does not affect the local packing fraction of the correlated HAp nanoparticles in the granules. The absorption of bovine serum albumin protein by the synthesized granules has been tested as a potential application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"Lithium-sulphur batteries are considered as some of the most potent secondary-battery systems. These batteries are expected to have extensive applications in fields requiring high-energy density. However, such applications are hindered by some serious intrinsic obstacles. Herein, TiO2 nanosheets-rGO/sulphur (TiO2 NS-rGO/S) composites were fabricated through a two-process hydrothermal method. TiO2 nanosheets served as active sites for polysulphide absorption, whereas rGO offered space for sulphur improvement and TiO2 NS-rGO/S composites. The TiO2 NS-rGO/S composite exhibited high discharge capacity of 1099 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2 C rate and retained a capacity of 690 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles, with high sulphur loading of 3 mg.cm(-2). The high initial specific discharge capacity and improved cyclic stability were attributed to the synergistic effects of TiO2 nanosheets and rGO. These results indicated that the simple, low-cost and scalable method provides a novel perspective on practical utilisation of lithium-sulphur batteries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Thermal behavior of hydrotalcites, which is a calcination process, is critical to prepare the metal oxide catalysts with high performances in the practical applications. In this paper, the MgFe-LDH with Mg/Fe molar ratio of 3.0 was prepared by urea method and the calcined products are obtained by calcining at different temperatures (473 K, 573 K, 673 K, 773 K, 873 K and 973 K) under a N-2 atmosphere for 4 h. The structure, morphology, texture, pyrolysis kinetics and mechanism of the MgFe-LDH were studied in detail. On one hand, based on the TG/DSC curves, Starink, Kissinger and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) methods were used to calculate the activation energy, on the other hand, the Satava-Sestak, Achar and Malek methods were used to define the most probable reaction mechanisms of pyrolysis behavior. The results suggested that the thermal decomposition of the LDH experienced two steps, i.e., removal of the interlayer water, followed by dehydroxylation and decarbonation. Moreover the Makel method was used to define the most probable reaction mechanisms of the pyrolysis behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"We report on the temperature-dependent transport behaviors of large-area molecular junctions fabricated with poly-(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) stabilized with polystyrene sulphonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) interlayer electrodes and the archetypal benzenethiol molecules. In this study, we investigated two different benzenethiol molecules: 4-methylbenzenethiol (MBT) and 1,4-benzenedithiol (BDT), which have the identical backbone structure but different top end-groups. The charge transport through the molecular junctions was dominated by distinct interfacial contact properties between the PEDOT:PSS electrodes and the component molecules. We also observed that the electrical characteristics of the MBT junctions are influenced by the PEDOT grain size, particularly depending on the annealing temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Electrochemical reaction induced by gate voltage between metallic cobalt and cobalt oxides was found to remarkably reshape average volume of superparamagnetic particles in Pt/Co/AlOx, stacks at room temperature and thus modulate superparamagnetic properties, such as saturation fields and saturated magnetization, of the superparamagnetic films. The interfacial reaction was indicated in anomalous Hall transport measurement.

23,"Oroxylum as a traditional Chinese medicine, was used as a green and novel bio-template to synthesize tremella-like Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C composite (LVPC) cathode materials by adopting a facile immersion method. The microstructures were analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties were investigated by galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments. The LVPC revealed specific capacity of 95 mAh center dot g(-1) at 1 C rate within potential range of 3.0-4.3 V. After 100 cycles at 0.2 C, the retention of discharge capacity was 96%. The modified electrochemical performance is mainly resulted from the distinct tremella-like structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

25,"Diverse polymer crosslinking techniques allow the synthesis of linear polymer-like structures whose monomers are colloidal particles. In the case where all or part of these colloidal particles are magnetic, one can control the behaviour of these supracolloidal polymers, known as magnetic filaments (MFs), by applied magnetic fields. However, the response of MFs strongly depends on the crosslinking procedure. In the present study, we employ Langevin dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of the type of crosslinking and the distribution of magnetic particles within MFs on their response to an external magnetic field. We found that if the rotation of the dipole moment of particles is not coupled to the backbone of the filament, the impact of the magnetic content is strongly decreased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"In this work, we study the indentation deformation of a Cu47.5Zr19Hf28.5Al5 bulk-metallic glass-matrix composite and characterize the effects of the indentation-loading rate and the holding time at the peak-indentation load. For the same peak-indentation load, increasing the holding time and/or decreasing the indentation-loading rate cause the increase of the indentation depth. There exists the ""bulge"" of the unloading curve at the onset of the unloading for small indentation-loading rates. The Vickers hardness is a monotonically increasing function of the indentation-loading rate for the same peak-indentation load. For the indentations with the same loading and unloading time of 30 s and without an intermediate stage at the peak-indentation load, the Vickers hardness of the Cu47.5Zr19Hf28.5Al5 bulk-metallic glass-matrix composite decreases with the increase of the indentation load. The strain energy dissipated through plastic deformation during the indentation is a power-law function of the indentation load with a power index of 3/2, and the energy ratio (total energy/plastic energy) linearly increases with the depth ratio (residual indentation depth/maximum indentation depth).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"Tin monoxide is a kind of IV-VI metal monoxides that has attracted great deal of attention due to its wide optical band gap and high field effect mobility in the past decade. On the other hand, nanoshell is a unique porous structure. Its curved shell provides a shelter for the hollow core, as well as a much bigger special surface area. We in this study systematically prepared SnO nanoshells through a facile self-assembly method under different annealing conditions. The lithium ion batteries were fabricated immediately based on the as prepared nanoshells. The capacity of as fabricated lithium ion batteries was 559.3 mAhg(-1) at rate performance of 0.1 Ag-1 and 497.5 mAhg(-1) at 1 Ag-1 in 30th cycle.

28,"Optical properties of four model systems (Na-, K-, Rb- or Cs-doped quasi-two-dimensional X1.95Al1.95Si2.05O8.00; X = Na, K, Rb, or Cs) used to study the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a deformable lattice are investigated. The doping evolution of the optical absorption band(s) originating from small bipolarons show strong variations depending on the electron-lattice coupling strength . Despite the increasing number density of small (bi)polarons, the Na-system remains a stubborn (bi)polaronic insulator due to strong , while the other three systems show closing of the respective mobility gaps giving way to conducting phases with differing properties. These interesting evolutions and dynamical properties are compared and discussed. We conjecture that the manifestation of anomalous electronic transport properties and Mooij correlations near the MIT or superconductor-insulator transition in systems with non-negligible electron-lattice coupling effects may be linked to the coexistence of competing polaronic phases and the dynamical intertwining of the deformable lattice and the random electronic potential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,"We theoretically study the spin textures of holes confined in the two-dimensional (2D) quantum well (QW) system. We particularly focus on the spin?orbit interaction (SOI) caused by the bulk-inversion-asymmetry (BIA) and explore the effective magnetic field (EMF) generated by the combination of the SOI couplings. For the study of the semiconductor mixed-alloy (MA) system, we propose the extended perturbation approach including possible perturbation terms crossing with the SOI couplings up to the second order ones. We then study the distribution and orientation of the EMF and investigate how the EMF changes the spin textures of the heavy-mass holes (HHs), light-mass holes (LHs) and separated holes (SHs), respectively. Finally, we study the Larmor spin precession of these holes having the characteristic spin textures driven by the SOI couplings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,"Glass-forming systems approaching their glass transition exhibit universal correlations between picosecond vibrational dynamics and long-time structural relaxation, which can be described by the same master curve in the bulk or confined conditions. In this work, we study at a fundamental level the effects of the reduction of spatial dimensionality on this phenomenon. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of a metallic glass-formers in two dimensions (2D). We show that in the supercooled regime particle localization in the cage and structural relaxation are blurred by long-wavelength fluctuations specific to low-dimensional systems. Once these effects are properly removed, we demonstrate that the fast dynamics and slow relaxation comply, without any adjustment, with same scaling between the structural relaxation time and the Debye?Waller factor, originally observed in three-dimensions (3D).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"In this paper, we study the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) originated from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of intrinsic type in a periodically buckled honeycomb nanoribbon such as silicene. Using the Green function formalism with density matrix expressions, we analyze the SOT contributions from the Fermi-level and -sea electrons. We find that the intrinsic-SOC-induced inverse spin galvanic effect generates spin accumulations perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The anti-damping torque results purely from the Fermi-level contribution, while the field-like torque from both the Fermi-level and -sea contributions. At zero bias voltage, the SOT is symmetric with respect to the Fermi energy (i.e., an even function of the Fermi energy), whereas the presence of bias further introduces the anti-symmetric torque components. When the ferromagnet magnetization lies in the honeycomb plane, all Fermi-sea contributions disappear. The maximum SOT among different Fermi energies is also inspected. For large enough in-plane magnetization compared to the staggered potential, the field-like torque has a maximum at zero Fermi energy. When the magnetization is smaller than some value characterized by the intrinsic SOC, the maximum of the anti-damping torque occurs at the cross point of the two Dirac linear bands in the leads. More importantly, we find that the anti-damping torques responsible for magnetic switching as well as the torkance require staggered potential from an applied out-of-plane electric field, i.e., lattice buckling is essential to the switching. When the electric field is reversed, the anti-damping torque and the torkance are also reversed. Accordingly, full electric control of the SOTs can be realized in this buckled system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"The superconducting behavior in IVB-VB group transition metal nitrides and carbides has generally been associated with the phonon anomaly and Fermi surface nesting. However, the origin of phonon anomaly has remained ambiguous (i.e. longitudinal acoustic or transverse acoustic modes). We performed first-principles calculations to investigate the phononic properties of these materials and theoretically confirmed that the Kohn anomaly originates from the lower transverse acoustic mode along the ?X direction, thereby revealing the frequency derivative discontinuity of the mode. In particular, the Kohn anomaly region is found to move from the interior to the boundary X point of the Brillouin zone with increasing number of valence electrons. We deduced that the Kohn anomaly originated from the electrons of the filled energy level near the van Hove singularity. These results suggest that the screening of the ionic electric field decreases, while the coupling of conduction electrons with the highly degenerate modes between the TA and LA via Umklapp scattering process increases. The Fermi surface nesting also plays a role in enhancing the superconductivity. The electronic excitation effect induces a stabilization of the V-2 group transition metal nitrides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"In this study, it was aimed to develop properties of cement paste having standard properties and produce a graphene doped Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) and boron-based cement paste in this context. This type of special cement is mixed with PVA as polymer additive material so it can have a higher strength and sufficient elasticity per unit weight. Also, boric acid which can absorb neutrons having poisonous effect in nuclear reactions is added into the cement in order to minimize environmental disaster caused by a nuclear accident. Compressive and bending strengths were measured based on TSE tests of graphene doped PVA and boron-based cement paste. Then, samples were measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Method (BET) and subjected to X-ray Diffraction (XRD). In XRD measurements, crystalline structure was observed in all materials. According to compressive strength tests, as the graphene amount increases compressive strength also increases, however in bending strength tests as the graphene amount increases bending strength decreases. Although the values of bending strength of samples produced decreased with increase of graphene content, these values were found to be above the standard values. In addition to boron, graphene admixture has a significant effect on material with its positive strength properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Heterostructures consisting of ferromagnetic metal and antiferromagnetic insulator have exhibited novel properties in interface exchange coupling, magnetoresistance and spin injection due to their fundamental physics of magnetism. However, as compared with bilayer heterostructures, it is very challenging in experiments to prepare single crystal epitaxial ultrathin superlattices consisting of ferromagnetic metal and antiferromagnetic insulator, where the interface exchange coupling, magnetic order, and electrical transport properties are expected to be greatly modulated due to the multiple interfaces and periodical structures. Here we prepared single crystal epitaxial [Co/CoO](n) superlattices consisting of ferromagnetic metal Co and antiferromagnetic insulator CoO by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that the saturation magnetization of [Co 0.6 nm/CoO 1.2 nm](5) superlattice is robust against temperature increase, which only shows a slight decrease of 1.5% from 5 K to 300 K. Moreover, we found that the longitudinal resistivity and anomalous Hall resistivity of [Co/CoO](n) superlattices are strongly modulated by the short-period Co/CoO heterostructure, which are quite distinguished from the electrical transport properties of Co bulk ferromagnetic metal. The [Co/CoO](n) superlattices provide a new insight into heterostructures consisting of ferromagnetic metal and antiferromagnetic insulator, which are beneficial for designing future spintronics devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"Poiseuille flow and thermal transpiration of a rarefied gas between plane parallel walls with nonuniform surface properties are studied on the basis of kinetic theory. Specifically, one of the walls is a diffuse reflection boundary, and the other wall is a Maxwell-type boundary whose accommodation coefficient has a periodic distribution in the direction perpendicular to the flow. The behavior of the gas is studied on the basis of the linearized Bhatnagar?Gross?Krook?Welander model of the Boltzmann equation. The extended integral equation for the macroscopic flow velocity is derived for the analysis at large Knudsen numbers, and is numerically solved. Features in the dependence of the mass flow rate on the distribution of the accommodation coefficient observed in the previous study (Doi 2015 ASME J. Fluids. Eng. 137 101103) were found to hold over a quite wide range of the Knudsen number up to 1000. A successive approximation method of the solution for a large Knudsen number is numerically tested using the integral equation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CoRu/SiO2 catalyst precursor was prepared via incipient wetness impregnation. Characterization and catalytic results showed that CO could be decomposed in glow discharge plasma field, a large fraction of carbon species was deposited as elementary substance on the catalyst surface, while some of the carbon reacted with cobalt and formed cobalt carbide, which could transform into Co-0 with hcp structure after reduction.

37,"Maxwell's equations represented by differential operators describe the local dependence between both electric and magnetic fields in every location of space and time. This description responds to the field concept proposed by Michael Faraday and formalized by James Clerk Maxwell. The discretized version in the form of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique relies on a proposal of local computation of the respective differential operators making use of the central difference approximation of the second derivative of functions through the Taylor series expansion. This article introduces a novel time -symmetric ""non -local"" technique from the mathematical formalism of electromagnetic potentials in the wave equation and its physical interpretation in the Minkowski spacetime. In the proposed case study, the ""non-local"" proposal is 1643 faster than FDTD, i.e.,more than three orders of magnitude, and it uses a time-step that is 4096 times greater than the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy limit without encountering stability problems. New electromagnetic potentials are calculated from the previous and distant ones located at vertices of spatiotemporal regions called causal diamonds that tessellates spacetime without the need for computations inside them. We show that the performance gain is proportional to the size of the spacetime tessellations because the ratio ""domain to boundary"" increases as the domain extension does. Consequently, our novel ""non -local"" approach provides a reduction in computational complexity and a more comprehensible explanation of their fundamental physical aspects, without contradicting the principles of the successful classical field theory. Program summary Program Title: SOME_models Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/7sgh6grm7g.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: C Nature of problem: The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition imposes a numerical bound to the size of the Yee cell in the FDTD approach. This restriction causes excessive oversampling, degrading the computation time of this technique. Solution method: We applied the parallelogram rule to solve the wave equation for the case of (1 + 1) time-space dimensions. With this rule, we proposed a novel algorithm that allows encoding potentials along the characteristic lines that tessellate the spacetime. The new technique produces higher performance gains than those achieved through traditional FDTD. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The as-prepared magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles calcined at 400 degrees C for 2 h with absolute alcohol of 30 mL were characterized with the average nanoparticle size of around 30 nm and the specific magnetization (Ms) of 14.7 emu/g.

39,"A DFT investigation was performed to evaluate the structure, electronic properties of the doped graphene, and the adsorption behavior of C2H2 and H-2 on the graphene sheet. Two kinds of doping scenarios are considered, namely dopants into pristine graphene and vacancy graphene. It is observed that the doping energy is negative for dopant (N, P, S) into vacancy graphene at pyridinictype site, yet it is positive at graphitic-type site for pristine graphene. It could be inferred that the introducing process is exothermic reaction for defective graphene. Meanwhile, for the adsorption of C2H2 on the surface of defective graphene, we notice that C2H2 would prefer to be adsorbed at the top site of the doping atom and the adsorption energy increases with the introducing of dopants, indicating that the dopant would enhance the interaction between C2H2 and graphene. Regarding hydrogen molecule, the dopant has less promotion effect on the adsorption. Moreover, the graphene plays a role of electron donor while the gas molecule (C2H2/H-2) is the electron acceptor when it is adsorbed. For the co-adsorption, the C2H2 is privileged to interact with the graphene and the pre-adsorbed C2H2 on doped graphene would weaken the opportunity of the uptake of H-2 molecule. We anticipate that our results would provide information to design the optimized catalysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The characteristics of D:Si(110)-(1 x 1) are unique compared to those of H:Si(110)-(1 x 1) (Matsushita et al., 2015) in terms of the resolved vibrational modes. By the HREELS, one-dimensional surface phonons consisting of D-Si stretching vibrations are observed above the bulk-phonon band energy edge of 64.5 meV. Ten modes are observed below this value, classified as surface, surface resonant, and bulk phonons according to the calculated energy dispersion as well as the depth profile of spectral density and displacement vectors. In particular, five D Si bending modes are observed out of the seven theoretically predicted modes. The bending modes are strongly coupled with the displacements across the D and five Si layers. The DFT-LDA surface phonon dispersion is in good agreement with the experimental results except a few frequency/dispersion mismatches, as the structure optimized by DFT-LDA mismatches with the previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results (Matsushita et al., 2015).

41,"For solid-fluid interaction, one of the phasic density equations in diffuse interface models is degenerated to a ""0 = 0"" equation when the volume fraction of a certain phase takes the value of zero or unity, because the conservative variables in phasic density equations include volume fractions. The degeneracy can be avoided by adding an artificial quantity of another material into the pure phase. However, nonphysical waves are introduced by the artificial treatment. In this paper, an improved pressure-equilibrium diffuse interface model, which is able to treat zero/unity volume fractions, is presented for solid-fluid interaction. In the proposed model, the phasic density equations are replaced by the algebraic relation between phasic densities and inverse deformation gradient tensors. In consequence, the volume fractions and the phasic densities do not appear explicitly in the conservative equations any more. The degeneracy introduced by zero/unity volume fractions are prevented. A flux-splitting based finite difference algorithm suitable for this formulation is then presented. A series of one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed model can present more accurate results near material interfaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to hydration heat, hydration products, microstructure and porosity of GNPs cementitious matrix materials, the microcosmic mechanism for autogenous shrinkage was also investigated. It was testified that moderate addition of GNPs decreased the autogenous shrinkage of cement-based composites. Moreover, the autogenous shrinkage value was minimal after treatment with 0.10 wt% GNPs cement paste sample for 7 days, at the water to cement ratio of 0.35, and the depressed percentage of autogenous shrinkage reached 81.60% compared with the blank sample.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that the band gap of MoS2/BLG is 30 meV and is enlarged to 98 meV with the substitution of molybdenum (Mo) atom by Re atom in MoS2. By analyzing the change density difference of the two systems, the existence of MoS2 causes the inequivalent charge distribution between the two graphene layers, which induces the band gap. Dopant Re atom enlarges the inequivalent electron distribution, resulting larger band gap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"Fine structure splitting (FSS) is a bottleneck in quantum dot (QD) based solid-state entangled photon pair sources for application in quantum key distribution (QKD). In QDs, entangle photon pairs are generated through a cascaded emission process: biexciton to exciton to the ground state. The FSS of the excitonic states destroys the entanglement of the photon pairs; hence, it needs to be eliminated. For numerical investigation of FSS and design optimization, a multiscale-multiphysics many-body calculation is required. In this article, we report the coupling of a full configuration interaction (FCI) method with a 10-band ( $sp<^>{ {3}}$ $s<^>\ast $ -spin) tight-binding (TB) model to calculate the excitonic energetics of realistically sized InGaN/GaN dot-in-nanowire structures. Model benchmarking has been done against a recently reported InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) structure in the ${a}$ -plane orientation. Computational methodology of implementing a hexagonal-base truncated pyramid shaped QD has been presented. The effects of QD shape/thickness, material composition, and crystal growth direction (polar ${c}$ -plane and non-polar ${m}$ -plane and ${a}$ -plane) on the FSS of InGaN/GaN based photon emitters have been investigated.

Here we study, as a function of Bi-doped Si film thickness, the evolution and ultimate removal of lattice defects that are associated with a recently demonstrated viable route to precisely incorporate Bi dopants in homoepitaxial Si thin films. Scanning tunneling microscopy imaging reveals how the elongated defect structures in the Si lattice, originating from prefabricated Bi nanolines on the substrate surface that are the source of the Bi dopants, evolve with increasing Si overlayer thickness. Moreover, we demonstrate that a prolonged low-temperature annealing is able to annihilate these defect structures while leaving a significant Bi dopant concentration in the Si films.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"Chlorosilane gas transport in ambient hydrogen in a slim vertical cold wall chemical vapor deposition reactor was real-time monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) using its behaviour responding to the properties of the gas mixture. The QCM frequency quickly decreased by introducing the trichlorosilane gas, while it slowly decreased by the dichlorosilane gas. The QCM frequency behavior was explained by the gas flow condition, such as the plug flow and recirculating flow, in the reactor. The relationship was consistent with the gas flow calculations, because the heavy and light gases could directly flow downward and recirculate, respectively, in the chamber due to natural convection. The information obtained from the QCM frequency behavior is expected to be utilized for the real-time gas monitoring and for the process design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

49,"PrFeB/PrCo5 hybrid magnet has excellent magnetic properties and better thermal stability. In this paper, anisotropic nanocomposite PrFeB/PrCo5 hot-deformed magnets with and without doping PrCu eutectic alloy were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. With the addition of 6 wt% PrCu, the coercivity of the magnet (10.8 kOe) is almost double than that of undoped magnet (5.6 kOe), with an enhancement of the remanence (9.1 kG versus 8.4 kG). For the magnet with PrCu, the nonmagnetic PrCu phase is mainly distributed in the phase boundary regions, introducing a coupling effect of demagnetization on the hard-magnetic phases, which obtained an enhancement of the coercivity. The deformed Pr2Fe14B grains of the hybrid magnet have elongated platelet shapes, but the PrCo5 grains are not easy to be deformed, which affects the overall degree of deformation texture of the hybrid magnet. This implies that there is uncoordinated deformation for the PrFeB/PrCo5 hybrid magnet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found the bi-confluent Heun equation (BHE) corresponding to this system in a differential realization approach, by making use of the symmetries. By means of a b-transformation from this second-order equation to a Schrodinger one, we have found a family of quasi-exactly solvable potentials. For each invariant n-dimensional subspace of the second harmonic generation, there are either n potentials, each with one known solution, or one potential with n-known solutions. Well-known potentials like a sextic oscillator or that of a quantum dot appear among them. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

52,"Although it is a simple and convenient birefringence analysis instrument, the traditional planar polariscope is difficult to use for the quantitative measurement of phase retardation and azimuth angle. A novel 2D quantitative birefringence measurement method based on ptychographic iterative engine (PIE) in a planar polariscope is proposed. The birefringent sample is placed in the parallel probe-forming path. By inserting an isotropic diffractive object with good modulation property for the probe, the ptychographic scan measurements are performed under two different dark-field states. The amplitudes and phases of the two probes containing different birefringence information were reconstructed, and the phase retardation and azimuth angle obtained with a simple and straightforward extraction approach. The approach was verified using a classic diametrically compressed disc. The proposed method solves the problem of quantitative birefringence measurement in planar polariscopes by introducing the phase information. It reduces the PIE scans and shortens the data collection time, which provides a practical measurement means for birefringence in materials, biophysics and opto-mechanical system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,"We describe optical switching in solutions of semiconductor nanocrystals illuminated by a 404 nm continuous wave laser source, driven by the formation of a micro-bubble of solvent vapor in the solution. Low boiling solvents such as hexane show an oscillatory modulation of transmitted light intensity (period similar to 4 s) while solvents with intermediate boiling points such as toluene give a stable switching response. An on/off ratio of 83% is observed in the transmitted pump beam. Using this, a pump beam (404 nm, 80 mW continuous wave) was shown to reversibly switch the state of a probe laser (630 nm, 5 mW continuous wave).

54,"Until recently, different metals have been adopted as the electrode materials for MoOx/Si photodetectors and solar cells, but the influence of these different metals has not been investigated. We have systematically studied and proved that the choice of metal has a great impact on optoelectronic performance. Ag and Al with similar low work functions display similar current?voltage behavior before and after the introduction of MoOx; whereas Au and Ni which own similar high work functions lead to another type of current?voltage behavior. MoOx in the metal/MoOx/Si samples brings the superior diode behavior with an enhanced responsivity and decreased dark current as compared with the metal/Si samples. The choice of Ag as the top electrode on MoOx/Si has low alloying or defect formation with the MoOx/Si structure preventing the deterioration of the diode behavior, and the large downward band bending in MoOx at the Ag/MoOx junction facilitates the multitunnelling capture emission. This leads to high responsivity while maintaining the low dark current.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed upgrade is not the final instrument plan, as modifications and compromises will need to be applied for space compatibility with neighbouring instruments. The concept offers an intensity upgrade for a nominal sample of a factor > 20. The relative wavelength spread of the incident beam will be reduced by a factor approximate to 3.

In order for Xe to have good electronic qualifies, it needs to be of high purity. This work reports on the determination of the charge carrier lifetime in Xe, which reflects its purity and characterizes the quality of the gas for gamma-spectroscopy. Our previously developed analytical model for charge transport in an ionization chamber filled with Xe is used to determine the electron lifetime in Xe in the parallel-electrode configuration.

60,"An amorphous InZnO/MoS2 heterojunction-based phototransistor with excellent photoconductive gain and responsivity over the entire visible range has been demonstrated. The photogenerated current of the InZnO phototransistor at long light wavelength (>600 nm) was significantly improved by utilizing narrow bandgap MoS2 as the capping layer (1.3 eV). At lower wavelength, photocarriers are generated due to the optical absorption of both InZnO and MoS2 layers, whereas the latter ensures significant photocarrier generation even at the higher wavelength region of the visible spectrum. The photogenerated carriers subsequently transfer to the underlying InZnO layer of superior carrier mobility that has a high channel conduction of additional electrons from the optically-induced doubly positively charged oxygen vacancies (Vo(++)) where the gate field is screening, thereby leading to the higher photoconductive gain of the InZnO/MoS2 phototransistors. The dynamic photosensitivity behaviour of the aforesaid phototransistor reveals the presence of persistent photoconductivity (PPC) due to the oxygen vacancy associated with InZnO which can be removed by applying a reset gate pulse from -15 to +5 V. The optical properties of these phototransistors were further enhanced by replacing the opaque Ti/Au electrode by an ultrathin transparent Ti/Au electrode. Utilization of the transparent electrode results in enhanced electron injection from source to channel due to a reduced barrier height under illumination giving rise to a ten-fold improvement in the photocurrent and responsivity of the phototransistors. A position-dependent study of the photocurrent w.r.t beam position also reveals that the enhancement in photocurrent is strongly dependent on the position and is at its maximum when the beam is placed near the source region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,"y The realization of large-scale and high-density gaps with sizes as small as possible is crucial for designing ultra-sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. As known, the ultrathin alumina mask (UTAM) surface nanopatterning technique allows the fabrication of periodic nanoparticle (NP) arrays with 5 nm gaps among the NPs, however, it still faces a significant challenge in realizing the reliable distribution of nanogaps over a large area, because of the unavoidable collapse of the UTAM pore wall during the traditional one-step homothermal pore-widening process. Herein, an efficient two-step poikilothermal pore-widening process was developed to precisely control the pore wall etching of a UTAM, enabling effectively avoiding the fragmentation of the UTAM and finally obtaining a large-scale UTAM with a pore wall thickness of about 5 nm. As a result, large-scale NP arrays with high-density sub-5 nm and even smaller gaps between the neighboring NPs have been realized through applying the as-prepared UTAM as the nanopatterning template. These NP arrays with sub-5 nm gaps show ultrahigh SERS sensitivity (signal enhancement improved by an order of magnitude compared with NP arrays with 5 nm gaps) and good reproducibility, which demonstrates the practical feasibility of this promising two-step pore-widening UTAM technique for the fabrication of high-performance active SERS substrates with large-scale ultra-small nanogaps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

64,"Posynomial terms frequently appear in many nonlinear problems and are the core components of geometric and generalized geometric programming problems. The most popular method to treat nonconvex posynomial terms for obtaining global optimization is to convert nonconvex posynomial terms as convex underestimators using transformation techniques. Among the transformation techniques, exponential transformation (ET) and power convex transformation (PCT) can yield the tightest underestimators of posynomial terms. However, the current literature has rarely discussed which to select between ET and PCT. This study employs the definite integral with piecewise linear technique to calculate the error between the original posynomial and the corresponding ET/PCT underestimators. Lastly, this study aims to identify an indicator that can choose the appropriate transformation between ET and PCT and analyze the correctness of the proposed indicator for posynomial terms in nonlinear problems. The proposed indicator can efficiently solve nonlinear problems containing posynomial terms. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed indicator. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

68,"A MuOn-decay Medium-baseline NeuTrino beam facility (MOMENT) was proposed for the leptonic CP violation determination and other potential neutrino physics by offering extremely high flux neutrinos decayed from muons without cooling and acceleration. The huge transverse and large momentum acceptances are needed for the secondary beamline of MOMENT and the beam dynamics has been studied in detail. The whole beamline based on large-aperture superconducting solenoids is composed of several sections: charge selection section, pion decay channel, bending section, adiabatic taper and muon decay channel. To improve particles transmission and neutrino flux while maintaining low background at the far detector of 150 km, the curved solenoids with additional vertical dipole field are applied in the charge selection and bending sections. The adiabatic parameter changes between the sections are also adopted to enhance the neutrino flux. The endto-end simulations have been carried out and the muon antineutrino flux at the far detector can reach 4.1x10(11)/m(2)/year with a low background of unwanted neutrino species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

76,"A recently proposed phase-space boundary integral model for the stochastic propagation of ray densities is presented and, for the first time, explicit connections between this model and parametric uncertainties arising in the underlying physical model are derived. In particular, an asymptotic analysis for a weak noise perturbation of the propagation speed is used to derive expressions for the probability distribution of the phase-space boundary coordinates after transport along uncertain, and in general curved, ray trajectories. Furthermore, models are presented for incorporating geometric uncertainties in terms of both the location of an edge within a polygonal domain, as well as small scale geometric fluctuations giving rise to rough boundary reflections. Uncertain source terms are also considered in the form of stochastically distributed point sources and uncertain boundary data. A series of numerical experiments is then performed to illustrate these uncertainty models in two-dimensional convex polygonal domains. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

77,"This paper describes mainly laser-based techniques applied to a boiler fueled by wood pellets which is a real complicated combustion system. To our knowledge, laser-induced incandescence (LII) and extinction are used to characterize particulate emission at the exhaust for the first time because laser diagnostics are generally applied to laboratory flames, automotive engines and aeroengines. The 30-kW boiler was first characterized by temperature mapping in the combustion chamber and particle diameter analysis by scanning mobility particle sizer at the exhaust and inside the first combustion chamber for a better understanding of the running of this complex combustion system. Non-intrusive laser-based diagnostics including broadband LII, two-color LII and laser extinction excited at 1064 nm have been employed to study the particulate emissions at the exhaust of the boiler during the start-up and the steady-state phases of the boiler. The cross analysis of the experimental results obtained with the different diagnostics shows that particle size distributions, particles volume fractions and the temperature distribution are strongly dependent on the boiler cycle linked to the pellets loading. Laser extinction and LII-based methods provided complementary information about the particulate emissions. The LII technique probes incandescent soot particles formed during the combustion of pellets, while laser extinction detects both soot and non-incandescent particles (such as dust, fly ashes).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The structural and electronic properties were calculated employing density functional theory (DFT). The di-radical character was identified by performing DFT and complete active space self-consistent (CASSCF) calculations. The calculated value of coupling constant revealed the presence of both types of magnetic interaction i.e. ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM). A strong magnetic interaction is found for the radical-dehydrogenated A(-H1)U-.(.+) series whereas a weak magnetic interaction is observed for radical-radical cation, A(.+)U(.+), A(.+)U'(.+) and other di-radical series e.g. A( .+) U.+(-H1)(.), A(.+) U'(-H1)(.), and A(-H1)U-.'(-H1) (.) .

79,"The effects of heating temperature in ultraviolet irradiation process (hereafter named as UV temperature) on photon-activated precursor YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) films were investigated systemically. The results from FT-IR spectra, carbon content, the XPS spectra of Cu 2p and O1s reflected that the photochemical reactions were inhibited by high UV temperature. And we proposed a model to analyze and explain the mechanism of how the UV temperature affect the photochemical reactions. Finally, the YBCO films irradiated at 100 or 150 degrees C had higher Jc values (about 7.0 MA/cm(2) at 77 K and 0 T) than samples UV-irradiated under high UV temperatures (beyond 200 degrees C), which showed lower Jc values due to the weakening of oxidation progress. Consequently, a temperature window of 100-150 degrees C in UV irradiation process maybe suitable for the deep UV irradiation method used in YBCO preparation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

82,"In the present research, heterojunctions comprised of n-type Si wafer substrates and B-doped p-type ultrananocrystalline diamond/hydrogenated amorphous carbon composite films were produced successfully by using pulsed laser deposition. Their alternating current impedance characteristics, under various frequencies, were measured and studied as a function of temperature in the range 200 to 400 K. Both the real (Z') and imaginary (Z '') parts of the complex impedance were temperature dependent. It was apparent that the Z ''-Z' curve for all temperatures exhibited single semicircles. The center of these semicircles was below the Z' axis. With temperature increment, the diameter of the semicircles decreased. The characteristics of the semicircular curve indicated that the parallel resistance (R-p) and constant phase element (CPE) in parallel combination with the series resistance (R-s) should be appropriate for the equivalent electrical circuit model for the produced heterojunctions. Through simulation, the value of R-s at 200 K was found to be 5.04 x 10(3) Omega, and fell to 252.05 Omega at 400 K. Also, the value of R-p was 1.34 x 10(7) Omega at 200 K and decreased to 3.37 x 10(5) Omega at 400 K. Moreover, the value of CPE at 200 K was 95.91 x 10(-12) F with a deviation from the standard (n) value of 0.90 and rose slightly to 115.60 x 10(-12) F with an n value of 0.98 at 400 K.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"The production of p-type silicon/intrinsic ultrananocrystalline diamond/n-type nanocrystalline iron disilicide heterojunction devices was conducted via coaxial arc plasma deposition and pulsed laser deposition. The results of current density-voltage (J-V) curves justified a large leakage current along with minimal response under illumination. A recombination process controls the mechanism for carrier portage in the zone of V <= 0.16 V, while a space-charge-limited current process governs the carrier portage mechanism in the circumstance of V value beyond 0.16 V. Frequency (f) dependent conductance (G/omega)-V and capacitance (C)-V curves were measured to extract the series resistance (R-s) and density of the interface state (N-ss). On the basis of extraction in the manner of Nicollian-Brews, the value of R-s rose with f abatement. With zero bias voltage applied, the value of R-s was 189.84 Omega at 2 MHz and rose to 715.10 Omega at 20 kHz. The acquired R-s may be attributable to the occurrence of R-s in the neutral zones as well as Ohmic contact. The values for N-ss, which were extracted in the manner of Hill-Coleman, were 1.23 x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2) at 2 MHz and 6.51 x 10(12) eV(-1) cm(-2) at 20 kHz.

84,"Mn (2.59 wt.%)-doped tin oxide (MTO) was deposited on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate using RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature. Oxygen was introduced during the sputtering process to prevent the reduction of transmittance and the formation of nonstoichiometric compositions. The dependence of the optical and electrical properties of MTO thin films on the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio was systematically investigated. The transmittance of the MTO single layer (24 nm) at 550 nm gradually increased from 85.9% to 88.2% with an increase of the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio from 0% to 7.9%. The optical band gap was also affected by the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio, varying from 3.30 to 3.64 eV. The MTO film deposited at an O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio of 2.7% showed the minimum resistivity (0.03 Omega . cm). The XPS spectra indicated that the SnO2 thin films become almost stoichiometric as the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio increased. Thus, this sputtering process can be used to prepare flexible MTO films with a wider optical band gap, improved transmittance, and decreased resistivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"We fabricated transparent Mn (2.59 wt.%)-doped tin oxide (MTO)/Ag/MTO films with refractive index-matching layers (IMLs) on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. To reduce refractive index-mismatching, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and MTO layers were inserted between the MTO/Ag/MTO multilayer film and the PET substrate. MTO and Ag were deposited by RF/DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature, whereas spin-coating was used to deposit PDMS at various dilution ratios in hexane. In this study, pattern visibility was examined by comparing the differences in the color and reflectance of oxide/metal/oxide multilayers before and after adding the PDMS and MTO IMLs. In addition, the effects of the PDMS dilution ratio on the electrical and optical characteristics were also investigated. The MTO/Ag/MTO/PDMS/MTO multilayer films showed high transmittance (>86% at 550 nm) except at the dilution ratio of 1:50. As the PDMS dilution ratio increased from 1:50 to 1:200, the reflectance difference (Delta R) increased from 0.08% to 0.35% and the color difference (Delta b*) increased from 0.31 to 1.23.

86,"Recently, better understanding of nano-area is required for 5 nm or less technology node. In particular, the high contact resistance generated in a nano-area significantly degrades the device performance. In this study, we propose a direct contact resistance measurement method without a test structure by separate processes to improve the nano-area contact resistance. The nano-area contact resistance of Ti-Ti and Cu-Cu decreased from 6.46 M Omega to 1.08 M Omega and from 3.78 M Omega to 1.48 M Omega, respectively, when the metal line and native layer formed on the surface were removed. In addition, it is confirmed that the contact resistance decreased with an increase in bonding strength in the case of nano-area homo-metal contact. However, the contact resistance is affected by the tunneling effect and bond energy according to the distance between the first layers of atoms in the case of nano-area hetero-metal contact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"An approach is proposed in which the form of the partial waves in the decomposition of the displacement field is chosen in such a way that boundary conditions on the outer surfaces of a layered structure are matched exactly. So found basis functions are further used to solve for the remaining boundary conditions. Explicit analytic expressions for the vibration spectrum and normalized amplitudes of a free plate in the long wavelength regime are derived and their behavior in the full space of material parameters is discussed. Thus, it is found that properties of the fundamental flexural mode change in a strongly non-monotonous way. In particular, by increasing the thickness of added layer one may observe the same propagation velocity for up to three different values of layer thicknesses ratio. Existence of an important criterion based on the relative signs taken by the amplitudes on the outer surfaces in this regime is revealed. It allows to establish a clear correspondence between symmetric and antisymmetric solutions for a single layer and those for a bilayered plate. It is suggested that the criterion is not limited to case of two layers. Branches of the spectrum are classified accordingly and their evolution from long to short wavelength is discussed. Analysis of a specific example which includes volume and surface modes (Rayleigh and Stoneley) is presented. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme and possible extensions are suggested. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,"There is an urgent need for in situ methods for detecting environmental pollution quickly and accurately. With the development of nanotechnology, a huge potential has been created for the design of highly sensitive sensors with low energy consumption and low costs. If a composite material constructed with carbon nanotubes is used as an electrode in contact with a contaminant, this material undergoes an oxidation-reduction reaction with the contaminant that allows the electrode to function as an electrochemical sensor. This study involved the application of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and modified working electrodes constructed with multi-walled carbon nanotube composites (Ag- and ZnO-multi-walled carbon nanotubes) as electrochemical sensors. These electrodes have good response speed and sensitivity at low concentrations, and they are reusable.

The addition of multi-wall carbon nanotubes facilitates the control of the polymer morphology and increases the specific capacitance of the material. We obtained microfibers or flake-like morphologies depending on the amount of multiwall carbon nanotubes added in the organic phase and through cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge, we evaluated the effect of the backbone geometry and the addition of nanotubes on the electrochemical properties of the composites and the pristine polymers.

91,"In this paper, it is reported a study of spatial correlations in configurations of a plastic wire trapped in two-dimensional planar cavities of different topologies defined by particular distributions of fixed pins that introduce excluded domains. The configurations examined were obtained from an extensive experimental study that shows that the jammed packing fraction of the wire within the cavities depends heavily on the topology of the cavity. The analysis reveals regions of the configurations dominated by finite-size effects controlled by the drive force of injection, and bulk domains strongly controlled by the density of pins. In the bulk regime a persistence length, as obtained in the Kratky?Porod model of polymers, is found to depend linearly with the number of pins which develops the role of an inverse effective temperature. That is, the temperature for the system in this case depends on the topology of the space. The regions characterized by finite-size effects present two regimes corresponding to different mechanical rigidities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fundamental and the practical implications of our findings are thoroughly discussed with pilot calculations and numerical simulations supported via non-linear dynamic analysis. A basic kinetic scheme is suggested for natural glycolytic alternative, ED pathway with its comparison and contrast to other standard routes for glucose metabolism.

94,"A photocurrent spectroscopy employing two-color light excitation beams scanned at different photon energies is proposed to resolve and to investigate different photogeneration processes involving exciton dissociation and above bandgap excitations in organic semiconductors. The basic concept of this spectroscopy is based on the phenomenon of photoresponse enhancement (PE), recently observed in pentacene films. In this phenomenon, the photocurrent, generated with modulated probe-light creating excitons, undergoes enhancement under additional above bandgap bias-light excitation, which acts to facilitate exciton dissociation. In the proposed photocurrent spectroscopy, the excitation energies of probe-light producing photocurrent undergoing PE and those of the biaslight which can induce PE are specified. This allows us to resolve photogeneration via exciton dissociation, which is facilitated by above bandgap excitations, and the onset of the above bandgap excitations, which facilitate exciton dissociation in pentacene films. It is found that light excitation in the region of 1.77-2.43 eV generates excitons diffusing with a diffusion length of 50-80 nm, which is compatible with that of triplet excitons, to the pentacene-substrate interface where dissociate via electron transfer to positive donor-like traps. For light excitation exceeding 2.43 eV, above bandgap excitations become strong competing triplet exciton creation by singlet fission. These results can be explained if the singlet fission and the above bandgap excitations are mediated by charge transfer states with energy-dependent electron-hole separations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"The observation of an ultra-high energy photon component of the cosmic radiation is one of the open problems in Astroparticle Physics. The stringent theoretical and experimental upper limits to the photon flux above 100 TeV make the search of a weak photon signal in the vast hadronic cosmic ray background a challenging task. At these energies, photon primaries entering the atmosphere develop an extensive air shower which is driven by electromagnetic processes with a poor muon component. The muon content of the air showers is one of the most promising observables that could lead to the best possible discrimination between photons and hadronic cosmic rays. In this article, we define a parameter capable of quantifying the muon component while reducing the fluctuations due to the unknown lateral distribution of muons. We explain the different features of this observable using simulated air showers between 30 and 300 PeV. We show that a merit factor of 5 in the separation between photon and proton primaries and a photon signal efficiency of at least similar to 92% while rejecting 99.97% of the proton-initiated showers can be reached in the mentioned energy range of interest. This separation power can be achieved provided the shower features, specially the primary energy, are reconstructed sufficiently precise and without significant biases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the initial surplus water in mortar causes the internal calcium component to leach out and contaminate the surface, and the hardening of concrete that contains pigment is generally slower than that of normal concrete. This study was to evaluate the physical properties of mortar colored by carbon amino silica black (CASB), using a methyl cellulose (MC) polymer to reduce surface efflorescence and increase early strength by means of steam curing. MC modifies the mechanical properties of mortar by forming a polymer film, which prevents the soluble calcium from migrating to the surface and reduces whitening in steam cured mortar.
