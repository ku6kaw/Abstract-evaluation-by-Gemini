0,"In this paper, the linear isotherm regularity (LIR) equation of state has been used to predict some of the most important thermodynamic quantities and also a series exploring the physical consequences in dense fluids. A new method in this paper is introduced to derive these empirical rules from the LIR equation of state. Thus, first, the thermodynamic quantities are extracted and then verified by the experimental data. The monatomic fluids whose experimental data are used to test the ability of the equation of state are helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon. Boyle's temperature and density are also derived in this paper for monatomic fluids, which is in good agreement with the quantities reported in literatures. The modified model was compared with the other two-parameter equation of state and the results showed the modified model can provide better correlation results with the average absolute relative deviation.",no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

2,"In this study, we perform a series of mass-balance-type calculations, in order to estimate the minimum volume of liquid water required to dissolve completely a single methane gas bubble, located inside different types of domains that are near or under hydrate equilibrium pressure/temperature conditions. We examine the case of methane bubble dissolution in the bulk, along with the cases of methane bubble dissolution within simple/regular networks of pores, where all pores have the same size. In our calculations, we consider experimental values for the equilibrium solubilities of methane in water, along the hydrate-forming line, as well as, values obtained from predictive tools that are based on different thermodynamic models. The effect of aqueous NaCl solutions on the results is also investigated. As a result of the relatively low solubility of methane in water, large volumes of water are required for complete dissolution of a methane bubble.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

We obtain the generating function of the structures using the Hermitian matrix model with the Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind and analyze the statistics with respect to the number of stems.

4,"Metallic cavities show substantial advantages in light confinement, providing opportunities to modulate the optical resonances and absorption. Here, we report on the configuration of horizontally aligned ZnO-nanowires-based metallic cavity ensemble with a light to dark current ratio of similar to 1000. An enhanced polarization photodetection ratio of transverse electric (TE) to transverse magnetic (TM) was experimentally observed compared to the single ZnO nanowire photodetector. Finite difference time domain simulation was performed on the metallic cavities, showing the distinct resonance behaviors under TE and TM light. The confinement by the multi-reflection and optical resonances between the metallic claddings contribute to the high anisotropy ratio. Furthermore, the polarized light absorption in the metallic cavity was studied as well as in the naked nanowire, which reveal a significant dependence on the cavity diameter and wavelength. For the metallic cavities, the absorption ratio of TE to TM show an enhanced value in the range of 300-500 nm wavelength and 85-150 diameter and a reversed value in the range of 400-500 nm wavelength and 17-50 diameter. While for the naked nanowires, the ratio show an apparently opposite value in these two regions.

Platinum loaded on Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 was prepared by impregnation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, Brunner-Emmet-Teller measurements (BET), temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen, scanning electron microscope, and X-ray photoelectron spectra. The three-way catalyst platinum/ceria-zirconia/fw is prepared with the paste ball mill coating technique. And the catalytic performance is evaluated under simulated fuel ethanol engine exhaust gas condition. The catalysts not only show excellent low-temperature performances and several-way catalytic activities for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and acetaldehyde but also have better high-temperature resistance.

6,"We present a simple and effective approach to improve X-ray data collected under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature. The X-ray data of the sample and the amorphous, liquid, or crystalline pressure transmitting media (PTM) which surround the sample are collected separately at each pressure and temperature, allowing a satisfactory background subtraction. Using this method, we are able to identify weak diffraction peaks of the low-Z elements Li and Na and amorphous silica under pressure and at cryogenic temperatures. In addition to exploration of phase diagrams of low-Z materials, this method can also be applied to recognize new phases of other unknown materials such as binary hydrides in the high pressure and high-temperature synthesis, and to allow deterministic identification of the onset pressure of structural phase transitions and the presence of mixed phases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"The beam quality of array lasers which propagate in atmosphere will degrade in far-field. Therefore, the ultimate efficiency of combined lasers will be affected if no compensation measure is taken in some typical systems such as high energy system. Based on the model of array lasers with incoherent combination, laser propagation in atmosphere is simulated by generating a random atmospheric turbulence phase screen to modulate the phase of the laser beam. The distorted wavefront of atmospheric turbulence is divided according to the array distribution. The phase generated by tilt aberration coefficient which is solved by the method of fitting sub-wavefront data is eliminated in the phase of sub-beam, which simulates the process of correcting tilt aberration. The simulation results show that comparing with the case of tilt aberration, the power in the bucket (PIB) and the Strehl rate (SR) of combined lasers focusing in far-field are improved when the tilt aberration influenced by the same atmospheric turbulence phase screen is corrected. At the same time, coherence length ranging from 4 cm to 45 cm is used to characterize atmospheric turbulence of different intensities. At each coherent length, the PIB and SR are calculated when the distances of propagation of lasers are 2 km and 3 km, separately. The simulation results show that although PIB and SR before and after tilt aberration are corrected, they become worse with the decrease of coherence length, and PIB and SR are improved more obviously when tilt aberration is corrected in stronger turbulence. An experiment in the case of 2 km is carried out by using a prototype of incoherent combination, and the data are obtained by measuring the focused spot at the target. The measurement results confirm that the correcting of tilt aberration can improve the beam quality of array lasers with incoherent combination in far-field. In summary, the research conducted in this work can obtain tilt aberration accurately and the corresponding method of correction is easy to implement, which can provide supporting data for improving the performances high energy laser systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"We study various statistical properties of the double-dimer model, a generalization of the dimer model, on rectangular domains of the square lattice. We take advantage of the Grassmannian representation of the dimer model, first to calculate the probability distribution of the number of nontrivial loops around a cylinder, which is consistent with the previously known result, and then to calculate the expectation value of the number of loops surrounding two faces and the left-passage probability, both in the discrete and the continuum cases. We also briefly explain the calculation of some related observables. As a by-product, we obtain the partition function of the dimer model in the presence of two and four monomers, and a single monomer on the boundary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"The relative stability and kinetics of CH4 horizontal ellipsis O2 horizontal ellipsis MO and the reaction potential energy surface under the transition metal oxide catalysts (RuO/RhO/PdO) during methane oxidation reaction were studied with density functional calculations. The results show that the reaction can be easily carried out under the catalysis of transition metal oxides. The transition barriers and the reaction rate constant all show oscillation modes that are consistent with the increase of atomic number at 298 K. while the calculated reaction energies (Er/kcal mol-(1)) are gradually increased. The oxidised dioxide can be treated to form metal and oxygen that can still be used as a catalyst for methane oxidation; the resulting oxygen can continue to be used as an oxidant. We also calculated the rate constant of methane oxidation reaction to give the resulting methanol pathway. The calculated dynamic characterisation shows that the rate constant has a positive temperature dependence. Our calculation show that this reaction is exothermic reaction via the RuO/RhO/PdO catalyst, and the reaction is thermodynamically feasible. This study also provides theoretical reference data for us to identify new catalysts for the catalytic oxidation of methane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"A periodic array of atomic sites, described within a tight binding formalism is shown to be capable of trapping electronic states as it grows in size and gets stubbed by an 'atom' or an 'atomic' clusters from a side in a deterministic way. We prescribe a method based on a real space renormalization group method, that unravels a subtle correlation between the positions of the side coupled atoms and the energy eigenvalues for which the incoming particle finally gets trapped. We discuss how, in such conditions, the periodic backbone gets transformed into an array of infinite quantum wells in the thermodynamic limit. We present a case here, where the wells have a hierarchically distribution of widths, hosting standing wave solutions in the thermodynamic limit. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

12,"The critical current of a new structure, the superconducting differential double contour interferometer (DDCI), investigated recently, depends on the parity of the sum of quantum numbers of the two superconducting loops connected in two points by two Josephson junctions. The theory confirms that the DDCI structure can be used for the ideal readout of quantum states of the flux qubit. Large jumps in the critical current and voltage enables to observe continuously the change in time the state of the flux qubit. Such observations can have fundamental importance for the investigation of macroscopic quantum systems with strongly discrete spectrum such as the flux qubit. The DDCI structure can also be used for precise measurement of a very weak magnetic field. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Dislocations are always observed during crystal growth, and it is usually desirable to reduce the dislocation density in high-quality crystals. Here, the annihilation process of the 30 degrees Shockley partial dislocation pairs in CdTe is studied by first-principles calculations. We found that the dislocations can glide relatively easily due to the weak local bonding. Our systematic study of the slipping mechanism of the dislocations suggests that the energy barrier for the annihilation process is low. Band structure calculations reveal that the band bending caused by the charge transfer between the two dislocation cores depends on the core-core distance. A simple linear model is proposed to describe the mechanism of formation of the dislocation pair. More importantly, we demonstrate that hole injection can affect the core structure, increase the mobility, and eventually trigger a spontaneous mutual annihilation, which could be employed as a possible facile way to reduce the dislocation density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"We report on the experimental investigation of the phase coherence of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical antidot lattice (ADL). In the ADL, a series of potential hills are arranged on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice and crisscrossing channels with zero ac Stark shift form a 2D mesh with multiple junctions. Due to these structural features, matter wave interference released from the ADL is clearly visible even at antidot heights of the 300 times the photon recoil energy. However, phase coherence is significantly reduced at extremely tall antidot heights and atom hopping is suppressed. We explain this loss of coherence by introducing a periodic effective potential felt by the atoms on the mesh lines, which is the result of the quantization of the faster atomic motion in the orthogonal direction. This effective potential localizes atoms at the junctions, forming a bundle of tubelike gases. Using the Bose-Hubbard model, we interpret the coherence properties in terms of a 2D Josephson junction array. We have also observed the emergence of vortexlike holes after merging the tubelike gases. We discuss the effect of transverse thermal phase fluctuations and interpret the appearance of the vortexlike holes as a possible signature of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless crossover in the 2D lattice plane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"LiFePO4/C-Li4Ti5O12 composite electrode materials were synthesized by blending LiFePO4/C and Li4Ti5O12 materials then calcining at 500 degrees C for 14 h. The effects of different composite ratios on the phase structure and electrochemical properties of LiFePO4/C-Li4Ti5O12 composite cathode materials were investigated. The results showed that the structure of LiFePO4/C and Li4Ti5O12 in the composite prepared by the simple blending method did not change. XRD shows only the characteristic peaks of these two substances and no characteristic peaks of other crystal impurities. When the recombination ratio was 8:2 (LPF-8), the obtained composite material had fine particles and uniform size. The initial discharge capacity at 0.1C rate is 151.56 mAh g(-1) at the voltage of 1.0-4.2 V. After 100 cycles, the capacity retention rate was 97.3% which exhibited more outstanding electrochemical performance than samples with other composite ratios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"We report the spontaneous emission of vortex rings from turbulence induced by a vibrating wire in superfluid He-4, and investigate the statistical behavior of quantum turbulence. Using a set of vibrating wires as a turbulence generator and vortex detectors, we measured the distribution of times of flights between the generator and the detectors for emission directions parallel and perpendicular to the vibration direction of the generator wire. We find that the times exhibit a single exponential distribution for emissions in both directions, indicating temporally random emission of vortex rings with a single mean emission rate. When a limit is set on the detection diameter of the vortex rings, the detection times exhibit a double exponential distribution for the perpendicular direction for ring diameters above 10 mu m, suggesting that large vortex rings reach the detector with a high rate emission at later times. In the parallel emission direction, the emission rate during an equilibrium state exhibits a power law behavior with a minimum diameter of detected vortex rings, implying that a vortex tangle generated by an oscillating object has a self-similar structure of vortex lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"The matter can be instantaneously heated up to a high energy density state by the high power laser. When the high power laser is injected into silver spherical hohlraum, the high temperature radiation source formed in the hohlraum can drive the high velocity blast wave in the laboratory to study various astrophysical phenomena such as supernova remnants, stellar jets, etc. As the basis of laser driven blast wave experiments, the first experimental results of energy coupling and partitioning of silver spherical hohlraum with one laser entrance hole (LEH) on Shenguang III prototype laser facility are introduced in this work. Four beams with 3.2 kJ of laser energy in a 1ns square laser pulse from the upper hemisphere are used to heat the silver spherical hohlraum targets. The silver spherical hohlraum targets are 800 mu m-diameter and 650 mu m-diameter LEH, and are fabricated by electroforming silver onto an acrylic mandrel. The laser coupling and partitioning to the targets are investigated by using the optical and X-ray diagnostics. The experimental results show that the radiation temperature is beyond 240 eV, the laser-to-X-ray conversion efficiency of silver hohlraum is 0.68 and the silver albedo is 0.83. With the driving of the high temperature radiation source, most of laser energy is coupled to the residual shell, and the high velocity blast wave can be generated. The laser energy not coupled to the target is lost through scattering light, emitting hot electrons and radiating X-rays. The experimental results show that the fraction of energy lost due to the scattering light is 15%, that due to emitting the total hot electrons is less than 1%, almost 30% of the laser energy is lost from the LEH by radiating the X-ray flux, almost 9% of the laser energy leaks from the spherical shell consisting of the 5.6 mu m-thick Ag layer and 10 mu m-thick CH layer through the X-ray radiation flux, and 45% of the laser energy is converted into the kinetic energy and internal energy of the remaining spherical shell. Therefore, more than 50% of the laser energy will be used to drive the high velocity blast wave in the subsequent experiments. After 950 ps, the silver plasma is concentrated in the center of the silver spherical hohlraum, which does not affect the injection of 1ns laser. The experiment on energy coupling and partitioning of a spherical silver hohlraum laser is carried out for the first time on Shenguang III prototype laser facility, which lays a foundation for the subsequent experiments on laser driven blast wave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"The interaction of cytosine with AuCl4-, under electrospray ionization mass spectrometric conditions, is discussed. On the basis of respective full scan mass spectra and product ion spectra, obtained in positive and negative ion mode, it has been deduced that cytosine is very prone to form Au(I)-containing complexes. The complexes may be formed in the gas phase by decomposition of Au(III)-containing complexes and also in the electrospray ionization source as a result of the occurrence of redox process. It has also been found that the interaction of cytosine with Au+ is stronger than that with Cu+ or Ag+, although taking into account the electrostatic attraction, it is not expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Applied to Yang-Mills connections we obtain a bound for the index in terms of its energy which is conformally invariant, and captures the sharp growth rate. Furthermore we derive an index estimate for Einstein metrics in terms of the topology and the Einstein-Hilbert energy. Lastly we derive conformally invariant estimates for the Betti numbers of an oriented four-manifold with positive scalar curvature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"In this study, the electronic and optical properties of wurtzite MgxZn1-xO structures for different Mg mole fractions (x) are studied using Density Functional Theory (DFT). In calculations, the generalised gradient approximation (GGA + U) formalism is used with the Hubbard parameters (U) are applied to Zn-3d and O-2p electrons of ZnO. The calculated electronic band structures show that the band gap energies of the investigated structures increase linearly with increasing Mg mole fraction from 0 to 31.25% which is also quantitatively consistent with the previous experimental results. In addition, the electron effective masses of investigated MgxZn1-xO structures are calculated. The electron effective masses of investigated structures show an increment linearly with increasing Mg mole fractions. The optical results show that the absorption edges of the structures move toward the higher energies region as the Mg mole fractions increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"In order to thoroughly comprehend and adequtely interpret NMR data, it is necessary to perceive the complex structure of spin Hamiltonian. Although NMR principles have been extensively discussed in a number of distinguished introductory publications, it still remains difficult to find illustrative graphical models revealing the tensorial nature of spin interaction. Exposure of the structure standing behind mathematical formulas can clarify intangible concepts and provide a coherent image of basic phenomena. This approach is essential when it comes to hard to manage, time-dependent processes such as Magic Angle Spinning (MAS), where the anisotropic character of the spin system interactions couple with experimentally introduced time evolution processes. The presented work concerns fundamental aspects of solid state NMR namely: the uniqueness of the tetrahedral angle and evolution of both dipolar D and chemical shield sigma coupling tensors under MAS conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"We study two-dimensional non-abelian BF theory in Lorenz gauge and prove that it is a topological conformal field theory. This opens the possibility to compute topological string amplitudes (Gromov-Witten invariants). We found that the theory is exactly solvable in the sense that all correlators are given by finite-dimensional convergent integrals. Surprisingly, this theory turns out to be logarithmic in the sense that there are correlators given by polylogarithms and powers of logarithms. Furthermore, we found fields with ""logarithmic conformal dimension"" (elements of a Jordan cell for L0). We also found certain vertex operators with anomalous dimensions that depend on the non-abelian coupling constant. The shift of dimension of composite fields may be understood as arising from the dependence of subtracted singular terms on local coordinates. This generalizes the well-known explanation of anomalous dimensions of vertex operators in the free scalar field theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"With the increase of storage density in three-dimensional NAND flash memory, technical challenges become more and more severe. Specifically, the etch process of ultra-narrow via is one of the most intricate technical challenges. The critical dimension (CD) of ultra-narrow via is sensitively affected by this process. In this paper, a Design of Experiment (DOE) was presented to develop an optimized etch process. Various statistical correlations between factors and measured results were analyzed by statistical software. Tail phenomenon and cliff effect were explicated by wafer level analysis. A process regression model was employed for process window check and process optimization. Based on data analysis, modeling, and supplementary experiments, the ratio of CxFy to CxHyFz during the etching of anti-reflective coating (ARC) was identified as the most significant factor for the etch process of ultra-narrow via.

25,"Peculiarities in the dependences of the elastic and strength properties of ceramics with a hierarchically organized pore structure on the porosity are revealed. To exclude the influence of other microstructural factors, such as, for example, grain size, the study was carried out on the basis of multilevel computer modeling using movable cellular automata and a probabilistic approach. A special computer model of the mechanical behavior of porous ceramics with a bimodal pore size distribution has been developed. At the lower level of the model, small isolated pores are explicitly taken into account and series of calculations are carried out for the representative samples with individual pore arrangement in space. The values of the elastic and strength characteristics of these samples obtained as a result of Weibull analysis serve as effective properties of the porous material matrix at the mesoscale. At the mesoscale, large pores of both equiaxial and elongated shapes are considered explicitly. At the macrolevel, the heterogeneity of the material is described implicitly by setting to the automata the unique elastic and strength properties obtained from the Weibull analysis of the calculation results obtained at the mesoscale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"Distinct oscillations of the purity of the single-particle density matrix for many-body open quantum systems have been shown to exist [D. Dast, D. Haag, H. Cartarius, and G. Wunner, Phys. Rey. A 93, 033617 (2016)]. They are found in PT-symmetric Bose-Einstein condensates, in which the coherence of the condensate drops and is almost completely restored periodically. For this effect the presence of a gain and loss of particles turned out to be essential. We demonstrate that it can also be found in closed quantum systems whose subsystems experience a gain and loss of particles. This is shown with two different lattice setups for cold atoms, viz., a ring of six lattice sites with periodic boundary conditions and a linear chain of four lattice wells. In both cases pronounced purity oscillations are found, and it is shown that they can be made experimentally accessible via the average contrast in interference experiments. This shows that it is possible to identify this characteristic effect in closed quantum systems which have been proposed to realize PT-symmetric quantum mechanics via separation into subsystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"To improve the cycling performance of nickel-rich layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material, many methods have been studied to reduce cation mixing degree, improve layered structure and modify particle morphology, including doping elements, coating metal oxides and morphology control (spherical, nanoflower, core-shell structure, etc.). In this paper, a new gradient calcination process through four-step temperature gradients is applied to synthesize LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material synthesized by gradient calcination shows more excellent electrochemical performance than traditional method. The XRD results indicate that the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material produced by four-step calcination shows lower cation mixing degree and better crystallinity. In addition, the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode produced by gradient calcination presents the highest initial capacity (177.9 mAh g(-1)) and a retention of 82.07% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. And the material shows the best electrochemical properties when the final temperature in these steps is 820 degrees C.

28,"Nanocolloids, obtained by pulsed laser ablation (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm, 7 ns, 150 mJ) of metallic Sn in distilled water and also in solutions of hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid, were dried and subjected to heat treatment at different temperatures up to 800 degrees C. It has been shown that addition of H2O2 or HNO3 has an effect not only on the size characteristics and structure of the initial nanoparticles, but also on the process of formation and the final characteristics of SnO2 under annealing. By the method of powder x-ray diffraction it was established that in the case of pulsed laser ablation in water and in a solution of nitric acid, the initial particles contain the phase SnO, but for annealed sample obtained by ablation in HNO3, an intermediate orthorhombic phase of SnO2 is formed.

29,"This article further develops the Coulson-Fischer formalism in conjunction with the optimised effective potential method [V.N. Glushkov and S. Wilson, Molec. Phys. 110, 149 (2012)] to incorporate both exchange and static correlation effects for excited states having the same symmetry as the ground state. By using this formalism, we compute complete potential energy curves for the ground and first excited states of the molecule and the isoelectronic heteronuclear ion. Effective potentials are generated in according to a novel density functional theory [A.K. Theophilou, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 074104 (2018)] in which the Kohn-Sham (KS) like potential has spherical symmetry around each nucleus. In this way, the inconsistencies of standard density functional theory concerning the asymmetry of the KS potential are remedied. In our implementation, an effective potential which satisfies this requirement is expressed as a direct mapping of the external potential. Different approximations for the effective potentials are investigated. It is shown that applications of the proposed formalism support good agreement with the exact Coulson-Fischer theory for both the ground and first excited state potential energy curves and thus a qualitatively correct description of dissociation.

33,"A significant difference was found in the amplitude and polarization spectra of ULF magnetic noise at stations with a base of 120 km during periods of absence of regional thunderstorm activity. A simultaneous analysis of low-frequency data and ionosonde data allowed us to conclude that the difference in the main parameters of the polarization spectrum at two stations is due to the appearance of sporadic E-s layers having a nonuniform horizontal intensity distribution with characteristic scales of the order of the base between stations. A difference in the depth of variations in the polarization parameter epsilon was also found during the ionosphere recovery after magnetic storms. It could be related with Es layers, which had not only a nonuniform intensity distribution, but were also located at different altitudes. A difference was found in the frequency scales of the spectral resonance structure during recording of time variations of its fundamental frequencies. Numerical calculations of the parameter epsilon with specifying model E-s layers and electron-density profiles corrected at the altitudes of the ionospheric F layer adequately explained the observed difference in the magnetic noise spectra and allowed us to determine the altitudes at which the horizontal ionospheric irregularity existed.

Numerical modeling, which was performed for a gyrotron producing radiation with a frequency of 0.78 THz and operating at the second cyclotron-frequency harmonic at the TE8.5 mode, demonstrates the possibility of spatial and energy separation of electron beams. This makes it possible to implement a double-stage recuperation scheme. The found energy spectra of electrons suggest an increase in the gyrotron efficiency by 3.5-4 times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"Classical mechanics for individual physical systems and quantum mechanics of nonrelativistic particles are shown to be exceptional cases of a generalized dynamics described in terms of maps between two manifolds, the source being configuration space. The target space is argued to be two dimensional and flat, and its orthogonal directions are physically interpreted. All terms in the map equation have a geometrical meaning in the target space, and the pullback of its rotational Killing 1-form allows the construction of a velocity field in configuration space. Identification of this velocity field with tangent vectors in the source space leads to the dynamical law of motion. For a specific choice of an arbitrary scalar function present in the map equation, and using Cartesian coordinates in the target space, the map equation becomes linear and can be reduced to the Schrodinger equation. We link the bidimensionality of the target space with the essential nonlocality of quantum mechanics. Many extensions of the framework presented here are immediate, with deep consequences yet to be explored.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"The single ionization of He atom by the impact of highly charged dressed projectile nucleus is investigated by applying the three-body formalism of three-Coulomb wave (3CW) model and the first Born approximation (FBA). In the 3CW formalism, the interaction between the dressed projectile and the active electron is represented by a model potential containing both the long-range and short-range part of the Coulomb potential. The target is treated as a one-electron atom, where the interaction of the active electron with the rest of the target is represented by a similar type of model potential. The correlated motion of each pair of particles, interacting through long-range Coulomb potential, is taken into account in the final state. In addition, an independent particle model and a single-zeta Roothaan-Hartree-Fock 1s wavefunction, describing helium in its ground state, is used to carry out the calculations, where the effective charge of the target nuclei is obtained from the initial orbital energy. The energy distributions of the double-differential cross sections (DDCS) at low and intermediate energy electron emission from helium atom have been investigated. Our theoretical results are compared with both the available experimental measurements and theoretical calculations using other methods. There is good overall agreement of the present calculations with experimental data except for low-energy electron emission (less than 10 eV). For target ionization by a dressed projectile, we find that the cross sections depend on the projectile charge. For distant collisions involving high energy ions, the primary effect of bound projectile electrons is to screen the projectile nuclear charge, thereby reducing the strength of the interaction potential. Finally, the energy distribution of DDCS ratio at different angles has also been studied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"The Optimised Random Phase Approximation in the thermodynamic perturbation theory of liquids is augmented by use of Mayer function. The direct correlation function of a hardcore potential is assumed to be represented by A Mayer function instead of THE one used in the Random Phase Approximation and Mean Spherical Approximation. Correcting the unphysical behaviour of the corresponding pair correlation function in the hardcore region will give rise to a new perturbation theory as a natural generalisation of the Optimised Random Phase Approximation. To assess its accuracy and reliability, the theory is used to find the structure and thermodynamics of hard-core Yukawa fluids. The new-resulted theory is shown to be more accurate than the Optimised Random Phase Approximation both in predicting the thermodynamic and structure functions of hard-core Yukawa potentials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"Since early models of wave propagation in both stationary and moving media during the nineteenth century, the Lorentz transformation (LT) has played a key role in describing characteristic wave phenomena, e.g., the Doppler shift effect. In these models LT connects two different events generated by wave propagations, as observed in two reference systems and the synchronism is absolute. In relativistic physics LT implements the relativity principle. As a consequence, it connects two space-time event coordinates that both correspond to the same physical event and ""absolute synchronization"" is not allowed. The relativistic interpretation started from Einstein's early criticism of the notion of ""simultaneity"" and Minkowski's invariance of the space-time interval. In this paper, the two different roles of LT, i.e., in classical wave propagation theories and in relativistic physics, are discussed. Einstein's early criticism is also re-examined with respect to LT in view of its significance for the notion of simultaneity. Indeed, that early criticism is found to be defective. Our analysis is also useful for general readers in view of its impact on modern speculations about the existence of a preferred system of reference sigma, where light propagation is isotropic, and related implications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"The effect of uniformly distributed fluctuation in the coupling strength of a 100 spins transverse field quantum Ising chain is studied using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group on the Matrix Product States formalism. Uniform noise with mean zero and amplitude eta is introduced to uniform nearest neighbour coupling of value unity. Disordered averages of thermodynamic quantities are calculated from 100 disordered realizations for each transverse field reading. We show that the system exhibits distinct behaviour of ordered and disordered state separated at eta 1.0. For eta less than or similar to 1.0, thermodynamic behaviour of the system gradually deviates from pure quantum Ising model. For eta > 1.0 system exhibits highly fluctuating thermodynamic behaviour. Edward-Anderson order parameters are calculated and shown to be much less fluctuating and suitable as an order parameter for eta > 1.0. Qualitative behaviour of the system is not affected by finite-size effect and replacing the fluctuation with normally distributed noise. Finally, for noise level between eta = 1.0 and 1.5, the system exhibits a faster phase transition and enhances transverse magnetization before the critical point. For certain ranges of noise amplitude before the critical point, the quantum fluctuations are amplified. This suggests a potential improvement of quantum annealing within that regime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"In this work, the multicomponent nanocomposites containing filamentary carbon nanostructures were synthesized using materials based on iron oxides with a predominant content of the epsilon phase (epsilon-Fe2O3). These iron oxide-based materials were obtained by a direct plasma-dynamic synthesis with supersonic outflow of an iron-containing electric discharge plasma into an oxygen atmosphere. Subsequently, they were used as an initial precursor and placed in the plasma-chemical reactor, where the multicomponent C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanostructures were synthesized under the influence of the pulsed electron beam. This method was based on the volume excitation of the reaction gas by a pulsed electron beam in such a way as to control the uniform process implementation in the entire excitation region. The morphology and phase composition of the synthesized C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanocomposites were studied. A typical morphological feature of the C/SixOy/Fe2O3 samples was found to be the formation of filamentary nanostructures. Their diameter does not exceed 10-20 nm, while their length varies up to 1 mu m.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"The minimum vertex cover (Min-VC) problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. Earlier studies illustrate that the problem defined over the Erdos-Renyi random graph with a mean degree c exhibits computational difficulty in searching the Min-VC set above a critical point c = e = 2.718.... Here, we address how this difficulty is influenced by the mesoscopic structures of graphs. For this, we evaluate the critical condition of difficulty for the stochastic block model. We perform a detailed examination of the specific cases of two equal-size communities characterized by in and out degrees, which are denoted by c(in) and c(out), respectively. Our analysis based on the cavity method indicates that the solution search once becomes difficult when c(in) + c(out) exceeds e from below, but becomes easy again when c(out) is sufficiently larger than c(in) in the region c(out) > e. Experiments based on various search algorithms support the theoretical prediction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"In the mid-1980s, the cost of investment in infrastructure for particle accelerators and colliders at the highest energy had risen to such level that the host laboratory (CERN) could no longer afford the cost of development of new detector technology required for the experiments. Large particle colliders were identified by the tools of the future for high-energy physics research, and a long-term view of their development was already conjured up in the late 1970s. It was based on this appraisal that a separate project, called LAA, which addresses the development of the technologies that are required to fully exploit the potential of the new infrastructure, was conceived. The project, specifically funded by the Italian government, centers on advanced microelectronics, and it is largely thanks to this development that the experiments at the large hadron collider (LHC) at CERN were equipped with performant detectors. Some of this equipment features in (i) the Italian School project to observe Extreme Energy Events (EEE), (ii) the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in the International Space Station and (iii) the time-of-flight (TOF) detector of the LHC heavy ion experiment ALICE at CERN. Several spin-offs for applications in medical instrumentation and advanced electronics were also initiated by development in the framework of the LAA project. The project also covers development work on superconductors and high field superconducting magnets for a future very LHC.

Numerical computations of dispersion relation in the pinch plasma medium showed that CR started at approximately E = 0.0645 MeV with the relativistic velocity of 0.46 (m/s).

46,"The canonical formulation of general relativity (GR) is based on decomposition space-time manifold M into R x Sigma, where R represents the time, and Sigma is the three-dimensional space-like surface. This decomposition has to preserve the invariance of GR, invariance under general coordinates, and local Lorentz transformations. These symmetries are associated with conserved currents that are coupled to gravity. These symmetries are studied on a three dimensional space-like hypersurface Sigma embedded in a four-dimensional space-time manifold. This implies continuous symmetries and conserved currents by Noether's theorem on that surface. We construct a three-form E-i Lambda DA(i) ( D represents covariant exterior derivative) in the phase space ( E-i(a), A(a) (i)) on the surface Sigma, and derive an equation of continuity on that surface, and search for canonical relations and a Lagrangian that correspond to the same equation of continuity according to the canonical field theory. We find that Sigma(0a)(i) is a conjugate momentum of A(a)(i) and Sigma F-ab(i)ab(i) is its energy density. We show that there is conserved spin current that couples to A(i), and show that we have to include the term F mu viF mu vi in GR. Lagrangian, where F-i = DA(i), and A(i) is complex SO(3) connection. The term F mu viF mu vi includes one variable, A(i), similar to Yang-Mills gauge theory.

48,"The dominant molecular orbitals (MO) making roles in electronic transitions responsible for optical processes in an OLED molecule are investigated. Whole molecule transition during absorption of stimulus light in such devices are commonly described first-principally as a summation of electronic transitions between several MOs. Time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can determine the percent of each electronic transition contributing into a specific molecular transition between ground and excited states. This scheme, however, ignores electronic correlation during the transitions, which of crucial importance for correcting the difference energies between MO levels. This electron-hole interaction energy can be recovered considering every peak of absorption spectrum of the molecule to one single electronic transition between two specific MOs. The corresponding single-excited molecular orbitals (SEMO) are employed to calculate the intensities of absorption peaks of a well-known OLED molecule Alq(3). First, TDDFT is used to simulate the molecule and to obtain its MOs and it is shown that TDDFT is capable to track the dominant electronic transitions and their specific MOs responsible for the optical process, and so, it provides a reliable basis for calculations of SEMO. The SEMO is then applied on MOs contributing dominantly in each absorption peak of the molecule. The calculations, performed within this scheme, move the computational curve excellently closer to experimental measurement of the absorption peaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

50,"In many practical situations, the recovery of information about some phenomenon of interest f reduces to performing deconvolution on indirect measurements g = p * f, corresponding to the convolution of f with a known kernel (point spread function) p. However, in practice, only discrete measurements of g will be available. Consequently, the construction of discrete approximations to f reduces to deriving discrete versions of g = p * f. How this is done depends crucially on what is assumed about the properties of the kernel p. Here, it is assumed that p is symmetric and integrable, and that the Fourier transform *p of p is strictly positive. Different discrete versions are obtained depending on how the discretisation of g = p * f is performed. After establishing convergence of the truncated schemes, we discuss the underlying difficulties reflecting their ill-posedness and detail how approximations have to be treated with due care.

52,"A class of network models with symmetry group G that evolve as a Lie-Poisson system is derived from the framework of geometric mechanics, which generalises the classical Heisenberg model studied in statistical mechanics. We considered two ways of coupling the spins: one via the momentum and the other via the position and studied in details the equilibrium solutions and their corresponding nonlinear stability properties using the energy-Casimir method. We then took the example G = SO(3) and saw that the momentum-coupled system reduces to the classical Heisenberg model with massive spins and the position-coupled case reduces to a new system that has a broken symmetry group SO(3)/SO(2) similar to the heavy top. In the latter system, we numerically observed an interesting synchronisation-like phenomenon for a certain class of initial conditions. Adding a type of noise and dissipation that preserves the coadjoint orbit of the network model, we found that the invariant measure is given by the Gibbs measure, from which the notion of temperature is defined. We then observed a surprising `triple-humped' phase transition in the heavy top-like lattice model, where the spins switched from one equilibrium position to another before losing magnetisation as we increased the temperature. This work is only a first step towards connecting geometric mechanics with statistical mechanics and several interesting problems are open for further investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the advances in molecular, morphological, and evolutionary studies about several aspects of rattles, there are no studies elucidating these nanoscale topographical features using high-resolution techniques. Here we propose a set of approaches to show these micro/nano surface features searching for patterns or hidden signatures. The results showed that the older rattle ring (segment 8) presented higher roughness values when compared to other segments. Cluster analysis allowed the observation of similarities/differences among some groups, which reinforced the strong discrepancy of the segment 8 when compared to the others and enable possible topographical transitions among each segment features, considering their linkages and Euclidean distances. Attractive forces and surface hardness were also significant increased on segment 8, while adhesion was significantly decreased on the segments 5, 6, and 7 compared to segment 1 (P < 0.05). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed typical profiles of keratin spectra considering the amino acids present in this protein structure.

56,"Gypsum is one of the karstic rocks with many positive and negative characteristics. The most important defect of these rocks is solubility against water flow. The dissolution phenomenon in gypsum is accompanied by the release of the sulfate ion in water increasing its concentration, gradually. In this research, the effect of water flow temperature (T), Reynolds number (Re) and water head (H) on gypsum dissolution rate was evaluated, experimentally. In all of the experiments, gypsum samples were prepared approximately in the same dimensions and a circular hole was created inside the sample. Results showed that by increasing the temperature above T/Ta = 1.30 (Ta = temperature of the ambient air), the dissolution rate of gypsum was significantly increased.

63,"The multipolar representation of the magnetic field has, for the lowest-order term, a magnetic dipole that dominates the far field. Thus the far-field representation of the magnetic field of the Earth, Sun and other celestial bodies is a dipole. Since these bodies consist of or are surrounded by plasma, which can support Alfven waves, their propagation along dipole magnetic field lines is considered using a new coordinate system: dipolar coordinates. The present paper introduces multipolar coordinates, which are an example of conformal coordinates; conformal coordinates are orthogonal with equal scale factors, and can be extended from the plane to space, for instance as cylindrical or spherical dipolar coordinates. The application considered is to Alfven waves propagating along a circle, that is a magnetic field line of a dipole, with transverse velocity and magnetic field perturbations; the various forms of the wave equation are linear second-order differential equations, with variable coefficients, specified by a background magnetic field, which is force free. The absence of a background magnetic force leads to a mean state of hydrostatic equilibrium, specified by the balance of gravity against the pressure gradient, for a perfect gas or incompressible liquid. The wave equation is simplified to a Gaussian hypergeometric type in the case of zero frequency, otherwise, for non-zero frequency, an extended Gaussian hypergeometric equation is obtained. The solution of the latter specifies the magnetic field perturbation spectrum, and also, via a polarisation relation, the velocity perturbation spectrum; both are plotted, over half a circle, for three values of the dimensionless frequency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"The phonon properties of BiFeO3 have been studied by using the specific heat. It is found that the specific heat of BiFeO3 exhibits two peaks. The first peak appears at the magnetic phase transition temperature T-N = 650 K. This anomaly in specific heat can be interpreted as antiferromagnetic transition. The values of the specific heat (at the magnetic phase transition temperature T-N) increase with the increasing of the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g. Another abnormal peak of specific heat appears at nearly 550 K, which is associated with the onset of structural changes. Note that the second peak shifts to lower temperature as the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g decrease. It is considered that the main reason of leading to the structure distortion increases is due to the increase of the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g. Those calculation conclusions are in accordance with the experimental results of other researchers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"The filter diagonalization method (FDM) was implemented and used instead of fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra from the free induction decay (FID) signals. The areas obtained by the FDM, from selected absorption lines, were used as input for a multidimensional method of data analysis. This procedure was applied in a NMR-based metabolomics investigation. In FDM, instead of spectra, the absorption peaks' specification, such as central frequency, line width, amplitude and relative phases, are estimated and the spectra are built using this information. Therefore, one can select the lines by width and intensity to exclude the broad lines such as baseline, solvent line and albumin peak. Also lines with small amplitude such as noise can be excluded from the spectra. Moreover, the spectra do not suffer from aliasing or baseline problems. These characteristics are fundamental in the metabolomics investigations. To show the superiority of our method over the standard FFT to obtain the spectra, we reconstructed the spectra from simulated FID by both methods. As an example, this new approach is used to analyze the non-small cell lung cancer A549 exposed to different treatments and principal component analysis is used to compare the performance of both methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

69,"Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) technology can monitor the multi-phase flow in closed pipes or vessels. The monitoring technology has the advantages of anti-intrusion, low manufacturing cost, high-temperature resistance, and simple structure. At present, ECT systems use small-scale sensors for signal capture, but such sensors have problems such as low sensitivity and poor anti-interference, which have attracted the attention of researchers. In this study, a light-trigger sensor was proposed, which was equipped with a special light window to receive optical signals. At the same time, in terms of the problem of electromagnetic shielding and optical window protection, a light window structure that transmitted optical signals and shields electromagnetic waves was designed. Based on the light-trigger sensor, the other modules of the ECT system were designed, considering that the sensor would be interfered by the measurement of stray capacitance, the intra-isoelectric driver cable shielding technology, the double T-type simulation switch matrix, and the digital-mode demodulation technology was introduced. Consequently, the performance of the sensor was tested. During the experiment, the sucrose flow pattern was used as the test object. The results showed that compared with the traditional sensors, the image distortion of the sensor based on the ECT system was lower; while in the performance test of the ECT system, the introduction of the double T-type simulation switch matrix, the digital-analogy demodulation technology, and the bipolar plate excitation mode could further optimize the signal-to-noise ratio index of the image; in the sensitivity test of the ECT system, the introduction of bipolar plate excitation mode could improve the output sensitivity of the capacitance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was demonstrated that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the modified electrode (Mb-MPA-AuNPs/Au) was 7862 ft, the exchange current density (i0) was 32.7 pA/cm(2). And a pair of reversible and symmetrical redox peaks appeared after the coordination of Cu2+, and the electrical signal response of Cue /Mb-AuNPs-MPA/Au reached the highest. The superoxide anion generated in the basic DMSO system was determined by CV using the modified electrode Cu2+ Mb-AuNPs-MPA/Au. It was discovered that the superoxide anion had a strong disproportionation effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"Cardiovascular disease is an important problem in developed countries and the effective target of treatment should be further developed. ETB receptor is one of receptor of ET system, which may affect the function of vascular smooth muscle cell via NO released. In order to clarify the theory, we had cell culture with or without ET-1 treatment. Flow cytometry had been used to prove cell apoptosis and transwell assay had been used to detect the ability of cell migration. The expression of ET-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MMP-9 and CRP were detected by using qRT-PCR and Western blot assay. After we had found that RES-701-1 one of ETB receptor antagonists can induced VSMC apoptosis and migration. Also RES-701-1 can down regulated ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MMP-9 and CRP while ET-1 was the opposite. In a conclusion ETB receptor is one of the role target to mediate vascular smooth muscle cell through the ET system and it may be a significant treating target in cardiovascular disease in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"The output displacement of the traditional symmetrical microgripper is large, but its micro-components or parts are easily damaged due to the uneven force exerted on the left and right jaws of the gripper. The output force of the traditional asymmetric microgripper is stable. However, its output displacement is small, typically half the output displacement of the symmetric microgripper. To solve these problems, in this study, we designed a large-displacement asymmetric microgripper. First, we calculated the relationship between the theoretical input and output variables based on their geometric relationship. Then, we analyzed the performance of the microgripper using finite element software. Lastly, we used a piezoelectric actuator as the input driver of the microgripper. The errors associated with the theoretical and simulated output displacements were 7.05% and 924%, respectively. At 150 V of driving voltage, the maximum output displacement was 224 pm, and the actual magnification was 11.2 times. Microparts can be gripped in parallel and stably, which confirms the validity of the design. Copyright (C) 2019 Tianjin University.

73,"Energy spectra of the 3d(4), 3d(3)4s, 3d(3)4p, and 3d(3)4d configurations of W LIII are calculated using the ab initio multi-configuration Dirac-Fock method. The correlations within the n = 9 complex, n being the principal quantum number of the outermost electron are accounted for in a systematic way and the Breit interaction and quantum electrodynamics effect are evaluated. Wavelengths, oscillator strengths, electric dipole, electric quadrupole, magnetic dipole, and magnetic quadrupole emission transition rates regarding these levels are obtained. The Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) calculations are further performed to support these data. Results are compared with other available theory reported in the literature as well as the recommended experimental data listed in the Atomic Spectra Database (ASD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) online database. Satisfactory agreement is found between them. In light of these findings, the present complete and consistent results can aid line identifications in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra and should be beneficial in fusion plasma research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,"In this study, In(OH)(3) nanocrystals with three morphologies including rods, cubes and spheres were synthesized through a hydrothermal method. The morphology and crystalline were manipulated by controlling the growth speed and the addition of ascorbic acid. The InVO4 nanocrystals were obtained by a process sacrificing In(OH)(3) templates. The phase transformation of rods and cubes generated size-controllable products, whereas that of nanospheres formed hollow micro-spheres. InVO4 nanocrystals display a brilliant yellow emission band with the peak at 517 nm. Intriguingly, luminescent rare-earth Eu ions with red emission could be doped into InVO4 nanocrystals during the phase transformation.

It admits a super action of the super Lie group OSP(1 vertical bar 2, R). This action induces a one parameter action of OSP(1 vertical bar 2, R) on the super-ring, R of C-infinity-superfunctions on C-1 vertical bar 1. A supermodular form is a superfunction F is an element of R invariant by the action of OSP(1 vertical bar 2, R) on the super-ring R (see Cohen et al., 1997).

76,"Pondering Enrique Loedel's 1948 symmetrical spacetime chart whose angle's sine reflects scaled velocity between inertial reference frames, led in 2004 to a most curious discovery: Angles of a unit sines law ratio spherical triangle geometricise relativistic velocity composition. Overlooked in a paper by Einstein's colleague Sommerfeld and kept under wraps until publication of a recent book, the germane criterion points to a seemingly unknown hemispherical liemix' spiral which encapsulates the Gudermannian relating a fixed thrust rocket's velocity and clocked own-time. This opens new avenues for analysing relativistic noninertial length contexts whereby hemix-generated real-metric lambda vertical bar tau 'own-szrfaces' visualisable in are corroborated by radar path attributes, oddly a strategy unexploited in relativity. The Euclidean models epitomise not only Born's (one off) 'rigid motion' but also non-Minkowski extended medium acceleration scenarios such as the previously unresolved Bell's spaceships problem where the +/- [+++-] signature is misplaced, increment 'own-lines' and radar paths turn out to be nongeodesics, and Gauss curvature remains the same along each shared own-time likewise nongeodesic 'medium curve'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"Magnetic resonance is a quantum phenomenon and describes a resonant interaction of spins with electromagnetic fields. Its understanding requires advanced knowledge of quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics and thus often remains elusive to students. However, the great impact of this phenomenon on medicine, science, and technology makes magnetic resonance an important subject for general education, and it requires a graspable model for translating the physical concepts without resorting to advanced physics. One of the most common and familiar objects related to magnetism is the compass. Here, we develop an inexpensive tabletop demonstration experiment for magnetic resonance. The compass is placed into the magnetic field of a permanent magnet (strong refrigerator magnet); an alternating field of an electromagnetic coil (solenoid) excites a resonant oscillation of the compass needle. The experiment has been proven to catch the attention of audiences of all ages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"We theoretically investigate light propagation in two coupled nonlinear waveguides with a certain static propagation constant detuning between two waveguides and with the linear refractive index modulated along the propagation direction. By slowly varying the amplitude of modulation, we steer the light to the desired output waveguide when equal amounts of lights are launched into each waveguide. We reveal that depending on the sign of the static propagation constant mismatch (detuning) between two waveguides, the launched light can be completely switched to either of waveguides. Additionally, we numerically examine the performances of light switching for general inputs and modulation amplitudes, and show that the localization of output light is robust against small to moderate variations in the final modulation amplitude, phase difference and intensity distribution of input field between two waveguides. More importantly, according to the principle of the proposed scheme, we are capable of steering the output light to the targeted waveguide at extremely low input power. In theory, our findings can be explained qualitatively by means of adiabatic navigation of the so-called nonlinear Floquet states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,"Quantum key distribution (QKD) involving polarized photons could be vulnerable to a jamming (or denial-of-service) attack, in which a third party applies an external magnetic field to rotate the plane of polarization of photons headed toward one of the two intended recipients. Sufficiently large Faraday rotation of one of the polarized beams would prevent Alice and Bob from establishing a secure quantum channel. We investigate requirements to induce such rotation both for free-space transmission and for transmission via optical fiber, and find reasonable ranges of parameters in which a jamming attack could be successful against fiber-based QKD, even for systems that implement automated recalibration for polarization-frame alignment. The jamming attack could be applied selectively and indefinitely by an adversary without revealing her presence, and could be further combined with various eavesdropping attacks to yield unauthorized information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present an authentic research project for introductory physics students that focuses on kinematics that can be done outside a formal laboratory space. This experiment can be done in a high school or a university setting. Because it is not confined to a formal laboratory space, students can perform the experiment outside of a formal time period dedicated for labs, and over the course of a semester. This activity was developed as a part of an integrated science and mathematics program where students used their knowledge in kinematics to observe the psychology of animal behavior.

81,"On the basis of the transport features and experimental phenomena observed in studies of molecular motors, we investigated an overdamped Brownian motion of two coupled particles with an asymmetric periodic potential in a two-dimensional microchannel theoretically and numerically, to reveal the dynamical mechanism of cooperative transport of particles with two heads, where the interactions between two particles are taken into consideration. Moreover, while moving in a confined structure, Brownian particles also could exhibit peculiar kinetic behavior. The dependence of directed current on various parameters is systematically studied. Our results indicate that the direction of motion can be reversed by modulating the coupling strength, free length, and microchannel width. In addition, we have achieved the conditions of forward motion in this study. That is, when the interparticle average horizontal interval Delta x > 0.25L, where L is the spatial period of the external potential, the forward motion of coupled Brownian particles effected by the synchronized noise and confined to a microchannel can be generated in the strong-coupling case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"Structural features, electronic structures, and optical properties of superatomic compounds [Co6Se8(PMe3)(6)] [C-60] with rock-salt, cesium chloride, and zinc-blende structures were investigated from first principles. Partial electronic density of states, highest occupied molecular orbital, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital were given and used to discuss the detailed electronic structures. Dielectric function, refractive index, reflectivity, absorption coefficient, and energy loss functions under several pressures were calculated and used to investigate the optical properties. We found that Co6Se8(PMe3)(6) transfers electrons and C-60 receives electrons, making contributions to electron communications between the positive and negative counterparts on the basis of electrostatic interactions. The superatomic structures are made from assemblies of charge-rich and charge-poor molecular precursors. In the solid state, charge is transferred between the components, with a net reduction of C-60 by less than one electron (0.75 electron approximately).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the main result, we find only regular motions for the geodesics in all cases, which suggest the existence of the so-called Carter's constant in this kind of exact solutions. Moreover, our simulations indicate that in the two-particle Chazy-Curzon solution, some oscillatory motions take place as in the classical MacMillan problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"Mid-infrared (MIR) optical frequency combs (OFCs) are ideal light sources for precision metrology and can find extensive applications, especially in molecular spectroscopy and gas detection. Here the generation of mode-locked MIR frequency comb in a LiNbO3 microring through optimized slot-waveguide design is proposed. Such microcomb can span over four-fifths of an octave (ranging from similar to 2810 nm to similar to 4630 nm) with pump power as low as 50 mW, which can be applied to the 2f-3f self-referencing for fully stabilization and helpful to monolithic integration of the whole system. Further investigations on complex dynamical processes for the microcomb generation suggest that the intracavity soliton drifting caused by the third-order dispersion could be compensated by the self-steepening effect as introducing an additional drift through proper dispersion tailoring. This work could facilitate the low-threshold broadband MIR frequency comb generation technique, as well as provide a way to realize more delicate control of soliton microcombs in both temporal and spectral domain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,A prime number based parametrization for total neutrino-nucleon cross section is presented. The method employs the relation between prime numbers and their indices to reproduce neutrino cross sections for neutrino energies from the MeV to the PeV regions where experimental data are available. This prime-index relation provides estimates of the neutrino-nucleon cross sections valid across many decades of neutrino energy scales. The PeV data are from the recently published astrophysical nu(mu) + (nu) over bar (mu) rates in the IceCube detector as well as neutrino-nucleon cross section measurements. A similar method has been employed for high energy pp cross sections which explains the (ln s)(2) parametrization first proposed by Heisenberg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,"In this paper, liquid state solvent-free organosilica-based nickel-bithiazole complexes (PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+) were synthesized through sol gel processes respectively, and these two metal complexes and their precursors were characterized. The precursors with bithiazole were successfully prepared, their inorganic and organic parts were connected on molecular level. The DSC results indicated they would all exist in liquid phase at temperature ranging from 180 K to 280 K. The UV-VIS showed that a red shift of the main electronic transitions from 254 to 268 nm of PBSIBTHM to PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 14 (from 249 to 266 nm of PBSIBTMeM to PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 17). This verified the formation of a more extensive pi -> pi* conjugating system due to coordination interaction between Ni2+ and PBSIBTHM or PBSIBTMeM. The magnetic measurement results of PBSIBTHM-Ni2+ and PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+ reflected they both exhibited ferromagnetic properties at low temperature. For PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+, it had a transition temperature (T-tran) at 160 K, and became an anti-ferromagnet above T-tran. For PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, it had a very high Curie-Weiss temperature (T-c = 253 K).

88,"SrTiO3 nanopowders doped with various percentages of Fe (0, 1, 3, and 5 mol%) was synthesized, determining its chemical and structural properties using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of the samples were studied using hysteresis curves obtained by an alternating gradient magnetometer. Theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory are also performed to support experimental data. The results indicated that Fe incorporated into de SrTiO3 structure induced intrinsic magnetic properties, which increase as the Fe percentage increase. At 5 mol% of Fe in the sample showed a single-domain state, typical of a ferromagnetic material capable for information storage. This latter result would be due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies as more Fe was added and to the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions reinforced the magnetic behaviour of the compound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

91,"The mathematical transformations used in a previous paper by the author enable one to recast the Kerr-Newman metric for the gravitational field of a charged and rotating mass in two new forms which satisfy physically judicious requirements necessary for a relevant system of reference to be realizable with the aid of real bodies throughout all space as distinct from the initial Kerr-Newman metric. The new metrics are physically admissible for any angular momentum of the rotating central mass provided the charge of the mass is not too large. Properties of the metrics are studied. One of the metric is preferable from the physical point of view because all coefficients in the metric are non-singular except for the points where the rotating disk creating the gravitational field is located. The results of the present paper show that there are no black holes around rotating masses, be they charged or noncharged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"In this paper, a simulation study on tailoring the fields in planar ion trap geometries for making them suitable for mass analysis is presented. Two different planar trap geometries were considered: the first is a One-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry in which the ions are trapped off-plane and the second is a Two-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry in which the ions are trapped in between the two sheets. Both DC and RF potentials were used to trap ions. The fields were tailored to obtain linear trapping fields in these two geometries. This was done by splitting the central electrode into segments and applying suitable DC potentials to them. The potentials were computed using a least square method. The simulations were carried out considering a printed circuit board (PCB) with a Teflon base. The One-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry consists of five electrodes, of which the central electrode is segmented. In Two-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry, each sheet consists of three electrodes, of which the central electrode is segmented. The method outlined in the study is able to tailor fields to be linear as well as mildly superlinear. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"In this article, we report for the first time that the well-established diffusion noise can be apparently increased in large proportions and that such a situation can be very common at some specific frequencies in the p-n junction structures operating at a very low direct bias current. Noise theories and the associated measurement techniques are a major issue for the emerging semiconductor technologies, the development of accurate computer-aided design (CAD) models, and the designing of low-noise circuits and systems. The conventional shot noise model usually satisfactorily describes the p-n junction noise in solid-state devices, such as diodes and transistors. It has proven to be very efficient for many different conventional and advanced semiconductor technologies. However, alterations may sometimes be needed as previous works indicate scenarios where this so-called shot noise exhibits deviations from the theory, which translates into some noise suppression. In this article, we report on alterations that look like low-frequency diffusion noise enhancement (unexpected noise increase). It occurs at low current levels, for many generic commercially available diodes and the p-n junctions in transistors. Therefore, we propose an appropriate electrical noise model that satisfies both the low-frequency noise experimental data and the electrical behavior of the devices observed from impedance spectroscopy. We also evaluate this model as the ambient temperature is varied. Finally, it is discussed how this model can be connected to the conventional van der Ziel shot noise model and a better insight on the possible origin of such diffusion noise enhancement is provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

95,"Notions of noncommutative complex and Kahler structure have been introduced by Frohlich et al. (1999), in the context of supersymmetric quantum theory. Here we show that whenever a C*-dynamical system (A, G, alpha, tau) equipped with a faithful G-invariant trace tau, where G is an even dimensional abelian Lie group, determines a spectral triple, the smooth dense subalgebra A(infinity) inherits a noncommutative Kahler structure. In particular, whenever T-2n acts ergodically on the algebra, it inherits a noncommutative Kahler structure. This produces a class of examples of noncommutative Kahler manifolds. As a corollary, we obtain that all the noncommutative even dimensional tori are noncommutative Kahler manifolds. We explicitly compute the space of complex differential forms and study holomorphic vector bundles on all noncommutative even dimensional tori. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

96,"In this paper, we demonstrate the formation of Schottky contact formed by Al with a new class of synthesized conjugated pure poly(Schiff base) (PSB) and its blend with varied concentrations of polyaniline (PANI). The Schottky behavior was transformed into Ohmic in the blended polymer. PSB was synthesized from the solution of polycondensation of terephthaloyl chloride (T) and 4-(4-hydroxybenzylideneamino)phenol (SB). The polymer showed good thermal stability with T-g of 312 degrees C as determined by thermal gravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry TGA-DSC and high molecular weight 3.5 x 10(5) (g/mol) with coiled conformation as determined by laser light scattering. PBS was blended with various weight percentage ratios of PANI (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 percent by weight of the pristine polymer). The metal contact (Au) was formed and studied in the temperature range of 293-373 K, which showed that Schottky behavior in the intrinsic polymer with an ideality factor was close to 2 and then reduced to 1.0-1.2 in the blended polymers. In blended polymers, the conduction across the junction was characterized by Schottky emission at low field and Poole-Frenkel emission at high field. The Schottky barrier height showed a small increase with temperature, which was attributed to reduction in the built up of image charge. The Schottky and Poole-Frenkel emission coefficients were also determined and Schottky emission coefficient agreed with the theoretical value, while Poole-Frenkel emission coefficient was small. In short, the metal-semiconductor junction was affected by the blending, while conduction within the polymer remained independent of PANI concentration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"As a new state of matter, the quantum liquid droplets formed in ultra-cold potassium (K-39) atomic gases have been studied experimentally by Cabrera et al. (2018) and Semeghini et al. (2018). In this paper, we combined the experimental findings with the theory of mean-field, and obtained the potential function of inter-atomic interaction and the function of forces on atoms. The relation between the radial size of liquid droplet (sigma(r)) and magnetic field (B) is established based on the previous functions. From the viewpoint of energy balance, the condition under which the liquid droplets can stably exist and the dependence of the critical atom number (N-C) on B are discussed. A semi-theoretical relation between N-C and B is derived and verified to be valid by comparing the experimental values with the calculated ones. The energy balance (the potential energy of system equaling the kinetic energy of the system) can be considered as a condition under which the liquid droplets exist stably. Our results are helpful to further understanding of the quantum liquid droplets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of Ti in Bi2O2 layer spacer or superconducting BiS2 layers was investigated. For this study, the polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 superconductor was prepared following a two-step solid-state reaction. Grains consisted of lamellae, similar to 5-10 mu m in the planar orientation and 100-500 nm thick, presenting a tetragonal crystalline structure, with space group I4/mmm. For the first time, Raman spectroscopy revealed three modes at room temperature, with no significant changes in the spectra with Ti doping. The superconductivity was observed by the Meissner effect from ZFC and FC magnetization measurements. For both samples, the critical temperature was around 3.5 K, showing that Ti doping did not change the T-C value, probably due to fact that Ti is in the Bi2O2 layer spacer. Also, the doped sample presented a strong positive magnetic moment, probably due to the presence of ferromagnetic order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"The effects of the electron temperature on the dominant color in colloidal nano sphere solutions are analytically studied. This system contains ions (as radiators) close to the hot nano plasma spheres (HNPSs). Considering two separate models of the point radiated ions and applying the fluid dynamic equations and suitable Green's function, the optical resonance of HNPSs is declared. The thermal effects in HNPSs show that a series of optical resonances occur in the system and the dominant resonance frequencies depend on the plasma geometry, electron density, electron temperature. The resonance frequencies in the two different models are exactly identical. Also, a new type of resonance frequency (subsidiary resonance frequencies), resulting in the thermal effects, is seen by considering two radiators beside the HNPS and, in this case, due to the sign of the ion radiators with same strengths, the even or odd modes are excited, separately. In other words, the permissible resonance frequencies in colloidal nano sphere solutions are categorized into two principal types: dominant resonance frequencies and subsidiary resonance frequencies. In addition, the graphs of the scattering patterns and resonance frequencies of this problem are analyzed. All of the resonance frequencies are varied with the temperature so that decreasing the Debye length (temperature) of HNPSs decreases the resonant frequencies and changes the dominant color of the system. Moreover, the dominant color of the system depends on the number of spheres in a colloidal solution including many bodies of nano-spheres with different radii.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
