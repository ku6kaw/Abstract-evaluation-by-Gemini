We propose a way to interpolate higher Bessel equations, their wedge powers, and monodromies thereof to non-integer orders, and link the result with the dimensional interpolation of the RRH formalism in the spirit of the gamma conjectures.

J,"Gong, QX; Guo, XQ; Willis, MAC; Zhang, SJ; Borowiec, J; Kreouzis, T",Heuristic description of separate charge transport pathways determined by Time of Flight: Multiple hole transit times in the ubiquitous poly(3-hexylthiophene),"Poly(3-hexylthiophene), (P3HT), is widely used in organic semiconductor applications. Time of Flight measurements on P3HT displayed three distinct hole transport pathways with corresponding mobilities above 10(-4), between 10(-5) and 10(-4) and below 10(-5) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) over a range of sample thickness (1.1 mu m-4.2 mu m), and electric field (2.4 MVm(-1) to 37.7 MVm(-1)). The space-charge limited current (Mott-Gurney) device mobility was in agreement with that obtained for the fastest route (10(-4) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)). The transport pathways were distinguished using a dispersive transport plot of reciprocal transit time versus electric field to thickness ratio and are described by single (pseudo dispersion) parameters: alpha(t1) = 0.97, alpha(t2) = 0.73 and alpha(t3) = 0.62. The P3HT displayed 3 M mass peaks obtained by Gel Permeation Chromatography, which are the most likely cause of the three pathways. The dispersive transport analysis used here offers clearer distinction between pathways than Poole-Frenkel plots and offers a full mobility description, including the dependence on sample thickness, making it suitable for general application.",10.1016/j.orgel.2019.06.038,1,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no

SLAC pulses are theoretically derived, then applied to the design of enhanced BIR-4 and hyperbolic secant pulses to demonstrate practical utility of the new pulses. At 7T, SLAC pulses are shown to improve the flip angle homogeneity compared to a standard adiabatic pulse with validation in both simulations and phantom experiments, under SAR equivalent experimental conditions.

However, it is presently not clear how the type of doped-O species affects the capacitive performance. In this paper, an attempt has been made to probe into the possible correlation between the type of doped-O species and the corresponding capacitive performance. Three O species (C=O, C-O and O-C=O) have been introduced onto TiC-derived carbon (TiC-CDC) by using a facile room-temperature oxidation strategy with three typical oxidizing agents (H2O2, HNO3 and (NH4)(2)S2O8), respectively. The results have shown that as the content of the C=O species increases, both the specific capacitance and the capacitance retention for the oxidized TiC-CDC samples become higher, showing a positively correlative performance. This work suggests that optimizing the type of doped-O species will be great potential for obtaining the optimal electrochemical performances for the O-doped carbon materials.",10.1142/S179329201950142X,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is based on exact analytical solutions of piece-wise linear potentials with an arbitrary number of segments that describe any given potential up to the desired precision.

We found that a Schottky emission leakage mechanism dominates the low bias conditions and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling became the main leakage mechanism at high fields with reverse biased condition. The sample with HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm) laminated dielectric shows a high barrier height phi(B) of 1.66 eV at 30 degrees C which was extracted from the Schottky emission mechanism, and this can be explained by fewer In-O and As-O states on the interface, as detected by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test. These effects result in HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm)/n-InAlAs MOS-capacitors presenting a low leakage current density of below 1.8 x 10(-7) A/cm(2) from -3 to 0 V at 30 degrees C.

Results showed that Cu, Cu2O, CuO, and SiO2 (Cu-SiO2) composite particles were plated on the surface of KH550-modified PA12 powders. The Cu-SiO2 particles existed independently on PA12 surface, and the size was around 200 nm. The melting temperature and crystallization temperature of Cu-SiO2/PA12 composite powders were 183 degrees C and 150 degrees C. The results indicate that the selective laser sintering (SLS) process involved the contact of Cu-SiO2/PA12 powders, the formation of sintering neck, the growth of sintering neck, and the formation of fused solid. The Cu-SiO2 composite particles uniformly dispersed in the part due to surface tension, and the contact interface was good due to their similar polarity.

Most of digital circuits are composed of different components which determine the performance of the entire digital circuits. With the improvement of these components, the digital circuits can be optimized. One of these components is full adder for which various structures have been proposed to improve its performance, among them the two novel full adder structures are based on Gate-Diffusion Input (GDI) structure and half-classical XOR/XNOR logic (SEMI XOR/XNOR) modules.

The vacua are provided by three dimensional conformally flat manifold, which admit a special configuration, a two dimensional system (M-2, h, Phi) consisting of metric h and scalar field Phi, by dimensional reduction. For this system we define the quasi-local mass. An interesting observation is that this system contains certain two dimensional dilaton gravity at the classical level. Via AdS/CFT, we check the Weyl anomaly and diffeomorphism anomaly for the boundary theory. We study the linearization of Chern-Simons-like gravity around the background with constant scalar curvature via linear Cotton tensor. If the background manifold is of positive constant scalar curvature, we show that there is no solutions for linearized vacuum equation. To find the solutions of the linear gravity with respect to the background with negative constant scalar curvature, we need to solve some Schrodinger-type equations. Related to supersymmetric quantum mechanics, one can find some exact solutions and some dualities between different components or modes of solutions. And it is also can be related to Seiberg-Witten theory via Picard-Fuchs equation in terms of WKB approximation. We discuss the ADM-type charge under the context of Chern-Simons-like gravity.

The atom is considered as a ? system. One transition of the atom chirally couples to the waveguide. The other transition is driven by two coherent driving fields. The transmission probabilities for the single photon incidents from the left (T-lr) and right (T-rl) are given respectively. The calculated results show that one can realize T-lr = 0 (T-rl ? 0) or T-rl = 0 (T-lr ? 0) by manipulating the phase difference between the two coherent driving fields. The influence of the decay rate of the metastable state on the asymmetric transmission is also discussed.,10.1088/0253-6102/71/11/1304,25,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,

J,"Inam, O; Qureshi, M; Omer, H",De-noising Multi-coil Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Patch-Based Adaptive Filtering in Wavelet Domain,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently requires transform domain de-noising methods to preserve important features in the reconstructed images such as corners, sharp structures, and edges. Wavelet transform-based image de-noising is a standard approach used in MRI to recover smooth surface and sharp edges from the given noisy MR images, thereby improving diagnostic interpretations. Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) techniques such as SENSE have been recently developed with an aim to improve the data acquisition speed, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and spatial resolution of the reconstructed images. However, the SENSE reconstruction algorithm often encounters noise during data acquisition and reconstruction process which not only contaminates the quality of the reconstructed images but also leads to poor diagnostic interpretations in clinical settings. During SENSE reconstruction process, noise can appear in the reconstructed image mainly due to two reasons (1) imperfections in the receiver coils; (2) un-folding the aliased images of multiple receiver coils to obtain a single composite image. In this paper, a new adaptive patch-based filtering in wavelet domain is presented to recover sharp structures and edges without introducing any artifacts in the SENSE reconstructed images. The proposed method uses soft-thresholding function as a shrinkage process which typically involves thresholding the small wavelet coefficients to reduce the noise without affecting the important features in the SENSE reconstructed images. For the evaluation of the proposed method, several experiments are performed using simulated phantom and in vivo data sets. The SENSE reconstruction quality using the proposed method is compared with contemporary de-nosing techniques, in terms of structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the SENSE reconstruction using the proposed method when compared to the other contemporary de-nosing methods successfully removes the noise and preserves the fine details in the reconstructed MR images without introducing blurring artifacts.",10.1007/s00723-019-01153-5,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Construction of ITER is indeed progressing at full speed, with some ITER components having already been manufactured, such as the toroidal field coil structures and the gyrotrons of the electron cyclotron heating and current drive system, as a result of decades of technological development. Construction of JT-60SA and WEST is also progressing on schedule to support ITER in various engineering and physics aspects. The EU and Japan are advancing with their pre-conceptual designs for DEMO, and the experience and lessons learned from ITER are already being applied to both designs. China reported on the status of the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor engineering design. One of the technical issues evident from these DEMO designs is the interfacing of the plasma-facing, in-vessel components with plasmas. Advanced plasma-facing elements having liquid metals and an advanced in situ boron coating technology were applied to existing fusion reactors, the results of which were reported at this conference. It was also reported that commissioning of the injector for the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility engineering validation and engineering design activities (IFMIF/EVEDA) project has been completed and testing of the Radio Frequency Quadrupole accelerator has begun. Europe and Japan presented their plans to construct neutron irradiation test facilities: the DEMO-Oriented Neutron Source (DONES) and Advanced Fusion Neutron Source (A-FNS), respectively.

The control of the electrode thickness could be useful to manipulate the energy confinement and the band dispersion of the surface guided mode. It has been demonstrated recently that high aspect ratio (HAR) electrode could produce a dispersive shear horizontal and vertically polarized surface modes in the bulk piezoelectric substrate. In this theoretical study, we propose to employ a high aspect ratio electrode on top of the GaN/sapphire-layered substrate enabling the presence of Sezawa surface mode. Based from the dispersion band, we obtained a higher frequency of surface guided mode in the non-radiative zone in the GaN/sapphire heterostructure configuration compared to the bulk GaN substrate. Indeed, these guided modes are induced by the hybridization between Sezawa surface mode and the mechanical resonance of the HAR electrode producing nearly a flat band at the limit of First Brillouin Zone. Furthermore, the displacement of each guided modes indicates the confinement of energy mostly in the electrode with a slight amount of energy in the top layer of the substrate. We demonstrated also the frequency tuning of guided mode using diverse materials for the electrode but also the thickness of GaN layer.

Here, we study the thermoelectric response of a series of five anhydrous 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium halide ionic liquids with varied chain length and counterion in a high-aspect-ratio, horizontal-temperature-gradient geometry, where convection is minimal. While a canonical, constant-volume thermodynamic model indicates that greater disparity and longer aliphatic groups should exhibit larger Seebeck coefficients, we instead measure the opposite: Longer aliphatic chains correlate with lower densities and greater heat expansion, stronger intermolecular associations, stronger steric repulsion, and lower Seebeck coefficients. As evidence of the critical role of thermal expansion, we measure that the Seebeck effect is nonlinear: Values of -2.8 mV/K with a 10 K temperature difference and -1.8 mV/K with a 50 K difference are measured with ether ion. Our results indicate that steric repulsion and heat expansion are important considerations in ionic liquid design; with large temperature differences, the Seebeck coefficient correlates negatively with heat expansion.

J,"Kim, JM",Restricted Solid-on-Solid Growth Model in <i>d</i>=3+1 with Various Restriction Parameters <i>N</i>,"The surface dynamics of a restricted solid-on-solid growth model is studied using various restriction parameter N in d = 3 + 1. The surface width W(L, t) grows as t(beta) for t MUCH LESS-THAN L-z and becomes saturated via W(L) - L-alpha for t > L-z, where L is the system size. W(L, t) for N = 1 has some oscillating behavior as a function of time t induced by the discrete height of the model, so we choose the proper N to reduce this artifact. Through a large-scale numerical simulation of a system with size L = 512, beta = 0.196 +/- 0.005 and alpha = 0.332 +/- 0.006 are obtained with N = 5.

The total fringing capacitance arising due to induced fringing fields in the device is divided into inner, outer and bottom fringing capacitance.

However, the existing information exchange protocols only focus on either pairwise information exchange or group information exchange, and none of these protocols enable private and public information exchange to occur simultaneously. Thus, a general secure information exchange protocol for a multiuser channel is desirable. With this motivation, this paper investigates simultaneous private and public information exchange in a Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (MIMO) multiuser relay channel. In an aim to achieve this goal, signal alignment is chosen as the core technique. With the designed precoding matrix for each user, private information is aligned with its exchange partner, and public information forms a coding chain at the relay. With the aligned private signal and public coding chain, neither an untrusted relay nor external eavesdroppers can recover the original individual information. Performance analyses of the proposed protocol are conducted. First, we conduct transmission performance analyses from the perspective of time slot cost. Second, we conduct a security analysis for private information exchange and public information exchange. Third, we conduct secrecy sum-rate analysis for three attack scenarios: an untrusted relay attack only, an eavesdropper attack only, and both an untrusted relay and eavesdropper attack. The simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed protocol can enable simultaneous private and public information exchange while resisting attacks by an undesired receiver, an untrusted relay, and external eavesdroppers.",10.3390/e21111054,75,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

The resulting velocity field complements the one that is known to generate Prandtl?s induced drag in three dimensions. We demonstrate how fluid particles in a velocity field are attracted towards an object, and that this, due to conservation of momentum, results not only in lift, but also in drag forces. The magnitude of a disturbance velocity can be derived from the circulation of bound and shed vortices accompanying the object and parameters taken from the von K;rm;n vortex street description. Another part of the drag is generated by vortices that emerge behind blunt bodies when fluid particles do not follow the surface of the objects. We obtain a mathematical description of the resistance of several types of blunt bodies and rotating cylinders. The model involves no parameters that are derived from empirical data.

J,"Mollaei, M; Jafarian, SMM",The introduction of the surfing scheme for shock capturing with high-stability and high-speed convergence,"In this paper, a novel shock capturing scheme with high stability and speed of solution is presented. The scheme divides the dependent variables into two parts, i.e. Surf and Surfer, like surfing sport. The Surf part is calculated by applying the concept of Sobolev gradient on the dependent variables. Furthermore, it has the least difference with these variables, along with the lowest discretization error and the same equation. Hence, it is expected that this part can be solved at high stability conditions and large time steps. In addition, the Surfer part is obtained from the difference between the Surf part and the dependent variables. Therefore, only the error-maker operators (for example, a discontinuity like a shock) are in this part and accordingly it has a local nature. Due to this feature, it can be solved with fewer points compared to the Surf part. Therefore, its equation is solved as quickly as Surf equation, despite its limited stability conditions. Finally, the summation of the Surf and Surfer solutions makes the main solution. The scheme has been applied to the inviscid Burgers' equation with an initial value of the step function, and one-dimensional inviscid Euler flow through a nozzle with a shock wave. The stability condition for the Burgers' equation has been increased to a Courant number of 10(10) and the solution time for the Euler flow case has been decreased by one-fifth. Comparison of the results with traditional methods indicates the ultra-high stability and ultra-speed convergence of this scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

For this aim, we approximate Spearman's rho via empirical distribution function of a given data set.

Also, TEM picture shows the electrical network formation in the continuous PA phase and the interface of PA and PE phases. Determination of the density and the weight percentage of elements of this nanocomposite reveal that the obtained values are similar to A-150 and the soft tissue.

In addition, microdosimetric distributions derived from a TEPC with the nanocomposite wall agree well with a TEPC with A-150 wall. Hence, the frequency-mean and dose-mean lineal energies obtained by the two TEPCs are also compatible. A maximum difference 3% is observed between the frequency-mean lineal energies. Also, the dose-mean lineal energies differ up to 10%. Consequently, the dose-equivalent determined by the two above TEPCs is found similar.

The main advantage of this theory is that the study of 2D wavefront propagation can be carried over in a ray coordinate system, which is 1D (in the space variable). This makes the theory (along with the shock ray theory, SRT) more efficient than solving the full Euler system in 2D and is well suited for certain applications. However, the WNLRT and the SRT are developed only in a homogeneous and quiescent medium whereas it is important to update these theories to inhomogeneous and moving media. In this article, we derive the WNLRT system in an inhomogeneous and moving medium filled with polytropic gases. The governing system of this theory involves three balance laws in the ray coordinate system, which is strictly hyperbolic under the condition that the wavefront speed is greater than the ambient sound speed. In order to validate the developed theory, we solve the derived system numerically and show that the effect of medium anisotropy has been captured in terms of the geometry of a propagating wavefront. We also compare our numerical results with linear ray theory to highlight the success in capturing the nonlinear geometric effect of the propagating wavefront. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.
