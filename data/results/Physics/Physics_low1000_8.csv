We propose a way to interpolate higher Bessel equations, their wedge powers, and monodromies thereof to non-integer orders, and link the result with the dimensional interpolation of the RRH formalism in the spirit of the gamma conjectures.

1,"Poly(3-hexylthiophene), (P3HT), is widely used in organic semiconductor applications. Time of Flight measurements on P3HT displayed three distinct hole transport pathways with corresponding mobilities above 10(-4), between 10(-5) and 10(-4) and below 10(-5) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) over a range of sample thickness (1.1 mu m-4.2 mu m), and electric field (2.4 MVm(-1) to 37.7 MVm(-1)). The space-charge limited current (Mott-Gurney) device mobility was in agreement with that obtained for the fastest route (10(-4) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)). The transport pathways were distinguished using a dispersive transport plot of reciprocal transit time versus electric field to thickness ratio and are described by single (pseudo dispersion) parameters: alpha(t1) = 0.97, alpha(t2) = 0.73 and alpha(t3) = 0.62. The P3HT displayed 3 M mass peaks obtained by Gel Permeation Chromatography, which are the most likely cause of the three pathways. The dispersive transport analysis used here offers clearer distinction between pathways than Poole-Frenkel plots and offers a full mobility description, including the dependence on sample thickness, making it suitable for general application.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,happy,happy,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,happy,happy,no,no,yes,yes,no
2,"A new framework for B-1 insensitive adiabatic pulse design is proposed, denoted Spin Lock Adiabatic Correction (SLAC), which counteracts deviations from ideal behaviour through inclusion of an additional correction component during pulse design. SLAC pulses are theoretically derived, then applied to the design of enhanced BIR-4 and hyperbolic secant pulses to demonstrate practical utility of the new pulses. At 7T, SLAC pulses are shown to improve the flip angle homogeneity compared to a standard adiabatic pulse with validation in both simulations and phantom experiments, under SAR equivalent experimental conditions. The SLAC framework can be applied to any arbitrary adiabatic pulse to deliver excitation with increased B-1 insensitivity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

3,"O-doping has proved to be one of the most promising approaches to further enhance the supercapacitive performance of carbon materials. However, it is presently not clear how the type of doped-O species affects the capacitive performance. In this paper, an attempt has been made to probe into the possible correlation between the type of doped-O species and the corresponding capacitive performance. Three O species (C=O, C-O and O-C=O) have been introduced onto TiC-derived carbon (TiC-CDC) by using a facile room-temperature oxidation strategy with three typical oxidizing agents (H2O2, HNO3 and (NH4)(2)S2O8), respectively. The results have shown that as the content of the C=O species increases, both the specific capacitance and the capacitance retention for the oxidized TiC-CDC samples become higher, showing a positively correlative performance. This work suggests that optimizing the type of doped-O species will be great potential for obtaining the optimal electrochemical performances for the O-doped carbon materials.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,
4,"As in boiling super-heated liquid, first-order phase transitions in QFT arise from an abrupt decay of an excited state of false vacuum into an energetically more favorable minimum of energy through bubble nucleation. We review an efficient semi-analytical approach to compute such a tunneling decay rate with any number of scalar fields and space-time dimensions. It is based on exact analytical solutions of piece-wise linear potentials with an arbitrary number of segments that describe any given potential up to the desired precision. Contributions beyond the linear order as well as the generalization to more fields are considered and computed through analytical linear expansions within a few iterations.

5,"Au-Pt-Ti/high-k/n-InAlAs metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors with HfO2-Al2O3 laminated dielectric were fabricated. We found that a Schottky emission leakage mechanism dominates the low bias conditions and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling became the main leakage mechanism at high fields with reverse biased condition. The sample with HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm) laminated dielectric shows a high barrier height phi(B) of 1.66 eV at 30 degrees C which was extracted from the Schottky emission mechanism, and this can be explained by fewer In-O and As-O states on the interface, as detected by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test. These effects result in HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm)/n-InAlAs MOS-capacitors presenting a low leakage current density of below 1.8 x 10(-7) A/cm(2) from -3 to 0 V at 30 degrees C.

6,"In this work, SiO2-encapsulated copper particles/PA12 (Cu-SiO2/PA12) composite powders were prepared by electroless composite plating, and the laser sintering behavior was investigated. Results showed that Cu, Cu2O, CuO, and SiO2 (Cu-SiO2) composite particles were plated on the surface of KH550-modified PA12 powders. The Cu-SiO2 particles existed independently on PA12 surface, and the size was around 200 nm. The melting temperature and crystallization temperature of Cu-SiO2/PA12 composite powders were 183 degrees C and 150 degrees C. The results indicate that the selective laser sintering (SLS) process involved the contact of Cu-SiO2/PA12 powders, the formation of sintering neck, the growth of sintering neck, and the formation of fused solid. The Cu-SiO2 composite particles uniformly dispersed in the part due to surface tension, and the contact interface was good due to their similar polarity. The Cu-SiO2/PA12 SLS parts had excellent dimensional precision. The tensile strength of the 15 W-sintered Cu-SiO2/PA12 specimen was 48 MPa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"In this work, a one-dimensional fluid model is established to study the effects of frequency on (He + O2) dielectric barrier discharge. As the frequency increases from 20 to 30 kHz, the first pulse becomes more intensive, while the second pulse gradually decreases and finally disappears. The plasma transforms from multibreakdowns to single breakdown per half-cycle. In order to study the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during this transformation, the spatiotemporal distributions of ROS densities are presented and the average ROS densities, as well as their wall fluences, are statistically analyzed. It is suggested that the production of each species increases along with the frequency, but when the second pulse disappears, the productions of some species, such as and, decline slightly. Moreover, the wall fluence and average density of a specific species vary with similar trends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,"The Klein-Alfv & xfffd;n model is based on the pragmatic belief that also cosmology, just like all other fields of physics, should be based on physical laws independently tested in the laboratory. It actually has a number of attractive features, described in this article. As almost all matter in the known universe is in the plasma state, the model is by necessity based on both gravity and electromagnetism, and as most cosmic plasmas are inhomogeneous and magnetized, it is automatically inhomogeneous (as is the real universe). It is not perfect (no models are), but many of the outstanding unsolved ?problems? of the contemporary standard big bang-model of cosmology are either solved/sidestepped by, or non-existent in, the Klein-Alfv & xfffd;n model. One should remember that the standard model of cosmology also is just that?a model, and highly idealized at that, with many ad hoc ingredients and a large number of free parameters and hypothetical ingredients that are fixed only through comparison with cosmological data in a global best-fit fashion. It is not, and should never be considered to be, sacrosanct. If a comparable number of man-hours had been invested in the direction of the Klein-Alfv & xfffd;n model it is plausible that it would describe the real observed universe as good as, or even better than, the big bang-model?with much fewer speculative additions to known physics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Scaling down the size of transistor in the nanoscale reduces the power supply voltage, as a result, the design of high-performance nano-circuit at low voltage has been considered. Most of digital circuits are composed of different components which determine the performance of the entire digital circuits. With the improvement of these components, the digital circuits can be optimized. One of these components is full adder for which various structures have been proposed to improve its performance, among them the two novel full adder structures are based on Gate-Diffusion Input (GDI) structure and half-classical XOR/XNOR logic (SEMI XOR/XNOR) modules. In this paper, Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNTFET)-based low power full adders by using SEMI XOR logic style and GDI structure are presented. Due to the incomparable thermal and mechanical properties of the CNTFET, it can be the first alternative to substitute the metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFET). The digital circuits have the better performance based on CNTFET. Therefore, the three proposed full adders in this paper are designed based on CNTFET technology with many merits, such as low power dissipation, less energy delay product (EDP), and high speed at various supply voltages, frequencies, temperatures, load capacitors, and the number of tubes. Moreover, these proposed full adders occupy the minimum area consumption and have better performance in comparison with previous standard full adders. All simulations are done by using the Synopsys HSPICE simulator in 32 nm-CNTFET technology and layout of all full adder circuits are presented on Electric.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

15,"In this paper, we present an adaptive measurement to quantify the complexity of time series, called q-sample entropy difference mean (qSEDiffAve), and apply this method to heart rate time series. It quantifies the structural information of the signals and helps identify different conditions of the heart systems. Experiments show that compared with the traditional sample entropy (SampEn), qSEDiffAve has significant advantages in reflecting the inherent information of sequences. It also reveals that the qSEDiffAve curves of healthy subjects are significantly different from the atrial fibrillation (AF) and congestive heart failure (CHF) groups, because the CHF signals tend to fluctuate between narrow ranges while the atrial fibrillation (AF) signals are random, and the signals of healthy subjects are usually mixed by signals with different dynamic characteristics, showing higher complexity. In addition, the most important parameter in the model, q, can enlarge the differences between qSEDiffAve curves of healthy and pathological states. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

An average output power of 13.5 W with repetition rate up to 7 kHz and pulse duration of ?1.24 ns is obtained, corresponding to a pump extraction efficiency of 16.1% (19.5% for the second stage) and peak power of ?1.5 MW. The beam quality factors at maximum output power are measured to be Mx2=1.56and My2=1.48We introduce an analytical model to estimate gain and beam quality after amplification.

17,"It is important to be able to control the physical and chemical integrity of carbon-based porous monolith structures while being tailored for targeted analytical, energy and catalytic based applications. A set up using a CO2 laser in continuous mode (CW CO2 laser) was implemented to cut fragile and porous carbon monolithic (CM) and nanotemplated carbon monolithic (NTCM) rods into discs with a prescribed thickness and dimensional integrity (denoted as LCM and LNTCM, or LCMs). Changes in structure, porosity and composition of LCMs were induced by the efficient thermal energy afforded by the CW CO2 laser irradiation under tightly controlled process conditions. The main effects observed before and after laser cutting were studied in comparison with traditional scalpel blade cutting of carbon monolithic (SCM). FE-SEM images confirmed that the resulting LCMs exhibited a more open, interconnected macroporous structure and smoothed mesopores to a depth of approximately 5 while the structure of the bulk section remained intact. Minimal changes in chemical compositions were confirmed by XPS. Raman spectroscopy revealed a modest increase in the graphitic content on the cross sections of LCM discs. Phenol and Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as a model analyze for demonstration of resulting discs adsorption performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

19,"In the steel industry, the fabrication of sintered products includes the use of graphite as an alloying element and lubricant. This study explores the idea that a sintered alloy with increased properties can be produced substituting graphite by carbon nanotubes. Also, the microstructural characteristics of an equiatomic alloy CrFeMnNiTi were compared with an austenitic 321 stainless-steel; which at present, has a vital role in the food industry. Results showed that the equiatomic alloy was composed mainly by austenite and Ti-rich phases, growth rate and porosity of samples were reduced with the graphite substitution. On this way, carbon nanotubes addition and modification of the chemical composition of the alloy represented viable routes to obtain new alloys with enhanced properties to replace conventional steels.

20,"In this note, we study an infinite reaction network called the stochastic Becker-Doring process, a sub-class of the general coagulation-fragmentation models. We prove pathwise convergence of the process towards the deterministic Becker-Doring equations which improves classical tightness-based results. Also, we show by studying the asymptotic behavior of the stationary distribution, that the phase transition property of the deterministic model is also present in the finite stochastic model. Such results might be interpreted closed to the so-called gelling phenomena in coagulation models. We end with few numerical illustrations that support our results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"The semi-insulating characteristics of GaAs substrates makes GaAs front end manufacturing sensitive to ESD events occurring during wafer processing. Charges induced to the wafer by these ESD events can harm or even destroy insulating structures like MIM capacitors because these charges cannot dissipate. This paper deals with the modelling and control of backside-induced ESD defects on MIM capacitors. It will highlight how charges can be induced to the wafer from its backside by wet-chemical processes and consequently destroy MIM capacitors at the wafer front side. Furthermore, we will explain how the DI water resistivity is the root cause for these defects and how it can be controlled to prevent the creation of ESD defects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"We construct a four-leg spin-1/2 t-J type model to simulate a doped two-leg spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ladder. Employing renormalized mean-field theory with simple Gutzwiller factors, we obtain three degenerate superconducting states with different pairing symmetry. Through improving the Gutzwiller factors, we find that the state C with inter-layer modified dy2-z2<i-wave pairing has the lowest energy in a large doping range. Besides, we use the density matrix renormalization group method to solve the model. The negative binding energy reveals the pairing tendency, and the pair-pair correlation functions exhibit a slowly decaying behavior on certain types of bonds. From the pair correlations, we confirm the inter-layer modified dy2-z2<i-wave superconducting state as the ground state of the model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

24,"In this paper, we detailed study the geometric aspect of Chern-Simons-like gravity in three dimensions. The vacua are provided by three dimensional conformally flat manifold, which admit a special configuration, a two dimensional system (M-2, h, Phi) consisting of metric h and scalar field Phi, by dimensional reduction. For this system we define the quasi-local mass. An interesting observation is that this system contains certain two dimensional dilaton gravity at the classical level. Via AdS/CFT, we check the Weyl anomaly and diffeomorphism anomaly for the boundary theory. We study the linearization of Chern-Simons-like gravity around the background with constant scalar curvature via linear Cotton tensor. If the background manifold is of positive constant scalar curvature, we show that there is no solutions for linearized vacuum equation. To find the solutions of the linear gravity with respect to the background with negative constant scalar curvature, we need to solve some Schrodinger-type equations. Related to supersymmetric quantum mechanics, one can find some exact solutions and some dualities between different components or modes of solutions. And it is also can be related to Seiberg-Witten theory via Picard-Fuchs equation in terms of WKB approximation. We discuss the ADM-type charge under the context of Chern-Simons-like gravity. Finally, we extend the Chern-Simons-like gravity to the supermanifolds by embedding the structure group of three-manifold into the body of othosymplectic supergroup. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

25,We theoretically investigate the influences of two coherent driving fields on the asymmetric transmission of single photon in the atom-waveguide system. The atom is considered as a ? system. One transition of the atom chirally couples to the waveguide. The other transition is driven by two coherent driving fields. The transmission probabilities for the single photon incidents from the left (T-lr) and right (T-rl) are given respectively. The calculated results show that one can realize T-lr = 0 (T-rl ? 0) or T-rl = 0 (T-lr ? 0) by manipulating the phase difference between the two coherent driving fields. The influence of the decay rate of the metastable state on the asymmetric transmission is also discussed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"Phase retrieval is an important problem in many areas of physics while transport-of-intensity Equation (TIE) is a traditional method for recovering phases by intensity detection. Derivative of axial intensity is an important parameter in TIE and usually obtained by finite difference (FD) method. However, nonlinearity error is unavoidable in these FD methods.

The field configuration consists of two circularly polarized electromagnetic wave wigglers propagating collinearly in the opposite direction to the traveling relativistic electron beam.

In these studies, it was assumed that the warship was composed of one magnetic material in order to establish an effective deperming protocol. However, since the actual warship was composed of various materials, the magnetic interaction between the materials inevitably occurs during the demagnetization process.

31,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently requires transform domain de-noising methods to preserve important features in the reconstructed images such as corners, sharp structures, and edges. Wavelet transform-based image de-noising is a standard approach used in MRI to recover smooth surface and sharp edges from the given noisy MR images, thereby improving diagnostic interpretations. Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) techniques such as SENSE have been recently developed with an aim to improve the data acquisition speed, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and spatial resolution of the reconstructed images. However, the SENSE reconstruction algorithm often encounters noise during data acquisition and reconstruction process which not only contaminates the quality of the reconstructed images but also leads to poor diagnostic interpretations in clinical settings. During SENSE reconstruction process, noise can appear in the reconstructed image mainly due to two reasons (1) imperfections in the receiver coils; (2) un-folding the aliased images of multiple receiver coils to obtain a single composite image. In this paper, a new adaptive patch-based filtering in wavelet domain is presented to recover sharp structures and edges without introducing any artifacts in the SENSE reconstructed images. The proposed method uses soft-thresholding function as a shrinkage process which typically involves thresholding the small wavelet coefficients to reduce the noise without affecting the important features in the SENSE reconstructed images. For the evaluation of the proposed method, several experiments are performed using simulated phantom and in vivo data sets. The SENSE reconstruction quality using the proposed method is compared with contemporary de-nosing techniques, in terms of structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the SENSE reconstruction using the proposed method when compared to the other contemporary de-nosing methods successfully removes the noise and preserves the fine details in the reconstructed MR images without introducing blurring artifacts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33,"Starting from the Rabi Hamiltonian, which is useful in arriving at non-perturbative results within the rotating wave approximation, we have found Einstein?s B coefficient to be time-dependent: for a two-level system (atom or molecule) in thermal radiation field. Here is the corresponding Rabi flopping (angular) frequency and J(0) is the zeroth order Bessel function of the first kind. The resulting oscillations in the B coefficient?even for very small ?drives the system away from thermodynamic equilibrium at any finite temperature contrary to Einstein?s assumption. The time-dependent generalized B coefficient facilitates a path to go beyond Pauli?s formalism of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics involving the quantum statistical Boltzmann (master) equation.

35,"The propagation of surface acoustic wave (SAW) on the piezoelectric substrate requires conventionally an interdigitated electrode structure to excite the mechanical displacement at resonance frequency. The control of the electrode thickness could be useful to manipulate the energy confinement and the band dispersion of the surface guided mode. It has been demonstrated recently that high aspect ratio (HAR) electrode could produce a dispersive shear horizontal and vertically polarized surface modes in the bulk piezoelectric substrate. In this theoretical study, we propose to employ a high aspect ratio electrode on top of the GaN/sapphire-layered substrate enabling the presence of Sezawa surface mode. Based from the dispersion band, we obtained a higher frequency of surface guided mode in the non-radiative zone in the GaN/sapphire heterostructure configuration compared to the bulk GaN substrate. Indeed, these guided modes are induced by the hybridization between Sezawa surface mode and the mechanical resonance of the HAR electrode producing nearly a flat band at the limit of First Brillouin Zone. Furthermore, the displacement of each guided modes indicates the confinement of energy mostly in the electrode with a slight amount of energy in the top layer of the substrate. We demonstrated also the frequency tuning of guided mode using diverse materials for the electrode but also the thickness of GaN layer. The obtained results could be useful for the development of high-frequency telecommunication and sensing device based on Sezawa surface acoustic wave.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"The role of convection in liquid thermoelectric cells may be difficult to predict because the inter- and intra-molecular interactions are not currently incorporated into thermodynamic models. Here, we study the thermoelectric response of a series of five anhydrous 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium halide ionic liquids with varied chain length and counterion in a high-aspect-ratio, horizontal-temperature-gradient geometry, where convection is minimal. While a canonical, constant-volume thermodynamic model indicates that greater disparity and longer aliphatic groups should exhibit larger Seebeck coefficients, we instead measure the opposite: Longer aliphatic chains correlate with lower densities and greater heat expansion, stronger intermolecular associations, stronger steric repulsion, and lower Seebeck coefficients. As evidence of the critical role of thermal expansion, we measure that the Seebeck effect is nonlinear: Values of -2.8 mV/K with a 10 K temperature difference and -1.8 mV/K with a 50 K difference are measured with ether ion. Our results indicate that steric repulsion and heat expansion are important considerations in ionic liquid design; with large temperature differences, the Seebeck coefficient correlates negatively with heat expansion. Our results suggest that Seebeck values may improve if thermal expansion and steric forces are limited in a pressurized, isochoric, convection-free design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The load impedance of the PA was adaptively sensed by an embedded impedance detector which was digitally controlled and the system adjusted PA power using a feedback circuit to keep the PA safe based on a load mismatch detection. For verification, a two-stage hetero junction bipolar transistor (HBT) PA module for handsets was fabricated and tested against load mismatch.

38,"A ruggedness improved multi-band radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) module applicable to mobile handsets, which are required to survive against a serious load impedance change under extreme power and bias conditions, is presented. In this method, the load impedance of PA is adaptively adjusted with a digitally controlled impedance corrector to keep the PA safe by performing a load mismatch detection. The impedance mismatch detector, impedance corrector, and other RF switches were all integrated into a single integrated circuit (IC) using silicon on insulator (SOI) complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS). For the verification purpose, a 2-stage hetero junction bipolar transistor (HBT) PA module adopting this method was fabricated. At a frequency of 1915 MHz, a collector bias voltage of 4.2 V, and over a wider range of load impedance variation between a VSWR of 1 and a VSWR of 5.5, it did not fail. When this technique was not applied with a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) range of 1 to 4, it resulted in an acceptable RF performance degradation of 1% power added efficiency (PAE) in envelope tracking (ET) mode. Moreover, it survived at a bias voltage 1V larger than when the technique was not applied for the same mismatch condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed PHORS device comprises a sensing probe combining NaI(Tl) and CaF2(Eu) scintillators for simultaneous measurement of beta and gamma radiation, a multichannel analyzer to characterize the radiation energy, and a laptop computer for signal analysis. For its performance test, we employed a prototype PHORS to measure the energies and the count rates of beta and gamma radiation from three different radiation sources for separation distances from 2 to 10 cm. The count rates of the PHORS were consistent with expected rates, and the captured energy spectra showed classic radionuclide characteristics. Thus, the proposed PHORS system provides an effective and facile tool to detect beta and gamma radiation simultaneously and to identify radionuclides from the captured energy spectra.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patientswith thrombocytopenia presents a difficult problemin that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is not suitable. This first case report describes our patientwith angina pectoris and thrombocytopeniawhowe successfully treatedwith PCI after partial splenic artery embolization (PSE). A 70-year-old Japanese male was transferred to our hospital because of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). After medical treatment was administered, a coronary angiography (CAG) revealed three-vessel disease. He had severe thrombocytopenia (nadir of 27,000/mu L) due to liver fibrosis. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and PCIwere not feasible. PSEwas performed, and splenic volume reduction was confirmed by computed tomography. As a result, the platelet count increased after PSE and we completed the PCI with a DES. Major bleeding complications and cardiac events did not occur under the DAPT. To the best of our knowledge, performing PSE before PCI for increasing a patient's platelet count for thrombocytopenia has never been reported. This method may be considered as one of the treatment strategies for angina patients with thrombocytopenia. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

44,"The edge effects due to leakage electric fields in piezoelectric bar specimens cause non-uniform charge densities, distort electric field lines, and increase capacitance. This increase in capacitance was simulated using finite-element-method-based electric field simulation software. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulation results showed that the rate of increase in capacitance decreased when the aspect ratio or dielectric constant increased. To increase measurement accuracy of the dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic constants of piezoelectric single crystals, the rate of increase in capacitance should be maintained below 0.5%. Actual measurements and theoretical analysis of the transverse- and longitudinal-effect length-extensional vibration in specimens with a small dielectric permittivity were performed. The results indicated that s(jj)(E) can be obtained directly from the f(r) of a transverse-effect length-extensional vibration, but k(ij) and d(ij) must be compensated for if the rate of increase in capacitance is greater than 0.5%. After compensation, it is possible to measure k(ii) from longitudinal-effect length-extensional vibration in specimens with a reasonable dielectric permittivity, but one must avoid using it to measure s(ii)(D) and s(ii)(E) (C) 2019 The Japan Society of Applied Physics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation volume versus 'x' exhibited a nonlinear pattern with regions of Fe-induced volume contraction (within x<50%, i.e., Si-rich region) and expansion (x>50%, i.e., Ge-rich region).

The photoluminescence spectra of the powders exhibited two emission bands in the blue-green (A-band) and red (B-band) regions, which were assigned to the 4f(7)-4f(6)5d transition of Eu2+ and spin-forbidden d-d transition of Mn2+, respectively. The B-band arose from an energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+. The multiple photoluminescence resulted in Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates occurring in the warm white light region. Increasing x and y had differing effects on the crystal structures, photoluminescence properties, and particle morphologies of the synthesized powders. The B-band was closely dependent on the x values, whereas increasing y mainly produced a change in the luminescence of the A-band. The particle size increased with the x and y values.

75,"Secure information exchange occurs in many recently emerging cooperative-based networks, such as 5G networks (especially those with a Device to Device architecture), the Internet of Things, and vehicular ad hoc networks. However, the existing information exchange protocols only focus on either pairwise information exchange or group information exchange, and none of these protocols enable private and public information exchange to occur simultaneously. Thus, a general secure information exchange protocol for a multiuser channel is desirable. With this motivation, this paper investigates simultaneous private and public information exchange in a Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (MIMO) multiuser relay channel. In an aim to achieve this goal, signal alignment is chosen as the core technique. With the designed precoding matrix for each user, private information is aligned with its exchange partner, and public information forms a coding chain at the relay. With the aligned private signal and public coding chain, neither an untrusted relay nor external eavesdroppers can recover the original individual information. Performance analyses of the proposed protocol are conducted. First, we conduct transmission performance analyses from the perspective of time slot cost. Second, we conduct a security analysis for private information exchange and public information exchange. Third, we conduct secrecy sum-rate analysis for three attack scenarios: an untrusted relay attack only, an eavesdropper attack only, and both an untrusted relay and eavesdropper attack. The simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed protocol can enable simultaneous private and public information exchange while resisting attacks by an undesired receiver, an untrusted relay, and external eavesdroppers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

79,"In this paper, nano-CeO2-Y2O3 co-stabilized ZrO2 ceramic powders (CYSZ) were firstly prepared by co-precipitation method, and CYSZ powder was spray-granulated, followed by thermal plasma spraying of nano-CYSZ thermal barrier coating on 35Cr(2)Ni(4)MoA alloy matrix. After XRD and SEM analysis, the five CYSZ ceramic coatings (CeO2 content 0, 1, 5, 10, 15 mol%) prepared were tetragonal phase structures before and after the thermal shock experiment, and the thickness of CYSZ ceramic coating was about 200 mu m. Adding appropriate amount of nano CeO2 promoted the formation of micro-cracks in the coating, released the coating stress, slowed down the thermal shock damage process, and prevented the transformation from t-ZrO2 to m-ZrO2. The AFM morphology showed that the coating surface grains grow vertically after thermal shock cycle, which indicated that the entry of Ce4+ into ZrO2 lattice resulted in lattice distortion and made the grains more stable. When the content of CeO2 is 1 mol%, the thermal shock resistance excellent is 84 times. Therefore, the addition of CeO2 can effectively improve the thermal shock resistance performance of CYSZ thermal barrier coating, meeting the requirements of high temperature working conditions of aeroengine and hot-end components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,"We propose an all-optical phase-shifting method using Yb-doped optical fibers and demonstrate its potential in on-axis digital holography microscopy (DHM) system. The Yb-doped optical fiber induces a phase change under optical pumping conditions. The induced phase shift shows a good linear response to applied pumping currents, and N-step phase-shifting up to 2p can be properly performed. Four-, six-, and eight-step phase-shifting methods are performed, and the phase retrievals from their phase-shifted interferograms are achieved using an interframe correlation matrix method. An 8-step phase shifting-based reconstruction, which is effective for background noise reduction, is used for 3D imaging of an indium tin oxide (ITO) thin film and an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) thin film. The reconstructed surface profile was in agreement with the step structure of the samples. The proposed all-optical phase-shifting method is expected to be applied to various optical imaging systems using fiber-based phase-shifting interferometers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

82,"Mess (disorder)-there are many different meanings related to this problem. The explicit majority comes from the area of philosophical, social and medical sciences. In our paper, we try to present the engineering aspect of the concept of disorder. We propose a mathematical model which describes the effects and consequences concerning the process of making the mess. We use Multi-Agent Modeling, where there are several independent agents with decision-making ability. Each agent has the ability to communicate and perceive for achieving its own aim. We use square grid n x n with objects which can be moved by agents to another places. The degree of disorder of the system is examined by the value of entropy. Using computer simulation, we investigate the time needed to find the desired thing in an environment in which agents (in real life, people) co-exist and they have different tendencies to tidiness. The cost of mess is counted as the number of attempts to access the object in the analyzed system and the time needed to locate the object.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"A high-voltage light-emitting diode (LED) flip chip based on an AlInGaN heterostructure is developed and fabricated. The LED flip chip consists of 16 elements connected in series, each of which is a convential LED. The chip with a total area of 1.25 x 1.25 mm is intended for a working current of 20 mA and a forward voltage of 48 V. To improve the current-distribution uniformity over the active region of the chip elements and to minimize the losses of the element area occupied by the n-type contact, the n-type contact pads in them are arranged inside the p-type contact region due to the two-level metallization layout with an intermediate insulating layer of dielectric. The arrangement topology of the contact pads is developed using numerical simulation. An increase in the quantum efficiency of the chip is provided by the application of combinations of metals with a high reflectance at the LED emission wavelength, which are used when fabricating n- and p-type contacts as well as current-carrying strips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

85,"In this paper we suggest a model for how a significant part of the drag forces on two-dimensional objects can be derived using the circulation that is naturally maintained around the objects. We assume incompressible and inviscid potential flow and that the circulation is already generated. The resulting velocity field complements the one that is known to generate Prandtl?s induced drag in three dimensions. We demonstrate how fluid particles in a velocity field are attracted towards an object, and that this, due to conservation of momentum, results not only in lift, but also in drag forces. The magnitude of a disturbance velocity can be derived from the circulation of bound and shed vortices accompanying the object and parameters taken from the von K;rm;n vortex street description. Another part of the drag is generated by vortices that emerge behind blunt bodies when fluid particles do not follow the surface of the objects. We obtain a mathematical description of the resistance of several types of blunt bodies and rotating cylinders. The model involves no parameters that are derived from empirical data. Still, this inviscid approach corresponds well with experimental data in viscous flow and is close to a mathematical empirical description of rotating cylinders by W. G. Bickley.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2008) and 35 clusters at redshifts 0.15 < z < 0.30 selected and analysed by Landry et al. (2013), we obtained constraints on main cosmological parameters in two popular cases: wCDM model in which dark energy equation of state is constant in time and the model in which dark energy equation of state evolves with redshift according to the Chevalier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization. Our results from numerical Monte Carlo calculations are following: Omega(m) = 0.3695(-0.173)(+0.1121), H-0 = 66.74(-42.15)(+28.48), w = -0.78(-0.2615)(+0.1695) for wCDM model and Omega(m) = 0.2523(-0.0694)(+0.1738), H-0 = 67.29(-29.98)(+24.27), w(0) = -0.86(-0.3245)(+0.4541), w(a) = 0.6948(-0.892)(+0.5226) for CPL scenario and are in an agreement with the results based on other well-established, independent techniques.

87,"Here we report the interesting change in magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of ErRu2-xCrxSi2 upon increase of Cr doping for x= 0, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction becomes weak when a small amount of Cr is doped in place of Ru, resulting in magnetic transition from AFM to doping induced ferromagnetic (FM) transition. The associated change in transition (AFM to FM) is coupled with inter atomic distance along c axis. Above certain concentration, the nature of the transition is also modified to second order from first order. It is also evident that for x= 0.3, obtained magnetic entropy change is maximum (15.9 J/kg-K for 50 kOe field change), slightly greater than the parent compound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,"Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique which magnetic susceptibility differences between tissues can be used as a new type of contrast in MRI. SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances. Accurate estimations of the magnetic properties of the heme derivatives is essential for the development of the SWI technique. In this paper, we study structural and magnetic properties of the heme derivatives from Density Functional Theory calculations. By applying the Stoner model we obtained the magnetic susceptibility of the heme derivatives. We find that the paramagnetic phase of heme, deoxyhemoglobin and aquomethemoglobin to be more stable than the diamagnetic phase as expected from experimentation but the diamagnetic phase of the oxyhemoglobin and hemichrome is more stable. Our results show that the response of the heme to the external magnetic field is changed by the presence of ligand (imidazole or water) molecule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"Synthesis of core/shell structured ZnFe2O4/CuO nanoparticles with varying core diameter and different weight percentage of CuO phase [(1-x) ZnFe2O4/x CuO: x = 0.15, 0.30, 0.45 and 0.60] using double stage standard chemical co-precipitation method has been reported in this article. For first four samples only the diameter of core was varied and for other four samples only the weight percentage of CuO phase was varied. The existence of both cubic spinel ZnFe2O4 phase along with monoclinic CuO phase was verified by X-ray patterns recorded at room temperature. The average core diameter was in between 8 and 13 nm as estimated using Scherrer's formula and further verified by HRTEM images. A reduction in lattice parameter with increasing core thickness and also with increasing CuO phase was observed. A notable enhancement in coercivity and saturation magnetization were observed in field cooled (5 T) hysteresis loops obtained at 5 K for the first four varying core diameter core-shell structured nanoparticles in comparison to bare zinc ferrite nanoparticles of almost same size. A decreasing trend in coercivity and saturation magnetization was also noticed in low temperature hysteresis loops for higher CuO content samples. A considerable improvement in blocking temperature (T-B) as well as Neel temperature (T-N) for all the different core diameter samples were also found in M(T) protocols. Both blocking temperature and Neel temperature decreased for increasing CuO content in composite nanoparticles. The room temperature M(H) plots exhibited superparamagnetic nature with insignificant coercivity and negligible remanence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,"Type-I (straddled) InP DHBT devices have been fabricated to study the impact of different base-collector junction transition layer designs on the collector to emitter breakdown behavior, breakdown voltage, BVceo and the device output performance such as knee voltage, Vknee at high collector current densities, Jc. An abrupt breakdown behavior with BVceo of 11V and Vknee less than 1V at Jc>100kA/cm(2) are achieved using an optimized base collector junction transition layer design. Using 2D numerical simulations, components of leakages dominating Iceo at low and high collector to emitter bias voltages are explained. It is further shown that the optimized device exhibits good RF and power performance achieving f(T) of 115GHz and f(max) of 150GHz at emitter width >1um. An MMIC power amplifier (PA) is also designed and fabricated using the optimized Type-I InP DHBT device. At 28GHz, good power performance is achieved with PAE of 54% and Psat of 26dBm.

91,"In this paper, a novel shock capturing scheme with high stability and speed of solution is presented. The scheme divides the dependent variables into two parts, i.e. Surf and Surfer, like surfing sport. The Surf part is calculated by applying the concept of Sobolev gradient on the dependent variables. Furthermore, it has the least difference with these variables, along with the lowest discretization error and the same equation. Hence, it is expected that this part can be solved at high stability conditions and large time steps. In addition, the Surfer part is obtained from the difference between the Surf part and the dependent variables. Therefore, only the error-maker operators (for example, a discontinuity like a shock) are in this part and accordingly it has a local nature. Due to this feature, it can be solved with fewer points compared to the Surf part. Therefore, its equation is solved as quickly as Surf equation, despite its limited stability conditions. Finally, the summation of the Surf and Surfer solutions makes the main solution. The scheme has been applied to the inviscid Burgers' equation with an initial value of the step function, and one-dimensional inviscid Euler flow through a nozzle with a shock wave. The stability condition for the Burgers' equation has been increased to a Courant number of 10(10) and the solution time for the Euler flow case has been decreased by one-fifth. Comparison of the results with traditional methods indicates the ultra-high stability and ultra-speed convergence of this scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

92,"We explore a variational characterization of the bipartite entanglement entropy such as von Neumann entropy for pure states in terms of general projective measurements of an arbitrary system. By properly choosing the measurement basis, we show that a general estimation of the bipartite entanglement measure can be explicitly written. The number of projective measurement operators of the subsystem necessary for calculating an upper bound of the bipartite entanglement entropy is less than or equal to the dimension of the smaller subsystem. This number is much smaller than that of the full tomography of the density matrix. As an application, our method is useful to estimate the entanglement entropy of each energy eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"The most entropy distribution can be estimated based on some proper intended constraints. It is unbiased and unique on some constraints and is applied to find out the distribution of a data set. But it is difficult to get the distribution of multivariate data by saving the dependency between its variables and transferring it to the outcome distribution. On the other hand, copula function keeps safe the dependency. Thus entropy principle can be added to copula concept to approximate the distributions of the multivariate dependence data sets. In this article, we would like to work on the most copula entropy based on known Spearman's rho as an extra constraint. For this aim, we approximate Spearman's rho via empirical distribution function of a given data set. Then the most copula entropy based on Tsallis definition is gotten and compared with Shannon results in some senses by plots. Finally its density function is practically obtained.

94,"In the present work a tissue-equivalent (TE) nanocomposite is prepared by mixing polyamide 6 (PA6), polyethylene (PE) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to be a substitution for the expensive and difficult to obtain A-150 plastic as the wall material of tissue-equivalent proportional counters (TEPCs). It is found that 3% of CNTs in the nanocomposite produced 3 x 10(-6)S cm(-1) electrical conductivity comparable with that of A-150 and the soft tissue. Also, TEM picture shows the electrical network formation in the continuous PA phase and the interface of PA and PE phases. Determination of the density and the weight percentage of elements of this nanocomposite reveal that the obtained values are similar to A-150 and the soft tissue. On the other hand, simulations carried out by Geant4 toolkit show that the fluence of secondary charged particles of the gamma rays or neutrons inside the gas cavity originating from A-150 and the nanocomposite (3% CNT) is similar. In addition, microdosimetric distributions derived from a TEPC with the nanocomposite wall agree well with a TEPC with A-150 wall. Hence, the frequency-mean and dose-mean lineal energies obtained by the two TEPCs are also compatible. A maximum difference 3% is observed between the frequency-mean lineal energies. Also, the dose-mean lineal energies differ up to 10%. Consequently, the dose-equivalent determined by the two above TEPCs is found similar. Finally, it is concluded that the fabricated nanocomposite can be a reliable substitution for A-150 plastic as a wall material of TEPCs in the neutrons and gamma ray measurements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"The weakly nonlinear ray theory (WNLRT) has been developed for the study of propagation of wavefronts in homogeneous and quiescent media. The main advantage of this theory is that the study of 2D wavefront propagation can be carried over in a ray coordinate system, which is 1D (in the space variable). This makes the theory (along with the shock ray theory, SRT) more efficient than solving the full Euler system in 2D and is well suited for certain applications. However, the WNLRT and the SRT are developed only in a homogeneous and quiescent medium whereas it is important to update these theories to inhomogeneous and moving media. In this article, we derive the WNLRT system in an inhomogeneous and moving medium filled with polytropic gases. The governing system of this theory involves three balance laws in the ray coordinate system, which is strictly hyperbolic under the condition that the wavefront speed is greater than the ambient sound speed. In order to validate the developed theory, we solve the derived system numerically and show that the effect of medium anisotropy has been captured in terms of the geometry of a propagating wavefront. We also compare our numerical results with linear ray theory to highlight the success in capturing the nonlinear geometric effect of the propagating wavefront. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

96,"The unipolar arc (UA) consists of two parts: the emitting electrons cathode part and the anode part collecting electrons. The central (emitting) part operates as a vacuum arc with relatively well-established experimental parameters: cathode voltage drop, current density, and minimal arc current (I-min). The current distribution in the background plasma was considered to find the condition of the UA existence, which is the ability of the background plasma to provide the return current at a level above I-min. Two situations were considered: with and without external magnetic field. It was found that in the magnetic field absence, the condition for the UA existence is determined mostly by the plasma temperature. At the same time, the magnetic field dramatically shifts the domain of the unipolar existence toward higher temperatures and higher plasma densities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"Small sized electrocatalysts, which can be obtained by rapid nucleation and high supersaturation are imperative for outstanding methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Conventional microwave synthesis processes of electrocatalysts include ultrasonication, stirring, pH adjustment, and microwave irradiation of the precursor mixture. Ethylene glycol (EG), which serves as a reductant and solvent was added during the ultrasonication or stirring stage. However, this step and pH adjustment resulted in unintended multi-stage gradual nucleation. In this study, the microwave reduction approach was used to induce rapid nucleation and high supersaturation in order to fabricate small-sized reduced graphene oxide-supported palladium (Pd/rGO) electrocatalysts via the delayed addition of EG, elimination of the pH adjustment step, addition of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), prior microwave irradiation of the EG mixed with Na2CO3, and addition of room temperature precursor mixture. Besides its role as a second reducing agent, the addition of Na2CO3 was primarily intended to generate an alkaline condition, which is essential for the high-performance of electrocatalysts. Moreover, the microwave irradiation of the EG and Na2CO3 mixture generated highly reactive free radicals that facilitate rapid nucleation. Meanwhile, the room temperature precursor mixture increased supersaturation.
