0,"Identifying research fronts is of great scientific and practical significance. Partnered with Clarivate Analytics and the Higher Education Press, the Chinese Academy of Engineering launched an annual project, aiming to identify engineering research and development frontiers. For engineering research, we determine the candidate hotspots mainly based on data analysis of highly cited papers in the Web of Science Core Collection and select the fronts based on expert research and judgment. The research hotspots are selected from topics clustered through co-citation analysis, which are based on four topic indicators including the number of core papers, total citations, average publication year of core papers, and the percentage of consistently cited publications. It is thus crucial to design proper strategies for hotspot selection. We compared the performance of several hotspot selection strategies and found that the proposed mixed selection strategy performs best. The strategy was used in the 2018 project and led to an improved edition. We present an overall comparison of the performance of the top 10 countries or regions in engineering research fronts based respectively on the number of first author core papers and the citation number per paper of core papers. We believe that our experience obtained from the implementation of the Engineering Fronts project can be used as reference for other similar bibliometric projects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

1,"An adaptive cell method is proposed in order to simulate physical fields on a coarse grid with high accuracy. Compared with the conventional cell method, the advance of the proposed adaptive method originates from the so-called node weight correction procedure by using a patch-recovery technique, which corrects the local constitutive relations and in turn mitigates the error source that results from the discretization of constitutive equations. Furthermore, the proposed method has been extended to general curvilinear grids, in which the construction of the local constitutive matrix is derived by using differential geometry. Finally, we have demonstrated by theoretical analysis and numerical results that the proposed strategies can achieve a high-order convergence as well as high-efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

2,"The von Braun reaction, discovered at the dawn of the past century, consists of the reaction between a tertiary amine and cyanogen bromide. It leads to the cleavage of a CN bond with the formation of an N-dialkylcyanamide and an alkyl bromide and has been extensively used in organic synthesis. A detailed in silico study (PCM/density functional theory [DFT]/B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) calculations) of this venerable reaction has shown that in the first stage a zwitterionic adduct with a multibonded bromine atom is formed. The widely accepted mechanism involving an S(N)2 reaction occurs in the second step, thus accounting for its selectivity. Quantum chemical calculations were performed for the von Braun-like reactions in systems formed by cyclic tertiary amines (N-alkyl azetidines). In these cases, the first stage is almost the same as in the classical von Braun processes, and selective S(N)2 mechanisms can occur in the second step.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no
3,"The structure and magnetic properties of PrNi2-xCox alloys are investigated over the entire concentration range 0 <= x <= 2. It is shown that there is a continuous series of disordered solid solutions with a structure of the MgCu2 type. In all alloys, cobalt atoms have a magnetic moment mu(Co) = 0.5 mu(B). The ground magnetic state of the alloys depends on the composition. In the range 0 <= x <= 0.2, alloys are paramagnetic at a temperature T = 2 K, in the alloys with 0.4 <= x <= 0.8, ferromagnetic order occurs in clusters of cobalt atoms due to the exchange interaction of Co - Co. Their magnetization in small magnetic fields is realized via turnabout, by 180 degrees, of the magnetic moments of individual clusters. In the alloys with 1.0 <= x <= 2.0, the long-range ferromagnetic order is established. The processes of technical magnetization reversal in them are effected via the motion of domain walls and rotation of the vectors of spontaneous magnetization. In all alloys, magnetic saturation is not achieved at T = 5 K even in a magnetic field of 200 kOe, which is associated with a large splitting of the ground J multiple of Pr3+ ions by the crystal field. Numerical calculations of the magnetization curves are performed. In the approximation of the independence of the parameters of the crystal field on the concentration, a satisfactory agreement between the calculated and experimental curves was obtained.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes
4,"Al-doped ZnO (Al:ZnO) thin films of average thickness similar to 400 nm were grown on silicon substrates. The annealed films were irradiated using 6 MeV Au2+ ions at varying ion fluence. The residual structural, morphological, phonon and optical properties due to the comparable elastic and inelastic collision have been studied. The pristine films stabilize in hexagonal wurtzite structure which remained invariant after irradiation. However, the crystalline size decreases with increasing ion fluence. The compressive microcrystalline stress for pristine films converts into tensile with increasing the ion beam fluence. AFM micrographs indicate a smooth and dense surface micromorphology. The irradiated films with increasing ion fluence become rough and cluster formation takes place after irradiation. The optical band gap estimated from absorption spectra decreases with increasing ion fluence. In the Raman spectra, two significant phonon modes E-2(High) and E-1(LO) have been observed at room temperature.

5,Focused Hydrogen Molecular Beam (FHIB) is an extended technology to utilize accelerated proton to modify material that is Proton Beam Writer (PBW) Watt (1999) [1]. The unique characteristic of these technologies is their capability to modify engineering plastics such as polyester and polyimide of no photosensitivity. These engineering plastics are key materials to compose electronic circuits and devices. Therefore we have been researching to apply these technologies for making functional devices in various applications. FHIB especially H-3(+) as the accelerating particle is proposed to improve productivity for industrial products Hayashi et al. (2017) [2]. In this report we show FHIB is properly applied to make distributed surface device of low profile that is useful to surface devices working at GHz to THz band applications. These bands are expected to provide the last communication carrier to fulfil the future wireless communication needs Oshima et al. (2017) [3]. We used 1MV accelerator to accelerate H-3(+) and irradiated on the FPC surface before development process of 5% KOH to make engravings and nanometer sized silver oxide paste was used to fill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"To explore the possibility of using ground ice archives for studies of the cosmogenic radionuclide Be-10, we analyzed the beryllium isotopes in ice wedges exposed in the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) Permafrost Tunnel and the Barrow Permafrost Tunnel in Alaska. We determined the concentrations of Be-10 and Be-9 in samples pretreated following two procedures: acidification before (procedure A) and after (procedure B) removal of particles. The Be-10 and Be-9 concentrations spanned wide ranges. Concentrations in procedure A samples were higher than those in procedure B samples. The Be-10/Be-9 ratios fell within a narrow range, and values from CRREL (about 8.5 x 10(-9)) and Barrow (about 7 x 10(-9)) were of the same order of magnitude. Further studies are needed to validate our findings and assess the feasibility of using the Be-10/Be-9 ratio of syngenetic ice wedges for reconstruction of 10Be variations due to cosmogenic and environmental changes, and radiometric dating of ice-wedge sequences that contain very old (beyond 1 Ma) ice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8,"In this paper, the equivalent equations of DLR k-epsilon turbulent model in the boundary-fitted curvilinear coordinate are employed. Using the upwind idea that the contribution of the difference coefficients to the main node is positive contribution, and the other nodes are negative contribution or no contribution, new five-point difference schemes with a full diagonally dominant coefficient matrix (5-point-DD difference scheme) are constructed. Finally, taking the u? equation in the DLR k-epsilon turbulent model as an example, the mathematical characteristics of the 5-point-DD difference scheme are analyzed, and the uniform boundedness and convergence theorems of the Gauss-Seidel iterative sequence are given. Numerical simulations show that the five-point schemes are strictly diagonally dominant, and the calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"A high-resolution time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction study of the layered nickel oxide Pr2-xSrxNiO4 with x = 0.7 and 0.9 was performed to characterize the crystal structures of these highly hole-doped nickelates. For the sample with x = 0.7, the Ni-O bond lengths decrease uniformly with decreasing temperature, and the atomic displacement parameters are similar to those for x = 1/3. In contrast, for the sample with x = 0.9, the out-of-plane Ni-O bond length shows a sharp thermal contraction in the high-temperature region, which is suggestive of changes in the orbital occupation accompanied by the development of checkerboard-type charge correlations. Furthermore, the x = 0.9 sample is characterized by a large atomic displacement parameter for the apical O atoms along the out-of-plane direction, which is interpreted as the existence of two types of Ni3+ sites with different orbital occupancies. The distinct difference between the x = 0.9 sample and the lower-concentration compounds should be related to the development of checkerboard-type charge ordering in the metallic matrix and possible orbital ordering at the Ni3+ sites at x similar to 1 in the hole-doped layered nickel oxides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"Background: The advent of radioactive ion beams has helped considerably to explore exotic decay modes like proton radioactivity in extremely proton-rich nuclei lying on or beyond the proton drip line. Recently, an experimental study was reported on the structural properties of proton-rich nucleus O-11. Interestingly, O-11 is the mirror nucleus of the widely studied 2n halo system Li-11. In addition, O-11 formed in the experiment was identified through its decay by 2p emission. A similar kind of interdependence between neutron halo and its mirror counterpart for 2p emission was reported [Charity, Elson, Komarov, Sobotka, Manfredi, and Shane, J. Phys.: Conf series 420, 012073 (2013)]. Purpose: To study and analyze whether the mirror nuclei of known 1n/2n halo systems are 1p/2p emitters. Method: The preference for the mirror nuclei of 1n/2n halo systems for 1p/2p emission over the other (2p/1p emission) is studied by Q-value systematics and potential energy minimization using a cluster-core model. The half-lives of the mirror nuclei of neutron halo systems were determined using a recently proposed empirical formula [Sreeja and Balasubramaniam, Eur. Phys. J. A 54, 106 (2018); Sreeja and Balasubramaniam, Eur. Phys. J. A 55, 33 (2019)]. Results: Among the mirror nuclei of 1 n halo systems, N-11 (the mirror of Be-11) and F-15 (the mirror of C-15) were found to have a preference for 1p emission over 2p emission by Q-value systematics. The potential energy surface analysis supported the result where both N-11 and F-15 were found to be ground-state 1p emitters. The trend got changed with an increase in angular momentum where the minimum in potential shifted from 1p to 2p cluster. Moreover, the half-life calculation matches with the result obtained from Q-value systematics. Conclusion: For the 2n halo systems, all the studies made indicate that the respective mirror nuclei have a preference for 2p emission. A similar conclusion cannot be drawn for the mirror nuclei of In halo systems except for N-11 and F-15, which were found to be ground-state 1p emitters. All the remaining mirror nuclei of In halo systems prefers 2p emission as favorable decay mode than the expected 1p emission. The empirical formula can be used as a good tool to evaluate half-life values of proton emitters provided the Q values are known with desirable accuracy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"The Josephson effect in the array of superconducting nano-bridges (short circuits) connected in parallel within the intermediate semiconductor layer with metallic (M) nanoclusters (Sm(M)), separating two superconducting plates (S) in the presence of applied parallel dc magnetic field is considered basing on the generalized Ferrell-Prange model. This model seems to be relevant for understanding of the unusual Josephson critical current dependence, I-c(H), on applied parallel magnetic field in a S-Sm(M)-S type planar Josephson junction (MoRe-Si(W)-MoRe). Lack of the typical Fraunhofer type I-c(H) dependence for this type Josephson junctions is related with a discrete Josephson current flow through the set of parallel metallic nanobridges (or resonant-percolation trajectories) formed by M-nanoclusters within the semiconductor (Sm)-intermediate layer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"The understanding of the physical mechanisms of the nanoobjects interaction within the nanostructured complex materials is one of the main tasks for the development of novel materials with tunable properties. In this work, we develop a formation procedure of the colloidal complexes based on alloyed CdZnSe/ZnS quantum dots and gold nanoparticles where the various mercaptocarboxylic acids are used as the binding molecules. The QD photoluminescence enhancement (up to x 3.1) can be achieved by the control of the interparticle distance in colloidal solutions. We provide a detailed discussion on the influence of the linking molecules on the nanoparticle complexes optical parameters through the steady-state and time-resolved spectral measurements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"In this paper, we investigate the effects of coarse toll on the user equilibrium (UE) state in a single-entry traffic corridor with early and late arrivals from analytical and numerical perspective. Unlike previous studies on traffic tolls, the flow congestion model is used to take into account the dynamic propagation of traffic flow. The LWR (Lighthill-Whitham-Richards) model and the Greenshields' velocity-density function are used to describe the dynamic properties of traffic flow. The quasi-analytic solutions of the three possible cases in UE due to different charges are derived. Both analytical and numerical results indicate that rarefaction waves and shock waves appear in the corridor under the coarse toll. The three-dimensional evolution diagrams of traffic flow and space-time diagrams illustrate that the introduction of course toll lets flow patterns more complicated. This extends the knowledge given by the classical bottleneck model. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"The quench protection of the close-wound superconducting magnet is a key factor during the design process, especially when used on the particle therapy gantry system. Therefore, the interplay between quench protection and coil quench needs to be considered from the earliest stage of the design. For this purpose, a method using Cryosoft code is presented in this paper. Based on the quench protection electric circuit, the current and voltage evolution of the quench protection circuit and the temperature and normal zone evolution of the superconducting coil all can be obtained with this method. By studying the allowable action time for the quench protection associated with the operating current, the quench voltage threshold and the resistance of the dump resistor are determined, which is 0.4 V and 0.3 Omega. The differences of the voltage evolutions obtained with different kinds of dump resistor connections are also studied. The results show that it is better to have the dump resistor directly connected to the coil than with a switch. The advantage of this method is its integration and comprehensiveness and can be used in the design procedure of different kinds of magnets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Vertically oriented copper sulfide nanosheet arrays were successfully fabricated by a simple and manageable electrochemical anodization method at room temperature. By controlling and adjusting the concentrations of sodium sulfide electrolyte to be 0.1 M, 0.5 M, 1.0 M and 1.5 M, respectively, the morphologies of copper sulfide nanosheets (average size, thickness or density of sharp edges) could be well tailored and be more optimized for applications in field emission (FE). As the results showed, for optimal nanostructure of such copper sulfides nanosheet arrays, its turn-on field could be lowered to 2.0 V/mu m and the field emission current density would reach up to 4.1 mA/cm(2) under an applied field of 6.4 V/mu m, and also it can exhibit excellent field emission stability, with a degradation lower than +/- 4% and a huge field enhancement factor of 8327.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular we discuss the influence of site disorder on the quantum phase transition of this model at D-c that separates the Neel phase, D < D-c, which is gapless, from the disordered phase, gapped phase, D > D-c.

17,"Dynamics on complex networks and associated games have numerous practical applications for a wide range of fields. The analyses addressed in the literature frequently consider game frameworks defined between the individual nodes within a given network. However, many real situations are related to teams of agents which are external to the network but that compete over the state of the network elements. In this paper we carry out an analytical and numerical analysis of games played between two teams that compete to maximize their benefits from the resources of the same population, whose elements form a network. This population could be a group of voters in an election, a set of potential clients within a given market, or a certain species in an ecosystem, whose state favourable to one of the teams (political opinion, volume of purchases or pollination, for example) must be maximized. The dynamics of the state of each node of the network is given by a consensus function, and the steady state depends on the network structure and the external action of each team. We have found an optimal analytical solution for the team's actions that maximize its benefit, when the network of connections with the population is fixed and equal for both teams. Additionally, we find analytically the optimal network of connections from the team agents to the population so that the achievable payoff for said optimal action is maximum over all alternative networks. Finally, we consider the case of a game played on subsets of the general population by each of the two competing teams, ultimately leading to a Nash equilibrium. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

18,"We propose a novel method to extract the prompt neutron multiplicity distribution, P(nu), in fission reactions based on correlations between prompt neutrons, gamma rays, and fragment kinetic energy arising from energy conservation. In this approach, only event-by-event measurements of the total gamma-ray energy released as a function of the total kinetic energy (TKE) of the fission fragments are performed, and no neutron detection is required. Using the CGMF fission event generator, we illustrate the method and explore the accuracy of extracting the neutron multiplicity distribution when taking into account the energy resolution and calibration of the energy measurements. We find that a TKE resolution of under 2 MeV produces reasonably accurate results, independent of typical gamma-ray energy measurement resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"The modified layers were prepared on the GR2 titanium by plasma-pulsed detonation technology (PPD) in the compressed air (Air), argon (Ar) and nitrogen (N2) atmospheres, respectively. We observed that the modified layer was composed of TiN, TiN0.3, TixOy and Ti phases. The second phase strengthening, the fine grain strengthening and the dislocations strengthening are the main reasons for the improvement of wear resistance. Compared with the substrate, all modified layers have lower friction coefficient and better wear resistance. The wear volumes of three kinds of modified layers decrease by about 97%, 72% and 95%, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Stopping power and energy loss straggling data of He-4(+) swift ions in Bismuth thin film (Bi/Si) deposited onto silicon substrate were measured via Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) at incident energies ranging from 0.9 to 3.0 MeV. We adopted an improved experimental method based on the Kr+ ion implantation of the target Si substrate at low 40 keV energy and using the generated Kr-peak in the backscattered RBS spectra as reference to extract both the energy loss and the energy loss straggling for He+ ions crossing the Bi thin film. The obtained experimental stopping power values were found in good agreement with those generated numerically via SRIM-2013 and CasP 5.2 computer codes. They are also showed to be consistent with previously reported stopping data within the He+ ion energy region mainly below 1.5 MeV, which are thus extended them to higher incident energies. Finally, the relevance of collisional straggling values predicted by Bohr's and Bethe-Livingston's theories for describing the determined experimental straggling data was discussed by invoking two main additional contribution effects due to target thickness inhomogeneity and ion charge exchanges included in the Yang semi-empirical formula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

22,"In the present work, we discuss all possible condensation states of the exciton-polariton system in a microcavity. The matter-light system in the microcavity is described in a two-dimensional many-particle interacting model. In the thermal equilibrium limit, a set of self-consistent equations determining the condensate order parameters is derived by adapting the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation. Analyzing the condensate order parameters and momentum distributions of the exciton and photon densities, a detail phase structure of the exciton-polariton system has been released. At zero temperature, above a critical density, depending on the Coulomb interaction, one finds all possible condensate phases of the exciton-polariton systems including excitonic-BEC, excitonic-BCS, polaritonic-BEC, polaritonic-BCS, and photonic BEC states. A whole regime of the condensation states is decreased if increasing the detuning parameter. The complex BCS-BEC crossovers of the condensation states are also addressed in the influence of thermal fluctuations and excitation deturning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,We theoretically investigate field-induced charge-transport processes from the viewpoint of time-reversal symmetry.

24,"ZnO:Ni thin films with Ni content of 0, 3, 5 and 7% were deposited onto ITO/glass substrates using the spin coating method. The deposited films were characterized for their structural, photoluminescence and electrical properties by respectively X ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and the four points probe techniques. XRD patterns showed that the deposited films were polycrystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The absence of the Ni related diffraction peaks reflected the substitution of Zn atoms by Ni atoms in the ZnO lattice. The variation of both lattice parameters and crystallite size, as a function of Ni content, indicated that the Ni doping enhance the structural properties of the deposited films. In Raman spectra, the band at 667.9 cm(-1) appeared for doped samples, was attributed to the Zn sites occupied by Ni atoms in the ZnO lattice. In PL spectra, the decrease of the UV band emission intensity, as a function of Ni content, was attributed to Ni ions doping. The concentration of deep level defect such as Zn-i,V-zn and V-o, decreased as a function of the Ni content. The electrical resistivity increase correlated with the increase of the of Ni3+-related impurity concentration which behaves as a source of free electrons for n-type conduction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We choose the models studied in the previous work of one of the authors as an aluminum nanowire model and a hydrogen-adsorbed one. These nanowire models have conductive ability, because the aluminum part of these models is metallic. It is confirmed that electric current affects the strength of the adsorption of hydrogen atoms, and the change of the bonding of hydrogen to aluminum nanowire surface is larger for larger current.

We find that the distributions of character height and weight approximately follow lognormal distributions in common to five selected works. We propose a mechanism governing this lognormal behavior based on the principle of maximum entropy and the Weber-Fechner law. Moreover, we provide a comparison to the size distributions of real animals. Although the size distributions of fictional characters and real animals are both lognormal, the distributions are essentially different, particularly in the scaling between height and weight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"Quantitative understanding of the magnetization processes (MPs) is one of the important aspects for the design and development of ferromagnetic smart materials (FSMs). The present work explores the method of decoupling the anisotropic MPs directly for bulk soft FSMs. The small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were performed on the [1 0 0]-oriented alloys Fe1-xGax (Galfenol) under a series of magnetic fields. Those two-dimensional (2D) SANS patterns were decomposed and reconstructed by the spherical harmonic approaches. The scattering intensities, which are respectively decomposed into isotropic and anisotropic components, show clearly the pathway of three types of magnetic domains. The 90 degrees domain process is thus quantified directly in the bulk Galfenol. The evolution trend for the domain process is consistent with that for the lattice strain and magnetization responses, which has been respectively evidenced by the in-situ neutron diffraction and initial magnetization measurement. Meanwhile, the quantitatively addressed domain process agrees well with the simulated results by the energy-based domain rotation modelling. These observations indicate that the anisotropic magnetization processes correlate tightly with the lattice strain response, which are of significant importance for the understanding and design of large magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS). The present approach provides a quantitative method for decoupling the magnetization processes, which would be also applicable to other ferromagnetic systems besides Galfenol. This may help the understanding of MFIS mechanism and development of new FSMs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"Contractile tails are key components of the biological nanomachinery involved in cell membrane puncturing, where they provide a means to deliver molecules and ions inside cells. Two intriguing examples of contractile tails are those from bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin. Although the two systems are different in terms of biological activity, they share a fascinatingly similar injection mechanism, during which the tail sheaths of both systems contract from a so-called extended state to around half of their length (the contracted state), accompanied by release of elastic energy originally stored in the sheath. Despite the great prevalence and biomedical importance of contractile delivery systems, many fundamental details of their injection machinery and dynamics are still unknown. In this work, we calculate the bending and torsional stiffness constants of a helical tail sheath strand of bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin, in both extended and contracted states, using molecular dynamics simulations of about one-sixth of the entire sheath. Differences in stiffness constants between the two systems are rationalized by comparing their all-atom monomer structures, changes in sheath architecture on contraction, and differences in interstrand interactions. The calculated coefficients indicate that the T4 strand is stiffer for both bending and torsion than the corresponding R2-pyocin strands in both extended and contracted conformations. The sheath strands also have greater stiffness in the contracted state for both systems. As the main application of this study, we describe how the stiffness constants can be incorporated in a model to simulate the dynamics of contractile nanoinjection machineries.

29,"We have investigated collective breathing modes of a unitary Fermi gas in deformed harmonic traps. The ground state is studied by the superfluid local density approximation (SLDA) and small-amplitude collective modes are studied by the iterative quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). The results illustrate the evolutions of collective modes of a small system in traps from spherical to elongated or pancake-shaped deformations. For small spherical systems, the influences of different SLDA parameters are significant, and, in particular, a large pairing strength can shift up the oscillation frequency of collective modes. The transition currents from QRPA show that the compressional flow patterns are nontrivial and dependent on the deformation. Finally, the finite-size effects are demonstrated to be reasonable when progressing towards larger systems. The hydrodynamical results of collective frequencies can be reproduced by SLDA-QRPA with reduced pairing strengths. Our studies indicate that experiments on small and medium systems are valuable for understanding effective interactions in systems with varying sizes and trap deformations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

31,"Perfluorobenzenes are reactive species with the lowest magnesium metalation barriers among all hexahalobenzenes. This fact makes them good candidates for the study of heterocoupling reactions of the Grignard type. In this work, we investigated a number of pathways for both heterocoupling and homocoupling reactions and estimated the solvated energy barrier heights. According to the results of our density functional theory (DFT)-based computations, the heterocoupling reaction (C6F5)MgF + C6F6 is a single-step process. We have also studied the (C6F5)MgF + (C6F5)MgF homocoupling reaction with an aryne intermediate. In this particular reaction, a carbon-carbon bond is formed between two nucleophilic carbon centers in a chemically predictable way. The final product, (C12F9)Mg2F3, retains even stronger nucleophilic activity than that of the starting (C6F5)MgF reagent. A very surprising result of our calculations is that this homocoupling of two nucleophilic centers is spontaneous in THF solvent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33,"The effective mass of the materials relies on exciton dynamics which is greatly dominated by energy gap of the materials. We examined the effective mass for the Al2O3/NiO nanoheterostructure material through polarization in the dielectric study. The mean optical effective mass was calculated to be m(opt)*, = 5.69645 X 10(-20) m(op)/m(0) in the UV-visible region (1 x 10(6) to 5.4 x 10(6) Hz). From the group and phase velocity values, we observed that Al2O3/NiO is an anisotropic material. The electron spin-orbit energy splitting associated to electron in the valence band was identified using the Gaussian-confining 3D potential under normalized angular momentum (n, 1 = 0, 1, 2, 3). The 1S (S-1(1/2)) and 2S (S-2(1/2)) orbital ionization energies were calculated to be -6.08 and -5.99 eV for AlO3/NiO. The orbital ionization energies were established from the Bohr radius a(B) = 5.29 X 10(-11) m and donor Rydberg constant R-y = 1.097 x 10(7) m(-1) of the identical hydrogen atom.

34,"This paper investigates the coexistence and interplay of spin and mass superfluidity in antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). The hydrodynamic theory describes the spin degree of freedom by equations similar to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory for bipartite antiferromagnetic insulators. The variables in the spin space are two subspins with absolute value h/2, which play the role of two sublattice spins in the antiferromagnetic insulators. As well as in bipartite antiferromagnetic insulators, in antiferromagnetic spin-1 BEC there are two spin-wave modes: One is a gapless Goldstone mode and the other is gapped. The Landau criterion shows that in limit of small total spin (two subspins are nearly antiparallel), the instability of supercurrents starts from the gapped mode. In the opposite limit of large total spin (two subspins are nearly parallel), the gapless modes become unstable earlier than the gapped one. Mass and spin supercurrents decay via phase slips, when vortices cross streamlines of the supercurrent. The vortices participating in phase slips are nonsingular bicirculation vortices. They are characterized by two topological charges, which are winding numbers describing circulations of two angles around the vortex axis. The winding numbers can be half-integers. A particular example of a half-integer vortex is a half-quantum vortex with the superfluid velocity circulation h/2m. However, the superfluid velocity circulation is not a topological charge, and in general the quantum of this circulation can be continuously tuned from 0 to h/2m.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to bring hydrogen (H-2) very close to its critical point, we place the sample cell under weightlessness using a magnetic levitation device. Images of an H-2-filled cell are taken near its critical temperature of 33 K by illuminating the cell with three different filters. We fit the turbidity data to a theoretical expression that allows us to estimate the critical amplitudes of isothermal compressibility and fluctuation correlation length. The values of isothermal compressibility and correlation length obtained from turbidity fitting are compared against literature values.

Reduced basis methods (RBM) are commonly used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom while preserving high accuracy. RBM based on Proper Othogonal Decomposition (POD) have been extensively used but limitations exist with unsteady problems, where the temporal nonlinear dynamics of the flow needs to be addressed carefully. The accuracy in reconstructing nonlinear unsteady flows by means of RBM for a specific class of impulsively started lifting bodies is addressed. The snapshot POD approach and the recent Spectral POD will be comparatively studied to assess their capacity to reconstruct unsteady flows.

The decay rate is given in terms of the Agmon distance function d(E) associated with the degenerate Agmon metric (V - E)+g with support in the forbidden region. The point of this note is to prove a reverse Agmon estimate (i.e. exponential lower bound for the eigenfunctions) in terms of Agmon distance in the forbidden region under a control assumption on eigenfunction mass in the allowed region {V < E} arbitrarily close to the caustic {V = E}. We then give some applications to hypersurface restriction bounds for eigenfunctions in the forbidden region along with corresponding nodal intersection estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"This study aims to provide an analysis of the complementarity principle in quantum theory through the establishment of partial structural congruence relations between the quantum and Boolean kinds of event structure. Specifically, on the basis of the existence of a categorical adjunction between the category of quantum event algebras and the category of presheaves of variable Boolean event algebras, we establish a twofold complementarity scheme consisting of a generalized/global and a restricted/local conceptual dimension, where the latter conception is subordinate to and constrained by the former. In this respect, complementarity is not only understood as a relation between mutually exclusive experimental arrangements or contexts of comeasurable observables, as envisaged by the original conception, but it is primarily comprehended as a reciprocal relation concerning information transfer between two hierarchically different structural kinds of event structure that can be brought into partial congruence by means of the established adjunction. It is further argued that the proposed category-theoretic framework of complementarity naturally advances a contextual realist conceptual stance towards our deeper understanding of the microphysical nature of reality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The equilibrium position results from the balance between energy of repulsion and energy of attraction.

XRD analysis results show that all samples are a single-phase perovskite structure; XRD refinement demonstrates that La0.50Ca0.35MnO3 is a single phase with the space group Pbnm. When x = 0.15, the variation of magnetization versus temperature in a magnetic applied field of the sample indicates that La0.5Ca0.35MnO3 is converted from a ferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic phase. The Curie temperature (Tc) of the sample increases with the concentration of vacancy doping. The value of Tc increases from 209.5 to 242.1 K when x increases from 0 to 0.15.

48,The anomalous ground-state phase shift in superconductor/antiferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling is predicted and numerically investigated. It is found to be a consequence of the uncompensated magnetic moment at the superconductor/antiferromagnet interfaces. The anomalous phase shift exhibits a strong dependence on the value of the spin-orbit coupling and the sublattice magnetization with the simultaneous existence of stable and metastable branches. It depends strongly on the orientation of the Neel vector with respect to the superconductor/antiferromagnet interfaces via the dependence on the orientation of the interface uncompensated magnetic moment.

51,"A novel beam diagnostics technique to detect fast beam transient instabilities and glitches has been developed at National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). Vertical spikes of beam size and centroid have been observed occasionally and randomly during high current operations. These spikes are believed to be caused by ion instabilities associated with vacuum activity localized in the ring. With the functionality of gated beam position monitor (BPM), the newly developed technique utilizes turn-by-turn (TBT) data to detect beam centroid glitches. Whenever one turn trajectory deviates from a predefined window, a global control event is generated to trigger an online TBT data acquisition. The data acquisition is synchronized for all BPMs around the ring. In the meantime, the bunch-by-bunch (BxB) data, which is acquired from a single dedicated feedback BPM, has also been collected for analyzing possible coupled bunch instabilities (CBI). In addition to CBI caused mainly by ion bursts, other types of fast transient motions, such as, the top-off residual disturbance and fast orbit disturbance, have been captured with the new tool. The sources of the glitches can be approximately localized with the synchronized TBT data from multiple BPMs around the ring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"A very strong magnetoelastic effect in the CeCo1-xFexSi alloys is reported. The strength of the magnetostrictive effect can be tuned upon changing x. The moderate low-temperature linear magnetostriction observed at low Fe concentrations becomes very large (Delta L/L(16T, 2K) = 3 x 10(-3)) around the critical concentration x(c) approximate to 0.23 at which the long-range antiferromagnetic order vanishes. Upon increasing doping through the nonmagnetic region (x > x(c)), the magnetostriction strength gradually weakens again. The interplay between magnetic order and the Kondo screening appears to cause an enhanced valence susceptibility slightly changing the Ce ions valence, ultimately triggering the large magnetostriction observed around the critical concentration. Previous studies of the evolution of the lattice parameters with x as well as magnetization and x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements support this hypothesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We write it in the two dimensional form and show that it fulfils identically if we admit the cyclotron mass as an effective one and take the principal value of the integral. We find a deep relation between the graphene complex optical conductivity singularities and electrons Zitterbewegung (ZB) in graphene with frequency omega(ZB). Namely, the value of ZB frequency is related with the recently found magnitudes of the inductance L and capacitance C by Thomson's formula, that is, omega(ZB) = 1/root LC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"When spin ice systems undergo a sudden thermal quench, they have been shown to enter long-lived metastable states where the monopole excitations form so-called noncontractible pairs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 107201 (2010)]. While the nature of these states is well understood, the dynamical mechanisms underpinning their formation remain largely unexplored and are the subject of this study. We find that the long-range tail of the Coulomb interactions between monopoles plays a central role by suppressing the monopole-assisted decay of noncontractible pairs with respect to monopole-antimonopole annihilation. In conjunction with low final quench temperatures, where the system enters a nonhydrodynamic regime in which the monopoles effectively move at terminal velocity in the direction of the local force acting on them, the interactions lead to a metastable plateau that persists in the thermodynamic limit. This is a remarkable phenomenon, reminiscent of jamming and some instances of glassiness: A transient modification of the short-time dynamics of the system allows it to enter a metastable state whose lifetime can easily be astronomically large at (experimentally relevant) low temperatures. We demonstrate this using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field population dynamics theory, and we provide an analytical understanding of the mechanisms at play. When the interactions between monopoles are truncated to finite range, the metastable plateau reduces to a finite size effect. We derive the finite size scaling behavior of the density of noncontractible pairs in the metastable plateau for both short- and long-range interactions and discuss the experimental implications of our results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,"Microwave SQUID multiplexing has become a key technology for reading out large arrays of X-ray and gamma-ray microcalorimeters with mux factors of 100 or more. The desire for fast X-ray pulses that accommodate photon counting rates of hundreds or thousands of counts per second per sensor drives system design toward high sensor current slewrate. Typically, readout of high current slewrate events is accomplished by increasing the sampling rate, such that rates of order 1MHz may be necessary for some experiments. In our microwave multiplexed readout scheme, the effective sampling rate is set by the frequency of the flux-ramp modulation (fr) used to linearize the SQUID response. The maximum current slew rate between samples is then nominally Phi(0)f(r)/2M(in) (where M-in is the input coupling) because it is generally not possible to distinguish phase shifts of > pi from negative phase shifts of < -pi. However, during a pulse, we know which direction the current ought to be slewing, and this makes it possible to reconstruct a pulse where the magnitude of the phase shift between samples is > pi. We describe a practical algorithm to identify and reconstruct pulses that exceed this nominal slew rate limit on the rising edge. Using pulses produced by X-ray transition-edge sensors, we find that the pulse reconstruction has a negligible impact on energy resolution compared to arrival time effects induced by under-sampling the rising edge. This technique can increase the effective slew rate limit by more than a factor of two, thereby either reducing the resonator bandwidth required or extending the energy range of measurable photons. The extra margin could also be used to improve crosstalk or to decrease readout noise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We consider two-dimensional (2D), d(xy) singlet (2D-S), and three-dimensional (3D) p(x) +/- ip(y) equal-spin triplet (3D-T) superconductors. We demonstrate the topological bound state and spinful Majorana nature of the bulk gapless zeroth LLs in the singlet and triplet cases, respectively. Strain along certain directions can induce two topologically distinct phases in the bulk, with zeroth LLs localized at the interface. These modes are unstable toward ferromagnetism for 2D-S cases.

57,"We develop a formalism to study the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) response in metals based on the diagrammatic expansion for its cross section. The standard approach to the solution of the RIXS problem relies on two key approximations: short-range potentials and noninteracting conduction electrons. However, these approximations are inaccurate for charged particles in metals, where the long-range Coulomb interaction and dynamic screening effects are very important. In this work, we study how to extract important information about collective excitations in the Coulomb plasma, plasmons, and electron-hole pairs from RIXS data. We find that single- and multi-plasmon excitations can easily be distinguished by positions of the corresponding peaks, singularities, and their intensities. We also discuss the hybrid processes, where plasmon emission is accompanied by excitation of electron-hole pairs and study how they manifest themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,"We investigate the development of flow-induced small-amplitude high-frequency oscillations occurring in a rigid fluid-conveying channel with a section of the upper wall replaced by a taut elastic sheet. We consider an axially nonuniform base state, caused by a negative transmural pressure (internal minus external), which results in the sheet bending inward, and then examine the evolution of oscillatory perturbations about this state. Due to the curvature of the base state, any normal displacement of the sheet will lead to a change in the axial stretching of the sheet, which is an order of magnitude higher than would be the case for perturbations to a uniform sheet. This stretching provides an additional restoring force that can be dominant. We derive a modified tube law to describe the wall mechanics with this additional effect and combine it with an existing fluid model to obtain a complete description of the system. At leading order, we obtain a one-dimensional eigenvalue problem for the frequencies and mode shapes of the oscillatory perturbations. The nonlinear interaction between the perturbations and the base-state curvature manifests itself as an additional integral term in the eigenvalue problem, corresponding to the total axial stretching in the wall. The normal modes are neutrally stable at leading order, and their slow growth or decay is determined by considering the global energy budget of the system. The stability of the system can be expressed in terms of a critical Reynolds number of the mean flow through the channel. We explain the behavior of the system as two key dimensionless parameters F and K are varied. These quantify the dimensionless axial tension and base-state curvature effects, respectively. Numerical simulations are used to identify distinct flow regimes in parameter space, which we explore further in detail using asymptotic analysis. This reveals that at large K, i.e., strong base-state curvature effects, the leading-order axial profiles of the modes are forced to adjust in order to eliminate the need for significant stretching in the wall. This has the effect of stabilizing both the fundamental and, to a lesser extent, the first harmonic modes, which results in the first harmonic becoming the most unstable mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,"Herein, the production of nonpercolative hybrid insulating films with adjustable dielectric constant at low filler fractions is reported. These films might be useful to shape field distributions in passivation stacks or as dielectrics in passive components of integrated circuits such as capacitors. It is shown how such a system can be realized with commercially available materials and simple tools and how they can be significantly improved by adapting the processing techniques applied. The improved electric and dielectric properties are related to changes in the microstructure of the films caused by the different processing conditions. The experiments show that the films possess sufficiently stable properties from room temperature up to 150 degrees C, which enable them to be used in devices. Finally, a model is proposed for the dielectric breakdown of the films that gives a direction for the further improvement of such material systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

63,"In this paper, we generate some new classes of entangled states of a bimodal Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a pair of tunnel-coupled BEC, in the presence of two- and three-body elastic as well as mode-exchange collisions. The Hamiltonian of the considered system is very complicated, moreover, it can be fortunately transformed into a simple form using a two-mode displacement operator. After introducing the general form of the time evolved state, various classes of entangled states are generated. Indeed, the influence of different orders of tunneling strengths on the generated entangled states has been studied. Depending on the tunneling strength constants, two-, three-and four-partite entangled states are generated, all of which are superposition states of macroscopic number of BEC atoms. Considering three-particle collision dramatically changes the generated entangled states. Moreover, in particular cases, the resulted states are non-entangled. Also, we show that tunneling and collisional interactions can be manipulated to generate a pair of atomic entangled coherent states (quasi-Bell states). In addition, it is observed that the degree of entanglement for two-partite entangled states can be tuned via the number of BEC atoms, i.e. the corresponding concurrences tend to their maximum value by increasing the atoms in both modes of system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

65,"Many body quantum dynamics of phonons is steadily developed by considering the various effects of anharmonicities, defects (consider as doping or impurity concentration) and electron-phonon interactions in model Hamiltonian (instead of BCS Hamiltonian) for a high-temperature superconductor (HTS). This enables to obtain the expressions for the renormalized phonon spectrum, the renormalized phonon density of states (RPDOS). The RPDOS can be resolved into diagonal and nondiagonal parts where the nondiagonal component is found highly impurity-dependent. Considering the suitable Born-Mayer- Huggins (BMH) interaction potential, the renormalized phonon spectrum, RPDOS and generalized phonon density of states (GPDOS) of the La2-xSrxCuO4 layered superconductor have been numerically analyzed and it was found that these quantities depend on doping concentration, anharmonicities, and temperature. The results are compared with the inelastic neutron scattering experimental data of GPDOS for La2-xSrxCuO4 and are found in good agreement. The ratio of deviation in GPDOS to GPDOS at critical temperature (T-c = 37.5 K) shows the implicit difference at T-(55 K) > T-c > T-(20 K). The impact of defects, anharmonicities, and electron-phonon interactions in the cuprate superconductors virtually modify the scenario of GPDOS and affirm a large number of exotic peaks in the spectrum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"In recent years, with the development of mesoscopic physics and nanoelectronics, the research on noise and testing technology of electronic components has been developed. It is well known that noise can characterize the transmission characteristics of carriers in nanoscale electronic components. With the continuous shrinking of the device size, the carrier transport of nanoscale MOSFET devices has been gradually transformed from the traditional drift-diffusion to become the quasi-ballistic or ballistic transport, and its current noise contains granular and thermal noise. The paper by Jeon et al. [The first observation of shot noise characteristics in 10-nm scale MOSFETs, in Proc. 2009 Symp. VLSI Technology (IEEE, Honolulu, 2009), pp. 48-49] presents the variation relation of 20 nm MOSFET current noise with source-drain current and voltage, and its current noise characteristic is between thermal noise and shot noise, so 20 nm MOSFET current noise is shot noise and thermal noise. The paper by Navid et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 101 (2007) 124501] shows through simulation that the 60 nm MOSFET current noise is suppressed shot noise and thermal noise. At present, the current noise has seriously affected the basic performance of the device, thus the circuit cannot work normally. Therefore, it is necessary to study the generation mechanism and characteristics of current noise in electronic components so as to suppress device noise, which can not only realize the reduction of device noise, but also play a positive role in the work-efficiency, life-span and reliability of electronic components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that the work function improves after the modification of the electrode material, the space charge accumulation in LDPE decreases, and the trap level of the polymer reduces. Because of the oxygen vacancies, the titanium coating electrode has significant suppression on the charge injection in LDPE under 30 kV/mm and the tungsten shows excellent inhibition under 70 kV/mm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"We have investigated Raman spectra of the G and 2D lines of a single-layer graphene (SLG) with metallic contacts. The shift of the G and 2D lines is correlated to two different factors. Before performing annealing treatment or annealing under low temperature, the electron transfer on graphene surface is dominated by nonuniform strain effect. As the annealing treatment is enhanced, however, a suitable annealing treatment can eliminate the nonuniform strain effect where the relative work function (WF) between graphene and metal becomes a main factor to determine electronic transfer. Moreover, it is confirmed that the optimized annealing treatment can also decrease effectively the structural defect and induced disorder in graphene due to metallic contacts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the probe limit, we obtain bounds on the scalar field frequency. Below this bound, stationary hairy stars are expected to suffer from nonlinear instabilities under massless field perturbations. In other words, we prove that stationary scalar hairy stars are unstable for scalar fields with small frequency. (C) 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"We describe the family of normalizable solutions in linearized open string field theory, defined by Q Psi(0) = 0(Q is BRST charge) understood in the sense << Q Psi(0), Phi >> = 0 for an arbitrary string field Phi. The solutions depend on shifted partition numbers and are parametrized in terms of values of zeta-function at pairs of positive numbers greater than 2. We argue that the operators, defined by these solutions, create mixed quantum-mechanical states by acting on the vacuum (as opposed to standard vertex operators, creating the pure states with definite masses and spins).

71,"Production of black holes has been discussed in a variety of extensions of the Standard Model, and related bounds have been established from data taken at the Large Hadron Collider. We show that, if the Higgs particle has a fully gravitational content via the equivalence principle, enhanced cross-sections of black holes at colliders should be expected within the Standard Model itself. The case of black hole production by precision measurements at electron colliders is discussed. The Coulomb repulsion strongly suppresses the related cross-section with respect to the one based on the hoop conjecture, making the possible production of black holes still unfeasible with current beam technology. At the same time, this suggests the reanalysis of the bounds, based on the hoop conjecture, already determined in hadronic collisions for extra-dimensional models. (C) 2019 The Authors.

73,"We prove that, at the mini superspace level, and for an arbitrary Brans-Dicke parameter, one cannot tell traditional Einstein-Hilbert gravity from local scale invariant Weyl-Dirac gravity. Both quantum mechanical cosmologies are governed by the one and the same time-independent single-variable Hartle-Hawking wave function. It is only that its original argument, the cosmic scale factor a, is replaced by alpha phi (phi being the dilaton field) to form a Dirac in-scalar. The Weyl vector enters quantum cosmology only in the presence of an extra dimension, where its fifth component, serving as a 4-dim Kaluza-Klein in-scalar, governs the near Big Bang behavior of the wave function. The case of a constant Kaluza-Klein in-radius is discussed in some detail. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The glass transition of bulk water might occur at 210 K [Oguni et al., T. Phys. Chem. B 115 (2011) 14023] but it was recently proposed that the glass transition of water could happen around 121 K [C.

The formulas are valid for liquid and gaseous media, as well as for elastic isotropic media. Advantages of these formulas are their relative clarity compared with the well-known and commonly accepted formulas, as well as a possibility to pass over from one scattering problem to another by simply replacing the corresponding wave numbers. Despite the well-known methods which are used in the calculations and rather have a methodical character, we manage to find a new type of surface waves at the interface of elastic media. These waves are characterized either by ratios of the wave numbers of transverse waves and densities, or by only the wave numbers of longitudinal waves and the ratio of the densities of media.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An exact analytic solution for the reduced dynamics of a two-level system in this model has been obtained. It is shown that the initial correlations can improve the coherence in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. Moreover, the performance of weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal can further enhance the coherence. Remarkably, the system's coherence approach to a steady value in the long time limit. This phenomenon of ""coherence trapping"" originates from the fact that the quantum measurement reversal functions as a coherent driving and retrieves the coherence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

90,"The focus of this study is to numerically reproduce the asynchronous oscillations of an impinging slot jet on a concave surface experimental configuration. A Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) numerical simulation was realised at a Reynolds number of with respect to the slot jet width. The topological characteristics of the flow were also analyzed using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method. It was therefore possible to propose a sequence of flow topologies (four distinct flow states) during the changeover phenomenon of the impinging slot jet. The results show that the asynchronous phenomenon of the impinging slot jet seems to be related to the transitional characteristics of the jet flow. The flow topology of the most stable and energetic states (top and bottom jet flow states) creates a pressure imbalance inside the area of interest, resulting in the appearance of two transitional flow states. For the top or bottom impinging jet flow states, the jet remains in a relatively stationary position and the flow in the area of interest is quasi-two-dimensional. However, during the rapid changeover of the jet between these two states, small vortex structures prevail inside the area of interest for the centre jet states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

92,"When operating a cathodic arc discharge in quiescent air, a high-speed jet of gas is produced near the cathode, known as the cathodic arc jet (CAJ). To obtain time resolved measurements of the CAJ propagation, a high-resolution spatial spectroscopy technique was implemented. Measurement results show a weak dependence on discharge current magnitude. The CAJ propagation corresponds well with a Taylor-Sedov blast-wave model, with an explosive yield similar to 0.5% of the arc energy. At 0.25 mu s after discharge ignition the instantaneous speed of the CAJ is similar to 5 km s(-1) and after 1 mu s the CAJ slows to a sonic speed. These results imply that the CAJ is effective for flow manipulation when operated at single pulse durations of several micro-seconds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"The intermittency of an incompressible passive vector convected by homogeneous isotropic turbulence is studied by comparison with that of the velocity and passive scalar. This is used to explore the physics underlying the differences in statistical properties between the velocity vector and passive scalar. Direct numerical simulations with grid points of 1024(3) and two types of forcing method are performed at Reynolds numbers of Re-lambda similar to 200, 300, and 400. It is found that the probability density function (PDF) of the passive vector is wider than Gaussian. The PDFs of the logarithm of the dissipation rates of the kinetic energy, for the velocity and passive vector, are close to each other and well approximated by the log-normal distribution. Unlike the pressure PDF, which is negatively skewed, the PDF for the pseudopressure P(q) is nearly symmetric. Visualization results show that the pseudoenstrophy Omega(w) for the passive vector is close to sheetlike, similar to the case of the passive scalar, while the enstrophy is tubelike. The scaling exponents of the passive vector moments are found to be anomalous, nonuniversal at high order, and intermediate between the velocity and passive scalar for the order p >= 4. The pseudopressure tends to reduce the extreme events, while the linearity of the fundamental equation leads to stronger intermittency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"High-frequency sky wave detection equipment must rely on the ionosphere as the propagation medium in the early warning and sea state remote sensing tasks. The ionosphere is time-varying and unstable, which will change the characteristics of the high-frequency electromagnetic wave propagating through it, resulting in the broadening of the echo spectrum, thus seriously affecting the detection of targets and the inversion of sea state parameters. The reason and mechanism of the echo spectrum expansion are analyzed in detail from the dispersion effect, phase contamination and multimode propagation. The bandwidth of the dispersion effect is different from that of the high frequency detection equipment. When the bandwidth of the sky wave equipment is 3-30 MHz, the bandwidths of the dispersion effect are 41.6-57.4 kHz and 0.17-10.8 MHz. The multi-quasiparabolic ionospheric model is used to discuss the frequency selection measures to avoid multimode propagation. The modulation process of ionospheric contamination to echo is studied theoretically. It is shown that the nonlinear phase contamination will cause the energy of echo to diffuse in frequency domain and to be unable to accumulate. To solve the problem of phase contamination which is difficult to solve in practice, a contamination correction method without estimating the instantaneous frequency of the echo is proposed. In the method the consistency principle of signal subspace and signal frequency vector expansion space is used, and therefore the phase contamination term can be well estimated. Based on the real data, the contamination correction results from the proposed method, phase gradient autofocus method, maximum entropy spectral analysis method and time-frequency processing method are given. The results show that the new method is a better method and can effectively sharpen the broadened echo spectrum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"For the spreading of thin and free film of a partially wetting liquid with insoluble surfactant under the influence of surface acoustic wave, the dimensionless evolution equations governing the spreading dynamics are derived. The evolution equations contain the film thickness and the surface concentration of insoluble surfactant. Assuming that the thickness of the thin film is much smaller than the wavelength of sound in the liquid, the sound leaking off the surface acoustic wave cannot be sustained in the liquid film, and the acoustic radiation pressure and attenuation of the acoustic wave in the solid are both weak. Then the films spreading under different physical mechanisms are observed by numerical simulation. The results show that the surface acoustic wave drives the liquid film to spread and move. When the capillary stress is weak and the liquid film spreading is mainly controlled by the drift induced by surface acoustic wave, the spreading process consists of rapid spreading stage and balancing stage, and the Marangoni effect caused by uneven distribution of surfactant makes the liquid film spread faster in the first stage. When the capillary stress and the drift jointly dominate film spreading, the spreading process contains three stages, i.e. spreading stage, contracting stage and balancing stage. The effect of surfactant accelerates the spreading process, but the existence of contracting stage makes it take longer for the film to reach equilibrium. In addition, the disjoining pressure used in this paper promotes the liquid film spreading, as well as the Marangoni effect. As the correlation coefficient between disjoining pressure and surfactant concentration, a, and the Marangoni number, M, increase, the maximum thickness and the spreading radius of liquid film change faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"In this paper, we study the second harmonic generation (SHG) from the stero-stacked meta-molecules consisting of two vertically stacked split ring resonators (SRRs) that resonate at the fundamental wavelength. When pumped by the linearly polarized incident wave with the electric field direction along one of the SRRs' arms, the meta-molecules emit the SHG that can have two non-zero orthogonal electric field components, provided that the top SRR and the bottom SRR are not arranged in mutually parallel or anti-parallel manner. Due to the strong coupling between the two SRRs, the plasmonic properties of the stero-stacked meta-molecules could be tuned by varying the twist angle between the two SRRs. In this process, we demonstrate that the amplitudes of the two orthogonal SHG field components, and the phase difference between these two components can be varied with changing the twist angle between two SRRs. Based on the concept of the light polarization, different polarization states can be achieved by changing the differences in phase and amplitude between the orthogonal field components. Therefore, the twist angle dependent amplitudes of and phase difference between two orthogonal SHG field components can be used to manipulate the polarization states of the emitted SHG. For the stero-stacked meta-molecules with a fixed twist angle of 60 degrees, elliptically, near-circularly andnear-linearly polarized SHG emission can be obtained at different fundamental wavelengths. In addition, for the fundamental wave with a fixed wavelength of 1500 nm, the stero-stacked meta-molecules with different twist angles are demonstrated to be able to emit SHG with elliptical andnear-linear polarization states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown that thermal annealing at the temperature of healing defects does not change the structure of both kinds of the investigated pseudo spin valves and improves magnetoresistance. The high-temperature annealing at 750 K leads to the formation disordered solid solution Ag(Co) based on fcc-Ag lattice and affects not only the magnetoresistive curve shape in perpendicular orientation of the magnetic field but also its sign in the case of Co(5)/Ag(d(Ag))/Py(5)/Sub pseudo spin valve.

98,"Wolf-Rayet stars (WR stars) were discovered by French astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet in 1867. The Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descents of the most massive, extremely hot (temperatures up to 200000 K) and very luminous (10(5) L-circle dot - 10(6) L-circle dot) O stars, with 25M(circle dot) - 30M(circle dot) solar mass for solar metallicity. The WR stars possess very strong stellar winds, which have velocities up to 3000 km/s and wind mass loss rate 10(-5) M-circle dot a year. These winds are observed in the broad emission line profiles (sometimes, even P-Cygni profiles) of WR spectra in the optical and UV range. Actually, these winds are so strong that they can peel the star and convert it into a nude nucleus without envelope. It has been found that three bright galactic stars located at Cygnus region have broad strong emission bands, rather than absorptions lines, superposed on the typical continuum of hot stars. In 1930 Beals correctly identified these features as emission lines produced by high ionized elements such as helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The physical factors which can affect the evolution of WR stars are explored in this paper. These physical factors include stellar mass, initial velocities, orbital periods, metallicities, etc. According to the equations for angular momentum transfer and chemical element diffusion, we can ascertain how these physical factors influence the evolution of WR stars and the mixing of chemical elements in WR stars. The result indicates that massive stars with high initial velocities and metallicities have strong stellar winds and be prone to producing WR stars. In contrast with the counterpart with high metallicities, it is hard for the single star with low metallicity to generate WR star due to weak wind. However, the star with very high initial velocity and low metallicity can form chemical homogenious evolution. The star has an enlarged convective core and a very thin hydrogen envelope and it can also generate WR star. The component in the binary system with short orbital period can transfer mass to the companion star through Roche lobe overflow, and this physical process can produce WR star under the condition of low metallicity. Furthermore, mass removal due to Roche lobe overflow reduces the temperature of stellar convective core and rate of nuclear reaction. It is shown that mass metallicities of chemical elements including He-4, C-12, F-19, Ne-22, Na-23, Mg-25 in the primary star are higher than those in the single stars, whereas mass metallicities of chemical elements including H-1, N-14, O-16, Ne-20, and Al-26 are lower than those in the single counterparts. In a word, the conditions for massive stars with high initial velocities and metallicities in the binary system with short orbital period favor the formation of WR stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"Establishing a universal model to characterize the relationship between light rays and optical waves is of great significance in optics. The ray model provides us with an intuitive way to study the propagation of beams as well as their interaction between objects. Traditional ray model is based on the normal of a beam wave front. The normal vector is defined as the direction of ray. However, it fails to describe the relationship between light ray and optical wave in the neighborhood of focus or caustic lines/surface since light ray in those regions are no longer perpendicular to the wavefront. In this work, the ray model of a light beam is built according to its Fourier angular spectrum, where the positions of rays can be determined by the gradient of the phase of the Fourier angular spectrum. On the other hand, the Fourier angular spectrum of a light beam can be reconstructed through the ray model. Using Fourier angular spectra, we construct the ray model of two typical beams including the Airy beam and the Cusp beam. It is hard to construct ray model directly from the optical field of these beams. In this ray model, the information about ray including direction and position involves the propagation properties of light beams such as self-accelerating. In addition, we demonstrate that the optical field of the focused plane wave can be reconstructed by the ray model in Fourier regime, and the optical field in spatial domain can be obtained by inverse Fourier transform. Simulation results are consistent with the results from Debye's method. Finally, the high-dimensional ray model of light beams is elaborated in both spatial and spectral regime. Combined with focused plane wave, Airy beam and rays in quadratic gradient-index waveguide, our results show that the ray model actually carries the information about optical field in both spatial and Fourier domain. Actually, the traditional ray model is just a spatial projection of the high-dimensional ray model. Hence, when traditional ray model fails at the focus or caustic lines/surface, it is able to obtain the spectrum of the corresponding optical field from the Fourier domain, and then obtain the field distribution in spatial domain by inverse Fourier transform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
