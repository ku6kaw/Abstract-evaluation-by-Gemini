J,"Xu, C; Hui, PM",Emergence of cooperation in finite populations under biased selection,"We study the effects of biased selection on evolutionary games in finite populations. Biased selection is induced by including a number of invariant agents, who do not evolve, into an otherwise competing and evolving population. The invariant agents react differently when they encounter different types of variant agents, helping the cooperators to attain a higher payoff than the defectors by a difference d. The probability of a single cooperator invading and taking over a population of all defectors is evaluated based on the Moran process. When M invariant agents are introduced into the evolving population of size N, their presence helps promote the replacement of defectors by cooperators, in comparison with the case of unbiased selection with M = 0. While the prisoner's dilemma cannot sustain a cooperative population without the invariant agents, it is possible for cooperation to emerge with biased selection. We show that for a given N (M), there is a threshold of M (N) above (below) which an initial population of all defectors evolve into one of all cooperators. The dependence of the threshold on the game's payoffs, intensity of selection, and the values of M and d is studied. Beyond the prisoner's dilemma, biased selection also promotes cooperation in a bigger part of payoff parameter space corresponding to other types of games. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Xu, H; Ouyang, JM; Wang, SW; Liu, Y; Sun, X",Impact of atmospheric ionization by delayed radiation from high-altitude nuclear explosions on radio communication,"In this study, we investigated the motion, shape, and delayed radiation intensity of a radioactive cloud by establishing a volume-source model of delayed radiation after high-altitude nuclear explosions. Then, the spatial distribution of electron number density at different moments on the north side of the explosion point generated by delayed gamma-rays and delayed beta-rays from the radioactive cloud under the influence of the geomagnetic field was calculated by solving chemical reaction kinetics equations. The impact of radio communication in the different frequency bands on the process of atmospheric ionization was also studied. The numerical results of the high-altitude nuclear explosion (120 km high and with a 1 megaton equivalent at 40 degrees N latitude) indicated that the peak of electron number density ionized delayed gamma-rays is located at a height of approximately 100 km and that of electron number density ionized delayed beta-rays is about 90 km high. After 1 min of explosion, the radio communication in the medium frequency (MF) and high-frequency (HF) bands was completely interrupted, and the energy attenuation of the radio wave in the very high-frequency (VHF) band was extremely high. Five minutes later, the VHF radio communication was basically restored, but the energy attenuation in the HF band was still high. After 30 min, the VHF radio communication returned to normal, but its influence on the HF and MF radio communication continued.",10.1007/s41365-019-0703-2,1,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,

This makes it possible to determine properties of molecules, predict the correct arrangement of protein chains, find the best molecular docking for complex formation, verify hypotheses concerning the protein design, and solve other problems arising in modern drug development. In the case of low-molecular compounds (consisting of less than 250 atoms), the problem of finding the geometry that minimizes the energy function is well studied. The minimization of macromolecules (in particular, proteins) consisting of tens of thousands of atoms is more difficult. However, a distinctive feature of statements of these problems is that initial approximations that are close to the solution are often available. Therefore, the original problem can be formulated as a problem of nonconvex optimization in the space of about variables. The complexity of computing the function and its gradient is quadratic in the number variables. A comparative analysis of gradient-free methods with gradient-type methods (gradient descent, fast gradient descent, conjugate gradient, and quasi-Newton methods) in their GPU implementations is carried out.",10.1134/S0965542519120030,3,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no

In this paper, a novel multiplier-free maximum-a-posteriori-probability (MAP) detection scheme is proposed and verified in dual-polarization (DP) 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) Nyquist-WDM systems. Based on the innovative technique of approximate calculation of Euclidean distance, the competitive performance is obtained in terms of pattern-dependent impairments mitigation. Besides, the computational complexity (CC) is drastically reduced to about 34%, as the multiplier of the proposed MAP detection is completely removed. Comprehensive simulation results of triple-carrier Nyquist DP 16-QAM demonstrate that the MAP scheme could effectively mitigate the tight filtering and fiber nonlinearity impairments with much lower CC, i.e., achieve desirable SE and nonlinearity tolerance in long-haul transmissions. In addition, a 1.1 dB reduction of the required OSNR and 2.6 dB launch power range extension are observed in the triple-carrier 480 Gb/s Nyquist DP 16-QAM back-to-back and 700 km transmission experiments, respectively.

J,"Zhang, P",Study on EEBS for linewidth imaging by a Monte Carlo method,"A systematic analysis about the influences of electron beam focusing on scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging for silicon (Si) trapezoidal lines was performed based on a sophisticated Monte Carlo (MC) simulation program. It was found that the focus position and the aperture angle highly affect the final quality of SEM imaging. The effective electron beam shape (EEBS) is hence suggested as the broadening function to overcome this issue for theoretical analysis, rather than the widely-used Gaussian profile. However, EEBS is hardly acquired due to it strongly depends on both the sample topography and the electron beam focusing condition, which make it is impossible to be applied in practical analysis. An approach is proposed to find a best-fit traditional Gaussian profile, which can optimally replace the EEBS in the case of the same sample structure and experimental condition for establishing a database of the parameter in traditional Gaussian profile. Experimenters will benefit from this database to obtain true line-scan profiles for accurate gate linewidth measurement.

We found that the carrier lifetime and implied open-circuit voltage (iV(oc)) increased as the ozone concentration increased in the as-deposited condition. Although the passivation performance after annealing also improved and had a maximum value in the low ozone concentration region (<250 g/Nm(3), 17 wt%), it showed a reverse trend compared to the as-deposited sample in the high ozone concentration region (>250 g/ Nm(3)) as the ozone concentration increased. The maximum values of carrier lifetime and iV(oc) obtained in the low ozone concentration region are 1.4 ms and 656 mV, respectively. The improved values in the low ozone concentration region are attributed to a decrease in carbon and increase in hydrogen at the Al2O3/Si interface after forming gas annealing.

Although the presence of concentration of calcium ions is known to work as a trigger for the Cx functionality, the structural changes induced by calcium binding still need to be well elucidated. In this computational study, we have explored the structural effects promoted by Ca2+ on both the wild type (Cx26WT) and on two post-translationally modified Connexin 26 (Cx26): Cx26E42-47 gamma, which contains two glutamates (E42 and E47) that are gamma-carboxylated and Cx26R75m, where a key arginine (R75) is N-monomethylated. These modified amino acids, whose forcefield parameters have been developed in this work, alter Cx26 structure around the Ca(2+)coordination site. Structural changes were assessed from the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We observed a strict relation between the chemical properties of the post-translational modifications and significantly different responses of Cx26 to Ca2+-binding, while charge-adding modifications have destabilising effects upon calcium coordination, the uncharged ones share the same structural properties of the wild-type counterpart.

The present study investigates the structural, optoelectronic and charge transport properties of non-covalent complexes formed between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and quaterthiophene (4T) by employing dispersion-corrected density functional methods. The effect of different functionals viz., B97-D, B3LYP-GD3 and omega B97X-D on the properties of endo- and exohedral complexes is examined. The endohedral complex (4T@CNT) is found to be energetically more stable than the exohedral one (4T-CNT). Electronic properties such as the ionization energy, electron affinity and energy gap between the frontier molecular orbitals of the CNT are not significantly changed by the adsorption or the encapsulation of 4T. Contrary to the p-type characteristics of 4T, its complexes formed with CNTs exhibit n-type characteristics due to the higher electron mobility than the hole mobility. Among the endo- and exohedral complexes, the former one shows the highest electron mobility of 3.79 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The absorption properties of all the systems were studied by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). It is found that the complexes undergo several charge transfer transitions in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Here, the energetics and migration properties of Zn-i have been studied in ion implanted ZnO using a new approach based on the Li marker diffusion. Specifically, ZnO single crystals were implanted with 3.2 keV/amu B and BF2 ions and the release of Zn-i from the implanted regions during annealing was correlated with the advance of the characteristic Li depleted region into the bulk of the samples. Using this methodology, we calculate the activation energy of 1.45 eV to govern the process for B implants. Assuming that the migration energy of Zn-i to be of similar to 0.6 eV, as discussed previously in literature, a barrier for releasing Zn-i from the implanted region may be estimated as similar to 0.8-0.9 eV. Meanwhile, in the BF2 implanted samples, the migration of Zn-i is less efficient, as interpreted from the Li redistribution features in these samples; in particular, it is argued that Zn-i may be trapped by defect complexes related to the presence of F.",10.1088/1361-6463/ab3eab,32,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

The main attention is paid to the highcurrent mode which is similar to the glow discharge positive column. It is found that along with the discharge in closed electron drift the ignition of additional, non-self-sustained hollow cathode discharge with electron oscillation is possible, thus considerably reducing the voltage of the closed-drift discharge. Current-voltage characteristics of the high-current discharge are measured for these conditions.

In this paper, we propose nanolayer-embedded compact pseudo-photonic crystals (PPCs) that enable strong interaction between ultrathin nanolayers and photonic crystal modes. In typical two-dimensional slab photonic crystals, the transverse-magnetic (TM) photonic crystal bandgap is not well formed, making it difficult to operate the TM photonic crystal waveguide modes. However, by utilizing the low-frequency TM PPC bands, a long propagation TM waveguide mode, a slow TM waveguide mode, and a TM photonic bandgap are all readily available. In particular, the insertion of a nanometer-thick low-refractive-index layer in the vertical center of TM PPC waveguide can localize the electric fields tightly in nanometer space, causing strong field interaction with the inserted nanolayer material. Using the TM slow light near PPC band edges, field interaction with the nanolayer is significantly enhanced. We can also realize nanolayer-embedded high-quality-factor (Q-factor > 10(4)) PPC cavities using the TM PPC bandgap. We believe that the proposed TM PPCs will play an important role in the strong interaction of ultrathin nanolayer materials with photonic crystal modes.",10.1088/1361-6528/ab3d74,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The corresponding second- and third-order renormalized moments of the longitudinal velocity gradient and the resulting skewness values are found to depend on the Reynolds number in nontrivial fashions. For intermediate and moderately high Reynolds numbers, the skewness value does not exhibit any scaling behavior with respect to the Reynolds number. Instead, the skewness value remains bounded for any Reynolds number and it approaches a constant value for infinitely high Reynolds numbers. In the same scheme, we also incorporate another interpolation function between the production and inertial ranges coming from energy balance equation and inputs from renormalization-group analysis. We find exact agreement between the asymptotic values of skewness at high Reynolds numbers while the skewness values are in the same neighborhood in the finite Reynolds number (non-universal) regime.",10.1088/1751-8121/ab4ca9,57,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes

J,"Fang, JS; Yu, KY; Chen, ST; Cheng, YL; Wang, YS; Chen, GS",Reliability Enhancement of Copper/Porous SiOCH Metallization Systems Using Nitrogen Stuffing and Bias-Filter Sputter Deposited Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Barrier,"A robust ultrathin barrier to retard Cu diffusion is needed for fabricating state-of-the-art Cu interconnects associated with porous dielectric materials. Gas stuffing of grain boundaries is widely used to strengthen conventional polycrystalline TiN and TaN barriers. Alternatively, a self-formed MnOx layer derived typically from sputter-deposited Cu(Mn) alloy film is a viable barrier. However, vacuum plasma generated during Cu(Mn) deposition tends to damage porous dielectric materials. Thus, this study combines the two approaches, proposing a strategy to enhance reliability of copper/porous carbon-doped organosilica (p-SiOCH) metallization systems using nitrogen stuffed p-SiOCH and bias-filter sputter deposited Mn2O3. An ultrathin (1-4 nm) Mn2O3 film, deposited by reactive sputtering with a biased-filter mechanism on nitrogen-stuffed p-SiOCH (p-SiOCH(N)), was proposed as a barrier layer to prevent Cu from diffusion. Electrical properties of the samples were evaluated by capacitance-voltage and current density-electric field measurements. The bias-filter mechanism eliminated plasma damage of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. Furthermore, stabilization annealing converted Mn2O3 to Mn2O3-x(N) (manganese sub-oxynitride), giving the highest barrier performance for the Cu metallization layer, while maintaining the pristine dielectric properties of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. The Cu/Mn2O3-x(N)/p-SiOCH(N) structure also exhibited extremely low leakage currents after reliability tests, indicting their applicability to Cu metallization.

And with the structural feature size of the ILGP decreasing from tens of microns to microns and even sub-microns, the diffraction dispersion phenomenon will inevitably become a prominent problem in research and design of non-dispersion elements. Nevertheless, under the broadband light source illumination, the analysis of the dispersion characteristic of diffraction spectrum of the microstructure array has not been reported in detail. Therefore a theoretical model of micro-optical element with a typical one-dimensional rectangular phase grating (RPG) and a widely used white LED source is established in this paper. The dispersion characteristic of the diffraction spectrum is studied, that is, with the increase of period of the RGP or the cone angle of incident beam, the dispersion of diffraction spectrum weakens. Dispersion parameter C and its formula are proposed, which can precisely measure the chromatic dispersion degree of the diffraction spectrum. Furthermore, the boundary criterion point of non-dispersion C = 0.3 is given explicitly. It is explored that no matter whether the cone angle of incident beam or the RPG period increases, the non-dispersion output light can be obtained only by matching the two parameters to make the dispersion parameter C less than 0.3. Then an RPG sample, of which the structural parameters are consistent with the designed ones, is fabricated by using micro-nano processing technology. By changing the cone angle of incident beam, the luminance and the chromaticity coordinates of the diffraction beam are tested. The analyses of the test results of the fabricated RPG sample show that the spectrum dispersion regularity is in accord with the theoretical analysis. The consistency verifies the correctness of dispersion parameter C, its formula and the non-dispersion boundary criterion point.

J,"Yan, J; Wei, MM; Xing, YX",Dephasing effect of quantum spin topological states in HgTe/CdTe quantum well,"HgTe/CdTe quantum well is a typical two dimensional topological material which supports the helical edge states and quantum spin Hall effect that is imposing in applying of spin electronic devices. The special plateau valued with 0.25 h/e(2) of nonlocal resistance in H-shaped four terminal devices can be used as the fingerprint of quantum spin Hall effect. Based on the HgTe/CdTe quantum well, with the aid of nonequilibrium Green's function theory and multi-terminal Landauer-Biittiker formula, we calculate the nonlocal resistance and study the dephasing effect of spin topological states in the presence of exchange field and external magnetic field. It is found the dephasing processes play a role completely different from exchange field and external magnetic field. The latter destroy time reversal symmetry and change the width and relative position of topological gap, but do not influent the topological stability of helical edge states. In the contrary, dephasing processes don't change the width and relative position, however, they broke the topological stability. We consider two kinds of dephasing: normal dephasing and spin dephasing. In the first kind, the carriers lose only the phase memory while maintaining the spin memory. In the second kind, the carriers lose both phase and spin memories. Because of the spin locking properties, normal dephasing almost have no influence on the helical edge states. While the spin dephasing will induce spin flip backscattering and finally destroy helical edge states seriously.",10.7498/aps.68.20191072,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Zhang, BF; Zhu, K; Wu, H; Hu, HF; Shen, Z; Xu, J",Numerical study of metallic semiconductor nanolasers with double-concave cavity structures,"Metallic semiconductor nanolaser, as an ultra-small light source, has been increasingly attractive to researchers in last decade. It can have wide potential applications such as in photonic integrated circuits, on-chip interconnect, optical communications,etc. One obstacle to miniaturization of the laser size is that the loss increases rapidly with the cavity volume decreasing. In previous studies, a type of Fabry-Perot cavity with capsule-shaped structure was investigated and demonstrated both numerically and experimentally, showing that its cavity loss is reduced dramatically in contrast to the scenario of conventional rectangular cavities. However, when the cavity size is reduced down to nanoscale, capsule-shaped structure surfers high loss. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, a novel type of double-concave cavity structure for metallic semiconductor nanolaser in a 1.55 mu m wavelength range is proposed and numerically studied. The proposed structure consists of InGaAs/InP waveguide structure encapsulated by metallic clad, and has a cylindrical reflection end face and concave curved sidewalls. The cylindrical reflection end face can push the resonant mode into the cavity center and reduce the optical field overlap with metallic sidewalls, which can reduce the metallic loss. The curved-sidewalls topologically reduce the electric field component perpendicular to the sidewalls, and thus reducing the plasmonic loss. By optimizing the waist width of the double-concave cavity structure, the radiation loss can be effectively reduced, resulting in the improvement of cavity quality factor and the decrease of threshold current. Finite-difference time-domain simulations are conducted to investigate the properties of the proposed cavity structures such as resonant mode distribution, cavity quality factor, confinement factor, threshold gain and threshold current in this paper. The numerical results show that the double-concave cavity laser with cavity volume as small as 0.258 lambda(3) increases 24.8% of cavity quality factor and reduces 67.5% of threshold current, compared with the conventional capsule-shaped one, demonstrating an effective improvement of metallic nanolaser. With those advantages, the proposed structure can be used for realizing the ultra-small metallic semiconductor nanolasers and relevant applications.",10.7498/aps.68.20190972,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Zhang, ZH; Yu, XD; Li, HP; Han, K",Effect of alkane chain length on tribological properties of straight chain alkane liquid film,"How to overcome the friction between the micro components has become a key point of the successful operation of the micro/nano-electric mechanical systems. The understanding of the friction mechanism of the alkane liquid film confined between two substrates is important when the friction law on a macro/nano scale is not applicable. In this work, the molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the effect of the chain length on the friction properties of the liquid films that are confined between two golden substrates. There are seven pure alkane liquid films that are composed of one molecule CnH2n + (2)(n = 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18), and six mixed alkane liquid films that are composed of two molecules C6H14/CnH2n + (2)(n = 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) with a ratio of 1:1. The results show that the friction force and the coefficient of friction of pure alkane liquid films both increase as the chain length increases when the carbon atom number is less than 12, whereas the friction property keeps stable when the carbon atom number of the alkane molecule is greater than 10 and the pure hexadecane liquid film has the largest friction force. In the mixed films, the addition of short chain alkane molecules can strengthen the friction, and the hexane/dodecane mixed film has the maximum friction force. The short chain molecule dilutes the C8H18 film and C10H22 film which cause the friction force to decrease. During the sliding progress, the formation of solid-like high density-packet layers is the main reason for the friction reduction. When no solid-like layer or just one solid-like layer is formed at the interface of golden base, the liquid alkane film is liquid-like and its viscosity becomes much larger than that in the normal state, which leads to high friction force. The short chain molecules reduce the density of the solid-like layers, which causes the film to transform from solid-like state to liquid state, thus resulting in the increase of friction. The friction property mainly depends on the layered structure, and the interaction between the golden surface and liquid film contributes to the friction. This study helps to understand the friction mechanism of ultra-thin liquid films.",10.7498/aps.68.20190740,79,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

J,"DeGracia, DJ; Taha, D; Anggraini, FT; Huang, ZF",Nonautonomous dynamics of acute cell injury,"Medical conditions due to acute cell injury, such as stroke and heart attack, are of tremendous impact and have attracted huge amounts of research effort. The biomedical research that seeks cures for these conditions has been dominated by a qualitative, inductive mind-set. Although the inductive approach has not been effective in developing medical treatments, it has amassed enough information to allow construction of quantitative, deductive models of acute cell injury. In this work we develop a modeling approach by extending an autonomous nonlinear dynamic theory of acute cell injury that offered new ways to conceptualize cell injury but possessed limitations that decrease its effectiveness. Here we study the global dynamics of the cell injury theory using a nonautonomous formulation. Different from the standard scenario in nonlinear dynamics that is determined by the steady state and fixed points of the model equations, in this nonautonomous model with a trivial fixed point, the system property is dominated by the transient states and the corresponding dynamic processes. The model gives rise to four qualitative types of dynamical patterns that can be mapped to the behavior of cells after clinical acute injuries. The nonautonomous theory predicts the existence of a latent stress response capacity (LSRC) possessed by injured cells. The LSRC provides a theoretical explanation of how therapies, such as hypothermia, can prevent cell death after lethal injuries.

Tunable dye lasers offer a tunable light source which cover the desired excitation wavelength range with a high spectral intensity, but their operation is often cumbersome. Herein, the design and properties of an improved dye-laser system which is based on a Q-switch pump laser are presented.

The influences of spin-flip coefficient of interdot lambda, spin-flip coefficient of intradot eta and interdot hopping coefficient t + delta(sigma) Delta t on thermospin property are discussed. As interdot hopping coefficient t is equal to energy level epsilon, the spectrum of G(s) shows Fano-like effect with epsilon variation. Antiresonance position of G(s) is almost unchanged and its width becomes narrower with epsilon increasing. Spin thermopower S-s is close to the maximum of the peak and charge thermopower S-c is equal to zero for t = epsilon. As a result, the pure spin thermopower S-s can be obtained, which means that a pure spin current may be produced by a temperature gradient in our system.

For this purpose, we study theoretically the dependence of graphene resistance on Fermi energy having in mind to compare it with experimental data where super-high mobility electrons in suspended graphene samples without chemical doping were investigated. As far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the Coulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering potentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The empty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical shortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage of the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We consider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit formulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution of this scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function of the Fermi energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results are consistent with experiment, where the resistance was measured as a function of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene. This fact gives a possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the basis of the available experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with the gate voltage controlled Fermi level position.

The measured temperature-dependent rate constants for quenching of O-2(b) by NO can be represented by the expression 5.1 x 10(26) x (T-4) x exp(1338/T). The rate constant for quenching of O-2(b) by I-2 was found to be insensitive to temperature and approximately equal to (6.3 +/- 1) x 10(-11) cm(3)/s over the range of 297-750 K.,10.1016/j.cplett.2019.136774,98,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no

While Cd0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 orders ferromagnetically at 129 K (T-C), Zn0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 displays complex antiferromagnetic order at T-N = 20 K. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in the vicinity of the magnetic transition has been estimated in terms of isothermal magnetic entropy change (Delta S-m). The maximum values of Delta S-m for Cd0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 and Zn0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 are about -4.2 J/kg K and -3.4 J/kg K respectively at 133 K and 48 K for a field change from 0 to 70 kOe. Electrical resistivity shows Mott variable range hopping behaviour below 50 K. Large positive thermoelectric power values are observed below 300 K in both Cd0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 and Zn0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4.",10.1016/j.physb.2019.08.019,99,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no
