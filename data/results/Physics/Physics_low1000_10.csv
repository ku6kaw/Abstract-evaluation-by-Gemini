J,"Som, S",Relaxation and condensation kinetics of trapped excitons at ultra-low temperatures: numerical simulation,"This work is a theoretical study of the excitons relaxation dynamics in cuprous oxide at ultra-low temperatures and within a potential trap. Exciton-phonon collisions and exciton-exciton collisions have been included as relaxation processes. Special attention is given to the thermal distribution, cooling process and the condensation of the exciton gas with high number of excitons. It has been done by solving the Boltzmann equation numerically, using MATLAB. In this work, the relaxation behaviour has been analysed for the temperatures between 0.1 and 3 K. It has been found that for the temperatures above 0.1 K the local effective temperatures are coming down to the bath temperatures, i.e. the excitons reach the local equilibrium with the lattice, but for 0.1 K it does not happen. For 3 K, the global distributions do not change at all with time, but for 0.1 K this change is significant. Maybe this thermal loss of excitons for 0.1 K is related to the Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons. Interestingly, for the temperature of 0.1 K the condensate has been formed with sufficiently high number of excitons, for the times larger than 300 ns. Also, the results have been compared with the other theoretical results.",10.1007/s12648-019-01592-7,0,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no
J,"Azam, M; Rahaman, F; Sami, M; Bhatt, JR","The ""Planckonions""","We consider a spherically symmetric stellar configuration with a density profile rho(r) = c(2)/8 pi Gr(2). This configuration satisfies the Schwarzchild black hole condition 2G M/c(2) R = 1 for every r = R. We refer to it as ""Planckonion"". The interesting thing about the Planckonion is that it has an onion-like structure. The central sphere with radius of the Planck-length L-p = root(2hG/c(3)) has one unit of the Planck mass M-p = root(ch/2G). Subsequent spherical shells of radial width L-p contain exactly one unit of M-p. We study this stellar configuration using Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and show that the equation is satisfied if pressure P(r) = -rho(r). On the geometrical side, the space component of the metric blows up at every point. The time component of the metric is zero inside the star but only in the sense of a distribution (generalized function). The Planckonions mimic some features of black holes but avoid appearance of central singularity because of the violation of null energy conditions.",10.1142/S0217732319502687,1,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Bhandari, C; Satpathy, S",Two dimensional electron gas in the δ-doped iridates with strong spin-orbit coupling: La<sub>δ</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>,"Iridates are of considerable current interest because of the strong spin-orbit coupling that leads to a variety of new phenomena. Using density-functional studies, we predict the formation of a spin-orbital entangled two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the delta-doped iridate La delta Sr2IrO4, where a single SrO layer is replaced by a LaO layer. The extra La electron resides close to the delta-doped layer, partially occupying the J(eff) = 1/2 upper Hubbard band and thereby making the interface metallic. The magnetic structure of the bulk is destroyed near the interface, with the Ir-0 layer closest to the interface becoming non-magnetic, while the next layer (Ir-1) continues to maintain the AFM structure of the bulk, but with a reduced magnetic moment. The Fermi surface consists of a hole pocket and an electron pocket, located in two different Ir layers (Ir-0 and Ir-1), with both carriers derived from the J(eff) = 1/2 upper Hubbard band. The presence of both electrons and holes at the delta-doped interface suggests unusual transport properties, leading to possible device applications.",10.1088/1361-648X/ab2f3f,2,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Brahimi, S; Bouzar, H; Lounis, S",Impact of single atomic defects and vacancies on the magnetic anisotropy energy of CoPt thin films,"The impact of surface vacancies and single adatoms on the magnetic properties of tetragonal L1(0) CoPt thin films is investigated from first principles. We consider Co and Fe single adatoms deposited on a Pt-terminated thin film while a Pt adatom is assumed to be supported by a Co-terminated film. The vacancy is injected in the top-surface layer of the films with both types of termination. After finding the most stable location of the defects, we discuss their magnetic properties tied to those of the substrate and investigate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Previous simulations (Brahimi et al 2016 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 28 496002) predicted a large out-of-plane surface MAE for the Pt-terminated CoPt films (4 meV per f.u.) in contrast to in-plane surface MAE for Co-terminated films (-1 meV per f.u.). Here, we find that the surface MAI:, is significantly modified upon the presence of the atomic defects. All investigated defects induce an in-plane MAE, which is large enough for Fe adatom and Pt vacancy to switch the surface MAE from out-of-plane to in-plane for the Pt-terminated films. Interestingly, among the investigated defects Pt vacancy has the largest effect on the MAE in contrast to Co vacancy, which induced the smallest but still significant effect. This behavior is explained in terms of the orbital moment anisotropy of the thin films.",10.1088/1361-648X/ab2ffb,3,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

Here we investigate these events, analyzing the effect of next-to-next-to-leading order parton distribution function in the total neutrino-nucleon cross section, as compared with the color dipole formalism, where saturation effects play a major role. Energy deposit profiles in the ""bangs"" are also analyzed in terms of virtual W-boson and tauon energy distributions and are found to be crucial in establishing a clear signal for gluon distribution determination at very small x. By taking the average (all flavor) neutrino flux (Phi(v) similar to E-v(-2.3)) into differential cross sections as a function of tau and W energies, we find significant deviations from pure Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi parton interactions for neutrino energies already at a few PeV. With these findings one aims at providing not only possible observables to be measured in large volume neutrino detectors in the near future, but also theoretical ways of unravelling QCD dynamics using unintegrated neutrino-nucleon cross sections in the ultrahigh-energy frontier.",10.1103/PhysRevD.100.083020,4,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,,,

The limit of the immiscibility of component elements under non-equilibrium conditions have been explored, but achieving complete miscibility and formation of single phase microstructures in eutectic alloys would be unprecedented. Here, we report that during the low-temperature ball milling that provides high energy impact, complete mixing of phases can occur in immiscible Ag-Cu eutectic alloys. From combined theoretical and experimental studies, we show that impact can produce solid solutions of Ag-Cu nanoparticles of eutectic composition.

The growth of GaN was enhanced not only from bottom c-plane, but also from the sidewall of the micron-sized patterns. In this study, KOH solution was used to etch AlN (especially sidewall AlN) for the first time. The additional etching process is very simple. It was found that KOH etching 1 min did enhance the light output power (LOP) of LED. However, with the increase of etching time to 4 min, the LOP decreased. Besides, the effect of remained AlN on GaN growth mechanism was investigated in detail. (C) The Author(s) 2019.

For the purposes of this paper, a trajectory is a sequence of coordinates in a phase space defined by an underlying hidden dynamical system. Our work is inspired by earlier work on the use of KDE to detect shipping anomalies using high-density, high-quality automated information system data as well as our own earlier work in trajectory modeling. We focus specifically on the sparse, noisy trajectory reconstruction problem in which the data are (i) sparsely sampled and (ii) subject to an imperfect observer that introduces noise.

Cheeger-Simons theory associates a rigid invariant in H2p-1( B, R/Z) to any flat connection on this bundle. Generalizing this result, Jaya Iyer (Lett Math Phys 106 (1):131-146, 2016) constructed maps H-r(D( E)) -> H2p-r-1(B, R/Z) for p > r + 1.

A three-dimensional turbulence simulation is performed, based on the reduced fluid model. The background parallel flow is applied by introducing the time independent parallel momentum source. Changing the magnitude of the momentum source, the behavior of the zonal flow is investigated. The drift wave turbulence is affected by the parallel flow, and it shows the spatial competition between turbulence modes. The spatial competition appears/disappears abruptly, depending on the intensity of the parallel momentum source. As a consequence of the transition between the turbulence state, the radial profile of the turbulence drastically changes, which leads to the change of the turbulence force to drive the zonal flow. In this way, the parallel flow indirectly affects the zonal flow through the deformation of the turbulence.

J,"Baratidevin, M; Bakhshayeshi, A; Mendi, RT",Dependence of Energy Product to the Shell Thickness in FePt/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Core/Shell Nanoparticles,"A new model is presented to calculate energy product variation for FePt/Fe3O4 core/shell in the terms of Fe3O4 shell thickness. The spins at the core/shell interface and some parts of the core volume have a random orientation due to the presence of chemical disorder created by the experimental procedures. The mentioned random effects based on the chemical disorder and intermixing of core and shell produces random interactions, which according to the presented model can behave similar to the spin glass system. Due to the existence of a competition between exchange and anisotropy energies, the coercivity field contain two parts: In the first part, the effects of exchange interactions will dominate the effects of anisotropy. As a result, this section will include low anisotropy and frustrated spins, which is coupled to neighbor particles due to the strong exchange interactions. In the second part, which is the volume part of matter, the anisotropy is higher; in this case, the spins are frozen and remain fixed so that the neighbor particles do not have much effect on them. Since the nanoscale particles have a significant value of surface to volume ratio, there will be a competition between these two parts. Energy product variations for FePt/Fe3O4 core/shell increases when coherent rotation is dominant in the core/shell system. By increasing shell thickness, coherent rotation of spins disappears and the magnetization rotation will not be uniform, which leads to a decrease in energy product. To increase the maximum product energy, we need to increase the value of coercivity which is achieved by increasing the core thickness. If we can increase the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of the core, then the coercivity and thus the maximum energy product will increase.",10.1007/s10948-019-05246-x,13,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

It is well known that large-scale fluid injection into the subsurface leads to a buildup in pressure that gradually spreads and dissipates through lateral and vertical migration of water. This dissipation can have an important feedback on the shape of the CO2 plume during injection, but the impact of vertical pressure dissipation, in particular, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of lateral and vertical pressure dissipation on the injection of CO2 into a layered aquifer system. We develop a compressible, two-phase model that couples pressure dissipation to the propagation of a CO2 gravity current. We show that our vertically integrated, sharp-interface model is capable of efficiently and accurately capturing water migration in a layered aquifer system with an arbitrary number of aquifers. We identify two limiting cases - 'no leakage' and 'strong leakage' - in which we derive analytical expressions for the water pressure field for the corresponding single-phase injection problem. We demonstrate that pressure dissipation acts to suppress the formation of an advancing CO2 tongue during injection, reducing the lateral extent of the plume. The properties of the seals and the number of aquifers determine the strength of pressure dissipation and subsequent coupling with the CO2 plume. The impact of pressure dissipation on the shape of the CO2 plume is likely to be important for storage efficiency and security.",10.1017/jfm.2019.593,22,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The size obtained (similar to 0.9 nm) is appreciably less than the diameter of carbon nanodots under study (similar to 3 nm), which indicates that the atomic groups responsible for the luminescence of carbon nanodots are nonrigidly connected with their cores and can rotate almost independently of them.",10.1080/1536383X.2019.1680977,23,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no

J,"de Matos, CJ; Tajmar, M",Gravitational wave spectrometry with a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer in space,"The possibility to use a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer to carry out gravitational waves detection and spectrometry is investigated. The noise budget of the instrument is evaluated. The basic experimental requirements are calculated. It is shown that the power and wavelength of the heralded photon source, together with the angular accuracy of the measurement of the photon polarization rotation, form the main constraints to determine the type of gravitational waves sources, which would be the target of HOM gravitational wave spectrometers. The currently available pW power heralded photon sources, with typical heralded photon frequencies in the order of 10(14) Hz (visible-UV part of the optical spectrum) are totally unsuitable, in terms of required detection time for any of the GW sources, which are presently targeted by ground and space based GW detectors. The operation of the HOM interferometer as a GW spectrometer is illustrated with a numerical model that uses the gravitational wave strain data recorded by LIGO on 14 September 2015 (GW150914 event). Assuming an angular accuracy of mu rad for the measurement of photons polarization rotation, these measurements could only be carried out with HOM interferometer's arm lengths of the order of 10.000 km (only achievable in space, if we do not use optical cavities), and by using heralded photon sources of about 1 W power, producing heralded photons with wavelengths in the radio-wave band of the electromagnetic spectrum, 10 MHz. Although the technology to produce this type of heralded photon sources is currently not available, a brief discussion of the possible implementation of a large arm HOM interferometer in space is introduced.",10.1088/1361-6382/ab42df,26,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

We adopt flavor-dependent quark imaginary chemical potentials, namely, (mu(u), mu(d), mu(s))/iT = (theta - 2 pi C/3, theta,theta + 2 pi C/3) with C is an element of [0, 1]. The RW periodicity is guaranteed and the center symmetry of Z(3)-QCD is explicitly broken when C not equal 1 and/or quark masses are nondegenerate. For N-f = 3 and C not equal 1, the RW transition occurs at theta = theta(RW) = (2k + 1)pi/3(k is an element of Z), which becomes stronger with decrease of C. When C = 1, the theta(RW) turns into 2k pi/3 for N-f = 2 + 1, but keeps (2k + 1)pi/3 for N-f = 1 + 2; in both cases, the RWtransitions get stronger with the mass mismatch. For other C not equal 0 cases, the theta(RW)'s are not integral multiples of pi/3. We find that the RWtransition is more sensitive to the deviation of C from one compared to the mass nondegeneracy, and thus the strength of the traditional RW transition with C = 0 is the strongest.

A standard approach is to saturate the pore space with a fluid and perform NMR relaxation measurements. The standard measurements are sensitive to the low-lying diffusion eigenmodes and they allow an estimation of the pore size distribution. To obtain more complete information about the pore geometry including connectivity, it is necessary to determine the entire set of eigenmodes. Towards this goal, we present here a new approach to excite and detect higher eigenmodes that are not visible in standard relaxation measurements. The method is based on a two-dimensional pulse sequence that incorporates a pair of gradient pulses. The validity of our methodology was tested on a sample of bulk water that has an eigenmode spectrum that is known.

Thus a simple iterative geometry-based interface-preserving reinitialization is proposed to reconstruct a signed distance function (SDF) while fixing the interface location with the combination of the external and internal iterations. The external iteration is used to restore the nature of the SDF. And the internal iteration firstly determines displacement errors of zero-level-set interpolation points via the geometric position of the interface, then the errors are redistributed iteratively to adjacent nodes until moving zero-level-set interpolation points are driven back to their original positions. The novel approach performs excellent mass conservation and shape preservation without sacrificing the simplicity of the iterative reinitialization.

Our investigation demonstrates that metal nanoparticles are responsible for inducing plasmonic and light trapping effects, where their spatial arrangement, geometry and position in transparent conductive oxide (TCO) play a crucial role in modulating the electrode optical and electrical properties. Besides, an enhanced average transmittance and reduced sheet resistance over the conventional electrodes are recorded.

We also compute the stability of extended nonlinear modes showing significant differences from the usual homogeneous nonlinear array. The transmission of a nonlinear pulse across the void shows three main regimes-transmission, reflection, and trapping at the void's position-and we identify a critical momentum for the pulse below (above) where the pulse gets reflected (transmitted), or trapped indefinitely at the void's position. For relatively wide pulses, we observe a steep increase from a regime of no transmission to a regime of high transmission, as the amplitude of the soliton increases beyond a critical wave-vector value.

J,"Connell, JJ; Lopate, C; Tabeling, JW",A novel synthetic diamond Cherenkov radiator for measuring space radiation,"The measurement of cosmic rays and Solar energetic particles in space is basic to our understanding of the Galaxy, the Sun, phenomena in the Heliosphere and the emerging field of space weather. For these reasons, cosmic ray instruments are common on both scientific spacecraft and operational spacecraft such as weather satellites. Cosmic rays (CRs) and Solar energetic particles (SEPs) include ions over the full range of elements found in the Solar System. High-resolution measurements of the energy spectra of space radiation are key to understanding both acceleration and propagation processes. An inherent challenge is the large range of energies of such spectra. Cosmic ray energies range up to over 10(21) eV, while SEPs can reach a few GeV. Multi-instrument measurements are currently required to cover the full range of particle energies. Indeed, the highest energy particles, due to the rarity, can only be measured with ground-based instruments using the atmosphere as a calorimeter. Over limited energy ranges, SEP spectra are often approximated by a power law; however, over the full energy range, SEP events exhibit changing spectral shapes (e.g. ""knees"", ""roll-overs"" and ""cut-offs""). These features give information about the acceleration processes, such as size of the acceleration region, time of acceleration, morphology of the magnetic field during acceleration, and others, all of which can vary from event to event. Measurements of such features are often compromised by the need to combine measurements from more than one instrument, each with its own limited energy range. Even if there are no gaps between the energy intervals of the instruments, differing systematics can severely impact data analysis. A single instrument capable of measurements over a continuous and extended energy range would offer vastly more reliable measurement of the energy spectra of SEP events as well as replacing multiple instruments on resource-limited spacecraft. The most common method to measure GCRs and SEPs from a few to similar to 100 MeV for protons, is Si Solid-State Detector (SSD) stacks. Above these energies, Cherenkov detectors are typically used together with SSDs. Ideally, to provide full energy coverage with no gaps, this requires a Cherenkov radiator with a threshold of similar to 100 MeV. No suitable Cherenkov detector with such a low threshold has been developed. We are in the process of developing a synthetic diamond Cherenkov detector for this purpose. Diamond's high index of refraction (2.42) results in a theoretical threshold of 92 MeV for protons. Even with a practical threshold of similar to 110 MeV, this is ideal for extending the energy range from that of SSDs alone to that of sapphire Cherenkov detectors (202 MeV threshold) with higher energies attainable using plastic Cherenkov detectors. Both Sapphire and plastic Cherenkov radiators have spaceflight heritage.",10.1016/j.nima.2019.162338,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Duarte, NFV; Monteiro, CMB; Azevedo, CDR; Antognini, A; Amaro, FD",Operational properties of fine powder aerosol as radiation detection medium in gaseous proportional counters,"Due to its exceptional properties, He-3 proportional counters are the golden standard for neutron detection, particularly in homeland security applications where large area detectors are deployed. However, in recent years He-3 has become severely scarce, which led to a tremendous price increase and acquisition restrictions of this material. Motivated by this, the development of He-3-free solutions became a priority. In a previous work, we have established a novel concept for neutron detection: a proportional counter with boron carbide (B4C) fine powder suspended in the proportional gas, forming a neutron sensitive aerosol that relies on the B-10 neutron capture reaction. Computer simulations and prototype exposure to a cold neutron beam yielded favorable results, validating the detection concept, which may also be applied to hard x-ray and gamma ray detection by using fine particles made of a heavy element, such as Bi or Au. In this work we study the effect of the presence of B4C microparticles in the charge gain and energy resolution of a proportional counter filled with Ar-CH4 (90%-10%), by irradiation with x-rays from a Fe-55 source. For the same applied voltage, an average gain loss by a factor of 36% and energy resolution (FWHM) increase by 15% (absolute value) was observed with the inclusion of B-4 C microparticles. Intrinsic energy resolution was calculated, obtaining 15% for pure P10 operation and 32% in the presence of the microparticles. While the gain drop is recoverable by increasing anode voltage, energy resolution degradation may be a drawback in low energy applications, were energy resolution is favored over detection efficiency.",10.1016/j.nima.2019.162392,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J,"Martin, RW; Zwanikken, JW",Controlling the structure and mixing properties of anisotropic active particles with the direction of self-propulsion,"In the search for advanced materials active particles could offer unique structural and functional properties, with tunable time-dependent characteristics. We demonstrate here that the direction of self-propulsion, relative to the particle orientation, may be as influential for the phase behavior as the pair interactions are for passive particles, and enable dynamic properties that are not available to passive systems. We perform simulations on ensembles of self-propelled squares, and find that squares that self-propel in the direction perpendicular to a side rapidly reach a steady state with a characteristic cluster distribution, positional order, and well-defined diffusion constant. After tuning the direction towards a corner, the particles form large and dense clusters that show a transient collective motion, and display remarkable fluctuations over long time scales, with a distinct periodicity. Clusters of these particles appear unstable beyond a critical size, and susceptible to a catastrophic disintegration. Directionality is found to effect equally sharp transitions in the mixing properties of active squares and passive squares, and the behavior of the passive ensemble. We relate directionality to the collision dynamics and the resulting reaction network of clusters, evolved by a Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, to correlate propulsion direction to the observed phase behavior. Understanding this behavior could offer new design rules for programmable materials, and grant further insights in the dynamic processes that nature employs for self-assembly.",10.1039/c9sm01120j,47,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
J,"Petersen, OL",On the Cauchy Problem for the Linearised Einstein Equation,"A classical problem in general relativity is the Cauchy problem for the linearised Einstein equation (the initial value problem for gravitational waves) on a globally hyperbolic vacuum spacetime. A well-known result is that it is uniquely solvable up to gauge solutions, given initial data on a spacelike Cauchy hypersurface. The solution map is an isomorphism between initial data (modulo gauge producing initial data) and solutions (modulo gauge solutions). In the first part of this work, we show that the solution map is actually an isomorphism of locally convex topological vector spaces. This implies that the equivalence class of solutions depends continuously on the equivalence class of initial data. We may therefore conclude well-posedness of the Cauchy problem. In the second part, we show that the linearised constraint equations can always be solved on a closed manifold with vanishing scalar curvature. This generalises the classical notion of TT-tensors on flat space used to produce models of gravitational waves.

J,"Bao, LP; Li, WY; Wu, LQ",Singularly perturbed solutions of a class of non-Fourier temperature field distribution,"Thermoelastic coupling model excited by laser is of great significance in engineering. To study the thermoelastic coupling model, the distribution of temperature field must be determined firstly. Because the laser excitation time is short (usually femtosecond), the traditional Fourier heat conduction law is no longer suitable. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the distribution of temperature field by using the non-Fourier heat conduction law. Previous studies on the temperature field model mostly use numerical analysis and computer simulation to discuss its numerical solution, but few can directly solve the analytical solution of the model. Up to now, there are few reports about using singularly perturbed analysis method to solve the asymptotic solution of temperature field model and determine the jumping position of heat conductivity coefficient. In this paper, a temperature field model is constructed by using the non-Fourier heat conduction law, i.e. a class of singularly perturbed hyperbolic equations with small parameters in an unbounded domain. The nonlinear singularly perturbed two-parameter hyperbolic equations with discontinuous coefficients are obtained when the heat conduction coefficients jump due to sharp temperature changes. By using the singularly perturbed biparametric expansion method, the asymptotic solution of the problem is obtained. First, the expansion of the problem is obtained by using singularly perturbed method. The existence and uniqueness of the internal and external solutions are obtained by estimating the maximum modulus of the internal and external solutions and the maximum modulus estimates of the time derivatives, and the formal asymptotic expansion of the solutions is obtained. Secondly, the singularly perturbed hyperbolic equation is corrected by the singular perturbation theory, and the derivative of the solution is estimated. The position expression of the jump of the thermal conductivity coefficient is determined by the Fourier transform, and the seam method is used to connect the seams of the two sides of the jump position of the thermal conductivity coefficient, thus the form asymptotic expansion of the solution is obtained. Finally, the uniform validity of the asymptotic solution is obtained by estimating the residual term, and the distribution of the temperature field with discontinuous heat conduction coefficient is obtained.

J,"He, TC; Li, J",Measurement of gravity acceleration by cold atoms in a harmonic trap using Kapitza-Dirac pulses,"The interferometry of two Kapitza-Dirac (KD) pulses acting on cold atoms in a harmonic oscillator potential well is investigated by Feynman path integral method. The wave function and density distribution function of the system at a given time are calculated analytically by using the propagator under the action of an external field. The first KD pulse acts on cold atoms to produce a large number of modes in the harmonic oscillator potential well. The maximum value of wave packet of mode 0 is larger than those of other modes. These modes evolve along different paths. The external field changes the phase of each mode and makes the evolution path of the mode deviate from that without the external field. When the second KD pulse is added, it splits the mode of the first KD pulse, and thus generates more modes. These modes will evolve along different paths under the action of external field and harmonic potential well, and interfere with each other. At the moment of measurement, all the wave packets are separated without overlapping. The effect of the external field does not change the magnitude of the density distribution at the time of measurement, but makes the wave packet of each mode shift. The phase difference between adjacent modes decreases linearly with the increase of field intensity. When the external field is a gravity field, we calculate the Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao lower bound. The Fisher information is proportional to the mass of atoms and inversely to the third power of harmonic potential well frequency. We can improve the measurement accuracy of interferometer by reducing the frequency of harmonic potential well and increasing atomic mass. When the initial state is the ground state of the harmonic potential well, the accuracy of the gravity acceleration measured by the interference device can be obtained to be 10(-9) by using the experimental parameters. The initial state is the ground state of the harmonic potential well and the external field, and the calculation result indicates that the measurement accuracy will decrease. At the same time, the enhancement of inter-atomic repulsion and attraction interaction will also lead the measurement accuracy to increase.",10.7498/aps.68.20190749,54,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no

However, it usually needs synthesizing through a complicated multistep process involving high temperature (e.g., 1350 degrees C), severe reduction (e.g., 700-1300 C for up to 240 h in Ca or Ti metal vapor atmosphere) and post-purification. Owing to the H2O sensitivity of mayenite, the post-purification is quite troublesome once impurities are introduced. High-density, loosely bound encaged electrons with a low work function make it promise to possess practical applications. Therefore the facile method of massively producing the high-quality C12A7:e- with high Ne is extremely desired. In this work, C12A7:e- bulks are for the first time synthesized by simple spark plasma sintering process directly from a mixture of C12A7, CA and Ca powders under milder conditions (e.g., sintered at 1070 C for 10 min in a vacuum). The obtained electride, which exhibits a relative density of 99%, an electron concentration of 2.3x 1021 cm-3 and an obvious absorption peak at 2.5 eV, is obtained via SPS process at 1100 C for 10 min. Electronic structure is also investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance. The occurrence of Dysonian characteristic, a typical feature of good electronic conductors, strongly suggests that the electrons are trapped in mayenite cavities. Furthermore, the obtained C12A7:e- exhibits good sinterabilty on a crystal scale of 5-40 um. Thermionic emission test results show that the thermionic emission begins to occur at 700 K and a large current density of 1.75 A/cm2 is obtained in the electron thermal emission from a flat surface of the polycrystalline C12A7:e- with an effective work function of 2.09 eV for a temperature of 1373 K with an applied electric field of 35000 V/cm in a vacuum. Owing to no external reductant is needed, this developed route exhibits notable superiority over the conventional reduction method for phase-pure C12A7:e-.

The supercell crystal structures are established with 60 atoms with four models: the near-stoichiometric pure LiTaO3 crystal (LT); the iron doped LiTaO3 crystal (Fe:LT), with the charge compensation model expressed as Fe-Li(2+)-2V(Li)(-); the iron and magnesium co-doped LiTaO3 crystal (Fe:Mg:LT), with the charge compensation model taken as Fe-Li(2+)-Mg-Li+-3V(Li)(-); the other iron and magnesium co-doped LiTaO3 crystal (Fe:Mg(E):LT), with Mg ion concentration near threshold value (slightly less than 6 mol%) and taking the charge compensation model as 2Mg(Li)(+)-FeTa2-. The geometry optimization results show that the total energy values of all models can achieve certain stable values, which means that the models used in this paper are very close to the actual crystal structures. In the electronic structures, the extrinsic defect energy levels in the forbidden band of Fe:LT crystal are mainly contributed from the Fe 3d orbital, and the band gap of Fe:LT about 3.05 eV is narrower than that of LT, the band gap of Fe:Mg:LT and Fe:Mg(E):LT sample are 2.72 eV and 2.45 eV respectively. The results show that the orbit of Fe 3d, Ta 5d and O 2p are superposed with each other, forming covalent bonds, which results in conduction band and valence band shifting toward low energy in iron doped LiTaO3 crystal. The Fe 3d orbit is split into E-g orbit and T-2g orbit under the influence of the crystal field. There are two absorption peaks at 417 nm (2.97 eV) and 745 nm (1.66 eV) in the Fe:LiTaO3 crystal. The first one is attributed to the transfer of the T-2g orbital electron to conduction band. The last one can be taken as the result of E-g electron transfer of Fe2+ in crystal. The intensities and positions of these peaks vary with the concentration of Mg ion. Specially, with the concentration of Mg ion attaining the threshold value, the peak at 745 nm disappears, and the other peak moves slightly to 457 nm (2.71 eV). With the Mg ion concentration at the threshold value, the Fe ions can occupy Ta positions. This occupying condition makes the E-g orbital energy change greatly compared with the scenario in the Fe-Li condition, and it affects hardly the T-2g orbital energy. So, if the absorption nearby 745 nm waveband can be taken as the useful process in holographic storage application, it is better to take smaller concentration of Mg ions (less than threshold value). On the other hand, nearby 457 nm waveband, concentration of Mg ions can be chosen as a large value.",10.7498/aps.68.20190575,57,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Periodic disk array structure reduces the surface plasmon frequency of Ti, excites the spoof surface plasmons in the THz band and leads to resonance enhanced absorption.

J,"Wang, RX; Li, X; Li, L; Xiao, YC; Xu, SW",Stability analysis in three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction,"Spin-transfer torque-based magnetic random access memory is becoming more and more attractive in industry due to its non-volatility, fast switching speed and infinite endurance. However, it suffers energy and speed bottlenecks, so the magnetic tunnel junction urgently needs a new write scheme. Compared with the spintransfer torque, emerging spin-orbit torque will replace spin-transfer torque as a new write scheme of magnetic storage technology for its faster writing speed and avoiding the barrier breakdown. A three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction consists of magnetic tunnel junction/heavy metal structure offers a promising perspective from a technological point of view in the design of new generation of magnetic random access memory, for it is possible to control the magnetization dynamics through two current densities of spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque. In this paper, the stability of magnetic states in the three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction is studied theoretically. Through linearizing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation including the spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque defined in the spherical coordinates, the new equilibrium directions and linear differential equations are obtained. Performing linear stability analysis of the new equilibrium directions, the phase diagrams defined by the direction of pinned-layer magnetization vector and the current density of spin-orbit torque are obtained. Several magnetic states are distinguished in the phase diagram, such as in-plane precessional and stable states, out-of-plane precessional and stable states. When the pinned-layer magnetization vector rotates out of the film plane, through adjusting the direction of pinned-layer magnetization vector, the switching from stable state to precessional one can be realized. Orientating the pinned-layer magnetization vector in the film plane, neither the out-of-plane precession nor stable states emerges for the current density of spin-orbit torque and spin-transfer torque are relatively small. The instability current takes a minimum value with the pinned-layer magnetization vector nearly parallel or antiparallel to the easy axis of free layer and increases with the direction of pinned-layer magnetization vector deviating from these two locations. The magnetization reversal can be realized through adjusting the current density of spin-transfer torque, and the reversal time can decrease greatly under the assisting of spin-orbit torque. By showing the dependence of magnetization vector on the time of different magnetic states, the validity of phase diagram is confirmed. The selecting of the different directions of the pinned-layer magnetization vector provides an alternative way to control the current-driven magnetization dynamics.

J,"Ye, HF; Jin, D; Kuang, B; Yang, YH",Effect of equilibrium distribution positivity on numerical performance of lattice Boltzmann method,"Traditionally, the numerical performance of the lattice Boltzmann method is mainly determined by the moment degree of a discrete equilibrium distribution. The equilibrium distribution positivity is merely considered as an ancillary property which is used to constrict the numerical configuration. With the newly-developed partial Gaussian-Hermite quadrature scheme, the positivity of equilibrium distribution is validated as an independent property like moment degree which can be adjusted by discrete velocities. Researchers speculated that the positivity should also be significant for the numerical performance by the lattice Boltzmann method and can be used to improve the performance. Comparing with the classical improvement through moment degree, the positivity approach will not bring additional computation. However, due to the lack of boundary treatment, the speculation has not been validated by detailed numerical simulations. In this paper, through employing a periodic case, the Taylor-Green vortex, to avoid the boundary issue, we in depth analyze the numerical effect of the model positivity, including the numerical accuracy in the model positive range, the influence of positivity on the numerical performance, and the significance comparison between positivity and moment degree. The results show that for a given model, the numerical accuracy is not consistent in the whole positive range. As the configuration is close to the border of positive range, the accuracy will degrade though it is still acceptable. The numerical performance of a model depends on both moment degree and positivity. The role that the moment degree plays lies mainly in the qualification of a model on Galilean invariance. Once a model fulfills the Galilean invariance, its numerical performance is solely dependent on the positivity. Hence, the improvement approach through modifying the model positivity is a viable solution, and a Galilean invariant model with wider positive range does possess a better numerical performance regardless of its moment degree. Furthermore, based on the numerical results in this paper, all DnHm models with high moment degree are better than the classical D2Q9 model.

J,"Zhang, XD; Chu, YX; Jia, W; Hu, ML",Ultraviolet picosecond conversion efficiency improvement system at 355 nm based on fundamental frequency laser amplified,"In recent years, picosecond laser in ultraviolet (UV) has manifested great importance for applications both in science and industry, such as biomedical research, micro machining, etc. Now, the well proven approach to generating ultra-short UV pulses is extra-cavity frequency conversion based on nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal, due to the lack of suitable laser sources directly generating UV laser. In this process of harmonic generation, the length of nonlinear crystal is an important factor affecting the conversion efficiency and beam-quality. The optimal length of the nonlinear crystal is influenced by incident laser parameters and crystal absorption coefficient. At present, for the UV 355 nm picosecond laser generated from extra-cavity sum frequency, published are few reports about detailed analysis and research on the influence of photon ratio of the incident laser beams and nonlinear crystal absorption on optimal length of sum frequency crystal. In this paper, the steady-state solutions with the highest conversion efficiency under different incident conditions are obtained by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of the three waves coupling equations. The effects of different photon ratios and absorption effect of the sum frequency crystal on the optimum crystal length are analyzed. We propose a solution based on the fundamental frequency laser amplified to shorten crystal length and improve conversion efficiency. In this scheme, the 532 nm second harmonic laser with a high conversion efficiency over 65% can be achieved by LiB3O5 crystal. After that, the 1064 nm fundamental frequency laser is separated from the second harmonic laser, and then it is amplified by the Nd:YVO4 laser crystal pumped by an 808 nm laser diode. Finally, the ultraviolet 355 nm picosecond laser is obtained by combining the 1064 nm fundamental frequency laser with the 532 nm second harmonic laser in the LiB3O5 crystal. The simulation results show that the incident photon ratio of the sum frequency reaction can be changed by amplifying the residual fundamental frequency laser, and the optimum length of the sum-frequency crystal corresponding to the highest conversion efficiency can be shortened. Meanwhile, the absorption and walk-away effect of the sum frequency crystal can be also reduced. The final 355 nm laser output power can be increased more than 40 percent compared with the traditional scheme of early reports. In consequence, the high sum frequency conversion efficiency of the UV 355 nm picosecond laser can be obtained by changing the photo ratio of the incident laser beams through amplifying the fundamental frequency laser.",10.7498/aps.68.20190876,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Zhou, GZ; Li, Y; Lan, T; Dai, JJ; Wang, CO; Wang, ZY",Design and simulation of integration of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers and heterojunction bipolar transistor,"Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are widely used in the field of short-range optical communication and optical interconnection because of their advantages such as low threshold current, large modulation bandwidth, easy two-dimensional integration, easy coupling with optical fibers and low cost. The VCSELs and heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) are longitudinal current devices, so they can be well integrated on the same wafer, and the output light power can be modulated by the HBT base current. Integration of VCSELs and HBT are designed in this paper. The VCSELs and PNP InGaP/GaAs HBT form a direct series structure. The reflectivity of DBR is 99.72% at a resonant wavelength of 850 nm and 99.57% after adding HBT separately. Therefore, the addition of HBT has little influence on the reflectivity of DBR at the resonant wavelength. The electro-optical characteristics of the integrated structure are simulated by using PICS3D software. An interim collector is added into the model in order to ensure that the simulation can be carried out smoothly. Firstly, HBT is conducted and the current flows from the emitter to the interim collector. Then, the voltage across the interim collector and the N-type electrode is increased to make VCSELs conducted and the current of the transition collector drop to zero. The interim collector can be removed from the actual structure because the current is zero. The simulation results show that the current gain coefficient is 400, and the maximum modulation rate of the base current to the output light power rises up to 280 mW/mA. The maximum temperature in the active region increases with the base current increasing, and the output light power first increases and then tends to be saturated. The ac optical gain characteristics of the integrated structure is simulated by PICS3D, and the simulation result shows that cutoff frequency exceeds 1 GHz. The addition of HBT limits the modulation rate of the integrated structure, and further optimization of HBT structure parameters and geometric dimension are needed to improve the modulation rate. The integrated structure and simulation method established in this paper can also be used to integrate LED, LD, DFB or other luminescent devices with HBT.",10.7498/aps.68.20190529,66,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

We focus on the impact of variable reactivity of patchy particles on the form of miscibility gap. We show that the variation of model parameters determining features of interparticle interaction makes it possible to obtain miscibility gaps of different types within the unified formalism. In particular, we uncover two different mechanisms of the formation of phase separation curves with lower critical solution temperature. The first mechanism is realised in the case of positive bonding energy; the second one can takes place when the energy of formation of two-bonded particles is lower than that for all other m-bonded ones. We conclude that the most interesting and non-trivial phase behavior is observed in the case of patchy particles with variable reactivity. Using rigorous statistical model, we uncover new mechanisms of phase separation in a solution consisting of patchy particles, which are capable to form directed and saturated thermoreversible bonds.

The structure and chemical composition of the ferrites were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The presence of peaks in the XRD patterns was confirmed by the formation of a cubic spinel structure, because the main peaks of the patterns were related to the single-phase cubic spinel structure with PDF-number of 008-0234. The XRD patterns showed a slight shifting in peaks position due to unstable spacing values with increasing Mg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ contents in all ferrites. The mean crystallite size and lattice constant were determined from the Scherer's formula and XRD data. They were found to have been increased by the increase of x concentration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images were used to analyze the ferrites' structures. In addition, room temperature magnetization and coercivity of ferrites were determined from the hysteresis loops in a magnetic field of 9 kOe by alternative gradient force magnetometer. It was found that the magnetization and coercivity of ferrites with increasing x contents were increased, which is discussed according to the site's occupation of the substituted cations on the sub-lattices. Among all synthesized ferrites, Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.8 showed the highest magnetization and coercively, whereas Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.0 displayed the lowest corresponding values.

In this paper, we propose a plasmonic nanoantenna with PT-symmetric potential for unidirectional scattering functionality. The studied plasmonic nanoantenna is comprised of three metallic layers separated by two dielectric layers. Such kind of system, with the same coefficient kappa of loss and gain in each of the two dielectric layers, holds the characteristic of PT symmetry. We show that the unidirectional scattering is obtained for the passive structure (i.e., kappa = 0), and the switching between forward and backward directionality can be achieved with a single structure by changing the excitation wavelength, when the induced electric dipole (ED) and magnetic dipole (MD) modes satisfy the first or second Kerker conditions, respectively. In addition, we find that the forward-to-backward ratio spectra can be strongly affected by the non-Hermiticity parameter kappa. In particular, it is possible to reverse the radiation direction at the same wavelength in a wide spectra band by adjusting kappa. Moreover, putting the nanoantennas in an array of transverse configuration can efficiently narrow the main lobe angular beam width to be <6 degrees.

From the analysis results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Hall-effect measurement, the amorphous GeSn film starts to crystallize at 450 degrees C while the crystallinity enhances at 500 degrees C by employing rapid thermal annealing (RTA) as the film crystallization process. With capping layer on the whole region, the hole concentration becomes too high to turn the JL P-TFTs off. However, by limiting capping layer on source/drain region to increase hole concentration, total series resistance is reduced due to lower sheet resistance and contact resistance, which consequently improves the drive current, I-ON/I-OFF ratio and field-effect mobility. Based on the best process conditions and structure to form the poly-GeSn JL P-TFTs, I-ON/I-OFF ratio up to 5.6 x 10(2) are achieved while peak field-effect mobility of 20.8 cm(2)/Vs is obtained.

J,"Cotter, J; Guldiken, R",Vertical manipulation of fluids through electrostatic formation: model development and experimental validation,"A novel actuation method, called electrostatic formation (ESF), for MEMS and other applications, is introduced. The ESF mechanism uses a droplet of liquid material that is electrostatically deformed. ESF differs from Electrowetting and Electrowetting on Dielectric as the electrode used to apply the voltage is of a smaller diameter than the droplet being manipulated, and the electrode is located above the manipulated fluid. Modeling this movement requires adherence to the Lippmann and Young-Laplace equations simultaneously. In order to understand how the surface tension is specifically manipulated, as is required for the development of a model of representation of the phenomenon, a force-based interpretation of the Lippmann equation is outlined, with focus on how it compares to the force response provided by hydrostatic pressure under the influence of gravitational field forces. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a differential surface charge must be present of which the formulation is complex in nature, likely stemming from the combination of the internal pressure and a localized skin effect caused by an electric double layer that is present at the surface of the transformed liquid. In this study, a target liquid of gallium is manipulated under electrostatic charge in a physical experiment and compared against the geometry suggested by the developed model.

This is in contrast to the case of square shapes where the enhancements appeared as broad peaks around N = n(2). Furthermore, the field ranges of the N-vortex state expand at the triangular numbers of N, suggesting that the triangular number of vortices has a more stable configuration than the others.

J,"Aguerre, HJ; Damián, SM; Nigro, NM",Conservative interpolation on surface interfaces for transport problems in the Finite Volume Method,"This paper presents a new strategy to couple non-matching interfaces in the Finite Volume Method based on a conservative interpolation. In contrast to most of the conservative methods, the current approach does not modify the mesh and therefore, the connection between variables at both sides of the interfaces is solved using interpolation. The conservation of fluxes is imposed by a pair of vector equations which relates the matrix coefficients of the Finite Volume problem with the weighting factors used for interpolating. These relations are satisfied by projecting the matrix coefficients from an interface to its opposite and then computing the weighting factors according to a conservation principle.

We introduce an efficient algorithm for the computation of the visibility graph resulting from a kMC simulation and show that from the properties of the visibility graph one can determine the critical island size, thus demonstrating that the visibility graph approach, which implicitly combines size and spatial data, can provide insights into island nucleation and growth processes.

However, available gases with relatively high refractive indices, that simultaneously preserve their gaseous phase at room temperature and moderate pressures, are rare. Until recently, R-12 (Freon-12) was broadly used, but to date, it is generally unavailable due to its high global warming potential. In this work, we present an estimation of the refractive index of an alternative gas, Octafluoropropane (R-218), and we explore its feasibility as a Cherenkov radiator, for tagging charged particles at momenta as low as 2 GeV/c.",10.1016/j.nimb.2019.07.014,88,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Efremidze, L; Stanley, DJ; Park, A; Wasilewski, N",Empirical implementation of entropy risk factor model: A test on Chilean peso,"Currencies are used by many investors as a speculative or investment instrument. Their movements are complex and there are exchange rate models which suggest how to predict long and short-term fluctuations. In this paper we investigate the predictability of an exchange rate with an entropy risk factor model. Considering that recent studies find complex systems characteristics of financial markets, we explore the usefulness of sample entropy as a risk factor for currency fluctuations. The empirical testing of sample entropy is based on the data of the Chilean peso (CLP) exchange rate for the period of January 1, 2005 and November 25, 2016. We find evidence that Chilean peso market has enough market inefficiencies that can be profitably exploited by the sample entropy based prediction algorithm developed in this paper.

In this work, we report a new and facile strategy to prepare three-dimensional (3D) Au/C networks comprised of carbonaceous skeletons and tiny gold nanoparticles by directly carbonizing the nanoporous block copolymer films complexed with the gold salts. The robust complexation makes it ease of generating numerous dispersed gold nanoparticles with an average diameter as small as approximate to 15 nm confined in the carbonaceous frameworks after carbonization.

J,"Hermida-Ramon, JM; Öhrn, A; Karlström, G",Structure and spectrum of the hydrated electron. A combined quantum chemical statistical mechanical simulation,"In the current work, in order to model a free electron solvated in water, we have implemented a method to represent the molecular charge distribution as a set of Slater-type functions within the framework of a QM/MM method called QMSTAT. Also, it has been introduced in this method a new approach to calculate the intermolecular induction energy in the presence of very strong electric fields. Unlike most previous potentials, our method uses the ab initio energies of the electron-water complex as reference to obtain the few fitted parameters that the model needs, instead of the ab initio potential of the electron. A Metropolis-Monte Carlo simulation of 15 million steps has been carried out in a system that consists of an electron solvated in 200 water molecules explicitly described. The obtained results predict a vertical electron detachment energy of 3.30 eV and a radius of gyration of 2.38 angstrom, which are in very good agreement with the experimental data of 3.27+0.10 eV and 2.45 angstrom, respectively. We have also obtained the absorption spectrum of the hydrated electron from our simulation. The maximum of the spectrum agrees very well with the experimental result and the experimental width at half-maximum is only 0.11 eV wider than the calculated curve. The calculations predict the same blue tail as the experimental result but with a less smooth shape. Also, our results indicate that the transfer of intensity from the transition arriving to the highest of the three p states to transitions arriving to higher-lying states contributes to the intensity enhancement of the blue tail of the spectrum. Regarding the solvated structure of the free electron, we have found that if the basis center is used as the electron site to calculate the correlation functions, the results predict a structure where the electron places itself on top of a central water molecule surrounded by the remaining water molecules in a very organized and stable arrangement. However, if the maximum of the electron density is used as electron site the obtained picture shows an electron located in a very fluctuating cavity that collapses and reforms continuously.

This study investigates the interaction between graphene and aluminum oxide layer (Al2O3) and the influence of Al2O3 on the properties of graphene. The electrical characterization demonstrates the tunability in the resistivity of Al2O3/Gr devices by applying V-g. Al2O3 deposition introduced n-doping in graphene and is affirmed by shifting of charge neutrality point towards negative V-g. The selective coverage of channel, results in the formation of p-n junction within graphene FET which becomes more pronounced upon DUV treatment. Moreover, the study validates the modulation in interface properties of pristine GFET and Al2O3/Gr at different V-g and temperatures. An enhancement in the intervalley and phase coherence scattering rates is observed for Al2O3/Gr device.

J,"Jiang, J; Zhou, TS",Nontrivial effects of uncertainty on epidemic spreading under limited resources,"While epidemic spreading often involves uncertainty (represented by noise), its control depends on the resource amount to be invested. It is unclear how the noise affects epidemic spreading under limited resources. Here we analyze an artificial model of epidemic spreading on a two-layer network, which considers three factors often neglected in other studies: noise, resource amount and time delay. We find that the noise can significantly impact epidemic spreading, depending on resource amount, sub-network topology, connection strength between sub-networks, and time delay. Main findings include: (1) for a given number of resources, a stronger noise correlates to a smaller fraction of the population infected. Moreover, if the more resources are invested, then the effect of the noise in reducing the fraction of the population infected becomes more apparent; (2) for a large range of time delay or topology degree, there is an optimal noise intensity such that the fraction of the population infected is smallest. These findings would provide useful guidelines for government decisions on the control of epidemic spreading.

We determined a maximum intra-pulse phase distortion (B-integral) of 21.2 rad by mixing the burst with a reference. The difference in the B-integral between the first and last pulse in the burst was large, 12.8 rad, but can be compensated for. Moreover, burst-to-burst amplitude fluctuations (standard deviation, std) were below 6%, where phase fluctuations were similar to 0.6 rad (std) or less. Even if these fluctuations cannot be compensated for, they still allow for efficient coherent combination, which opens up for transform-limited or narrow-line high-energy divided-pulse amplification with single-frequency seeding.",10.1109/LPT.2019.2942175,96,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

J,"Ling, X; Chen, JJ; Guo, N; Zhu, KJ; Long, JC; Shi, Q; Jiang, R",Multiple states induced by dynamic speed allocation in dynamical networks,"Most previous studies on dynamical networks assume that all nodes move at the same speed, but the moving speed of each node in realistic system tends to differ from each other. In this paper, we propose a dynamic speed allocation algorithm with maximum speed based on the degree of nodes. By adjusting a tunable parameter in the algorithm, we obtain three different stable states in the network: uniform, clustered and decentralized state. There are two thresholds to describe the phase transitions between them. The transportation capacity of the network in clustered state is the best, the second in uniform state and the worst in decentralized state. It is found that there exists an optimal tunable parameter in clustered state, leading to the maximum traffic throughput of the network. Combining the spatial distribution of nodes, the nodes will aggregate into a group in clustered state or many different groups in decentralized state. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.
