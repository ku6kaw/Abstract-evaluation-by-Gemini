J,"Önder, EB; Önder, F",Students' understanding of fundamental AC signal concepts,"The aim of this study was to determine students' understanding of fundamental AC signal concepts, such as frequency, amplitude, and phase difference. The participants in the study were 179 students (44 female and 135 male) attending Izmir Vocational School who were enrolled in the Analog Electronics Course. The data of the study were collected by means of three open-ended questions and semi-structured interviews. In the questions, students were given a graph of an AC signal and asked to draw a signal with equal frequency but higher amplitude, a signal with equal amplitude but higher frequency, and a signal with a certain phase difference. The main aim of the interviews was to provide a deeper insight into the difficulties detected in the analysis of the questions. The data analysis showed that the students confused the concepts of frequency and amplitude and had difficulties in interpreting the signals that exhibited a phase difference.",10.1139/cjp-2018-0819,0,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no

J,"Park, H; Lee, K",Adaptive Natural Gradient Method for Learning of Stochastic Neural Networks in Mini-Batch Mode,"Gradient descent method is an essential algorithm for learning of neural networks. Among diverse variations of gradient descent method that have been developed for accelerating learning speed, the natural gradient learning is based on the theory of information geometry on stochastic neuromanifold, and is known to have ideal convergence properties. Despite its theoretical advantages, the pure natural gradient has some limitations that prevent its practical usage. In order to get the explicit value of the natural gradient, it is required to know true probability distribution of input variables, and to calculate inverse of a matrix with the square size of the number of parameters. Though an adaptive estimation of the natural gradient has been proposed as a solution, it was originally developed for online learning mode, which is computationally inefficient for the learning of large data set. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive natural gradient estimation for mini-batch learning mode, which is commonly adopted for big data analysis. For two representative stochastic neural network models, we present explicit rules of parameter updates and learning algorithm. Through experiments on three benchmark problems, we confirm that the proposed method has superior convergence properties to the conventional methods.",10.3390/app9214568,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike existing approaches, the proposed framework provides natural 3D manipulation of a face without background distortion and interactive face editing by a user's input, which leads to freeform manipulation without any limitation of range or shape. To achieve these features, a 3D morphable face model is fitted to a face region in a video frame and is deformed by the user's input. The video frame is then mapped as a texture to the deformed model, and the model is rendered on the video frame. Because of the high computational cost, parallelization and acceleration schemes are also adopted for real-time performance. Performance evaluation and comparison results show that the proposed framework is promising for 3D face editing in live video.",10.3390/app9214707,5,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

The achieved results for the lattice parameters and band gaps of three conformers in this research are in good accordance with other theoretical results. The band structures of three conformers show that the chair, boat, and stirrup are direct band gap with a band gaps of (3.12, 4.95, and 4.95 eV), respectively. To regulate the band structures of fh-BN, we employ a hybrid functional of Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) calculations and the band gaps are 3.84 (chair), 6.12 (boat), and 6.18 eV (stirrup), respectively. The boat and stirrup fh-BN exhibits varying degrees of mechanical anisotropic properties with respect to the Young?s modulus and Poisson?s ratio, while the chair fh-BN exhibits the mechanical isotropic properties. Furthermore, tensile strains are applied in the armchair and zigzag directions related to tensile deformation of zigzag and armchair nanotubes, respectively. We find that the ultimate strains in zigzag and armchair deformations in stirrup conformer are 0.34 and 0.25, respectively, larger than the strains of zigzag (0.29) and armchair (0.18) deformations in h-BN although h-BN can surstain a surface tension up to the maximum stresses higher than those of three conformers of fh-BN.

Reliability and performance of ENIG systems have been extensively reported at temperatures below 250C; however, information is not readily available about its reliability at higher temperatures. In this paper, thermal behavior of electroless Ni/Au, Ni/Pd and Ni/Pd/Au during solder reflow processing at temperatures of up to 350C is characterized.

J,"Shen, MJ; Lv, D; Ma, ZX",Detecting community structure by belonging intensity analysis of intermediate nodes,"Community structure is a common characteristic of complex networks and community detection is an important methodology to reveal the structure of real-world networks. In recent years, many algorithms have been proposed to detect the high-quality communities in real-world networks. However, these algorithms have shortcomings of performing calculation on the whole network or defining objective function and the number of commonties in advance, which affects the performance and complexity of community detection algorithms. In this paper, a novel algorithm has been proposed to detect communities in networks by belonging intensity analysis of intermediate nodes, named BIAS, which is inspired from the interactive behavior in human communication networks. More specifically, intermediate nodes are middlemen between different groups in social networks. BIAS algorithm defines belonging intensity using local interactions and metrics between nodes, and the belonging intensity of intermediate node in different communities is analyzed to distinguish which community the intermediate node belongs to. The experiments of our algorithm with other state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic networks and real-world networks have shown that BIAS algorithm has better accuracy and can significantly improve the quality of community detection without prior information.",10.1142/S0129183119500797,27,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Recently, the developing of the topological insulator provides a new opportunity to get high thermoelectric efficiency material. There are two effects in topological insulator: anomalous Hall and Nernst effect, which have contribution to the transport properties. Because of anomalous Hall and Nernst effect the electrical thermal conductivity have transverse parts, which affect the Seebeck coefficient. However, the transverse parts can be expressed by Berry curvature. By using of ?-mapping topological theory, the Berry curvature is studied and we find there is topological vortex in the momentum space. The Bloch wave function is zero at the topological vortex.

However, Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) that connect layers in the structure of 3D ICs can seriously increase the delay due to capacitance coupling between TSVs and lead to crosstalk fault. The severity of crosstalk faults depends on transitions appearing on TSVs that is called transition patterns. To propose an efficient crosstalk tackling mechanisms in 3D ICs, an accurate probability analytical model is required to predict the delay caused by TSVs (3D ICs) in the attendance of these transition patterns. In this regard, this paper proposes an accurate crosstalk probability model for 3D ICs called AM3D that estimates the latency of communication channels of 3D ICs in the attendance of crosstalk faults. The model is applicable for both non-protected TSVs and TSVs which are protected by crosstalk mitigation mechanisms. In order to accredit our proposed model, various SPICE simulations are conducted and obtained outcomes in different benchmarks are compared with extracted results from AM3D. Comparisons present an average of 1.81% discrepancies between the time delay obtained from SPICE simulations and time delay calculated by our proposed model.",10.1016/j.microrel.2019.06.071,30,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

In the calculations, a Sakhalin-type pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator is assumed as a power source for the launcher. Launchers with three and five pairs of parallel rails connected into a series electrical circuit are considered. The simulation was performed for different numbers of projectiles in a burst and for different projectile masses. It is established that a major factor limiting the operation of launchers in such modes is the heating of the rails. It is shown that the rate of rail heating is determined by the inhomogeneity of the current density distribution along the rail section due to the nonstationary diffusion of the magnetic field into the rails and by the velocity skin effect. It has been shown previously that the maximum heating of the rails occurs in regions located outside the launcher channel provided that the width of the outer rail extends beyond the section of the launcher channel. We investigated the possibilities of reducing the heating of rails in these regions using rails of different widths in the rail launcher channel, using rails of different materials and rails with inhomogeneous electrophysical properties, and using armatures of different materials. The calculations show that with an optimal choice of the material and structure of the rails and the armature material corresponding to this structure, multirail launchers 5-6-m long can provide a projectile velocity of 2-2.5 km/s in a burst of 10-16 projectiles with masses of up to 800 g at a firing rate of 200-300 shots per second with no melting of the rails in the launcher channel.",10.1109/TPS.2019.2942100,32,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

Using the spin Hartree-Fock approach we construct a quantitative theory of heat capacity in the quasi-1D regime with a finite coupling between spin chains. This theory reproduces closely the exact result of Bethe Ansatz in the 1D limit and does not produces any spurious phase transitions for any anisotropy in the quasi-1D regime at finite temperatures in agreement with the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We study the static spin-spin correlation function in order to analyse the interplay of lattice geometry and anisotropy in these systems. We compare the square and triangular lattice. For the latter we find that there is a quantum transition point at an intermediate anisotropy of similar to 0.6. This quantum phase transition establishes that the quasi-1D regime extends upto a particular point in this geometry. For the square lattice the change from the 1D to 2D occurs smoothly as a function of anisotropy, i.e. it is of the crossover type.

For this, an additional negatively polarised electrode is mounted in P+(source)-N (channel)-N+(drain) structure over the source region to overcome material solubility. This improves the electrical characteristics of the device. Along with this, we have implanted a low workfunction metal layer (ML) in the oxide layer under the gate electrode for creating more abruptness at the junction to improve the subthreshold swing (SS) of the device. Thus, the proposed concept improves the DC/RF performance of the doped TFET device. Further to this, the optimization of metal layer workfunction and misalignment of metal layer in TFET have been performed to get optimum device characteristics. In addition to this, for the suppression of ambipolar behaviour, gate electrode is shorted from the drain side.

The segmentation, or partition of the image pixels, is viewed as a model structure selection problem, where the decisions are based on the implementable codelength of the model, akin to minimum description length for lossy representations. The intended usage of the extracted disparity map is to provide to the decoder the geometry information at a very small fraction from what is required for a lossless compressed version, and secondly, to convey to the decoder a segmentation describing the contours of the objects from the scene. We propose first an algorithm for constructing a hierarchical segmentation based on the persistency of the contours of regions in an iterative re-estimation algorithm.

J,"Udal'tsov, AV",Proton-sharing frequency and dynamic characteristics of water molecule in the liquid in terms of polaronic exciton concept,"A developed polaronic concept has been suggested to describe dynamic molecular behavior of water with proton sharing. Fluctuating hydrogen-bonded structures formed due to the intermolecular dynamics provide different relaxation processes when microwave or THz spectroscopy is applied. Relaxation characteristics of water molecules in the liquid have been estimated by different modes taking into consideration proton sharing between the hydrogen-bonded molecules. One of the mode was deduced using Maxwell relation eta = B-m tau(r), where eta is dynamic viscosity, B-m is bulk modulus, and tau(r) is relaxation time. The latter (tau(r)) depending on temperature was used to estimate Debye relaxation time and its fast component (tau(2)). Rotational relaxation time (tau(rot)), which has been connected with tau(2), is introduced to characterize rotation of 2p(4)-electron orbit configuration arisen because of hydrogen bonding oscillations. Relaxation time of proton motion in the N-H+center dot center dot center dot O moiety with single hydrogen bond described like boson moving is found consistent with tau(2) of water.

Currently, only invasive and sacrificial methods exist to study neurochemical alterations following TBI. Nuclear magnetic resonance methods-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS)-are powerful tools which may be used noninvasively to diagnose a range of medical issues. These methods can be utilized to explore brain functionality, connectivity, and biochemistry. Unfortunately, many of the commonly studied brain metabolites (e.g., N-acetyl-aspartate, choline, creatine) remain relatively stable following mild to moderate TBI and may not be suitable for longitudinal assessment of injury severity and location. Therefore, a critical need exists to investigate alternative biomarkers of TBI, such as acrolein. Acrolein is a byproduct of lipid peroxidation and accumulates following damage to neuronal tissue. Acrolein has been shown to increase in post-mortem rat brain tissue following TBI. However, no methods exist to noninvasively quantify acrolein in vivo. Currently, we have characterized the T-1 and T-2 of acrolein via nuclear magnetic resonance saturation recovery and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill experiments, accordingly, to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of acrolein obtained with MRS. In addition, we have quantified acrolein in water and whole-brain phantom using PRESS MRS and standard post-processing methods. With this potential novel biomarker for assessing TBI, we can investigate methods for predicting acute and chronic neurological dysfunction in humans and animal models.

Moreover, to analyze the secrecy performance comprehensively, two eavesdropping scenarios, i.e., non-colluding eavesdroppers (NCE) and colluding eavesdroppers (CE) are considered.

The analytical analysis and simulation shows that the SCJ-OPA scheme achieves similar performance as the NJ scheme when the total transmit power is small.

The temperature dependence of electrical resistance (R) was measured for the low-T-c phase of (NH3)(y)LixFeSe0.5Te0.5 over a pressure (p) range of 0?14 GPa, and for the high-T-c phase of (NH3)(y)LixFeSe0.5Te0.5 over 0?19 GPa, yielding double-dome superconducting T-c?p phase diagrams, i.e. two superconducting phases (SC-I and SC-II) were found for both the low-T-c and high-T-c phases under pressure. For the low-T-c phase, the maximum T-c was 20.2 K at 0 GPa for SC-I, and 19.9 K at 8.98 GPa for SC-II. For the high-T-c phase, the maximum T-c was 33.0 K at 1.00 GPa for SC-I, and 24.0 K at 11.5?13.2 GPa for SC-II. These results imply that the maximum T-c value of the high pressure phase (SC-II) does not exceed the maximum value of the SC-I, unlike what was shown in the T-c?p phase diagrams of (NH3)(y)LixFeSe and (NH3)(y)CsxFeSe investigated previously. Nevertheless, the double-dome T-c?p phase diagram was found in metal-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5, indicating that this feature is universal in metal-doped FeSe1?zTez. Moreover, no structural phase transitions were observed for either the low-T-c or high-T-c phases of (NH3)(y)LixFeSe0.5Te0.5 over the wide pressure range of 0?15.3 GPa, and the T-c-lattice constant (c) plots for both phases were recorded to determine the critical point separating SC-I and SC-II.",10.1088/1367-2630/ab5034,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the system is finite with length L, we show the existence of a uniform background -phi/(2 pi L) which, though vanishing in the thermodynamic limit, is essential to maintain the conservation of the total integer quantum number. This analysis is also applicable to other systems with fractional quantum numbers, thus providing a mechanism to understand the compatibility of the emergence of fractional quantum number in the thermodynamic limit of a finite system with only integer quantum numbers. For the p-wave pairing case, the Majorana zero mode may occur associated with a real Z(2) soliton, and the fractionalized quantum number is the dimension of the single particle Hilbert space, which turns out to be 1/2.

The AAO is chosen as the leak element because its conductance remains constant from vacuum to atmosphere. The container to be measured is connected to the vacuum system via the AAO leak element. The dynamic differential pressure decay with time between the inlet and outlet of AAO leak assembly was measured and fitted by an exponential function, followed by volume calculation. The volume of two different containers has been obtained using this method with nitrogen, helium, and argon, respectively. The influence of temperature fluctuation on experimental results under vacuum and atmospheric pressure outlet conditions was discussed. For vacuum outlet conditions, the temperature change caused by pressure decay in one single experiment is small enough to satisfy the isothermal hypothesis, which makes the influence of temperature fluctuation on the experimental results negligible. The preliminary results compared with the static expansion method demonstrate that this novel volume measurement technique is accurate, simple and efficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to present the design and construction of a novel holonomic mechanism to simplify the system. Air-based propulsion was applied to a land-based holonomic vehicle. A prototype with three roller balls was developed with a propeller for the propulsion of a triangular holonomic vehicle.

For the establishment of the methodology, the data, including propeller size, rotation per minute, velocity, thrust, efficiency, etc., were measured or calculated.

For the pure qubit, when the NSIT conditions or the CNSIT conditions are not violated, the ANSIT conditions can not be violated, and a suitable conjunction of the CNSIT conditions and the NSIT conditions may be better for testing macrorealism. While for the driven qubit, the non-violation of the CNSIT conditions implies the non-violation of the NSIT conditions, which in turn implies the non-violation of the ANSIT conditions.

Along with the integrated core number increasing, the only shared cache serves too many processing threads to maintain sharing data efficiently. In this work, an enhanced router network is integrated within the private cache level for fast interconnecting sharing data accesses existing in different threads. All sharing data in private cache level can be classified into seven access types by experimental pattern analysis. Then, both shared accesses and thread-crossed accesses can be rapidly detected and dealt with in the proposed router network. As a result, the access latency of private cache is decreased, and a conventional coherence traffic problem is alleviated. The process in the proposed path is composed of three steps. Firstly, the target accesses can be detected by exploring in the router network. Then, the proposed replacement logic can handle those accesses for maintaining data coherence. Finally, those accesses are delivered in the proposed data deliverer. Thus, the harmful data sharing accesses are solved within the first chip layer in 3D-IC structure.
