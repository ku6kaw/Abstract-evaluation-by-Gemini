Further development of large, flexible displays requires a cost-effective manufacturing process for the active-matrix backplane, which contains one transistor per pixel. One way to further reduce costs is to integrate (part of) the display drive circuitry, such as row shift registers, directly on the display substrate. Here, we demonstrate flexible active-matrix monochrome electrophoretic displays based on solution-processed organic transistors on 25-mum-thick polyimide substrates. The displays can be bent to a radius of 1 cm without significant loss in performance. Using the same process flow we prepared row shift registers. With 1,888 transistors, these are the largest organic integrated circuits reported to date. More importantly, the operating frequency of 5 kHz is sufficiently high to allow integration with the display operating at video speed. This work therefore represents a major step towards 'system-on-plastic'.",10.1038/nmat1061,0,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The solution avoids fine-tuning of parameters and anthropic arguments. Instead, k-essence is based on the idea of a dynamical attractor solution which causes it to act as a cosmological constant only at the onset of matter domination. Consequently, k-essence overtakes the matter density and induces cosmic acceleration at about the present epoch. In this paper, we present the basic theory of k-essence and dynamical attractors based on evolving scalar fields with nonlinear kinetic energy terms in the action.

J,"Kirilyuk, A; Kimel, AV; Rasing, T",Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic order,"The interaction of subpicosecond laser pulses with magnetically ordered materials has developed into a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. From the discovery of subpicosecond demagnetization over a decade ago to the recent demonstration of magnetization reversal by a single 40 fs laser pulse, the manipulation of magnetic order by ultrashort laser pulses has become a fundamentally challenging topic with a potentially high impact for future spintronics, data storage and manipulation, and quantum computation. Understanding the underlying mechanisms implies understanding the interaction of photons with charges, spins, and lattice, and the angular momentum transfer between them. This paper will review the progress in this field of laser manipulation of magnetic order in a systematic way. Starting with a historical introduction, the interaction of light with magnetically ordered matter is discussed. By investigating metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics, the roles of (nearly) free electrons, charge redistributions, and spin-orbit and spin-lattice interactions can partly be separated, and effects due to heating can be distinguished from those that are not. It will be shown that there is a fundamental distinction between processes that involve the actual absorption of photons and those that do not. It turns out that for the latter, the polarization of light plays an essential role in the manipulation of the magnetic moments at the femtosecond time scale. Thus, circularly and linearly polarized pulses are shown to act as strong transient magnetic field pulses originating from the nonabsorptive inverse Faraday and inverse Cotton-Mouton effects, respectively. The recent progress in the understanding of magneto-optical effects on the femtosecond time scale together with the mentioned inverse, optomagnetic effects promises a bright future for this field of ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic order or femtomagnetism.",10.1103/RevModPhys.82.2731,6,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes

However, the hydrophilicity of MXene films may affect their stability and reliability when applied in moist or wet environments. Herein, for the first time, an efficient and facile approach is reported to fabricate freestanding, flexible, and hydrophobic MXene foam with reasonable strength by assembling MXene sheets into films followed by a hydrazine-induced foaming process. In striking contrast to well-known hydrophilic MXene materials, the MXene foams surprisingly exhibit hydrophobic surfaces and outstanding water resistance and durability. More interestingly, a much enhanced EMI-shielding effectiveness of approximate to 70 dB is achieved for the lightweight MXene foam as compared to its unfoamed film counterpart (53 dB) due to the highly efficient wave attenuation in the favorable porous structure. Therefore, the hydrophobic, flexible, and lightweight MXene foam with an excellent EMI-shielding performance is highly promising for applications in aerospace and portable and wearable smart electronics.",10.1002/adma.201702367,8,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

The constants in the LJ potential are different for graphene-graphene and C-60-C-60 interactions. From these, the constants for tube-C-60 interactions were estimated using averaging rules from the theory of dispersion forces. For tubes in ropes, the cohesive energy per unit length, the compressibility, and the equilibrium separation distance were computed as a function of tube radius. For a C-60 molecule interacting with tubes, the binding energy inside a tube was much higher than on a tube or at the tube mouth. Within a tube, the binding energy was highest at a spherically capped end. The potential energies for tubes of all radii, as well as for interactions between C-60 molecules, for a C-60 molecule outside of a nanotube, between a C-60 molecule and a graphene sheet, and between graphene sheets, all fell on the same curve when plotted in terms of certain reduced parameters. Because of this, all the potentials can be represented by a simple analytic form, thereby greatly simplifying all computations of van der Waals interactions in graphitic systems.

Force field descriptions of novel molecules are derived using a multistep process in which results from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are combined with a knowledge-based approach to ensure compatibility (as far as possible) with a specific parameter set of the GROM:OS force field.

The first step of this procedure involved the formation of platinum nanoparticles by reducing PtCl2 With ethylene glycol heated to similar to160 degreesC. Due to their close match in crystal structure and lattice constants, these platinum nanoparticles could serve as seeds for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of silver that was produced in the solution via the reduction of AgNO3 with ethylene glycol. When surfactants such as poly(vinyl pyrrolldone) (PVP) were present in this solution, the silver could be directed to grow into uniform nanowires with aspect ratios as high as similar to1000.

We develop a method for obtaining the thermochemistry of the electrochemical water splitting process as a function of the bias directly from the electronic structure calculations. We consider electrodes of Pt(111) and Au(111) in detail and then discuss trends for a series of different metals. We show that the difficult step in the water splitting process is the formation of superoxy-type (OOH) species on the surface by the splitting of a water molecule on top an adsorbed oxygen atom. One conclusion is that this is only possible on metal surfaces that are (partly) oxidized. We show that the binding energies of the different intermediates are linearly correlated for a number of metals. In a simple analysis, where the linear relations are assumed to be obeyed exactly, this leads to a universal relationship between the catalytic rate and the oxygen binding energy. Finally, we conclude that for systems obeying these relations, there is a limit to how good a water splitting catalyst an oxidized metal surface can become. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In hierarchical networks, the degree of clustering characterizing the different groups follows a strict scaling law, which can be used to identify the presence of a hierarchical organization in real networks.

Jaguar focuses on computational methods with reasonable computational scaling with the size of the system, such as density functional theory (DFT) and local second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory. The favorable scaling of the methods and the high efficiency of the program make it possible to conduct routine computations involving several thousand molecular orbitals. This performance is achieved through a utilization of the pseudospectral approximation and several levels of parallelization. The speed advantages are beneficial for applying Jaguar in biomolecular computational modeling. Additionally, owing to its superior wave function guess for transition-metal-containing systems, Jaguar finds applications in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry. The emphasis on larger systems and transition metal elements paves the way toward developing Jaguar for its use in materials science modeling. The article describes the historical and new features of Jaguar, such as improved parallelization of many modules, innovations in ab initio pKa prediction, and new semiempirical corrections for nondynamic correlation errors in DFT. Jaguar applications in drug discovery, materials science, force field parameterization, and other areas of computational research are reviewed. Timing benchmarks and other results obtained from the most recent Jaguar code are provided. The article concludes with a discussion of challenges and directions for future development of the program.

A complete drain current pinch-off characteristic was also obtained for VGS < -20 V, and the three-terminal off-state breakdown voltage was over 250 V. A low drain leakage current of 3 mu A at the off-state led to a high on/off drain current ratio of about 10000.

J,"Sheppard, D; Terrell, R; Henkelman, G",Optimization methods for finding minimum energy paths,"A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum energy pathways (MEPs) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).

J,"Spalart, PR; Deck, S; Shur, ML; Squires, KD; Strelets, MK; Travin, A","A new version of detached-eddy simulation, resistant to ambiguous grid densities","Detached-eddy simulation (DES) is well understood in thin boundary layers, with the turbulence model in its Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) mode and flattened grid cells, and in regions of massive separation, with the turbulence model in its large-eddy simulation (LES) mode and grid cells close to isotropic. However its initial formulation, denoted DES97 from here on, can exhibit an incorrect behavior in thick boundary layers and shallow separation regions. This behavior begins when the grid spacing parallel to the wall Delta(parallel to) becomes less than the boundary-layer thickness delta, either through grid refinement or boundary-layer thickening. The grid spacing is then fine enough for the DES length scale to follow the LES branch (and therefore lower the eddy viscosity below the RANS level), but resolved Reynolds stresses deriving from velocity fluctuations (""LES content"") have not replaced the modeled Reynolds stresses. LES content may be lacking because the resolution is not fine enough to fully support it, and/or because of delays in its generation by instabilities. The depleted stresses reduce the skin friction, which can lead to premature separation. For some research studies in small domains, Delta(parallel to) is made much smaller than delta, and LES content is generated intentionally. However for natural DES applications in useful domains, it is preferable to over-ride the DES limiter and maintain RANS behavior in boundary layers, independent of Delta(parallel to) relative to delta. For this purpose, a new version of the technique - referred to as DDES, for Delayed DES - is presented which is based on a simple modification to DES97, similar to one proposed by Menter and Kuntz for the shear-stress transport (SST) model, but applicable to other models. Tests in boundary layers, on a single and a multi-element airfoil, a cylinder, and a backward-facing step demonstrate that RANS function is indeed maintained in thick boundary layers, without preventing LES function after massive separation. The new formulation better fulfills the intent of DES. Two other issues are discussed: the use of DES as a wall model in LES of attached flows, in which the known log-layer mismatch is not resolved by DDES; and a correction that is helpful at low cell Reynolds numbers.",10.1007/s00162-006-0015-0,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional evidence that the preferred sites of interaction with water molecules are the anions has been obtained from the experiments with RTILs of the 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium and 1-butyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazolium cations. Water molecules can also form associated liquid-like formations in RTILs with anions of stronger basicity such as [NO3](-) and [CF3CO2](-). When these RTILs are exposed to air the water concentrations exceed 1.0 mol dm(-3). The strength of H-bonding between water molecules and anions increases in the order [PF6](-) <[SbF6](-) <[BF4](-) <[(CF3SO2)(2)N](-) <[ClO4](-) <[CF3SO3](-) <[NO3](-) <[CF3CO2](-). The energies of this H-bonding were estimated from spectral shifts, with the resulting enthalpies being in the range 8-13 kJ mol(-1). ATR-IR spectroscopy has also been used to study H-bonding between methanol and RTILs.",10.1039/b106900d,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method can also be viewed as providing a holographic reconstruction of the bulk spacetime metric and of bulk fields on this spacetime, out of conformal field theory data. Knowing which sources are turned on is sufficient in order to obtain an asymptotic expansion of the bulk metric and of bulk fields near the boundary to high enough order so that all infrared divergences of the on-shell action are obtained. To continue the holographic reconstruction of the bulk fields one needs new CFT data: the expectation value of the dual operator. In particular, in order to obtain the bulk metric one needs to know the expectation value of stress-energy tensor of the boundary theory.

The solitons were stable in the long term and their number could be controlled via pump-laser detuning. These observations are in agreement with numerical simulations and soliton theory.

The strengths of the interactions generally correlate well with the magnitudes of the positive and negative electrostatic potentials of the sigma-hole and the negative site. In certain instances, however, polarizabilities must be taken into account explicitly, as the polarization of the negative site reaches a level that can be viewed as a degree of dative sharing (coordinate covalence).

J,"Arkani-Hamed, N; Finkbeiner, DP; Slatyer, TR; Weiner, N",A theory of dark matter,"We propose a comprehensive theory of dark matter that explains the recent proliferation of unexpected observations in high-energy astrophysics. Cosmic ray spectra from ATIC and PAMELA require a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle). with mass M-chi similar to 500-800 GeV that annihilates into leptons at a level well above that expected from a thermal relic. Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Limits on (p) over bar and pi(0)-gamma's constrain the hadronic channels allowed for dark matter. Taken together, we argue these facts imply the presence of a new force in the dark sector, with a Compton wavelength m(phi)(-1) less than or similar to 1 GeV-1. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the annihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak-scale annihilation cross section during dark matter freeze-out in the early universe. If the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier phi, its low mass can make hadronic modes kinematically inaccessible, forcing decays dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a non-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and splittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m(phi) similar to MeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to explain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the INTEGRAL satellite; the light boson invoked by XDM to mediate a large inelastic scattering cross section is identified with the phi here. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected, providing a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter (iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld enhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at redshift similar to 10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history of the universe. Because of the enhanced cross section, detection of substructure is more probable than with a conventional WIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way subhalos can increase the substructure annihilation signal by an additional order of magnitude or more.",10.1103/PhysRevD.79.015014,56,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The sensitivity indices are related to the decomposition of the variance of y into terms either due to each xi taken singularly (first order indices), as well as into terms due to the cooperative effects of more than one xi. In this paper we assume that one has computed the full set of first order sensitivity indices as well as the full set of total-order sensitivity indices (a fairly common strategy in sensitivity analysis), and show that in this case the same set of model evaluations can be used to compute double estimates of: the total effect of two factors taken to-ether, for all such ((k)(2)) couples, where k is the dimensionality of the model; the total effect of k - 2 factors taken together, for all ((k)(2)) such (k - 2) ples.

J,"Lu, YY; Tu, ZY; Archer, LA",Stable lithium electrodeposition in liquid and nanoporous solid electrolytes,"Rechargeable lithium, sodium and aluminium metal-based batteries are among the most versatile platforms for high-energy, cost-effective electrochemical energy storage. Non-uniform metal deposition and dendrite formation on the negative electrode during repeated cycles of charge and discharge are major hurdles to commercialization of energy-storage devices based on each of these chemistries. A long-held view is that unstable electrodeposition is a consequence of inherent characteristics of these metals and their inability to form uniform electrodeposits on surfaces with inevitable defects. We report on electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolytes. We find that simple liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends exhibit stable long-term cycling at room temperature, often with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge and thousands of operating hours. We rationalize these observations with the help of surface energy data for the electrolyte/lithium interface and impedance analysis of the interface during different stages of cell operation. Our findings provide support for an important recent theoretical prediction that the surface mobility of lithium is significantly enhanced in the presence of lithium halide salts.

J,"Arvanitaki, A; Dimopoulos, S; Dubovsky, S; Kaloper, N; March-Russell, J",String axiverse,"String theory suggests the simultaneous presence of many ultralight axions, possibly populating each decade of mass down to the Hubble scale 10(-33) eV. Conversely the presence of such a plenitude of axions (an axiverse) would be evidence for string theory, since it arises due to the topological complexity of the extra-dimensional manifold and is ad hoc in a theory with just the four familiar dimensions. We investigate how several upcoming astrophysical experiments will be observationally exploring the possible existence of such axions over a vast mass range from 10(-33) eV to 10(-10) eV. Axions with masses between 10(-33) eV to 10(-28) eV can cause a rotation of the cosmic microwave background polarization that is constant throughout the sky. The predicted rotation angle is independent of the scale of inflation and the axion decay constant, and is of order alpha similar to 1/137 -within reach of the just launched Planck satellite. Axions in the mass range 10(-28) eV to 10(-18) eV give rise to multiple steps in the matter power spectrum, providing us with a snapshot of the axiverse that will be probed by galaxy surveys-such as BOSS, and 21 cm line tomography. Axions in the mass range 10(-22) eV to 10(-10) eV can affect the dynamics and gravitational wave emission of rapidly rotating astrophysical black holes through the Penrose superradiance process. When the axion Compton wavelength is of order of the black hole size, the axions develop superradiant atomic bound states around the black hole nucleus. Their occupation number grows exponentially by extracting rotational energy and angular momentum from the ergosphere, culminating in a rotating Bose-Einstein axion condensate emitting gravitational waves. For black holes lighter than similar to 10(7) solar masses accretion cannot replenish the spin of the black hole, creating mass gaps in the spectrum of rapidly rotating black holes that diagnose the presence of destabilizing axions. In particular, the highly rotating black hole in the X-ray binary LMC X-1 implies an upper limit on the decay constant of the QCD axion f(a) <= 2 X 10(17) GeV, much below the Planck mass. This reach can be improved down to the grand unification scale f(a) less than or similar to 2 X 10(16) GeV, by observing smaller stellar mass black holes.",10.1103/PhysRevD.81.123530,69,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Riplinger, C; Neese, F",An efficient and near linear scaling pair natural orbital based local coupled cluster method,"In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 10(5)-10(6) relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e. g., >100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below <0.05%, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD (""domain based LPNO-CCSD""). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured >8800 basis functions and >450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

The positive region on X corresponds to the electronically-depleted outer lobe of the half-filled p-type orbital of X that is involved in forming the covalent bond to R. This depletion is labeled a sigma-hole. The resulting positive electrostatic potential is along the extension of the R-X bond, which accounts for the directionality of halogen bonding. Positive sigma-holes can also be found on covalently-bonded Group IV-VI atoms, which can similarly interact electrostatically with negative sites. Since positive sigma-holes often exist in conjunction with negative potentials on other portions of the atom's surface, such atoms can interact electrostatically with both nucleophiles and electrophiles, as has been observed in surveys of crystallographic structures.

In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting ""universal"" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a ""plasmon ruler equation"" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band.

J,"Lim, CW; Zhang, G; Reddy, JN",A higher-order nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and its applications in wave propagation,"In recent years there have been many papers that considered the effects of material length scales in the study of mechanics of solids at micro- and/or nano-scales. There are a number of approaches and, among them, one set of papers deals with Eringen's differential nonlocal model and another deals with the strain gradient theories. The modified couple stress theory, which also accounts for a material length scale, is a form of a strain gradient theory. The large body of literature that has come into existence in the last several year has created significant confusion among researchers about the length scales that these various theories contain. The present paper has the objective of establishing the fact that the length scales present in nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory describe two entirely different physical characteristics of materials and structures at nanoscale. By using two principle kernel functions, the paper further presents a theory with application examples which relates the classical nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and it results in a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient theory. In this theory, a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient elasticity system which considers higher-order stress gradients and strain gradient nonlocality is proposed. It is based on the nonlocal effects of the strain field and first gradient strain field. This theory intends to generalize the classical nonlocal elasticity theory by introducing a higher-order strain tensor with nonlocality into the stored energy function. The theory is distinctive because the classical nonlocal stress theory does not include nonlocality of higher-order stresses while the common strain gradient theory only considers local higher-order strain gradients without nonlocal effects in a global sense. By establishing the constitutive relation within the thermodynamic framework, the governing equations of equilibrium and all boundary conditions are derived via the variational approach. Two additional kinds of parameters, the higher-order nonlocal parameters and the nonlocal gradient length coefficients are introduced to account for the size-dependent characteristics of nonlocal gradient materials at nanoscale. To illustrate its application values, the theory is applied for wave propagation in a nonlocal strain gradient system and the new dispersion relations derived are presented through examples for wave propagating in Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko nanobeams. The numerical results based on the new nonlocal strain gradient theory reveal some new findings with respect to lattice dynamics and wave propagation experiment that could not be matched by both the classical nonlocal stress model and the contemporary strain gradient theory. Thus, this higher-order nonlocal strain gradient model provides an explanation to some observations in the classical and nonlocal stress theories as well as the strain gradient theory in these aspects.

The governing equations, therefore, can be discretized and solved on a regular mesh thus retaining the advantages and the efficiency of the standard solution procedures. Two different forcings are tested showing that while the quality of the results is essentially the same in both cases, the efficiency of the calculation strongly depends on the particular expression. A major issue is the interpolation of the forcing over the grid that determines the accuracy of the scheme; this ranges from zeroth-order for the most commonly used interpolations up to second-order for an ad hoc velocity interpolation. The present scheme has been used to simulate several hows whose results have been validated by experiments and other results available in the literature. Finally in the last example we show the flow inside an IC piston/cylinder assembly at high Reynolds number; to our knowledge this is the first example in which the immersed boundary technique is applied to a full three-dimensional complex how with moving boundaries and with a Reynolds number high enough to require a subgrid-scale turbulence model.

Intensive UV light emission peaked around 3.27 eV was observed at room temperature, which was assigned to emission from free exciton under low excitation intensity. The observed room temperature UV emission was ascribed to the decrease in structure defects as compared to bulk ZnO materials, and in particularly to the size effect in the ZnO wires.

J,"Nakagawa, N; Hwang, HY; Muller, DA",Why some interfaces cannot be sharp,"A central goal of modern materials physics and nanoscience is the control of materials and their interfaces to atomic dimensions. For interfaces between polar and nonpolar layers, this goal is thwarted by a polar catastrophe that forces an interfacial reconstruction. In traditional semiconductors, this reconstruction is achieved by an atomic disordering and stoichiometry change at the interface, but a new option is available in multivalent oxides: if the electrons can move, the atoms do not have to. Using atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy, we have examined the microscopic distribution of charge and ions across the (001) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. We find that there is a fundamental asymmetry between the ionically compensated AlO2/SrO/TiO2 interface, and the electronically compensated AlO2/ LaO/TiO2 interface, both in interfacial sharpness and charge density. This suggests a general strategy to design sharp interfaces, remove interfacial screening charges, control the band offset and, hence, markedly improve the performance of oxide devices.",10.1038/nmat1569,95,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

This article describes a material strategy for a type of bio-interfaced system that relies on ultrathin electronics supported by bioresorbable substrates of silk fibroin. Mounting such devices on tissue and then allowing the silk to dissolve and resorb initiates a spontaneous, conformal wrapping process driven by capillary forces at the biotic/abiotic interface. Specialized mesh designs and ultrathin forms for the electronics ensure minimal stresses on the tissue and highly conformal coverage, even for complex curvilinear surfaces, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical studies. In vivo, neural mapping experiments on feline animal models illustrate one mode of use for this class of technology.
