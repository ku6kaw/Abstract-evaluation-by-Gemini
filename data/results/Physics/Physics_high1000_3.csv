J,"Grimme, S",Semiempirical hybrid density functional with perturbative second-order correlation,"A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (a(x)) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G2/97 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum a(x) is found to be quite large (53% with c=27%) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G2/97 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5 kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minium errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10-20 kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.",10.1063/1.2148954,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have discovered bulk superconductivity at T-c = 38 K in (Ba1-xKx)Fe2As2 with x approximate to 0.4. The parent compound BaFe2As2 crystallizes in the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure, which consists of (FeAs)(delta-) iron arsenide layers separated by Ba2+ ions. BaFe2As2 is a poor metal and exhibits a spin density wave anomaly at 140 K. By substituting Ba2+ for K+ ions we have introduced holes in the (FeAs)(-) layers, which suppress the anomaly and induce superconductivity. The T-c of 38 K in (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2 is the highest in hole doped iron arsenide superconductors so far.

A salient feature of this review is a critical comparison between carrier transport in graphene and in two-dimensional semiconductor systems (e. g., heterostructures, quantum wells, inversion layers) so that the unique features of graphene electronic properties arising from its gapless, massless, chiral Dirac spectrum are highlighted. Experiment and theory, as well as quantum and semiclassical transport, are discussed in a synergistic manner in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective. Although the emphasis of the review is on those aspects of graphene transport where reasonable consensus exists in the literature, open questions are discussed as well. Various physical mechanisms controlling transport are described in depth including long-range charged impurity scattering, screening, short-range defect scattering, phonon scattering, many-body effects, Klein tunneling, minimum conductivity at the Dirac point, electron-hole puddle formation, p-n junctions, localization, percolation, quantum-classical crossover, midgap states, quantum Hall effects, and other phenomena.",10.1103/RevModPhys.83.407,2,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no

It is shown that some of such theories may pass the Solar System tests. On the same time, it is demonstrated that they have quite rich cosmological structure: they may naturally describe the effective (cosmological constant, quintessence or phantom) late-time era with a possible transition from decceleration to acceleration thanks to gravitational terms which increase with scalar curvature decrease. The possibility to explain the coincidence problem as the manifestation of the universe expansion in such models is mentioned.

Theoretic studies show that intentional doping is a promising route for this goal, and the doped graphene might promise fascinating properties and widespread applications. However, there is no experimental example and electrical testing of the substitutionally doped graphene up to date. Here, we synthesize the N-doped graphene by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. We find that most of them are few-layer graphene, although single-layer graphene can be occasionally detected. As doping accompanies with the recombination of carbon atoms into graphene in the CVD process, N atoms can be substitutionally doped into the graphene lattice, which is hard to realize by other synthetic methods. Electrical measurements show that the N-doped graphene exhibits an n-type behavior, indicating substitutional doping can effectively modulate the electrical properties of graphene.

This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that the Wstate retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out.

J,"Look, DC",Recent advances in ZnO materials and devices,"Wurtzitic ZnO is a wide-bandgap (3.437 eV at 2 K) semiconductor which has many applications, such as piezoelectric transducers, varistors, phosphors, and transparent conducting films. Most of these applications require only polycrystalline material; however, recent successes in producing large-area single crystals have opened up the possibility of producing blue and W light emitters, and high-temperature, high-power transistors. The main advantages of ZnO as a light emitter are its large exciton binding energy (60 meV), and the existence of well-developed bulk and epitaxial growth processes; for electronic applications, its attractiveness lies in having high breakdown strength and high saturation velocity. optical UV lasing, at both low and high temperatures, has already been demonstrated. although efficient electrical lasing must await the further development of good, p-type material. ZnO is also much more resistant to radiation damage than are other common semiconductor materials? such as Si, GaAs, CdS, and even GaN; thus, it should be useful for space applications.

Graphite is a practical anode material used for LIB, because of its capability for reversible lithium ion intercalation in the layered crystals, and the structural similarities of GNS to graphite may provide another type of intercalation anode compound. While the accommodation of lithium in these layered compounds is influenced by the layer spacing between the graphene nanosheets, control of the intergraphene sheet distance through interacting molecules such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) or fullerenes (C-60) might be crucial for enhancement of the storage capacity. The specific capacity of GNS was found to be 540 mAh/g, which is much larger than that of graphite, and this was increased up to 730 mAh/g and 784 mAh/g, respectively, by the incorporation of macromolecules of CNT and C-60 to the GNS.",10.1021/nl800957b,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an aid to the modeling of such materials, a new framework for the basic equations of continuum mechanics, called the 'peridynamic' formulation, is proposed. The propagation of linear stress waves in the new theory is discussed, and wave dispersion relations are derived. Material stability and its connection with wave propagation is investigated, It is demonstrated by an example that the reformulated approach permits the solution of fracture problems using the same equations either on or off the crack surface or crack tip.

J,"Ritchie, RO",The conflicts between strength and toughness,"The attainment of both strength and toughness is a vital requirement for most structural materials; unfortunately these properties are generally mutually exclusive. Although the quest continues for stronger and harder materials, these have little to no use as bulk structural materials without appropriate fracture resistance. It is the lower-strength, and hence higher-toughness, materials that find use for most safety-critical applications where premature or, worse still, catastrophic fracture is unacceptable. For these reasons, the development of strong and tough (damage-tolerant) materials has traditionally been an exercise in compromise between hardness versus ductility. Drawing examples from metallic glasses, natural and biological materials, and structural and biomimetic ceramics, we examine some of the newer strategies in dealing with this conflict. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between the mechanisms that individually contribute to strength and toughness, noting that these phenomena can originate from very different lengthscales in a material's structural architecture. We show how these new and natural materials can defeat the conflict of strength versus toughness and achieve unprecedented levels of damage tolerance within their respective material classes.",10.1038/NMAT3115,14,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes
J,"Lam, DCC; Yang, F; Chong, ACM; Wang, J; Tong, P",Experiments and theory in strain gradient elasticity,"Conventional strain-based mechanics theory does not account for contributions from strain gradients. Failure to include strain gradient contributions can lead to underestimates of stresses and size-dependent behaviors in small-scale structures. In this paper, a new set of higher-order metrics is developed to characterize strain gradient behaviors. This set enables the application of the higher-order equilibrium conditions to strain gradient elasticity theory and reduces the number of independent elastic length scale parameters from five to three. On the basis of this new strain gradient theory, a strain gradient elastic bending theory for plane-strain beams is developed. Solutions for cantilever bending with a moment and line force applied at the free end are constructed based on the new higher-order bending theory. In classical bending theory, the normalized bending rigidity is independent of the length and thickness of the beam. In the solutions developed from the higher-order bending theory, the normalized higher-order bending rigidity has a new dependence on the thickness of the beam and on a higher-order bending parameter, b(h). To determine the significance of the size dependence, we fabricated micron-sized beams and conducted bending tests using a nanoindenter. We found that the normalized beam rigidity exhibited an inverse squared dependence on the beam's thickness as predicted by the strain gradient elastic bending theory, and that the higher-order bending parameter, bh, is on the micron-scale. Potential errors from the experiments, model and fabrication were estimated and determined to be small relative to the observed increase in beam's bending rigidity. The present results indicate that the elastic strain gradient effect is significant in elastic deformation of small-scale structures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We find that there exist three-dimensional (3D) topologically nontrivial insulators or superconductors in five out of ten symmetry classes introduced in seminal work by Altland and Zirnbauer within the context of random matrix theory, more than a decade ago. One of these is the recently introduced Z(2) topological insulator in the symplectic (or spin-orbit) symmetry class. We show that there exist precisely four more topological insulators. For these systems, all of which are time-reversal invariant in three dimensions, the space of insulating ground states satisfying certain discrete symmetry properties is partitioned into topological sectors that are separated by quantum phase transitions. Three of the above five topologically nontrivial phases can be realized as time-reversal invariant superconductors. In these the different topological sectors are characterized by an integer winding number defined in momentum space. When such 3D topological insulators are terminated by a two-dimensional surface, they support a number (which may be an arbitrary nonvanishing even number for singlet pairing) of Dirac fermion (Majorana fermion when spin-rotation symmetry is completely broken) surface modes which remain gapless under arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian that preserve the characteristic discrete symmetries, including disorder. In particular, these surface modes completely evade Anderson localization from random impurities. These topological phases can be thought of as three-dimensional analogs of well-known paired topological phases in two spatial dimensions such as the spinless chiral (p(x)+/- ip(y))-wave superconductor (or Moore-Read Pfaffian state). In the corresponding topologically nontrivial (analogous to ""weak pairing"") and topologically trivial (analogous to ""strong pairing"") 3D phases, the wave functions exhibit markedly distinct behavior.

The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron-neutral collisions and electron-electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems.

Quantum computers, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination.

J,"Calabrese, P; Cardy, J",Entanglement entropy and quantum field theory,"We carry out a systematic study of entanglement entropy in relativistic quantum field theory. This is defined as the von Neumann entropy S-A = - Trrho(A) log rho(A) corresponding to the reduced density matrix rho(A) of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result S-A similar to (c/3) log l of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length l in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length. is large but finite, we show that S-A similar to A(c/6) log xi, where A is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.",10.1088/1742-5468/2004/06/P06002,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Ferrari, AC; Robertson, J","Resonant Raman spectroscopy of disordered, amorphous, and diamondlike carbon","The Raman spectra of a wide range of disordered and amorphous carbons have been measured under excitation from 785 to 229 nm. The dispersion of peak positions and intensities with excitation wavelength is used to understand the nature of resonant Raman scattering in carbon and how to derive the local bonding and disorder from the Raman spectra. The spectra show three basic features, the D and G around 1600 and 1350 cm(-1) for visible excitation and an extra T peak, for UV excitation, at similar to 1060 cm(-1). The G peak, due to the stretching motion of sp(2) pairs, is a good indicator of disorder. It shows dispersion only in amorphous networks, with a dispersion rate proportional to the degree of disorder. Its shift well above 1600 cm(-1) under UV excitation indicates the presence of sp(2) chains. The dispersion of the D peak is strongest in ordered carbons. It shows little dispersion in amorphous carbon, so that in UV excitation it becomes like a density-of-states feature of vibrations of sp(2) ringlike structures. The intensity ratio I(D)/I(G) falls with increasing UV excitation in all forms of carbon, with a faster decrease in more ordered carbons, so that it is generally small for UV excitation. The T peak, due to sp(3) vibrations, only appears in UV Raman, lying around 1060 cm(-1) for H-free carbons and around 980 cm(-1) in hydrogenated carbons. In hydrogenated carbons, the sp(3) C-H-x stretching modes around 2920 cm(-1) can be clearly detected for UV excitation. This assignment is confirmed by deuterium substitution.",10.1103/PhysRevB.64.075414,27,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

J,"Smith, DR; Vier, DC; Koschny, T; Soukoulis, CM",Electromagnetic parameter retrieval from inhomogeneous metamaterials,"We discuss the validity of standard retrieval methods that assign bulk electromagnetic properties, such as the electric permittivity epsilon and the magnetic permeability mu, from calculations of the scattering (S) parameters for finite-thickness samples. S-parameter retrieval methods have recently become the principal means of characterizing artificially structured metamaterials, which, by nature, are inherently inhomogeneous. While the unit cell of a metamaterial can be made considerably smaller than the free space wavelength, there remains a significant variation of the phase across the unit cell at operational frequencies in nearly all metamaterial structures reported to date. In this respect, metamaterials do not rigorously satisfy an effective medium limit and are closer conceptually to photonic crystals. Nevertheless, we show here that a modification of the standard S-parameter retrieval procedure yields physically reasonable values for the retrieved electromagnetic parameters, even when there is significant inhomogeneity within the unit cell of the structure. We thus distinguish a metamaterial regime, as opposed to the effective medium or photonic crystal regimes, in which a refractive index can be rigorously established but where the wave impedance can only be approximately defined. We present numerical simulations on typical metamaterial structures to illustrate the modified retrieval algorithm and the impact on the retrieved material parameters. We find that no changes to the standard retrieval procedures are necessary when the inhomogeneous unit cell is symmetric along the propagation axis; however, when the unit cell does not possess this symmetry, a modified procedure-in which a periodic structure is assumed-is required to obtain meaningful electromagnetic material parameters.",10.1103/PhysRevE.71.036617,34,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

J,"Miroshnichenko, AE; Flach, S; Kivshar, YS",Fano resonances in nanoscale structures,"Modern nanotechnology allows one to scale down various important devices (sensors, chips, fibers, etc.) and thus opens up new horizons for their applications. The efficiency of most of them is based on fundamental physical phenomena, such as transport of wave excitations and resonances. Short propagation distances make phase-coherent processes of waves important. Often the scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths and, as a consequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference corresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant suppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and theoretical work has revealed such patterns in different physical settings. The purpose of this review is to relate resonant scattering to Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of the main features of the Fano resonance is its asymmetric line profile. The asymmetry originates from a close coexistence of resonant transmission and resonant reflection and can be reduced to the interaction of a discrete (localized) state with a continuum of propagation modes. The basic concepts of Fano resonances are introduced, their geometrical and/or dynamical origin are explained, and theoretical and experimental studies of light propagation in photonic devices, charge transport through quantum dots, plasmon scattering in Josephson-junction networks, and matter-wave scattering in ultracold atom systems, among others are reviewed.",10.1103/RevModPhys.82.2257,43,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no

Due to their unique physicochemical, optical and electrical properties, a wide variety of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have been designed to drive various reduction and oxidation reactions under light irradiation with suitable wavelengths. In this review, we have systematically summarized the photocatalytic fundamentals of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, including fundamental mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis, advantages, challenges and the design considerations of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. The versatile properties of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are highlighted, including their crystal structural, surface phisicochemical, stability, optical, adsorption, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and electronic properties. Various design strategies are also thoroughly reviewed, including band-gap engineering, defect control, dimensionality tuning, pore texture tailoring, surface sensitization, heterojunction construction, co-catalyst and nanocarbon loading. Many important applications are also addressed, such as photocatalytic water splitting (H-2 evolution and overall water splitting), degradation of pollutants, carbon dioxide reduction, selective organic transformations and disinfection. Through reviewing the important state-of-the-art advances on this topic, it may provide new opportunities for designing and constructing highly effective g-C(3)N(4-)based photocatalysts for various applications in photocatalysis and other related fields, such as solar cell, photoelectrocatalysis, electrocatalysis, lithium battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell and separation and purification.

Owing to their superb mechanical and electrical properties, many potential applications have been proposed for them. However, polydispersity and poor solubility in both aqueous and non-aqueous solution impose a considerable challenge for their separation and assembly, which is required for many applications. Here we report our finding of DNA-assisted dispersion and separation of carbon nanotubes. Bundled single-walled carbon nanotubes are effectively dispersed in water by their sonication in the presence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements provide evidence for individually dispersed carbon nanotubes. Molecular modelling suggests that ssDNA can bind to carbon nanotubes through pi-stacking, resulting in helical wrapping to the surface. The binding free energy of ssDNA to carbon nanotubes rivals that of two nanotubes for each other. We also demonstrate that DNA-coated carbon nanotubes can be separated into fractions with different electronic structures by ion-exchange chromatography.

However, traditional algorithms indicate higher complexity for certain pathologic processes associated with random outputs than for healthy dynamics exhibiting long-range correlations. This paradox may be due to the fact that conventional algorithms fail to account for the multiple time scales inherent in healthy physiologic dynamics. We introduce a method to calculate multiscale entropy (MSE) for complex time series. We find that MSE robustly separates healthy and pathologic groups and consistently yields higher values for simulated long-range correlated noise compared to uncorrelated noise.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.068102,61,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes

During the first observing run (O1), from September 12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which ran from November 30, 2016 to August 25, 2017, saw the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral, in addition to the observation of gravitational waves from a total of seven binary black hole mergers, four of which we report here for the first time: GW170729, GW170809, GW170818, and GW170823. For all significant gravitational-wave events, we provide estimates of the source properties. The detected binary black holes have total masses between 18.6(-0.7)(+3.2) M-circle dot and 84.4(-11.1)(+15.8) M-circle dot and range in distance between 320(-110)(+120) and 2840(-1360)(+1400) Mpc. No neutron star-black hole mergers were detected. In addition to highly significant gravitational-wave events, we also provide a list of marginal event candidates with an estimated false-alarm rate less than 1 per 30 days. From these results over the first two observing runs, which include approximately one gravitational-wave detection per 15 days of data searched, we infer merger rates at the 90% confidence intervals of 110 - 3840 Gpc(-3) y(-1) for binary neutron stars and 9.7 - 101 Gpc(-3) y(-1) for binary black holes assuming fixed population distributions and determine a neutron star-black hole merger rate 90% upper limit of 610 Gpc(-3) y(-1).",10.1103/PhysRevX.9.031040,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to graphene, monolayer MoS2 is a non-centrosymmetric material with a direct energy gap(2,5). Strong photoluminescence(2,3) a current on/off ratio exceeding 10(8) in field-effect transistors(6), and efficient valley and spin control by optical helicity(7-9) have recently been demonstrated in this material. Here we report the spectroscopic identification in a monolayer MoS2 field-effect transistor of tightly bound negative trions, a quasiparticle composed of two electrons and a hole. These quasiparticles, which can be optically created with valley and spin polarized holes, have no analogue in conventional semiconductors. They also possess a large binding energy (similar to 20 meV), rendering them significant even at room temperature. Our results open up possibilities both for fundamental studies of many-body interactions and for optoelectronic and valleytronic applications in 2D atomic crystals.",10.1038/NMAT3505,63,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

These new particles are poised to become the `atoms' and `molecules' of tomorrow's materials if they can be successfully assembled into useful structures. Here, we discuss the recent progress made in the synthesis of nanocrystals and colloidal particles and draw analogies between these new particulate building blocks and better-studied molecules and supramolecular objects. We argue for a conceptual framework for these new building blocks based on anisotropy attributes and discuss the prognosis for future progress in exploiting anisotropy for materials design and assembly.",10.1038/nmat1949,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signal was observed with a three-detector network matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 18. The inferred masses of the initial black holes are 30.5(-3.0)(+5.7)M(circle dot) and 25.3(-4.2)(+2.8) M-circle dot (at the 90% credible level). The luminosity distance of the source is 540(-210)(+130) Mpc, corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.11(-0.04)(+0.03). A network of three detectors improves the sky localization of the source, reducing the area of the 90% credible region from 1160 deg(2) using only the two LIGO detectors to 60 deg(2) using all three detectors. For the first time, we can test the nature of gravitational-wave polarizations from the antenna response of the LIGO-Virgo network, thus enabling a new class of phenomenological tests of gravity.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.141101,66,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,

By using a scanning confocal approach, we collect spectral data with spatial resolution, which allows us to directly compare Raman images with scanning force micrographs. Single-layer graphene can be distinguished from double- and few-layer by the width of the D' line: the single peak for single-layer graphene splits into different peaks for the double-layer. These findings are explained using the double-resonant Raman model based on ab initio calculations of the electronic structure and of the phonon dispersion. We investigate the D line intensity and find no defects within the flake. A finite D line response originating from the edges can be attributed either to defects or to the breakdown of translational symmetry.",10.1021/nl061702a,67,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes
J,"Hanson, GW",Dyadic Green's functions and guided surface waves for a surface conductivity model of graphene,"An exact solution is obtained for the electromagnetic field due to an electric current in the presence of a surface conductivity model of graphene. The graphene is represented by an infinitesimally thin, local, and isotropic two- sided conductivity surface. The field is obtained in terms of dyadic Green's functions represented as Sommerfeld integrals. The solution of plane wave reflection and transmission is presented, and surface wave propagation along graphene is studied via the poles of the Sommerfeld integrals. For isolated graphene characterized by complex surface conductivity sigma = sigma' + j sigma"" , a proper transverse- electric surface wave exists if and only if sigma' > 0 (associated with interband conductivity ), and a proper transverse- magnetic surface wave exists for sigma'' < 0 (associated with intraband conductivity). By tuning the chemical potential at infrared frequencies, the sign of sigma'' can be varied, allowing for some control over surface wave properties.

Hydrogen-treated rutile TiO2 (H:TiO2) nanowires were prepared by annealing the pristine TiO2 nanowires in hydrogen atmosphere at various temperatures in a range of 200-550 degrees C. In comparison to pristine TiO2 nanowires, H:TiO2 samples show substantially enhanced photocurrent in the entire potential window. More importantly, H:TiO2 samples have exceptionally low photocurrent saturation potentials of -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs RHE), indicating very efficient charge separation and transportation. The optimized H:TiO2 nanowire sample yields a photocurrent density of similar to 1.97 mA/cm(2) at -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, in 1 M NaOH solution under the illumination of simulated solar light (100 mW/cm(2) from 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter). This photocurrent density corresponds to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of similar to 1.63%. After eliminating the discrepancy between the irradiance of the xenon lamp and solar light, by integrating the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the H:TiO2 nanowire sample with a standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum, the STH efficiency is calculated to be similar to 1.1%, which is the best value for a TiO2 photoanode. IPCE analyses confirm the photocurrent enhancement is mainly due to the improved photoactivity of TiO2 in the UV region. Hydrogen treatment increases the donor density of TiO2 nanowires by 3 orders of magnitudes, via creating a high density of oxygen vacancies that serve as electron donors. Similar enhancements in photocurrent were also observed in anatase H:TiO2 nanotubes. The capability of making highly photoactive H:TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes opens up new opportunities in various areas, including PEC water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.",10.1021/nl201766h,69,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The standard model value for a(mu) includes contributions from virtual QED, weak, and hadronic processes. While the QED processes account for most of the anomaly, the largest theoretical uncertainty, approximate to 0.55 ppm, is associated with first-order hadronic vacuum polarization.

J,"Bao, QL; Zhang, H; Wang, Y; Ni, ZH; Yan, YL; Shen, ZX; Loh, KP; Tang, DY",Atomic-Layer Graphene as a Saturable Absorber for Ultrafast Pulsed Lasers,"The optical conductance of monolayer graphene is defined solely by the fine structure constant, alpha = e(2)/(h) over bar hc (where e is the electron charge, (h) over bar is Dirac's constant and c is the speed of light). The absorbance has been predicted to be independent of frequency. In principle, the interband optical absorbtion in zero-gap graphene could be saturated readily under strong excitation due to Pauli blocking.

In contrast to conventional estimators based on binnings, they are based on entropy estimates from k-nearest neighbor distances. This means that they are data efficient (with k=1 we resolve structures down to the smallest possible scales), adaptive (the resolution is higher where data are more numerous), and have minimal bias. Indeed, the bias of the underlying entropy estimates is mainly due to nonuniformity of the density at the smallest resolved scale, giving typically systematic errors which scale as functions of k/N for N points. Numerically, we find that both families become exact for independent distributions, i.e. the estimator (M) over cap (X,Y) vanishes (up to statistical fluctuations) if mu(x,y)=mu(x)mu(y). This holds for all tested marginal distributions and for all dimensions of x and y. In addition, we give estimators for redundancies between more than two random variables. We compare our algorithms in detail with existing algorithms.

Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and charging energy E-J/E-C. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with E-J/E-C, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control.

Currently used algorithms that identify the community structures in large-scale real-world networks require a priori information such as the number and sizes of communities or are computationally expensive. In this paper we investigate a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and requires neither optimization of a predefined objective function nor prior information about the communities. In our algorithm every node is initialized with a unique label and at every step each node adopts the label that most of its neighbors currently have. In this iterative process densely connected groups of nodes form a consensus on a unique label to form communities. We validate the algorithm by applying it to networks whose community structures are known. We also demonstrate that the algorithm takes an almost linear time and hence it is computationally less expensive than what was possible so far.,10.1103/PhysRevE.76.036106,85,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

Tensile tests on composite films show that 1 wt % nanotube additions result in 36%-42% and similar to 25% increases in elastic modulus and break stress, respectively, indicating significant load transfer across the nanotube-matrix interface. In situ transmission electron microscopy studies provided information regarding composite deformation mechanisms and interfacial bonding between the multiwall nanotubes and polymer matrix.

J,"Kitsak, M; Gallos, LK; Havlin, S; Liljeros, F; Muchnik, L; Stanley, HE; Makse, HA",Identification of influential spreaders in complex networks,"Networks portray a multitude of interactions through which people meet, ideas are spread and infectious diseases propagate within a society(1-5). Identifying the most efficient 'spreaders' in a network is an important step towards optimizing the use of available resources and ensuring the more efficient spread of information. Here we show that, in contrast to common belief, there are plausible circumstances where the best spreaders do not correspond to the most highly connected or the most central people(6-10). Instead, we find that the most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis(11-13), and that when multiple spreaders are considered simultaneously the distance between them becomes the crucial parameter that determines the extent of the spreading. Furthermore, we show that infections persist in the high-k shells of the network in the case where recovered individuals do not develop immunity. Our analysis should provide a route for an optimal design of efficient dissemination strategies.",10.1038/NPHYS1746,97,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Maldacena, J",Non-gaussian features of primordial fluctuations in single field inflationary models,We compute the three point correlation functions for primordial scalar and tensor fluctuations in single field inflationary models. We obtain explicit expressions in the slow roll limit where the answer is given terms of the two usual slow roll parameters. In a particular limit the three point functions are determined completely by the tilt of the spectrum of the two point functions. We also make some remarks on the relation of this computation to dS/CFT and AdS/CFT. We emphasize that (A)dS/CFT can be viewed as a statement about the wavefunction of the universe.,10.1088/1126-6708/2003/05/013,98,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes

The highest efficiencies have been achieved using blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a fullerene derivative(8-12), but performance depends critically on the material properties and processing conditions. This variability is believed to be influenced by the self-organizing properties of P3HT, which means that both optical(13,14) and electronic(15,16) properties are sensitive to the molecular packing. However, the relationship between molecular nanostructure, optoelectronic properties of the blend material and device performance has not yet been demonstrated. Here we focus on the influence of polymer regioregularity (RR) on the molecular nanostructure, and hence on the resulting material properties and device performance. We find a strong influence of RR on solar-cell performance, which can be attributed to enhanced optical absorption and transport resulting from the organization of P3HT chains and domains. Further optimization of devices using the highest RR material resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 4.4%, even without optimization of electrodes(7).",10.1038/nmat1574,99,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes
