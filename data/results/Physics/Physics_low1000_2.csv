0,"Light Emitting Diodes (LED) are highly energy efficient and offer long-life times for display applications. Long life and minimal energy consumption are often the most attractive advantages for electronic devices. Because LEDs are based on compound semiconductors, which explore the direct transition between the conduction and valance band edges, thermal energy loss can be minimized during operation. However, even though these types of LEDs are based on direct transition type semiconductors, thermal energy is still emitted during operation owing to forward conduction and reverse leakage currents. This research proposes capturing this energy loss through thermoelectric module-based energy recycling methods to improve the energy efficiency of LED applications, achieving savings of up to 18%. Additional analysis was performed on high power LED sources resulting in the manufacture of a high-power LED light grid system.",yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
1,"We study the stability and dynamics of traveling-front solutions of a modified Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation arising in the modeling of nanoscale ripple patterns that form when a nominally flat solid surface is bombarded with a broad ion beam at an oblique angle of incidence. Structurally, the linearized operators associated with these fronts have unstable essential spectrum-corresponding to instability of the spatially asymptotic states - and stable point spectrum-corresponding to stability of the transition profile of the front. We show that these waves are linearly orbitally asymptotically stable in appropriate exponentially weighted spaces. While the technical device of exponential weights allows us to accommodate the unstable essential spectrum of individual waves in our linear analysis, it does not shed light on the long-time pattern formation that is observed experimentally and in numerical simulations. To begin to address this issue, we consider a periodic array of unstable front and back solutions. While not an exact solution of the governing equation, this periodic pattern mimics experimentally observed phenomena. Our numerical experiments suggest that the convecting instabilities associated with each individual wave are damped as they pass through transition layers and that this stabilization mechanism underlies the pattern formation seen in experiments.

2,"This study proposes a simple and low-cost method of improving the photoresponse properties of ZnO nanorods by selecting optimal seed layer type and precursor concentration, which are parameters significantly influencing growth rate and morphology. When 0.025 M aqueous precursor solution was used, the obtained ZnO nanorods exhibited an improved vertical orientation and growth rate, showing directional growth along the (002) plane, as confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, ZnO nanorods (NR1) obtained on the seed layer prepared by oxidation of Zn films exhibited the faster growth rate than those (NR2) synthesized on the seed layer prepared by spin-coating method due to having access to a sufficient amount of Zn2+ ions. The ZnO nanorods obtained at a precursor concentration of 0.025 M exhibited the highest photocurrent, dark current, and photoresponsivity, with the photoresponsivity and photosensitivity of ZnO NR1 exceeding those of ZnO NR2, owing to the larger surface area.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes
3,"Magnesium hydride has a high hydrogen storage capacity (7.6 wt.%), and is cheap and lightweight, thus advantageous as a hydrogen storage alloy. However, Mg-based hydrides undergo hydrogenation/dehydrogenation at high temperature and pressure due to their thermodynamic stability and high oxidation reactivity. Various attempts have been made to lower the reaction rate and dehydrogenation temperature by adding transition elements (e.g., Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Ce), metal oxides, and intermetallic compounds to overcome these shortcomings. On the other hand, carbon materials have been mainly studied in the field of hydrogen storage with high specific surface area and lightweight properties; however, results show that they cannot store a large amount of hydrogen. Recently, it has been theoretically reported that carbon materials act as adsorbents in hydrogen storage. This study focuses on the hydrogenation behavior of MgHx-CaO and MgHx-CaO-MWCNT composites prepared by hydrogen-induced mechanical alloying, and investigates the properties of these composite materials.",yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
4,"A small-area composite-varactor-based digitally tunable capacitor operated with positive and negative control voltages is proposed to remove several drawbacks resulting from the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor of the conventional switched capacitor array (SCA). It was constructed with several composite-varactor branches in parallel, each of which consists of p-type (P+/Pwell) and n-type (N+/Nwell) accumulation-mode varactors in a cascode configuration. The optimum ratio of the channel width between p-type and n-type accumulation-mode varactors was investigated through the simulation in order to maximize a quality factor (Q-factor) of the tunable capacitor at the maximum capacitance (C-MAX) state. The number of composite-varactor unit in each branch was designed to be binary-weighted, and the total capacitance can vary linearly by digitally turning on and off both varactors. It was firstly implemented in 65-nm bulk CMOS process, and showed comparable tuning range, Q-factor, and harmonic distortion performances while reducing the silicon area by half and eliminating the MIM capacitor in comparison with the conventional SCA. In the measurement, the proposed tunable capacitor showed a Q-factor of 60.3 at C-MAX state and a tuning range of 2.8 at 2 GHz frequency band. In addition, it was perfectly capable of handling a high power signal up to 0 dBm with excellent second and third-order harmonic distortion of greater than 70 dBc at the minimum capacitance (C-MIN) state and 77 dBc at C-MAX state.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
5,Fluctuation relations such as the Jarzynski equality provide general statements about thermodynamic variables and have been used to infer free energy from nonequilibrium measurements. Here we utilize model-specific fluctuation relations derived from corresponding stochastic dynamical equations to study systems whose thermodynamics have not been well-understood. We detail steps of known frameworks to obtain specific forms of fluctuation relations for examples governed by non-Markovian Langevin dynamics and spatial temperature heterogeneity. We show related simple approximations in a system obeying Tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics and propose efficient design features for biomolecular machines.

6,"We examine the meandering instability for prismatic lattices formed from triangles, squares and hexagons using a nearest neighbor kinetic Monte Carlo model. In the first two cases, which are Bravais lattices, we find that facets with the orientation favored in the equilibrium shape of isolated islands are most prone to this instability, while the analogous facet for the hexagonal lattice is the least unstable. We argue that this is due to a significant difference in the reconstructed/equilibrium versus the non-reconstructed edge energy for non-Bravais crystals. Surface/edge energy is typically modeled as a single-valued function of orientation. We put forward a simple geometric argument that suggests this picture is inadequate for crystals with a non-Bravais lattice structure. In the case of a hexagonally structured lattice, our arguments indicate that the non-reconstructed edge energy can be viewed as both discontinuous and multi-valued for a subset of orientations that are commensurate with the crystal structure. We support these conclusions with density functional theory calculations that also reveal multivalued surface energies for the set of singular orientations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,We consider singular self-adjoint extensions of one-dimensional Schrodinger operator acting in space of two-component wave functions within the framework of the distribution theory (Kurasov 1996 J. Math. Anal. Appl. 201 297). We show that among C-4-parameter subset compatible with the spin interpretation of the two-component structure of wave function. They can be identified as the point-like spin-momentum (Rashba) interactions. We suggest their physical realizations based on the regularized form of the Hamiltonian with coupling of the electrical field inhomogeneity of a background and spin of a carrier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Al6061/Cu and Al6063/Cu cladding materials have been produced by the caliber-rolling process at 298 K. The prepared specimen was post-annealed at a temperature of 773 K for various time durations, and the effects of annealing conditions have been investigated. Vickers hardness of Al6061, Al6063 and Cu decreases as annealing time decreases; however, that of the interface between Al alloys and Cu increases with an annealing time of 1 h, and then decreases as annealing time increases further. The growth of a diffusion layer in Al6063/Cu is larger than that in Al6061/Cu, because the activation energy in the Al6063/Cu is lower than that in Al6061/Cu during the annealing process. Cracking of the diffusion layer occurs by annealing for extended periods of time in both materials, which contributes to the decrease in hardness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"This study deals with analysing students? causal reasoning when tackling electric current in transitory situations in introductory physics courses. We emphasise the types of reasoning students use in explanations at macroscopic and microscopic levels, as this knowledge is helpful for designing and implementing novel teaching approaches, which help articulate macroscopic and microscopic levels of description. Two open-ended questions were used to analyse students? reasoning, with emphasis on explanations. As seen in the obtained results, an important percentage of students are not able to correctly interpret phenomena in simple transitory current states. Their explanations can be categorised into two general categories. The first one is based on relational causal reasoning and the second one is a form of reasoning that excludes current flow in transitory state processes. We look at several aspects that have barely been mentioned in previous research at university level related to the topic of transitory current in circuits, such as possible difficulties with complex reasoning and the type of reasoning students use when they establish macro-micro relationships.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"It is an effort to improve the phenomenon of thick boron-carbon compound forming, during the process of arc surfacing of high boron and high carbon alloy. This paper deals with the refinement of hard particles, in order to improve the microstructure of the surfacing layer. The comparison of microstructure and hard particles composition between laser arc composite surfacing layer and arc surfacing layer confirmed that hard particles of both are (Fe, Cr)(7)(B, C)(3) and (Fe, Cr)(2)B. Also, the results show that in the cross section of the arc surfacing layer, the hard particles are in the shape of long strips, hexagonal and regular quadrangular blocks. But the size of hard particles decreases and follows a uniform distribution under laser induction. The wear resistance of laser arc composite surfacing layer is obviously improved. This may be due to that thick hard particles were broken into smaller units by pulsed laser stirring molten pool, thus providing more nucleating particles for the formation of hard particles. At the same time, the thick hard particles were melt down by high energy laser beam, which improves the temperature gradient and forces hard particles to grow uniformly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Breast nuclear medicine imaging has gradually become a supplemental method for detection of mammographically occult cancer in dense breasts. However, mammary glands and ducts are highly sensitive to radiation; the absorbed dose to glandular tissue may increase the risk of secondary breast cancer. Therefore, accurate suborgan breast dosimetry for breast nuclear medicine imaging represents an important issue. In this study, a series of anthropomorphic software breast phantoms (ASBPs) with various volumes and glandularitles were built. The realism of the ASBPs was assessed by using the two-dimensional projection and fractal dimension (FD) analysis. Breast self S values and suborgan S values for F-18 and Tc-99(m) were simulated using the Monte Carlo technique. The projected images of the ASBPs were similar to clinical mammograms in tissue distribution and image contrast. The mean FD value for the ASBPs was 2.23. The maximum differences between the breast self S values of ASBPs and OLINDA/EXM for (18)( ) and Tc-99(m) were -14.4% and -16.7%, respectively. For the breast suborgan S values, the maximum ratios between the S value from gland to gland S(g <- g) and the S value from breast to breast S(1).-b) were 4.84 for F-18 and 3.60 for Tc-99(m). The mean ratios between the S value from gland to duct S(d <- g) and that from gland to gland S(g <- g) were 0.296 for F-18 and 0.356 for Tc-99m. The suborgan breast dosimetry based on the ASBPs can be used for internal dose evaluation and carcinogenic risk assessment of mammary glands and ducts in breast nuclear medicine imaging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"Turbulent fast ion transport has been investigated in astrophisycal, laboratory and fusion plasmas. When gyro- and drift-averaging across plasma structures manifest as non-markovian and non-local effects, this results in generally non-diffusive transport. The intermittency of the formation of these plasma structures, such as blobs, can potentially be reflected in the transport of the fast ions as well. In the TORPEX basic plasma device, a toroidal beam of suprathermal Li-6 ions is injected into electrostatic plasma turbulence. Conditional sampling techniques confirm turbulent E x B-drifts as physical driving mechanism of radial fast ion transport, which features sub-, super- or quasi-diffusive regimes depending on the fast ion energy and propagation time. To address the question of how far local intermittency is associated with each regime, we analyze characteristics of time-intermittency on an extensive set of local fast ion time-series across all observed regimes. Modeling the time-average fast ion profiles as the result of a meandering smaller instantaneous beam allows us to predict the skewness of such time-series based on their time-average. Comparisons with the skewness of simple two-valued time-series can yield relative indications towards certain transport regimes in our specific system, based on the differences in the size of the instantaneous fast ion beam.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,"InP-based quantum dots are promising candidates as Cd-free quantum dots; however, they require sharper fluorescence to satisfy the next-generation display standard. For this purpose, a deeper understanding of the crystal growth scheme and well-designed organometallic precursors are needed. Density functional theory calculations were used to find the activation barriers for the initial reaction of Zn, Ga, and In precursors with tris (trimethylsilyl)phosphine, and differences in reactivity between dissimilar metal precursors were revealed. The coordinations of the P precursor to Zn, In, and Ga precursors were found to differ significantly, depending on the coordination number and the ionic radius, and these results were consistent with reports that found that InZnP can be alloyed, but InGaP is not easily alloyed. The activation energies become close to each other when using thiol ligands with less steric hindrance in monodentate ligands. These results will lead to achieving precise composition control and great luminescence properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"In this article, conservation laws, temperature dependent viscosity, thermal conductivity and mass diffusion models are used for mathematical modeling of flow of Casson fluid induced by nonlinear axisymmetric stretching sheet exposed to non-uniform magnetic field. Mathematical models are solved by finite element method. Convergence is ensured and grid independent analysis is performed. Several numerical simulations are executed to investigate the behavior of velocity, temperature and concentration under the variation of parameters. The impact of viscous dissipation, Joule heating, variation of viscosity and thermal conductivity is investigated through numerical simulations. The developed computer program is tested by comparing with computed results. The intensity of applied magnetic field and Joule heating are directly proportional to each other and an increase in the intensity of magnetic field causes an increase in the temperature. A rise in viscosity due to a rise in temperature has remarkable impact on both velocity and temperature. However, an increase in thermal conductivity (due to rise in temperature) results a significant increase in the temperature as conduction of heat from hot surface into the fluid speeds up. The wall heat flux increases when intensity of the magnetic field is increased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"In this paper we have comprehensive study on the interplay among radiation loss, transverse disorder (diagonal and off-diagonal) and Kerr-type nonlinearity on the light propagation in 1D array of optical waveguides. Our numerical results demonstrate the presence of three distinguished regimes of transverse light expansion at different propagation distances. At short propagation distance, the Kerr-type nonlinearity are dominated and results in the transverse localization of light through the self-trapping mechanism. Radiation loss, causes the light escape from the injected guides, affect the light expansion in middle distance via broadening the light beam width. At longer distance the disorder terms led to the transverse localization of light, again. Also, we compared the propagation of light in edge and middle modes in the presence of the above effects. Our results show that the propagation distance of first localized regime for edge modes is larger than the middle modes since the edge modes can exchange energy with one of the left or right waveguides, while for middle modes there are two ways for energy exchange. Therefore the discrete diffraction can be diminished the nonlinear effects in middle modes faster than the edge modes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"A novel and inexpensive fabrication method of multiferroic nanocomposite films via liquid-phase formation is demonstrated in this work. Well-aligned anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays on a Ti substrate were used as the core template. The anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays were then hydrothermally treated in Ba(OH)(2) aqueous solution to form BaTiO3 (BTO) nanotube arrays. The average pore diameter and thickness of the BTO nanotube arrays obtained were approximately 50 similar to 70 nm and 2 similar to 4 mu m, respectively. The BTO nanotube arrays were then dip-coated with CoFe2O4 (CFO) sol with the assistance of vaccum impregnation equipment to enable the penetration of CFO sol into the tubular pores of the BTO nanotube arrays. The good distribution of CFO in the BTO nanotube arrays was confirmed by electron microscopy accompanied with elemental analysis. The good crystallinity of CFO and BTO in the nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, and the nanocomposite film exhibited anisotropic ferrimagnetic properties upon an in plane and out-plane applied magnetic field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"The effects of thiodiphenol based epoxy resin on the thermal property of the composites containing aluminum oxide were investigated. The thermal conductivities and thermal diffusivities of the composites were dependent on the polymer resin. At the same content of Al2O3, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of composites made by synthesized polymer resin exhibited higher than that of composite made by bisphenol-A resin. The obtained maximum thermal conductivity of the composite was 0.25 W/mK, which was 0.4 times as large as that of the conventional bisphenol-A epoxy resin which has an amorphous structure. It is supposed that the reason for the high heat conductivity obtained in thiodiphenol based epoxy resin is certain high packing structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Application-viable yields of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) are known to be provided by a number of materials, Al2O3:C nanoDot OSLDs being one of those currently favoured, dominating the world of commercial passive radiation dosimetry. Associated with the use of such materials is the need for versatile, high performance readout devices, opportunities remaining for novel developments in support of the OSL media, as emphasised herein. Present study focuses on the data acquisition capability of an in-house prototype OSL reader, luminescence stimulation being provided by a 30 mW green LED light (spectral mid-point similar to 515 nm). In providing for the additional versatility of making stand-off (at a distance) measurements, the dosimeter sensors (nanoDot OSLD chips) were attached to a polymethyl-methcrylate (PMMA) fibre cable, allowing characterization of the OSL (phosphorescence) at very low risk. Using this prototype instrument, key OSL features from an Al2O3:C sensor medium have been captured, excellent quantitative agreement being found between present results and those of others using other readers. One further feature of the current design is that it also allows investigation of the excitation light wavelength dependence of sensor media that could be competitive to Al2O3:C, there being the additional ability to swap out the OSL sensor, filters and other support components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"Metal and metal-compound photocathodes are generally used as electron sources in radio frequency (RF) guns. These photocathodes are robust against laser irradiation and RF fields, are easy to handle, and have longevity. The surface cleaning of photocathodes is essential to improve and maintain their quantum efficiency (QE) in an RF gun cavity. In this paper, we propose a backside electron-beam irradiation heating technique as an in situ surface-cleaning procedure for photocathodes in an RF gun cavity. In the proposed technique, thermal electrons accelerated by a DC electric field are irradiated from the back of the photocathode, and their beam power is converted to heat, thereby heating the photocathode. Unlike other surface-cleaning techniques, surfaces of any cathode shape can be cleaned uniformly using this heating method. We designed and developed a cathode plug that includes the proposed heating system for large-diameter (similar to 8 mm) photocathodes. Thermal simulation of the entire system, including the photocathode and its holding structure, and RF simulation of the choke structure for preventing the leakage of RF power were performed. The developed heating system was installed in an RF gun in High Energy Accelerator Research Organization KEK and subjected to RF aging and beam commissioning. From the results of beam commissioning, it was found that the QE of the photocathode increased to approximately 2.5 times the initial value due to the in situ annealing in the RF gun cavity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"We present a novel numerical method aimed to characterize global behaviour, in particular chaotic diffusion, in dynamical systems. It is based on an analysis of the Poincare recurrence statistics on massive grids of initial data or values of parameters. We concentrate on Hamiltonian systems, featuring the method separately for the cases of bounded and non-bounded phase spaces. The embodiments of the method in each of the cases are specific. We compare the performances of the proposed Poincare recurrence method (PRM) and the custom Lyapunov exponent (LE) methods and show that they expose the global dynamics almost identically. However, a major advantage of the new method over the known global numerical tools, such as LE, FLI, MEGNO, and FA, is that it allows one to construct, in some approximation, charts of local diffusion timescales. Moreover, it is algorithmically simple and straightforward to apply. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This difference directs to drastic improvements of signal intensity and shot-to-shot reproducibility in mass spectra.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is an upcoming instrument that will start a new generation of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. CTA is expected not only to provide an unprecedented sensitivity in the tens of GeV to hundreds of TeV range, but also to considerably improve the systematic uncertainties of the measurements. We study the images registered by Cherenkov telescopes from low energy gamma rays with its first interaction in the upper parts of the atmosphere. The images show a characteristic separation due to the deflection of the first e(-)e(+) pair in the Geomagnetic Field. We evaluate the performance of the standard stereoscopic analysis for such events. We derive also a novel method for energy estimation of V-shaped events based purely on geometrical properties of the image. We investigate the potential of combining the classical energy estimation and the novel method for independent validation of the systematic shifts in the energy scale of Cherenkov telescopes and discuss the limitations of such analysis.

27,"Two types of nanoclusters were detected using DSC thermal analysis operating at -50 degrees C with liquid nitrogen. The formation of Cluster (1) was substantially suppressed by the formation of Cluster (2) during step quenching at 100 degrees C for 0.06 ks. The hardness increase was retarded for a period during two-step aging at 170 degrees C in the case of natural aging for 604.8 ks. The hardness decrease was determined to be due to the dissolution of nanoclusters in the early stage of two-step aging at 170 degrees C. On the other hand, hardness was directly increased in the step-quenched samples during multi-step aging at 170 degrees C. It is noted that Cluster (2) directly transforms into the strengthening phase. The bake hardening response is fairly enhanced by the formation of Cluster (2), which is formed by the step quenching process. It was confirmed that the step-quenched samples had a higher number of precipitates than the naturally-aged ones based on TEM images. The structure of the precipitate was identified to be the beta '' phase by analyzing HRTEM image.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"The effective interaction between two classical nonrelativistic electrons (positrons) in the presence of intense electromagnetic radiation (one and two waves) is theoretically studied. Small relativistic corrections are considered in the laboratory reference frame. The field of an intense wave forms the movement of particles in such a way that their trajectories are practically parallel for quite a long time and, in the perpendicular direction, the particles shift slightly, approaching first and then moving away from each other.

30,"A new beam-timing monitor (BTM) has been developed to analyze the longitudinal beam dynamics and bunching characteristics at the pre-injector of the KEKB injector linear accelerator (linac). The BTM is a conventional stripline-type beam monitor with two pickup electrodes. It measures the relative time delay between the arrival time of the beam signal and 1st-zero-cross time of the fundamental accelerating radio frequency (rf) signal (2856 MHz) immediately after the detection of the beam signal. The beam tests were performed to evaluate the performance and characteristics of the BTM for primary single-bunched electron beams with high bunch charges of similar to 8 nC for positron production. It was found that the results show that the resolution in the delay-time measurement is sigma similar to 1.2 ps in one standard deviation. This report describes the basic design of the BTM system, the beam tests, and results in detail, to investigate the sensitivity and stability of the beam timing based on the longitudinal phase-space parameters at the pre-injector and location A1 of the injector linac, along with the calibration method in the pulse-height variation of the BTM signal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"We assess the performance of two different types of basis sets for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics at conical intersections. The basis sets of both types are generated using Ehrenfest trajectories of nuclear coherent states. These trajectories can either serve as a moving (time-dependent) basis or be employed to sample a fixed (time-independent) basis. We demonstrate on the example of two-state two-dimensional and three-state five-dimensional models that both basis set types can yield highly accurate results for population transfer at intersections, as compared with reference quantum dynamics. The details of wave packet evolutions are discussed for the case of the two-dimensional model. The fixed basis is found to be superior to the moving one in reproducing true nonlocal spreading and maintaining correct shape of the wave packet upon time evolution. Moreover, for the models considered, the fixed basis set outperforms the moving one in terms of computational efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In theory unfocused intensities of 10(17) W cm(?2) could be reached. The Raman amplification scheme has been demonstrated as a promising candidate through the observation of 10% energy transfer efficiency due to amplification of noise, which implies potentially much larger efficiencies. However, controlled amplification of a seed pulse has not hitherto exceeded an efficiency of 7%. Here we discuss several saturation mechanisms that can limit the gain, such as early pump scattering and thermal effects. We show that chirped pulse Raman amplification can mitigate these deleterious effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"In this paper, we explore the persistent current in thin superconducting wires and accurately examine the effects of the phase slips on that current. The main result of the paper is the formula for persistent current in terms of solutions of certain (nonlinear) integral equation. This equation allows to find asymptotics of the current at long(small) length of the wire, in this paper, we examine the region in which the system becomes strongly interacting and very few pieces of information can be extracted by perturbation theory. Nevertheless, due to the integrability, exact results for the current can be obtained. We observe that at the limit of a long wire, the current becomes exponentially small and we believe that it is the signal that phase slips may destroy superconductivity for long wires, below BKT phase transition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Gels are composed of cross-linked polymer network and solvent. Gels are both ubiquitous in nature and widely applied in engineering applications. In this work, we develop a physics-based dynamic theory to investigate the tunable wave propagation properties of gels. Gels are soft and can generate large deformation. The constitutive relation takes account the coupled large deformation and diffusion of gels. The dynamic governing equations take account the relative motions between the polymer network and solvent, which leads to a pressure diffusion wave similar to the ""slow pressure wave"" in the classical Biot's poroelastodynamics. It is different from the pressure wave in pure solid or pure liquid. The phase velocity, group velocity and attenuation coefficient are analyzed at different frequencies and propagating directions for both pressure wave and shear wave. We show that the wave propagation properties of gels are not only related to the material properties including the crosslink density and the interaction property between solvent and polymer, but also can be tuned by different mechanical loading conditions and chemical stimuli. It is also predicted that the constrained swollen gel exhibits anisotropic wave propagation properties, which leads to the splitting of the pressure wave and shear wave propagating through it. The theory provides a general frame for fundamental understanding and quantitative characterization of the dynamic behaviors of gels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

36,"This study introduces a characterization technique for trap locations (X-t) with considerable trap density along the channel in field effect transistors (FETs). The technique is based on the experimental gate-to-source or gateto-drain capacitance-voltage (C-GS-V-GS or C-GD-V-GD) characteristics of FETs. As the gate bias (V-G) increases, the effective channel length (L-eff) extends by the increased conductivity of the channel from the source or the drain. Due to trapped charges at the trap sites with a high density of traps along the channel, abrupt change in the C-V characteristics is observed. For the transition gate bias (V-G,V-t) with abrupt change in the C-V characteristics, the dominant trap location (X-t) can be converted through the channel conduction factor (alpha(V-G) to be the effective channel length L-eff(V-G) = alpha(V-G).L-ch). We expect that the proposed C-V technique to be useful in non-destructive electrical characterization of lateral trap locations (interface states, bulk traps, and/or grain boundary traps caused by the bias stress and/or fabrication process) along the channel in FETs. We successfully applied the proposed technique to the p-channel poly-Si thin-film transistors (TFTs) for characterization of the grain boundary locations along the channel. As an example for the proposed technique, we applied the technique to a p-channel poly-Si TFT and obtained a dominant trap at X-GB1 = 3.13 [mu m] from the source and another at X-GB2 = 3.70 [mu m] from the drain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"In this study, we investigate the microstructure and mechanical properties of as-extruded Al-1.0RE alloys. The molten Aluminum alloy was maintained at 800 degrees C and then poured into a mould at 200 degrees C. Aluminum alloys were hot-extruded into a rod measuring 12 mm thick with a reduction ratio of 38: 1. The microstructure and electric conductivity properties of as-extruded Al-1.0RE alloy under different annealing processes were investigated and compared. After extrusion, the intermetallic compound having a needle shape in the cast state was finely decomposed based on the direction of extrusion. Significant changes in the microstructure were detected after annealing at 500 degrees C with fragmentation and sphering of eutectic particles. The annealing temperature of Al-1.0RE alloy increased proportionally to the electrical conductivity. The formation of Al-RE intermetallic compounds increases the electrical conductivity and improves the mechanical properties of the alloy through precipitation hardening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the time evolution characteristics of plasma temperature and electron density were discussed. Within the time delay range of 0?5 ?s, the spectral intensity of the characteristic lines of Si I: 288.158 nm, Ti I: 336.126 nm, Al I: 394.400 nm and Fe I: 438.354 nm of the four main elements in two kinds of national standard soil decayed exponentially with time. The average lifetime of the spectral lines was nearly 1.56 ?s. Under the condition of different time delays, the spectral intensity of Pb I: 405.78 nm in soil increased linearly with laser energy. However, the slope between the spectral intensity and laser energy decreased exponentially with the increase in time delay, from 4.91 to 0.99 during 0?5 ?s. The plasma temperature was calculated by the Boltzmann plot method and the electron density was obtained by inversion of the full width at half maximum of the spectrum. The plasma temperature decreased from 8900 K to 7800 K and the electron density decreased from 1.5?10(17) cm(?3) to 7.8?10(16) cm(?3) in the range of 0?5 ?s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

42,"The application of an energy and mass selected ion beam assisted deposition setup to investigate the influence of hyperthermal atomic and molecular nitrogen ion species during the initial stages of epitaxial GaN thin film growth is reported. By using a compact quadrupole mass filter system a hyperthermal ion beam is mass filtered. The GaN thin film depositions with varying ion-to-atom arrival ratio and kinetic energies of 40 eV and 80 eV are performed to highlight the distinct impact of the ion species on the early stages of the growth. It is evaluated that precise selection of ion beam parameters enables the preferred growth of either the metastable zinc blende GaN phase or the stable wurtzite GaN phase on 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Further, using molecular nitrogen ion species thin films of high crystalline quality could be deposited even at ion kinetic energies of 80 eV, while films with atomic nitrogen ion assistance feature reduced crystalline quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"Pentacene and fullerene (C-60) form an efficient stacked heterostructure in organic solar cells, and C-60 films exhibit high crystallinity on pentacene films. However, the mechanism of the crystallinity improvement in C-60 overlayers remains to be fully elucidated. In this work, the surface (step and terrace structure) of pentacene films is investigated in terms of the terrace width using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to clarify the mechanism. We found that the terrace width becomes wider as the substrate temperature for pentacene film growth increases, and the terrace width becomes narrower as the thickness of pentacene films increases. In addition, we investigate the influence of the terrace width of pentacene underlayers on C-60 overlayers using AFM and X-ray diffraction. We found that pentacene underlayers with wide terraces increase the grain size and improve the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers. These findings indicate that growing pentacene underlayers with wider terraces allows for further enhancement in the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers, leading to higher quality pentacene/C-60 stacked heterostructures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"Degenerate plasmas, in which quantum effects dictate the behavior of free electrons, are ubiquitous on earth and throughout space. Transitions between bound and free electron states determine basic plasma properties, yet the effects of degeneracy on these transitions have only been theorized. Here, we use an x-ray free electron laser to create and characterize a degenerate plasma. We observe a core electron fluorescence spectrum that cannot be reproduced by models that ignore free electron degeneracy. We show that degeneracy acts to restrict the available electron energy states, thereby slowing the rate of transitions to and from the continuum. We couple degeneracy and bound electron dynamics in an existing collisional-radiative code, which agrees well with observations. The impact of the shape of the cross section, and hence the magnitude of the correction due to degeneracy, is also discussed. This study shows that degeneracy in plasmas can significantly influence experimental observables such as the emission spectra, and that these effects can be included parametrically in well-established atomic physics codes. This work narrows the gap in understanding between the condensed-matter and plasma phases, which coexist in myriad scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,Emergence of long-lived emitter states is predicted to occur in a mesolaser driven below self-quenching threshold. Distinct behavioral regimes of the emitters are separated by peaks in photon fluctuations (the Fano factor) in a manner analogous to but fundamentally different from the nonequilibrium phase transition analogy in conventional lasers. The parameter space in which long-lived states emerge in mesolasers containing two or more emitters is identified and shown to be controlled by the strength of coupling to external baths.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

47,"Macroscale continuum mechanics simulations rely on material properties stemming from the microscale, which are normally described using predetermined phenomenological equations of state (EOS), which depend on physical parameters usually obtained from experiments. A method is proposed for the automatic generation of first-principles unconstrained EOSs using a Gaussian process on a set of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, thereby closing the continuum equations with the accuracy determined by the underlying first-principles theory. The method is validated for bulk silicon using density-functional theory (DFT) by comparing planar (one-dimensional) shock waves with experiment, and also with an explicit first-principles molecular dynamics simulation, both in the hyperelastic regime. Its applicability is then illustrated it for two-dimensional shock waves in DFT bulk silicon, following their nonlinear, temperature-dependent, anisotropic dynamics after a cylindrical region is instantaneously heated. The method is applicable to condensed matter systems in other regimes, using well-known continuum techniques and/or molecular dynamics simulations at larger scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"Electrically driven hybrid organic/inorganic white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) with low-cost, easy fabrication, and excellent electroluminescence (EL) performance have attracted tremendous attention recently. However, many issues, especially imbalanced carrier injection, have limited their development, so further research is needed. Herein, 4,4 '-cyclohexane-1,1-diylbis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)aniline] (TAPC) with a large bandgap is introduced as a multifunctional hole transport layer (MHTL) for efficient hybrid organic/inorganic WLEDs. Optimized hybrid WLEDs with TAPC are achieved with a peak current efficiency of 20.6 cd A(-1) and a near purity white light with color coordinates of (0.32, 0.33). They exhibit better EL performance than those without TAPC. This proves that an optimized TAPC layer can effectively reduce electron overflow and improve hole injection to acquire much better charge balance in the emitting layers. Such good results will significantly promote the design and fabrication of phosphor-free WLEDs with high performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

50,"Interleaving fins can significantly increase heat transfer by increasing the effective area per unit base area. The fins are separated uniformly by a gap, which is filled with a flow medium to control the heat flux. The heat flux between the plates depends strongly on the thermal conductivity of the fin material and the medium between them, as well as the dimensions. In earlier studies, an empirical fitting method has been used to determine the total effectiveness of the fins. However, it required complete characterization of the fins for each new set of operating conditions. In this paper, a simplified analytical model is developed, which still preserves the main physical traits of the problem. This model reveals the dimensionless parameter group containing both the material properties and the fin geometry that govern the heat transfer. Rigorous testing of the model using a numerical finite-element model shows an accuracy within 2% over a large parameter space, varying both dimensions and material properties. Lastly, this model is put to the test with previously measured experimental data and good agreement is obtained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"In this work, the stability of unpackaged CdTe solar cells with different configurations was investigated according to the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC 61215-2016. The measurements of thermal cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C and 24-hour temperature cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C withstanding the effects of 20-hour penetration of 85 degrees C were carried out in CdS/CdTe solar cells with structures of FTO/CdS/CdTe/Au, FTO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, and FTO/MZO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, respectively. The performances of these cells before and after the thermal aging experiments were investigated by using light and dark I-V together with C-V. The results reveal varied performance degradation before and after thermal aging in the cells with different structures. Among these, the most deteriorated device is the one without back contact (BC), whose efficiency decreased by 25.12% after thermal cycling accompanying an obvious roll-over phenomenon when forward bias was greater than open circuit voltage. On the contrary, the reduction in the efficiency was about 16.80% in the case cells with BC, and the roll-over phenomenon was not so significant. Furthermore, for the devices with optimized front contact of FTO/MZO, the thermal stability was improved obviously. Interestingly, short-circuit current density associated with the carrier concentration of cells remained relatively small variations compared with the change of Voc and fill factor. All the results indicated that an efficient back contact layer and an optimized front electrode were the indispensable structural elements to attain high stabilization in the CdS/CdTe solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a de Sitter background, on the other hand, we find processes describing the production of string/particle systems with no negative energies involved. We also compute the probabilities of creating and of breaking an infinite cosmic string in de Sitter space.

53,"This paper invokes a new mechanism for reducing a coupled system of fields (including Einstein?s equations without a cosmological constant) to equations that possess solutions exhibiting characteristics of immediate relevance to current observational astronomy. Our approach is formulated as a classical Einstein-vector-scalar-Maxwell-fluid field theory on a spacetime with three-sphere spatial sections. Analytic cosmological solutions are found using local charts familiar from standard LFRW cosmological models. These solutions can be used to describe different types of evolution for the metric scale factor, the Hubble, jerk and de-acceleration functions, the scalar spacetime curvature and the Kretschmann invariant constructed from the Riemann?Christoffel spacetime curvature tensor. The cosmological sector of the theory accommodates a particular single big-bang scenario followed by an eternal exponential acceleration of the scale factor. Such a solution does not require an externally prescribed fluid equation of state and leads to a number of new predictions including a current value of the ?jerk? parameter, ?Hopfian-like? source-free Maxwell field configurations with magnetic helicity and distributional ?bi-polar? solutions exhibiting a new charge conjugation symmetry. An approximate scheme for field perturbations about this particular cosmology is explored and its consequences for a thermalisation process and a thermal history are derived, leading to a prediction of the time interval between the big-bang and the decoupling era. Finally it is shown that field couplings exist where both vector and scalar localised linearised perturbations exhibit dispersive wave-packet behaviours. The scalar perturbation may also give rise to Yukawa solutions associated with a massive Klein?Gordon particle. It is argued that the vector and scalar fields may offer candidates for ?dark-energy? and ?dark-matter? respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,"AlN (1010)$(10\bar{1}0)$(101 over bar 0) and (1120)$(11\bar{2}0)$(112 over bar 0) surfaces are usually considered to be non-polar facets. However, polarization may be induced in the surface due to the surface dangling bonds. In this work, using the average local dipole evaluated by maximally localized Wannier functions, we investigated polarization properties of these two surfaces layer-by-layer. It is found that a remarkable polarization which is more than eight times that of the bulk, is induced on these two surfaces. Moreover, we found that the polarization oscillates around the bulk value in the inner surface layers, and quickly approaches to the bulk value at a depth of four layers. Such polarization variation was further analyzed from the viewpoints of atomic rearrangement and charge transfer. Thus (1010)$(10\bar{1}0)$(101 over bar 0) and (1120)$(11\bar{2}0)$(112 over bar 0) surfaces are actually not completely non-polar facets, but rather non-polar bulk core combined with polar surface layers which would potentially affect the surface properties. The present study may provide a deeper understanding of the non-polar AlN surfaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,"To understand the J/psi + Xnon-c(c) over bar production mechanism in e(+)e(-) annihilation, in this work, we propose to measure the cross section for J/psi production without the association of a charm quark pair without any constraint on the number of charged tracks in the final state events except for the mu(+)mu(-) from J/psi decay, which we will refer to here as J/psi production with light hadrons at B factories. We also present a detailed study on its QED background due to psi(2S) feed-down, where the psi(2S) is produced through e(+)e(-) -> psi(2S)+ gamma and e(+)e(-) -> psi(2S) + f (f) over bar (f = lepton, light quark), as well as those due to the QED contribution to the direct J/psi + q (q) over bar production with q = u, d, s quark. We find that the QED background is huge in the whole phase space region; however, it can be largely reduced when a suitable kinematic cut condition on p(J/psi) and theta(J/psi) is implemented, where p(J/psi) is the momentum of J/psi and theta(J/psi) is the angle between J/psi and the e(+)e(-) beam. In the range of pi/9 < theta(J/psi) < 8 pi/9 and P-J/psi > 3 GeV, the cross section of the QED background is of the same order as that of the QCD contribution. Therefore, studying the J/psi production with light hadrons is helpful to clarify the J/psi production mechanism at B factories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, a ultrabroad supercontinuum up to 300 orders harmonic plateau and an isolated 48-as pulse are generated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,"At the heart of the study of topological insulators lies a fundamental dichotomy: Topological invariants are defined in infinite systems but surface states as their main footprint only exist in finite systems. In the slab geometry, namely, infinite in two planar directions and finite in the perpendicular direction, the 2D topological invariant was shown to display three different types of behavior. The perpendicular Dirac velocity turns out to be a critical control parameter discerning between different qualitative situations. When it is zero, the three types of behavior extrapolate to the three 3D topologically distinct phases: trivial, weak, and strong topological insulators. We show analytically that the boundaries between types of behavior are topological phase transitions of particular significance since they allow us to predict the 3D topological invariants from finite-thickness transitions. When the perpendicular Dirac velocity is not zero, we identify a new phase with surface states but no band inversion at any finite thickness, disentangling these two concepts which are closely linked in 3D. We also show that at zero perpendicular Dirac velocity, the system is gapless in the 3D bulk and therefore not a topological insulating state, even though the slab geometry extrapolates to the 3D topological phases. Finally, in a parameter regime with strong dispersion perpendicular to the surface of the slab, we encounter the unusual case that the slab physics displays nontrivial phases with surface states but nevertheless extrapolates to a 3D trivial state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, infinite energy solutions do not have physical meaning in the present framework of kinetic theory of gases with collisions conserving the total kinetic energy. In the present work, we provide a correction to the self-similar form, so that the solutions are more physically sound in the sense that the energy is no longer infinite and that the perturbation brought by the shock does not grow at large distances of it on the cold side in the soft potential case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, we prepared a minimum low-energy carbon-ion beam corresponding to water-equivalent residual ranges of less than 2 mm. We performed experimental verification for low-energy carbon-ion beams ranging from 55.6 to 96.0 MeV/u. The accuracy of 3D dose delivery with the low-energy carbon-ion beam was verified by measuring the dose distributions for different target volumes.

68,"In order to investigate the defects induced by displacement cascade in gold nanotubes, primary knock-on atoms with kinetic energies of 1 keV were introduced at the exterior surface of the nanotubes. The evolution of the collision cascade as well as the defects generated in the nanotube were studied using molecular dynamics simulation. We found that point defects and stacking faults were induced by the cascade. The interior surface of the nanotube acts as the sinks to absorb the point defects as the same as the exterior surface does, especially when the distance between them is decreased. Consequently, both the two surfaces influence the time evolution and the residual number of point defects in the nanotubes. In the gold nanotubes with fixed external diameter, the number of interstitials is decreased with the internal diameter increasing, while the number of vacancies does not show a clear trend with the variation of the internal diameters. The probability of formation of stacking faults is higher in gold nanotubes with larger internal diameters which caused by the fact that the formation of stacking faults is facilitated by the interior surface. The results show that, due to the specific geometry of the nanotubes, the evolution and the production of the cascade-induced damage has its own features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

70,"We focus our attention on enhancing of computation performance at numerical simulation of a laser pulse interaction with inhomogeneous nonlinear medium (optical periodic structure or photonic crystal) which is described in the framework of 1D Schrodinger equation without using slowly varying envelope in spatial coordinate. It allows taking into account the optical pulse reflection from medium inhomogeneous. In practice, as a rule at computer simulation the domain size before photonic crystal is many times greater than the photonic crystal size. Decreasing this domain one can essentially increase a computation performance. This aim is achieved by re-statement of the problem: instead of initial distribution of complex amplitude along spatial coordinate before the photonic crystal we consider its specifying as a boundary condition (BC), which results in the pulse propagation in both directions of the propagation axis. Taking this into account and that a part of a laser pulse reflects from faces of photonic crystal layers, we use the artificial boundary conditions (ABCs). To avoid an influence of waves propagated in negative direction of spatial coordinate on the laser pulse interaction in photonic crystal (this influence appears due to imperfection of ABC). We introduce in consideration some number of artificial waves related with the equation under consideration. With this aim, firstly, we provide a computation of the laser pulse propagation in a linear medium and storage the complex amplitude values at chosen section of a coordinate, along which a laser light propagates. Then we use this complex amplitude values as a left boundary condition for 1D nonlinear Schrodinger equation in domain containing a nonlinear photonic crystal. To decrease amplitude of the wave reflected from artificial boundaries. We demonstrate also that instead of a complex amplitude values storage one can use the corresponding analytical expression for the linear Schrodinger equation solution, corresponding to a laser pulse propagation in a linear domain before the photonic crystal. We discuss also various ways for full transform of the optical pulse energy for reflected wave into artificial waves. This results essentially increasing of computation efficiency.

71,"Numerical simulation of the hydrodynamics and mass transfer involved in the capping of large size Z-cut KDP plates has been performed. The variations of surface supersaturation with thin layer height, bulk supersaturation and rotation rate are analyzed. The results show that keeping still is very unfavorable for the growth of thin layer, a certain rotation rate should be applied to the Z-cut plate to increase the concentration gradient across the (0 0 1) face, thus making sure that thin layers can grow from the edges while small pyramids barely grow from the face center. Given the result that end faces of thin layers nearly bear a bulk supersaturation, a relative low bulk supersaturation will be better to ensure both the growth of thin layers and the good surface uniformity brought by low supersaturation. Moreover, as thin layers grow, rotation rate should be increased to make up the insufficient solute supply resulting from the decreasing linear speed.

The computational cost of the proposed FSM is 0 (Mdv-1 Ndv+1 log N), where d(v) is the dimension of the problem, Mdv-1 is the number of discrete solid angles, and N is the number of frequency nodes in each direction. Spatially-homogeneous relaxation problems are used to demonstrate that the FSM conserves mass and momentum/energy to the machine and spectral accuracy, respectively. Based on the variational principle, transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion are calculated by the FSM, which agree well with the analytical solutions. Then, the FSM is applied to find the accurate transport coefficients through an iterative scheme for the linearized quantum Boltzmann equation. The shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of three-dimensional quantum Fermi and Bose gases interacting through hard-sphere potential are calculated. For Fermi gas, the relative difference between the accurate and variational transport coefficients increases with fugacity; for Bose gas, the relative difference in thermal conductivity has similar behavior as the gas moves from the classical to degenerate limits, but the relative difference in shear viscosity decreases when the fugacity increases. Finally, the viscosity and diffusion coefficients are calculated for a two-dimensional equal-mole mixture of Fermi gases. When the molecular masses of the two components are the same, our numerical results agree with the variational solutions. However, when the molecular mass ratio is not one, large discrepancies between the accurate and variational results are observed; our results are reliable because (i) the method does not rely on any assumption on the form of velocity distribution function and (ii) the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy density satisfies the minimum bound predicted by the string theory.

73,"Novel tri-component composite microspheres of polyvinyl alcohol-silica-hydroxyapatite (PVA/SiO2/HA) were prepared in a water-in-oil emulsion. The SEM results showed that the as-prepared composite microspheres with an average diameter of 23.1 mu m exhibited a regular spherical shape and a high dispersity. Their inorganic phases were identified as low-crystallized hydroxyapatite and amorphous SiO2. Moreover, the PVA/SiO2/HA composite microspheres presented an enhanced capacity for both loading and sustained release of vancomycin hydrochloride (VH) as compared to their bi-component equivalents (PVA/SiO2 and PVA/HA composite microspheres), suggesting their good potential to be used as a drug carrier in bone tissue engineering.

This compound consists of two separated phases of major magnetic (non-superconducting) and minor superconducting components. The internal magnetic field of the major magnetic component decreased at the SC2 phase and disappeared around 15 GPa, while that of the minor non-magnetic component maintained its intensity up to 14.9 GPa. Multiple internal magnetic fields were introduced for improved fits to the spectra of the magnetic component at the SC2 phase, suggesting the importance of the electron-electron correlation in the emergence of the SC2 phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"Ablation effects play an important role in material processing with intense pulsed ion beam (IPIB) and IPIB diagnostics such as calorimeters and infrared detection may also be influenced by ablation. In this study, with numerical analysis and thermal imaging method, the ablation plume and its effects on energy deposition of IPIB on solid target was studied. Radiation experiments of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) targets with a thickness of 200 gm were carried out on BIPPAB-450 pulsed ion beam accelerator and the energy deposition of the ion beam was investigated with infrared imaging diagnostics. It is revealed that due to the low thermal conductivity and decomposition temperature of PVC, ablation plume can be formed during the early stage of beam irradiation and the ablation product may shield the energy of the ion beam from depositing in the target when energy density reaches a certain threshold. This effect needs to be taken into consideration in order to avoid its influence on applications and beam diagnostics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decays were found to be statistical and absolute rate constants agree quantitatively with detailed balance predictions. The level densities required for the comparison of simulated and calculated rate constants were obtained from separate simulations using the integrated microcanonical temperature. The quantitative agreement between simulations and theory requires that the classical degeneracy of the ground state is included into the level densities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"We study nearly degenerate four-wave mixing using a two-photon-allowed vibrational transition of parahydrogen. A signal photon is generated by a trigger photon and coherence among parahydrogen, which is prepared by two counterpropagating pump pulses, and we investigate the dependence of the signal pulse energy on the trigger frequency. The measured spectra depend on the geometry, shifting depending on the direction of the signal pulse and on the small angle formed by the counterpropagating pump pulses. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of signal pulse energy on the incident time of the trigger pulse. The measured signal pulse energy is high if the trigger pulse is delayed slightly with respect to the pump pulses. We demonstrate that these geometry-dependent spectra and coherent-transient response can be explained by using simple models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

79,"We have calculated astrophysical reaction cross-sections for (gamma, alpha) reactions of some nuclei important for the calculation of p-process reaction-decay network. Reaction rates for alpha-induced reactions are calculated with the semi-microscopic optical potential constructed using double folding method, where nuclear density distributions for finite nuclei along with the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction are the important components of the folded potential. For this purpose, density distributions of target nuclei are obtained from relativistic mean field approach. Astrophysical reaction cross-section for elastic scattering of alpha-particle from Mo-92 target is compared with the existing experimental results to constrain the newly formed potential. Further, to check the credibility of the present theoretical framework, the astrophysical S-factor for (alpha, gamma) reactions are compared with the experimental observation, wherever available.

81,"The existence and mysterious nature of sterile neutrinos are revolutionizing physics from the particle level to the cosmological scales. The recent results from the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermi-lab observed far more v e appearance than expected, which have provided a hint about the possible existence of sterile neutrinos. The results, if confirmed in future experiments, will have significant implications for cosmology and astroparticle physics. This will require new neutrino mass models to accommodate these additional degrees of freedom. In respect to that, this work is just an extension of our recent work toward the CP phase analysis of Quark-Lepton Complementarity (QLC) model in a 3+1 scenario. The parametrization of CKM4 and PMNS4 using Monte Carlo Simulation is used to estimate the texture of nontrivial correlation matrix (V-c4). As such, we have successfully investigated the constrained values for sterile neutrino parameters, and also predicted the values for Dirac CP-Violation phase and the CP re-phasing invariant (J). The results obtained are consistent with the data available from various experiments, like NovA, MINOS, SuperK and IceCube-DeepCore. Furthermore, this analysis would be very important in view of growing sterile neutrino experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"Low-fat food products often contain natural, edible polymers to retain the desired mouth feel and elasticity of their full-fat counterparts. This type of product, however, can suffer from syneresis: densification due to the expulsion of fluid. Gaining insight into the physical principles governing syneresis in such soft hybrid dispersions remains a challenge from a theoretical perspective, as experimental data are needed to establish a basis. We record non-accelerated syneresis in a model system for low-fat mayonnaise: a colloid polymer mixture, consisting of oil in water emulsion with starch in the aqueous phase. We find the flow rate of expelled fluid to be proportional to the difference in hydrostatic pressure over the system. The osmotic pressure of the added starch, while being higher than the hydrostatic pressure, does not prevent syneresis because the soluble starch is lost to the expelled fluid. From these findings, we conclude that forced syneresis in these systems can be described as a gravity-driven porous flow through the densely packed emulsion, explainable with a model based on Darcy's law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is a promising cathode material with high capacity, which can be paired with1 nonlithium metal anodes such as silicon or tin so that the safety issues caused by the Li anode can be effectively avoided. However, the Li2S full cell suffers from rapid capacity degradation due to the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. Herein, a Li2S/Si full cell is designed with a Li2S cathode incorporated by titanium nitride (TiN) polysulfide immobilizer within parallel hollow carbon (PHC). This full cell delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(Li2S)(-1) (1007 mAh g(sulfur)(-1)) at 0.5 C rate and excellent cyclability with only 0.4% capacity fade per cycle over 200 cycles. The long cycle stability is ascribed to the strong polysulfide anchor effect of TiN and highly efficient electron/ion transport within the interconnected weblike architecture of PHC. Theoretical calculations, self-discharge measurements, and anode stability experiments further confirm the strong adsorption of polysulfides on the TiN surface. The present work demonstrates that the flexible Li2S cathode and paired Si anode can be used to achieve highly efficient Li-S full cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"The spatio-temporal localization of a system in the presence of an oscillating electric field for a symmetric double-well potential is examined via numerical simulations of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. For an initial state with equal probability densities in both the wells, stabilized localization atop the barrier can be achieved on a periodic high-frequency driving. The barrier localization is characterized using Shannon information entropies in position and momentum spaces, defined as S-rho = - integral |psi|(2) ln |psi|(2) dx and S-gamma = - integral |phi|(2) ln |phi|(2) dp, where psi and phi refer to position and momentum space wave functions, respectively. The information entropy sum, S-rho + S-gamma, goes through a minimum indicating the formation of the barrier-localized state, when the peak intensity of the oscillating field is reached. The generalized uncertainty via the Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski inequality (S-rho + S-gamma >= 1 + ln pi) is saturated upon this minimization. This serves as a signature of the formation of the barrier-atop localized state, in terms of Shannon entropies of measurable densities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"We study spontaneous emission of two-level quantum emitter agglomerates embedded in transparent oxides. The two levels correspond to the splitting between vacancy impurity states F, F+, and V- color centers, whereas correlations are due to narrow bands in transition-metal oxides with ABO(3) perovskite structures. For these systems, we put forward a mechanism to control light emission in which micrometer-size vacancy-rich regions play the role of cavity resonators for the emitted radiation with normal frequencies mode volumes, and emission linewidths determined by their size and material properties. We argue that a physical scenario in which the emitter's natural frequency and linewidth can be fine-tuned via electronic correlations or temperature explains unusual features in the experimental photoluminescence spectra of Ar-irradiated SrTiO3. By unveiling the role of electronic correlations on spontaneous emission in transparent oxides, we hope our findings help set the basis for the design of controllable engineered solid-state single-photon sources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,"Knowledge of the neutron capture of copper and cobalt isotopes is important for the understanding of abundances of the heavier elements produced via the weak s process. There are considerable discrepancies for the Cu-63(n, gamma)Cu-64 and Cu-65(n, gamma)Cu-66 cross-section values in the literature. New measurements of these cross sections were performed at the SARAF phase I facility using a high-power quasi-Maxwellian neutron source produced by irradiation of the liquid-lithium target (LiLiT) with an intense continuous-wave proton beam. The cross sections were measured by counting the activity of the irradiated targets. The measurement allowed us to evaluate the Cu-63(n, gamma)Cu-64, Cu-65(n, gamma)Cu-66, and Co-59(n, gamma)Co-60 Maxwellian averaged cross sections at 30 keV, obtaining values of 70.4 +/- 1.8(exp) +/- 2.4(syst), 26.8 +/- 1.5(exp) +/- 1.0(syst), and 38.1 +/- 0.9(exp) +/- 0.9(syst) mb, respectively.

87,"The noncentrosymmetric Th7Co2.5 Fe-57(0.5) and Th7Ni2.5 Fe-57(0.5) superconductors were studied by means of Fe-57 transmission Mossbauer spectroscopy (TMS), ac-magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements. The low-temperature data showed that both compounds are type-II superconductors with transition temperature close to T-c = 2 K. The collected Mossbauer spectra of the studied samples consist of one well-resolved doublet over the temperature range measured. Neither abnormal behaviour of the hyperfine parameters at or near T-c nor phonon softening were found. A comparison of Fe-57 Mossbauer data of Ni- and Co-based superconductors with those of Th7Fe3 indicated that with decreasing 3d-electron numbers across the series Th7Ni2.5 Fe-57(0.5) -> Th7Co2.5 Fe-57(0.5) -> Th7Fe3, the s-electron density around the Fe nucleus and as well as the electric field gradient strength increases. The latter finding is associated with increasing asymmetricity of 3d-electron distribution and this fact presumably gives arise to an exotic superconductivity in the Co- and Fe-based compounds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,"Relaxor ferroelectrics are characterized by a broadened and dispersive permittivity peak in their temperature-dependent dielectric spectra. Although several models have been proposed to explain the nature of these materials, understanding their relaxation dynamics still remains open and requires additional theoretical and experimental explanations. Particularly, a precise determination of the freezing temperature still remains controversial because the influence of dynamic ruptures at temperatures approaching the freezing states (dynamic crossovers) has never evaluated before. In this paper, a model-free approach for describing the super-Arrhenius behaviour in glassy systems is validated for relaxor ferroelectrics. As a result, a predicted dynamic change at a specific temperature (crossover temperature) is evidenced by a derivative-based representation of the relaxation time data. The Stickel function is suggested as a more straightforward but model-dependent method for obtaining the dynamic crossover temperature. Furthermore, the divergence (freezing) temperature is obtained on the basis of the Gruneisen-style activation energy temperature index without assuming any model equation for parameterizing the relaxation data. The influence of the dynamic change occurrences on the freezing temperature determination is also considered, showing that the dynamic crossover temperature determination is a key factor for a proper finding of the freezing temperature in relaxor ferroelectrics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"We investigate the charge carrier dynamics in bilayer graphene subject to monochromatic laser irradiation within the Landau level quantization regime. Even though the radiation field does not lift the energy degeneracy of the lowest Landau levels (LLs), it nevertheless has a strong effect on the photoinduced pseudospin polarization response for higher LLs (n >= 2). Our results show that the photoinduced bandgaps lead to a finite response of the averaged pseudospin polarization with nontrivial oscillating behavior. It is shown that the contribution from these higher LL transitions turns out to be crucial to achieve an enhanced photoinduced polarization in radiated bilayer graphene. The experimental feasibility of our findings is also discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compound 5OSCl has an enantiotropic nematic phase N and monotropic smectic A phase and 6OSCl is characterised by the existence of two enantiotropic phases, the N and smectic A phases. The compound 11OSNO(2) only exhibits an enantiotropic SmA phase. The permanent dipole moments of the studied molecules are located parallel to their long axes, which promotes the formation of SmA phase variants. The results of dielectric permittivity dispersion and absorption and spontaneous polarisation measurements allowed the SmA phase to be identified in the compounds we investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"Five-dimensional domain walls in gauged SU(5) generate a position-dependent symmetry breaking pattern along the additional dimension. We analyze the perturbative stability and the four-dimensional (4D) spectrum of these walls in the self-gravitating case, in terms of diffeomorphism-invariant and Lie algebra gauge-invariant field fluctuations. We show that tachyonic modes are absent, ensuring perturbative stability. As expected, gravitational tensor and vector fluctuations behave like their counterparts in the standard Z(2) domain walls. All the Lie algebra valued fluctuations exhibit towers of 4D massive modes, which propagate in the bulk, with a continuous spectrum starting from zero. All the would-be 4D Nambu-Goldstone fields, which are gravitationally trapped in the case of a global symmetry, are nontrivially absent. However, we fmd no localizable 4D gauge bosons, either massless or massive. Instead, quasilocalizable discrete 4D massive modes for the gauge field fluctuations are found, along the spontaneously broken directions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

93,"We present predictions for CP violating phases of the Type-I seesaw model with four-zero textures on the Dirac mass matrix. For the four-zero textures, the effective low energy Majorana mass matrix is parametrized with seven parameters. They are three mass-dimensional parameters, two angles and two CP violating sources. The number of these parameters is less than that of the general description of the Majorana mass matrix with three neutrino masses, three mixing angles and three CP violating phases. In particular, only two independent CP violating sources give rise to three CP violating phases. The efficient and comprehensive method is proposed in this paper to investigate four-zero textures in Type-I seesaw. We numerically show the possible range of CP violating phases in the plane of a Dirac CP violating phase and one of Majorana phases. Some cases show the strong correlations among two phases. These correlations can be explained by hidden relations among the elements of Majorana matrix with the fourzero textures. The hidden relations are classified according to the position of one vanishing off-diagonal element of Majorana mass matrix. The Majorana mass matrix all of whose elements are non-vanishing also produces other hidden relations particularly in the case of four-zero textures. By applying the hidden relations, we describe the concrete correlations among CP violating phases. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"In this paper, the propagation of the energy of internal waves in a three-layer hydrodynamic liquid system 'a layer with a solid bottom-a layer-a layer with a lid' is investigated. The problem statement is executed in a dimensionless form. Using the method of multidimensional development, the first three linear problems were obtained. For the first approximation problem, a dispersion equation of the first order is derived, and two pairs of independent solutions are obtained. The dependence of total energy on the wave number and thickness at different values of physical parameters were graphically illustrated and analyzed. The limiting case in which the obtained results are compared with the calculation of the energy that transferring the wave in the hydrodynamic system 'liquid layer-a layer with a lid', which was investigated earlier is considered. Graphically illustrates the transition of this system to a two-layer one.

95,"Motivated by the challenges of uncertainty quantification for coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics, we investigate the role of perturbation theory in model reduction of classical systems. In particular, we consider the task of coarse-graining rigid bodies in the context of generalized multipole potentials that have controllable levels of accuracy relative to their atomistic counterparts. We show how the multipole framework yields a hierarchy of models that systematically connects a CG ""point molecule"" approximation to the exact dynamics. We use these results to understand when and how the CG models fail to describe atomistic dynamics at the trajectory level and develop asymptotic error estimates for approximate molecular potential energies. Implications for other model-reduction strategies are also discussed. Key findings of this work are that (i) omitting rotational energy introduces significant error when coarse-graining and (ii) attention to symmetry can improve accuracy of ""point-molecule"" approximations. Analytical derivations and numerical results support these conclusions. Relevance to nonrigid bodies is also discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that the flag model admits a homogeneous solution for ""mixed"" Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) boundary conditions only for sufficiently large length L and undergoes a phase transition from the phase of partly broken gauge symmetry U(1) to the symmetric phase U(1) x U(1) for large L. On the other hand, the Grassmannian model has a detached phase with one massive and one massless non-zero condensates that completely break U(2) gauge symmetry. This phase lives on a region of L bounded from above and has to use the Robin boundary conditions. We also examine the L-dependence of the total energy and detect the linear growth inherent to confining string in all phases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
