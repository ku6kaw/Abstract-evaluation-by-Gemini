0,"We present NNPDF3.0, the first set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined with a methodology validated by a closure test. NNPDF3.0 uses a global dataset including HERA-II deep-inelastic inclusive cross-sections, the combined HERA charm data, jet production from ATLAS and CMS, vector boson rapidity and transverse momentum distributions from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, W +c data from CMS and top quark pair production total cross sections from ATLAS and CMS. Results are based on LO, NLO and NNLO QCD theory and also include electroweak corrections. To validate our methodology, we show that PDFs determined from pseudo-data generated from a known underlying law correctly reproduce the statistical distributions expected on the basis of the assumed experimental uncertainties. This closure test ensures that our methodological uncertainties are negligible in comparison to the generic theoretical and experimental uncertainties of PDF determination. This enables us to determine with confidence PDFs at different perturbative orders and using a variety of experimental datasets ranging from HERA-only up to a global set including the latest LHC results, all using precisely the same validated methodology. We explore some of the phenomenological implications of our results for the upcoming 13 TeV Run of the LHC, in particular for Higgs production cross-sections.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
1,"Owing to the size mismatch between light and nanoscale objects such as single molecules, it is important to be able to control light-molecule interactions(1-4). Plasmonic nanoantennas create highly enhanced local fields when pumped resonantly, leading to increased Raman scattering(5), but whether fluorescence enhancement occurs depends upon a variety of factors. Although sharp metal tips(6) and colloids(7,8) can enhance fluorescence, the highly enhanced optical fields of lithographically fabricated bowtie nanoantennas(9) provide a structure that is more controllable and amenable to integration. Using gold bowties, we observe enhancements of a single molecule's fluorescence up to a factor of 1,340, ten times higher than reported previously(7,8,10-22). Electromagnetic simulations reveal that this is a result of greatly enhanced absorption and an increased radiative emission rate, leading to enhancement of the intrinsic quantum efficiency by an estimated factor of nine, despite additional non-radiative ohmic effects. Bowtie nanoantennas thus show great potential for high-contrast selection of single nanoemitters.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes
2,"Solar steam generation, combining the most abundant resources of solar energy and unpurified water, has been regarded as one of the most promising techniques for water purification. Here, an artificial tree with a reverse-tree design is demonstrated as a cost-effective, scalable yet highly efficient steam-generation device. The reverse-tree design implies that the wood is placed on the water with the tree-growth direction parallel to the water surface; accordingly, water is transported in a direction perpendicular to what occurs in natural tree. The artificial tree is fabricated by cutting the natural tree along the longitudinal direction followed by surface carbonization (called as C-L-Wood). The nature-made 3D interconnected micro-/nanochannels enable efficient water transpiration, while the layered channels block the heat effectively. A much lower thermal conductivity (0.11 W m(-1) K-1) thus can be achieved, only 1/3 of that of the horizontally cut wood. Meanwhile, the carbonized surface can absorb almost all the incident light. The simultaneous optimizations of water transpiration, thermal management, and light absorption results in a high efficiency of 89% at 10 kW m(-2), among the highest values in literature. Such wood-based high-performance, cost-effective, scalable steam-generation device can provide an attractive solution to the pressing global clean water shortage problem.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no
3,"To enhance and optimize nanocatalyst performance and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel-cell applications, we look beyond Pt-metal disordered alloys and describe a new class of Pt-Co nanocatalysts composed of ordered Pt3Co intermetallic cores with a 2-3 atomic-layer-thick platinum shell. These nanocatalysts exhibited over 200% increase in mass activity and over 300% increase in specific activity when compared with the disordered Pt3Co alloy nanoparticles as well as Pt/C. So far, this mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction is the highest among the Pt-Co systems reported in the literature under similar testing conditions. Stability tests showed a minimal loss of activity after 5,000 potential cycles and the ordered core-shell structure was maintained virtually intact, as established by atomic-scale elemental mapping. The high activity and stability are attributed to the Pt-rich shell and the stable intermetallic Pt3Co core arrangement. These ordered nanoparticles provide a new direction for catalyst performance optimization for next-generation fuel cells.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes
4,"The most commonly used electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors are activated carbons, because they are commercially available and cheap, and they can be produced with large specific surface area. However, only the electrochemically available surface area is useful for charging the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL formation is especially efficient in carbon pores of size below 1 nm because of the lack of space charge and a good attraction of ions along the pore walls. The pore size should ideally match the size of the ions. However, for good dynamic charge propagation, some small mesopores are useful. An asymmetric configuration, where the positive and negative electrodes are constructed from different materials, e. g., activated carbon, transition metal oxide or conducting polymer, is of great interest because of an important extension of the operating voltage. In such a case, the energy as well as power is greatly increased. It appears that nanotubes are a perfect conducting additive and/or support for materials with pseudocapacitance properties, e. g. MnO2, conducting polymers. Substitutional heteroatoms in the carbon network (nitrogen, oxygen) are a promising way to enhance the capacitance. Carbons obtained by one-step pyrolysis of organic precursors rich in heteroatoms (nitrogen and/or oxygen) are very interesting, because they are denser than activated carbons. The application of a novel type of electrolyte with a broad voltage window (ionic liquids) is considered, but the stability of this new generation of electrolyte during long term cycling of capacitors is not yet confirmed.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no
5,"A current interpretation of XPS spectra of Ni metal assumes that the main 6 eV satellite is due to a two hole c3d(9)4s(2) (c is a core hole) final state effect. We report REELS observation in AES at low voltages of losses (plasmons and inter-band transitions) corresponding to the satellite structures in Ni metal 2p spectra. The satellite near 6 eV is attributed to a predominant surface plasmon loss. A current interpretation of Ni 2p spectra of oxides and other compounds is based oil charge transfer assignments of the main peak at 854.6 eV and the broad satellite centred at around 861 eV to the cd(9)L and the unscreened cd(8) final-state configurations, respectively (L is a ligand hole). Multiplet splittings have been shown to be necessary for assignment of Fe 2p and Cr 2p spectral profiles and chemical states. The assignments of Ni 2p states are re-examined with intra-atomic multiplet envelopes applied to Ni(OH)(2), NiOOH and NiO spectra. It is shown that the free ion inultiplet envelopes for Ni2+ and Ni3+ simulate the main line and satellite structures for Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH. Fitting the NiO Ni 2p spectral profile is not as straightforward as the hydroxide and oxyhydroxide. It may involve contributions from interatomic. non-local electronic coupling and screening effects with multiplet structures significantly different from the free ions as found for MnO. A scheme for fitting these spectra using multiplet envelopes is proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"Oxidation of graphite produces graphite oxide, which is dispersible in water as individual platelets. After deposition onto Si/SiO2 substrates, chemical reduction produces graphene sheets. Electrical conductivity measurements indicate a 10000-fold increase in conductivity after chemical reduction to graphene. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy measurements show one to two layer graphene steps. Electrodes patterned onto a reduced graphite oxide film demonstrate a field effect response when the gate voltage. is varied from +15 to -15 V. Temperature-dependent conductivity indicates that the graphene-like sheets exhibit semiconducting behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"We derive an effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian to describe the low-energy electronic excitations of a graphite bilayer, which correspond to chiral quasiparticles with a parabolic dispersion exhibiting Berry phase 2 pi. Its high-magnetic-field Landau-level spectrum consists of almost equidistant groups of fourfold degenerate states at finite energy and eight zero-energy states. This can be translated into the Hall conductivity dependence on carrier density, sigma(xy)(N), which exhibits plateaus at integer values of 4e(2)/h and has a double 8e(2)/h step between the hole and electron gases across zero density, in contrast to (4n+2)e(2)/h sequencing in a monolayer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"We demonstrate that the electronic gap of a graphene bilayer can be controlled externally by applying a gate bias. From the magnetotransport data (Shubnikov-de Haas measurements of the cyclotron mass), and using a tight-binding model, we extract the value of the gap as a function of the electronic density. We show that the gap can be changed from zero to midinfrared energies by using fields of less than or similar to 1 V/nm, below the electric breakdown of SiO2. The opening of a gap is clearly seen in the quantum Hall regime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,"It is shown that localization is necessary to preserve size consistency in nonlinear extrapolations of molecular energies. We demonstrate that the unphysical behavior of Mulliken populations obtained from extended basis set wave functions can lead to incomplete localization of orbitals by the Pipek-Mezey population localization method, and introduce a modification to correct this problem. The new localization procedure, called minimum population localization, is incorporated into the CBS-QB3 and the new CBS-4M model chemistries, and their performance is assessed on the G2/97 test set. The errors found for CBS-QB3 are comparable with those for the G3 and G3(MP2) (mean absolute deviation of 1.10, 0.94, and 1.21 kcal/mol, respectively, on the G2/97 test set). The CBS-4M is less accurate than the other models (mean absolute deviation of 3.26 kcal/mol on the G2/97 test set), but can be applied to much larger systems. The modified localization method resolves several problem cases found with CBS-4 and improves the reliability of CBS-QB3. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

11,"We describe the observation of GW170104, a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of a pair of stellar-mass black holes. The signal was measured on January 4, 2017 at 10: 11: 58.6 UTC by the twin advanced detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory during their second observing run, with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm rate less than 1 in 70 000 years. The inferred component black hole masses are 31.2(-6.0)(+8.4) M-circle dot and 19.4(-5.9)(+5.3)M(circle dot) (at the 90% credible level). The black hole spins are best constrained through measurement of the effective inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the spin components perpendicular to the orbital plane, chi(eff) = -0.12(-0.30)(+0.21) . This result implies that spin configurations with both component spins positively aligned with the orbital angular momentum are disfavored. The source luminosity distance is 880(-390)(+450) Mpc corresponding to a redshift of z = 0.18(-0.07)(+0.08) . We constrain the magnitude of modifications to the gravitational-wave dispersion relation and perform null tests of general relativity. Assuming that gravitons are dispersed in vacuum like massive particles, we bound the graviton mass to m(g) <= 7.7 x 10(-23) eV/c(2). In all cases, we find that GW170104 is consistent with general relativity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"We employ gravitational-wave radiometry to map the stochastic gravitational wave background expected from a variety of contributing mechanisms and test the assumption of isotropy using data from the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory's (aLIGO) first observing run. We also search for persistent gravitational waves from point sources with only minimal assumptions over the 20-1726 Hz frequency band. Finding no evidence of gravitational waves from either point sources or a stochastic background, we set limits at 90% confidence. For broadband point sources, we report upper limits on the gravitational wave energy flux per unit frequency in the range F-a circle minus (integral) < (0.1-56) x 10(-8) erg cm(-2) s(-1) Hz(-1) (f/25 Hz(a-1) depending on the sky location Theta and the spectral power index a. For extended sources, we report upper limits on the fractional gravitational wave energy density required to close the Universe of Omega(f,Theta < (0.39-7.6) x 10(-8) sr(-1) (f/25 Hz)(a) depending on Theta and a. Directed searches for narrowband gravitational waves from astrophysically interesting objects (Scorpius X- 1, Supernova 1987 A, and the Galactic Center) yield median frequency- dependent limits on strain amplitude of h(0) < (6.7, 5.5, and 7.0) x 10(-25), respectively, at the most sensitive detector frequencies between 130- 175 Hz. This represents a mean improvement of a factor of 2 across the band compared to previous searches of this kind for these sky locations, considering the different quantities of strain constrained in each case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"Composites incorporating two-dimensional nanostructures within polymeric matrices have potential as functional components for several technologies, including gas separation. Prospectively, employing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as versatile nanofillers would notably broaden the scope of functionalities. However, synthesizing MOFs in the form of freestanding nanosheets has proved challenging. We present a bottom-up synthesis strategy for dispersible copper 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate MOF lamellae of micrometre lateral dimensions and nanometre thickness. Incorporating MOF nanosheets into polymer matrices endows the resultant composites with outstanding CO2 separation performance from CO2/CH4 gas mixtures, together with an unusual and highly desired increase in the separation selectivity with pressure. As revealed by tomographic focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, the unique separation behaviour stems from a superior occupation of the membrane cross-section by the MOF nanosheets as compared with isotropic crystals, which improves the efficiency of molecular discrimination and eliminates unselective permeation pathways. This approach opens the door to ultrathin MOF-polymer composites for various applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"We point out a general framework that encompasses most cases in which quantum effects enable an increase in precision when estimating a parameter (quantum metrology). The typical quantum precision enhancement is of the order of the square root of the number of times the system is sampled. We prove that this is optimal, and we point out the different strategies (classical and quantum) that permit one to attain this bound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An efficiency of >11%, which is among the top values in the PSC field, and excellent thermal stability is obtained using PBDB-T and ITIC as donor and acceptor, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"Advanced thermoelectric technology offers a potential for converting waste industrial heat into useful electricity, and an emission-free method for solid state cooling(1,2). Worldwide efforts to find materials with thermoelectric figure of merit, zT values significantly above unity, are frequently focused on crystalline semiconductors with low thermal conductivity(2). Here we report on Cu2-xSe, which reaches a zT of 1.5 at 1,000 K, among the highest values for any bulk materials. Whereas the Se atoms in Cu2-xSe form a rigid face-centred cubic lattice, providing a crystalline pathway for semiconducting electrons (or more precisely holes), the copper ions are highly disordered around the Se sublattice and are superionic with liquid-like mobility. This extraordinary 'liquid-like' behaviour of copper ions around a crystalline sublattice of Se in Cu2-xSe results in an intrinsically very low lattice thermal conductivity which enables high zT in this otherwise simple semiconductor. This unusual combination of properties leads to an ideal thermoelectric material. The results indicate a new strategy and direction for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials by exploring systems where there exists a crystalline sublattice for electronic conduction surrounded by liquid-like ions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"The emerging field of nanophotonics(1) addresses the critical challenge of manipulating light on scales much smaller than the wavelength. However, very few feasible practical approaches exist at present. Surface plasmon polaritons(2,3) are among the most promising candidates for subwavelength optical confinement(3-10). However, studies of long-range surface plasmon polaritons have only demonstrated optical confinement comparable to that of conventional dielectric waveguides, because of practical issues including optical losses and stringent fabrication demands(3,11-13). Here, we propose a new approach that integrates dielectric waveguiding with plasmonics. The hybrid optical waveguide consists of a dielectric nanowire separated from a metal surface by a nanoscale dielectric gap. The coupling between the plasmonic and waveguide modes across the gap enables 'capacitor-like' energy storage that allows effective subwavelength transmission in non-metallic regions. In this way, surface plasmon polaritons can travel over large distances (40-150 mm) with strong mode confinement ( ranging from lambda(2)/400 to lambda(2)/40). This approach is fully compatible with semiconductor fabrication techniques and could lead to truly nanoscale semiconductor-based plasmonics and photonics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"The co-authorship network of scientists represents a prototype of complex evolving networks. In addition, it offers one of the most extensive database to date on social networks. By mapping the electronic database containing all relevant journals in mathematics and neuro-science for an 8-year period (1991-98), we infer the dynamic and the structural mechanisms that govern the evolution and topology of this complex system. Three complementary approaches allow us to obtain a detailed characterization. First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topological measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities. The results indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution is governed by preferential attachment, affecting both internal and external links. However, in contrast with most model predictions the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases. Second, we propose a simple model that captures the network's time evolution. In some limits the model can be solved analytically, predicting a two-regime scaling in agreement with the measurements. Third, numerical simulations are used to uncover the behavior of quantities that could not be predicted analytically. The combined numerical and analytical results underline the important role internal links play in determining the observed scaling behavior and network topology. The results and methodologies developed in the context of the co-authorship network could be useful for a systematic study of other complex evolving networks as well, such as the world wide web, Internet, or other social networks.

20,"We have calculated the spin-polarization effects of a current in a two-dimensional electron gas which is contacted by two ferromagnetic metals. In the purely diffusive regime, the current may indeed be spin-polarized. However, for a typical device geometry the degree of spin-polarization of the current is limited to less than 0.1% only. The change in device resistance for parallel and antiparallel magnetization of the contacts is up to quadratically smaller, and will thus be difficult to detect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"The two-dimensional layer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has recently attracted much interest due to its direct-gap property and potential applications in optoelectronics and energy harvesting. However, the synthetic approach to obtain high-quality and large-area MoS2 atomic thin layers is still rare. Here we report that the high-temperature annealing of a thermally decomposed ammonium thiomolybdate layer in the presence of sulfur can produce large-area MoS2 thin layers with superior electrical performance on insulating substrates. Spectroscopic and microscopic results reveal that the synthesized MoS2 sheets are highly crystalline. The electron mobility of the bottom-gate transistor devices made of the synthesized MoS2 layer is comparable with those of the micromechanically exfoliated thin sheets from MoS2 crystals. This synthetic approach is simple, scalable, and applicable to other transition metal dichalcogenides. Meanwhile, the obtained MoS2 films are transferable to arbitrary substrates, providing great opportunities to make layered composites by stacking various atomically thin layers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"The search for ferromagnetism above room temperature in dilute magnetic semiconductors has been intense in recent years. We report the first observations of ferromagnetism above room temperature for dilute (<4 at.%) Mn-doped ZnO. The Mn is found to carry an average magnetic moment of 0.16 μ(B) per ion. Our ab initio calculations find a valance state of Mn2+ and that the magnetic moments are ordered ferromagnetically, consistent with the experimental findings. We have obtained room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in bulk pellets, in transparent films 2-3 μm thick, and in the powder form of the same material. The unique feature of our sample preparation was the low-temperature processing. When standard high-temperature (T>700degreesC) methods were used, samples were found to exhibit clustering and were not ferromagnetic at room temperature. This capability to fabricate ferromagnetic Mn-doped ZnO semiconductors promises new spintronic devices as well as magneto-optic components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"Correlation consistent basis sets for accurately describing core-core and core-valence correlation effects in atoms and molecules have been developed for the second row atoms Al-Ar. Two different optimization strategies were investigated, which led to two families of core-valence basis sets when the optimized functions were added to the standard correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ). In the first case, the exponents of the augmenting primitive Gaussian functions were optimized with respect to the difference between all-electron and valence-electron correlated calculations, i.e., for the core-core plus core-valence correlation energy. This yielded the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets, which are analogous to the sets developed previously for the first row atoms [D. E. Woon and T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 103, 4572 (1995)]. Although the cc-pCVnZ sets exhibit systematic convergence to the all-electron correlation energy at the complete basis set limit, the intershell (core-valence) correlation energy converges more slowly than the intrashell (core-core) correlation energy. Since the effect of including the core electrons on the calculation of molecular properties tends to be dominated by core-valence correlation effects, a second scheme for determining the augmenting functions was investigated. In this approach, the exponents of the functions to be added to the cc-pVnZ sets were optimized with respect to just the core-valence (intershell) correlation energy, except that a small amount of core-core correlation energy was included in order to ensure systematic convergence to the complete basis set limit. These new sets, denoted weighted core-valence basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ), significantly improve the convergence of many molecular properties with n. Optimum cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row atoms were also developed and show similar advantages. Both the cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules (Al-2, Si-2, P-2, S-2, and Cl-2), as well as on selected diatomic molecules involving first row atoms (CO, SiO, PN, and BCl). For the calculation of core correlation effects on energetic and spectroscopic properties, the cc-pwCVnZ basis sets are recommended over the cc-pCVnZ ones.

24,"We show that nanometer-scale pores in single-layer freestanding graphene can effectively filter NaCl salt from water. Using classical molecular dynamics, we report the desalination performance of such membranes as a function of pore size, chemical functionalization, and applied pressure. Our results indicate that the membrane's ability to prevent the salt passage depends critically on pore diameter with adequately sized pores allowing for water flow while blocking ions. Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water flux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water flux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions. Overall, our results indicate that the water permeability of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reverse osmosis membranes, and that nanoporous graphene may have a valuable role to play for water purification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"A series of highly soluble fullerene derivatives with varying acceptor strengths (i.e., first reduction potentials) was synthesized and used as electron acceptors in plastic solar cells. These fullerene derivatives, methanofullerene [6,6]-plienyl C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a new azafulleroid, and a ketolactam quasifullerene, show a variation of almost 200 mV in their first reduction potential. The open circuit voltage of the corresponding devices was found to correlate directly with the acceptor strength of the fullerenes, whereas it was rather insensitive to variations of the work function of the negative electrode. These observations are discussed within the concept of Fermi level pinning between fullerenes and metals via surface charges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"While platinum has hitherto been the element of choice for catalysing oxygen electroreduction in acidic polymer fuel cells, tremendous progress has been reported for pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials. However, the structure of their active sites has remained elusive, delaying further advance. Here, we synthesized Fe-N-C materials quasi-free of crystallographic iron structures after argon or ammonia pyrolysis. These materials exhibit nearly identical Mossbauer spectra and identical X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra, revealing the same Fe-centred moieties. However, the much higher activity and basicity of NH3-pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials demonstrates that the turnover frequency of Fe-centred moieties depends on the physico-chemical properties of the support. Following a thorough XANES analysis, the detailed structures of two FeN4 porphyrinic architectures with different O-2 adsorption modes were then identified. These porphyrinic moieties are not easily integrated in graphene sheets, in contrast with Fe-centred moieties assumed hitherto for pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials. These new insights open the path to bottom-up synthesis approaches and studies on site-support interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"Given the energy of a solid (E) as a function of the molecular volume (V), the gibbs program uses a quasi-harmonic Debye model to generate the Debye temperature Theta (V), obtains the non-equilibrium Gibbs function G* (V; p, T), and minimizes G* to derive the thermal equation of state (EOS) V(p, T) and the chemical potential G(p, T) of the corresponding phase. Other macroscopic properties are also derived as a function of p and T from standard thermodynamic relations. The program focuses in obtaining as much thermodynamical information as possible from a minimum set of (E, V) data, making it suitable to analyse the output of costly electronic structure calculations, adding thermal effects at a low computational cost. Any of three analytical EOS widely used in the literature can be fitted to the p - V (p, T) data, giving an alternative set of isothermal bulk moduli and their pressure derivatives that can be fed to the Debye model machinery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"A comprehensive study is undertaken to assess the nonempirical meta-generalized gradient approximation (MGGA) of Tao, Perdew, Staroverov, and Scuseria (TPSS) against 14 common exchange-correlation energy functionals. Principal results are presented in the form of statistical summaries of deviations from experiment for the G3/99 test set (223 enthalpies of formation, 86 ionization potentials, 58 electron affinities, 8 proton affinities) and three additional test sets involving 96 bond lengths, 82 harmonic vibrational frequencies, and 10 hydrogen-bonded complexes, all computed using the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis. The TPSS functional matches, or exceeds in accuracy all prior nonempirical constructions and, unlike semiempirical functionals, consistently provides a high-quality description of diverse systems and properties. The computational cost of self-consistent MGGA is comparable to that of ordinary GGA, and exact exchange (unavailable in some codes) is not required. A one-parameter global hybrid version of the TPSS functional is introduced and shown to give further improvement for most properties.

30,"A re-parameterization of the standard TIP4P water model for use with Ewald techniques is introduced, providing an overall global improvement in water properties relative to several popular nonpolarizable and polarizable water potentials. Using high precision simulations, and careful application of standard analytical corrections, we show that the new TIP4P-Ew potential has a density maximum at similar to1 degreesC, and reproduces experimental bulk-densities and the enthalpy of vaporization, DeltaH(vap), from -37.5 to 127 degreesC at 1 atm with an absolute average error of less than 1%. Structural properties are in very good agreement with x-ray scattering intensities at temperatures between 0 and 77 degreesC and dynamical properties such as self-diffusion coefficient are in excellent agreement with experiment. The parameterization approach used can be easily generalized to rehabilitate any water force field using available experimental data over a range of thermodynamic points.

31,We present first-principles based calculations of the tunneling conductance and magnetoconductance of epitaxial Fe(100)\MgO(100)\Fe(100) sandwiches. Our results indicate that tunneling is much more interesting and complicated than the simple barrier model used previously. We obtain the following general results: (1) Tunneling conductance depends strongly on the symmetry of the Bloch states in the electrodes and of the evanescent states in the barrier layer. (2) Bloch states of different symmetry decay at different rates within the barrier. The decay rate is determined by the complex energy bands of the same symmetry in the barrier. (3) There may be quantum interference between the decaying states in the barrier. This leads to an oscillatory dependence of the tunneling current on kll and a damped oscillatory dependence on barrier thickness. (4) Interfacial resonance states can allow particular Bloch states to tunnel efficiently through the barrier. For Fe(100)(MgO(100)\Fe(100) our calculations indicate that quite different tunneling mechanisms dominate the conductance in the two spin channels. In the majority channel the conductance is primarily via Bloch electrons with small transverse momentum. One particular state with Delta (1) symmetry is able to effectively couple from the Fe into the MgO. In the minority channel the conductance is primarily through interface resonance states especially for thinner layers. We predict a large magnetoresistance that increases with barrier thickness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the different topological sectors can be distinguished, depending on the case, by a Z or a Z(2) topological invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we construct representatives of topological insulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using these representatives we demonstrate how topological insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and different classes can be related via 'dimensional reduction' by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in 'Kaluza-Klein'-like fashion). For Z-topological insulators (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one dimension at a time into a different class. The Z(2)-topological insulators (superconductors), on the other hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of parent Z-topological insulators in the same class, from which they inherit their topological properties. The eightfold periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or charge-conjugation/particle-hole symmetries) is a reflection of the eightfold periodicity of the spinor representations of the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). Furthermore, we derive for general spatial dimensions a relation between the topological invariant that characterizes topological insulators and superconductors with chiral symmetry (i.e., the winding number) and the Chern-Simons invariant. For lower-dimensional cases, this formula relates the winding number to the electric polarization (d = 1 spatial dimensions) or to the magnetoelectric polarizability (d = 3 spatial dimensions). Finally, we also discuss topological field theories describing the spacetime theory of linear responses in topological insulators (superconductors) and study how the presence of inversion symmetry modifies the classification of topological insulators (superconductors).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This bulk carbon-nanotube material retains the intrinsic properties of individual SWNTs, such as high surface area flexibility and electrical conductivity. By controlling the fabrication process, it is possible to fabricate a wide range of solids in numerous shapes and structures. This dense SWNT material is advantageous for numerous applications, and here we demonstrate its use as flexible heaters as well as supercapacitor electrodes for compact energy-storage devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Status and future outlook of III-V compound semiconductor visible-spectrum light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are presented. Light extraction techniques are reviewed and extraction efficiencies are quantified in the 60%+ (AlGaInP) and similar to 80% (InGaN) regimes for state-of-the-art devices. The phosphor-based white LED concept is reviewed and recent performance discussed, showing that high-power white LEDs now approach the 100-lm/W regime. Devices employing multiple phosphors for ""warm"" white color temperatures (similar to 3000-4000 K) and high color rendering (CRI > 80), which provide properties critical for many illumination applications, are discussed. Recent developments in chip design, packaging, and high current performance lead to very high luminance devices (similar to 50 Mcd/m(2) white at 1 A forward current in 1 x 1 mm(2) chip) that are suitable for application to automotive forward lighting.

35,"We formulate a universal characterization of the many-particle quantum entanglement in the ground state of a topologically ordered two-dimensional medium with a mass gap. We consider a disk in the plane, with a smooth boundary of length L, large compared to the correlation length. In the ground state, by tracing out all degrees of freedom in the exterior of the disk, we obtain a marginal density operator rho for the degrees of freedom in the interior. The von Neumann entropy of rho, a measure of the entanglement of the interior and exterior variables, has the form S(rho)=alpha L-gamma+..., where the ellipsis represents terms that vanish in the limit L ->infinity. We show that -gamma is a universal constant characterizing a global feature of the entanglement in the ground state. Using topological quantum field theory methods, we derive a formula for gamma in terms of properties of the superselection sectors of the medium.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"It is well-known that conventional field effect transistors (FETs) require a change in the channel potential of at least 60 mV at 300 K to effect a change in the current by a factor of 10, and this minimum subthreshold slope S puts a fundamental lower limit on the operating voltage and hence the power dissipation in standard FET-based switches. Here, we suggest that by replacing the standard insulator with a ferroelectric insulator of the right thickness it should be possible to implement a step-up voltage transformer that will amplify the gate voltage thus leading to values of S lower than 60 mV/decade and enabling low voltage/low power operation. The voltage transformer action can be understood intuitively as the result of an effective negative capacitance provided by the ferroelectric capacitor that arises from an internal positive feedback that in principle could be obtained from other microscopic mechanisms as well. Unlike other proposals to reduce S, this involves no change in the basic physics of the FET and thus does not affect its current drive or impose other restrictions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"The accumulation and extrusion of Ca2+ in the pre- and postsynaptic compartments play a critical role in initiating plastic changes in biological synapses. To emulate this fundamental process in electronic devices, we developed diffusive Ag-in-oxide memristors with a temporal response during and after stimulation similar to that of the synaptic Ca2+ dynamics. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle dynamics simulations both demonstrate that Ag atoms disperse under electrical bias and regroup spontaneously under zero bias because of interfacial energy minimization, closely resembling synaptic influx and extrusion of Ca2+, respectively. The diffusive memristor and its dynamics enable a direct emulation of both short- and long-term plasticity of biological synapses, representing an advance in hardware implementation of neuromorphic functionalities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"For nearly a decade, researchers have debated the mechanisms by which AgNPs exert toxicity to bacteria and other organisms. The most elusive question has been whether the AgNPs exert direct ""particle-specific"" effects beyond the known antimicrobial activity of released silver ions (Ag+). Here, we infer that Ag+ is the definitive molecular toxicant. We rule out direct particle-specific biological effects by showing the lack of toxicity of AgNPs when synthesized and tested under strictly anaerobic conditions that preclude Ag(0) oxidation and Ag+ release. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the toxicity of various AgNPs (PEG- or PVP- coated, of three different sizes each) accurately follows the dose response pattern of E. coli exposed to Ag+ (added as AgNO3). Surprisingly, E. coli survival was stimulated by relatively low (sublethal) concentration of all tested AgNPs and AgNO3 (at 3-8 mu g/L Ag+, or 12-31% of the minimum lethal concentration (MLC)), suggesting a hormetic response that would be counterproductive to antimicrobial applications. Overall, this work suggests that AgNP morphological properties known to affect antimicrobial activity are indirect effectors that primarily influence Ag+ release. Accordingly, antibacterial activity could be controlled (and environmental impacts could be mitigated) by modulating Ag+ release, possibly through manipulation of oxygen availability, particle size, shape, and/or type of coating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by coprecipitation method at 450 degrees C. X-ray diffraction result indicates that the sample is having a crystalline wurtzite phase. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) result reveals that the ZnO sample is spherical in shape with an average grain size of about 50 nm. X ray peak broadening analysis was used to evaluate the crystalline sizes and lattice strain by the Williamson-Hall (W-H) analysis. All other relevant physical parameters such as strain, stress, and energy density values were also calculated using W-H analysis with different models, viz, uniform deformation model, uniform deformation stress model and uniform deformation energy density model. The root mean square strain was determined from the interplanar spacing and strain estimated from the three models. The three models yield different strain values; it may be due to the anisotropic nature of the material. The mean particle size of ZnO nanoparticles estimated from TEM analysis, Scherrer's formula and W-H analysis is highly intercorrelated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"The short charging times and high power capabilities associated with capacitive energy storage make this approach an attractive alternative to batteries. One limitation of electrochemical capacitors is their low energy density and for this reason, there is widespread interest in pseudocapacitive materials that use Faradaic reactions to store charge. One candidate pseudocapacitive material is orthorhombic MoO3 (alpha-MoO3), a layered compound with a high theoretical capacity for lithium (279 mA h g(-1) or 1,005 C g(-1)). Here, we report on the properties of reduced alpha-MoO3-x(R-MoO3-x) and compare it with fully oxidized alpha-MoO3 (F-MoO3). The introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a larger interlayer spacing that promotes faster charge storage kinetics and enables the alpha-MoO3 structure to be retained during the insertion and removal of Li ions. The higher specific capacity of the R-MoO3-x is attributed to the reversible formation of a significant amount of Mo4+ following lithiation. This study underscores the potential importance of incorporating oxygen vacancies into transition metal oxides as a strategy for increasing the charge storage kinetics of redox-active materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"In recent years, zwitterionic materials such as poly(carboxybetaine) (pCB) and poly(sulfobetaine) (pSB) have been applied to a broad range of biomedical and engineering materials. Due to electrostatically induced hydration, surfaces coated with zwitterionic groups are highly resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and biofilm formation. Among zwitterionic materials, pCB is unique due to its abundant functional groups for the convenient immobilization of biomolecules. pCB can also be prepared in a hydrolyzable form as cationic pCB esters, which can kill bacteria or condense DNA. The hydrolysis of cationic pCB esters into nonfouling zwitterionic groups will lead to the release of killed microbes or the irreversible unpackaging of DNA. Furthermore, mixed-charge materials have been shown to be equivalent to zwitterionic materials in resisting nonspecific protein adsorption when they are uniformly mixed at the molecular scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

43,"We uncover the constitutive relation of graphene and probe the physics of its optical phonons by studying its Raman spectrum as a function of uniaxial strain. We find that the doubly degenerate E-2g optical mode splits in two components: one polarized along the strain and the other perpendicular. This splits the G peak into two bands, which we call G(+) and G(-), by analogy with the effect of curvature on the nanotube G peak. Both peaks redshift with increasing strain and their splitting increases, in excellent agreement with first-principles calculations. Their relative intensities are found to depend on light polarization, which provides a useful tool to probe the graphene crystallographic orientation with respect to the strain. The 2D and 2D(') bands also redshift but do not split for small strains. We study the Gruneisen parameters for the phonons responsible for the G, D, and D-' peaks. These can be used to measure the amount of uniaxial or biaxial strain, providing a fundamental tool for nanoelectronics, where strain monitoring is of paramount importance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

45,"Antiferromagnetic materials could represent the future of spintronic applications thanks to the numerous interesting features they combine: they are robust against perturbation due to magnetic fields, produce no stray fields, display ultrafast dynamics, and are capable of generating large magnetotransport effects. Intense research efforts over the past decade have been invested in unraveling spin transport properties in antiferromagnetic materials. Whether spin transport can be used to drive the antiferromagnetic order and how subsequent variations can be detected are some of the thrilling challenges currently being addressed. Antiferromagnetic spintronics started out with studies on spin transfer and has undergone a definite revival in the last few years with the publication of pioneering articles on the use of spin-orbit interactions in antiferromagnets. This paradigm shift offers possibilities for radically new concepts for spin manipulation in electronics. Central to these endeavors are the need for predictive models, relevant disruptive materials, and new experimental designs. This paper reviews the most prominent spintronic effects described based on theoretical and experimental analysis of antiferromagnetic materials. It also details some of the remaining bottlenecks and suggests possible avenues for future research. This review covers both spin-transfer-related effects, such as spin-transfer torque, spin penetration length, domain-wall motion, and ""magnetization"" dynamics, and spin-orbit related phenomena, such as (tunnel) anisotropic magnetoresistance, spin Hall, and inverse spin galvanic effects. Effects related to spin caloritronics, such as the spin Seebeck effect, are linked to the transport of magnons in antiferromagnets. The propagation of spin waves and spin superfluids in antiferromagnets is also covered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extremely high thermal conductivity in the range of similar to 3080-5150 W/m K and phonon mean free path of similar to 775 nm near room temperature were extracted for a set of graphene flakes. The obtained results suggest graphene's applications as thermal management material in future nanoelectronic circuits. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"The sub-grid-scale parameterization of clouds is one of the weakest aspects of weather and climate modeling today, and the explicit simulation of clouds will be one of the next major achievements in numerical weather prediction. Research cloud models have been in development over the last 45 years and they continue to be an important tool for investigating clouds, cloud-systems, and other small-scale atmospheric dynamics. The latest generation are now being used for weather prediction. The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) model, representative of this generation and of a class of models using explicit time-splitting integration techniques to efficiently integrate the Euler equations, is described in this paper. It is the first fully compressible conservative-form nonhydrostatic atmospheric model suitable for both research and weather prediction applications. Results are presented demonstrating its ability to resolve strongly nonlinear small-scale phenomena, clouds, and cloud systems. Kinetic energy spectra and other statistics show that the model is simulating small scales in numerical weather prediction applications, while necessarily removing energy at the gridscale but minimizing artificial dissipation at the resolved scales. Filtering requirements for atmospheric models and filters used in the ARW model are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"Graphene and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising materials for next-generation ultrathin optoelectronic devices. Although visually transparent, graphene is an excellent sunlight absorber, achieving 2.3% visible light absorbance in just 3.3 angstrom thickness. TMD monolayers also hold potential as sunlight absorbers, and may enable ultrathin photovoltaic (PV) devices due to their semi-conducting character. In this work, we show that the three TMD monolayers MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2 can absorb up to 5-10% incident sunlight in a thickness of less than 1 nm, thus achieving 1 order of magnitude higher sunlight absorption than GaAs and Si. We further study PV devices based on just two stacked monolayers: (1) a Schottky barrier solar cell between MoS2 and graphene and (2) an excitonic solar cell based on a MoS2/WS2 bilayer. We demonstrate that such 1 nm thick active layers can attain power conversion efficiencies of up to similar to 1%, corresponding to approximately 1-3 orders of magnitude higher power densities than the best existing ultrathin solar cells.

Doped metal oxides are commonly used, but their optical transparency is limited for films with a low sheet resistance. Furthermore, they are prone to cracking when deposited on flexible substrates, are costly, and require a high-temperature step for the best performance. We demonstrate solution-processed transparent electrodes consisting of random meshes of metal nanowires that exhibit an optical transparency equivalent to or better than that of metal-oxide thin films for the same sheet resistance. Organic solar cells deposited on these electrodes show a performance equivalent to that of devices based on a conventional metal-oxide transparent electrode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

54,"We use the discrete dipole approximation to investigate the electromagnetic fields induced by optical excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances of silver nanoparticles, including monomers and dimers, with emphasis on what size, shape, and arrangement leads to the largest local electric field (E-field) enhancement near the particle surfaces. The results are used to determine what conditions are most favorable for producing enhancements large enough to observe single molecule surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Most of the calculations refer to triangular prisms, which exhibit distinct dipole and quadrupole resonances that can easily be controlled by varying particle size. In addition, for the dimer calculations we study the influence of dimer separation and orientation, especially for dimers that are separated by a few nanometers. We find that the largest \E\(2) values for dimers are about a factor of 10 larger than those for all the monomers examined. For all particles and particle orientations, the plasmon resonances which lead to the largest E-fields are those with the longest wavelength dipolar excitation. The spacing of the particles in the dimer plays a crucial role, and we find that the spacing needed to achieve a given \E\(2) is proportional to nanoparticle size for particles below 100 nm in size. Particle shape and curvature are of lesser importance, with a head to tail configuration of two triangles giving enhanced fields comparable to head to head, or rounded head to tail. The largest \E\(2) values we have calculated for spacings of 2 nm or more is similar to10(5). (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

57,"Gold nanoparticles with unique optical properties may be useful as biosensors in living whole cells. Using a simple and inexpensive technique, we recorded surface plasmon resonance (SPR) scattering images and SPR absorption spectra from both colloidal gold nanoparticles and from gold nanoparticles conjugated to monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies after incubation in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCaT) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). Colloidal gold nanoparticles are found in dispersed and aggregated forms within the cell cytoplasm and provide anatomic labeling information, but their uptake is nonspecific for malignant cells. The anti-EGFR antibody conjugated nanoparticles specifically and homogeneously bind to the surface of the cancer type cells with 600% greater affinity than to the noncancerous cells. This specific and homogeneous binding is found to give a relatively sharper SPR absorption band with a red shifted maximum compared to that observed when added to the noncancerous cells. These results suggest that SPR scattering imaging or SPR absorption spectroscopy generated from antibody conjugated gold nanoparticles can be useful in molecular biosensor techniques for the diagnosis and investigation of oral epithelial living cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry-Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies.

By calculating vertical excitation energies of typical molecules, it was found that LC-TDDFT gives accurate excitation energies, within an error of 0.5 eV, and reasonable oscillator strengths, while TDDFT employing a pure functional provides 1.5 eV lower excitation energies and two orders of magnitude lower oscillator strengths for the Rydberg excitations. It was also found that LC-TDDFT clearly reproduces the correct asymptotic behavior of the charge-transfer excitation energy of ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene dimer for the long intramolecular distance, unlike a conventional far-nucleus asymptotic correction scheme. It is, therefore, presumed that poor TDDFT results for pure functionals may be due to their lack of a long-range orbital-orbital interaction.

69,"Hydrogels attract great attention as biomaterials as a result of their soft and wet nature, similar to that of biological tissues. Recent inventions of several tough hydrogels show their potential as structural biomaterials, such as cartilage.

This combination is rarely realized. Here, we report that polyampholytes, polymers bearing randomly dispersed cationic and anionic repeat groups, form tough and viscoelastic hydrogels with multiple mechanical properties. The randomness makes ionic bonds of a wide distribution of strength. The strong bonds serve as permanent crosslinks, imparting elasticity, whereas the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. These physical hydrogels of supramolecular structure can be tuned to change multiple mechanical properties over wide ranges by using diverse ionic combinations.

70,"We have performed a comprehensive first-principles investigation of native point defects in ZnO based on density functional theory within the local density approximation (LDA) as well as the LDA+U approach for overcoming the band-gap problem. Oxygen deficiency, manifested in the form of oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials, has long been invoked as the source of the commonly observed unintentional n-type conductivity in ZnO. However, contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find that native point defects are very unlikely to be the cause of unintentional n-type conductivity. Oxygen vacancies, which have most often been cited as the cause of unintentional doping, are deep rather than shallow donors and have high formation energies in n-type ZnO (and are therefore unlikely to form). Zinc interstitials are shallow donors, but they also have high formation energies in n-type ZnO and are fast diffusers with migration barriers as low as 0.57 eV; they are therefore unlikely to be stable. Zinc antisites are also shallow donors but their high formation energies (even in Zn-rich conditions) render them unlikely to be stable under equilibrium conditions. We have, however, identified a different low-energy atomic configuration for zinc antisites that may play a role under nonequilibrium conditions such as irradiation. Zinc vacancies are deep acceptors and probably related to the frequently observed green luminescence; they act as compensating centers in n-type ZnO. Oxygen interstitials have high formation energies; they can occur as electrically neutral split interstitials in semi-insulating and p-type materials or as deep acceptors at octahedral interstitial sites in n-type ZnO. Oxygen antisites have very high formation energies and are unlikely to exist in measurable concentrations under equilibrium conditions. Based on our results for migration energy barriers, we calculate activation energies for self-diffusion and estimate defect-annealing temperatures. Our results provide a guide to more refined experimental studies of point defects in ZnO and their influence on the control of p-type doping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"We construct three dimensional Chern-Simons-matter theories with gauge groups U(N) x U(N) and SU(N) x SU(N) which have explicit N = 6 superconformal symmetry. Using brane constructions we argue that the U(N) x U(N) theory at level k describes the low energy limit of N M2-branes probing a C-4/Z(k) singularity. At large N the theory is then dual to M-theory on AdS(4) x S-7/Z(k). The theory also has a 't Hooft limit (of large N with a fixed ratio N/k) which is dual to type IIA string theory on AdS(4) x CP3. For k = 1 the theory is conjectured to describe N M2-branes in flat space, although our construction realizes explicitly only six of the eight supersymmetries. We give some evidence for this conjecture, which is similar to the evidence for mirror symmetry in d = 3 gauge theories. When the gauge group is SU(2) x SU(2) our theory has extra symmetries and becomes identical to the Bagger-Lambert theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"We report a simple process to solubilize high weight fraction single-wall carbon nanotubes in water by the nonspecific physical adsorption of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate. The diameter distribution of nanotubes in the dispersion, measured by atomic force microscopy, showed that even at 20 mg/mL similar to63 +/- 5% of single-wall carbon nanotube bundles exfoliated into single tubes. A measure of the length distribution of the nanotubes showed that our dispersion technique reduced nanotube fragmentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"An extended tanh-function method is proposed for constructing multiple travelling wave solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a unified way. The key idea of this method is to take full advantages of a Riccati equation involving a parameter and use its solutions to replace the tanh function in the tanh-function method. It is quite interesting that the sign of the parameter can be used to exactly judge the numbers and types of these travelling wave solutions. In addition, by introducing appropriate transformations, it is shown that the extended tanh-function method still is applicable to nonlinear PDEs whose balancing numbers may be any nonzero real numbers. Some illustrative equations are investigated by this means and new travelling wave solutions are found. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,"Three-dimensional (3D) Dirac point, where two Weyl points overlap in momentum space, is usually unstable and hard to realize. Here we show, based on the first-principles calculations and effective model analysis, that crystalline A(3)Bi (A = Na, K, Rb) are Dirac semimetals with bulk 3D Dirac points protected by crystal symmetry. They possess nontrivial Fermi arcs on the surfaces and can be driven into various topologically distinct phases by explicit breaking of symmetries. Giant diamagnetism, linear quantum magnetoresistance, and quantum spin Hall effect will be expected for such compounds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"We consider low-temperature behavior of weakly interacting electrons in disordered conductors in the regime when all single-particle eigenstates are localized by the quenched disorder. We prove that in the absence of coupling of the electrons to any external bath do electrical conductivity exactly vanishes as long as the temperature T does not exceed some finite value T-c. At the same time, it can be also proven that at high enough T the conductivity is finite. These two statements imply that the system undergoes a finite temperature metal-to-insulator transition, which can be viewed as Anderson-like localization of many-body wave functions in the Fock space. Metallic and insulating states are not different from each other by any spatial or discrete symmetries. We formulate the effective Hamiltonian description of the system at low energies (of the order of the level spacing in the single-particle localization volume). In the metallic phase quantum Boltzmann equation is valid, allowing to find the kinetic coefficients. In the insulating phase, T < T-c, we use Feynmann diagram technique to determine the probability distribution function for quantum-mechanical transition rates. The probability of an escape rate from a given quantum state to be finite turns out to vanish in every order of the perturbation theory in electron-electron interaction. Thus, electron-electron interaction alone is unable to cause the relaxation and establish the thermal equilibrium. As soon as some weak coupling to a bath is turned on, conductivity becomes finite even in the insulating phase. Moreover, in the vicinity of the transition temperature it is much larger than phonon-induced hopping conductivity of non-interacting electrons. The reason for this enhancement is that the stability of the insulating state is gradually decreasing as the transition point is approached. As a result, a single phonon can cause a whole cascade of electronic hops. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,"The photocatalytic splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen using solar light is a potentially clean and renewable source for hydrogen fuel.(1,2) There has been extensive investigation into metal-oxide semiconductors such as TiO2, WO3, and Fe2O3, which can be used as photoanodes in thin-film form.(3-5) Of the materials being developed for photoanodes, TiO2 remains one of the most promising because of its low cost, chemical inertness, and photostability.(6) However, the widespread technological use of TiO2 is hindered by its low utilization of solar energy in the visible region. In this study, we report the preparation of vertically grown carbon-doped TiO2 (TiO2-C-x(x)) nanotube arrays with high aspect ratios for maximizing the photocleavage of water under white-light irradiation. The synthesized TiO2-xCx nanotube arrays showed much higher photocurrent densities and more efficient water splitting under visible-light illumination (> 420 nm) than pure TiO2 nanotube arrays. The total photocurrent was more than 20 times higher than that with a P-25 nanoparticulate film under white-light illumination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"Natural extracellular matrices (ECMs) are viscoelastic and exhibit stress relaxation. However, hydrogels used as synthetic ECMs for three-dimensional (3D) culture are typically elastic. Here, we report a materials approach to tune the rate of stress relaxation of hydrogels for 3D culture, independently of the hydrogel's initial elastic modulus, degradation, and cell-adhesion-ligand density. We find that cell spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are all enhanced in cells cultured in gels with faster relaxation. Strikingly, MSCs form a mineralized, collagen-1-rich matrix similar to bone in rapidly relaxing hydrogels with an initial elastic modulus of 17 kPa. We also show that the effects of stress relaxation are mediated by adhesion-ligand binding, actomyosin contractility and mechanical clustering of adhesion ligands. Our findings highlight stress relaxation as a key characteristic of cell-ECM interactions and as an important design parameter of biomaterials for cell culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

80,"The arbitrary control of electromagnetic waves is a key aim of photonic research. Although, for example, the control of freely propagating waves (PWs; refs 1-6) and surface waves (SWs; refs 7-10) has separately become possible using transformation optics and metamaterials, a bridge linking both propagation types has not yet been found. Such a device has particular relevance given the many schemes of controlling electromagnetic waves at surfaces and interfaces, leading to trapped rainbows(11,12), lensing(13-16), beam bending(17), deflection(18-20), and even anomalous reflection/refraction(21,22). Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that a specific gradient-index meta-surface can convert a PW to a SW with nearly 100% efficiency. Distinct from conventional devices such as prism(23) or grating(24-26) couplers, the momentum mismatch between PW and SW is compensated by the reflection-phase gradient of the meta-surface, and a nearly perfect PW-SW conversion can happen for any incidence angle larger than a critical value. Experiments in the microwave region, including both far-field and near-field characterizations, are in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Our findings may pave the way for many applications, including high-efficiency surface plasmon couplers, anti-reflection surfaces, light absorbers, and so on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specific power and specific energy of annealed RuO2 center dot xH(2)O nanotubes measured at 0.8 V and 4 kHz is equal to 4320 kW kg(-1) and 7.5 W h kg(-1), respectively, demonstrating the characteristics of next generation supercapacitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"A thorough energy benchmark study of various density functionals (DFs) is carried out with the new GMTKN30 database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions [Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2010, 6, 107; Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2011, 7, 291]. In total, 47 DFs are investigated: two LDAs, 14 GGAs, three meta-GGAs, 23 hybrids and five double-hybrids. Besides the double-hybrids, also other modern approaches, i.e., the M05 and M06 classes of functionals and range-separated hybrids, are tested. For almost all functionals, the new DFT-D3 correction is applied in order to consistently test the performance also for important noncovalent interactions; the parameters are taken from previous works or determined for the present study. Basis set and quadrature grid issues are also considered. The general aim of the study is to work out which functionals are generally well applicable and robust to describe the energies of molecules. In summary, we recommend on the GGA level the B97-D3 and revPBE-D3 functionals. The best meta-GGA is oTPSS-D3 although meta-GGAs represent in general no clear improvement compared to numerically simpler GGAs. Notably, the widely used B3LYP functional performs worse than the average of all tested hybrids and is also very sensitive to the application of dispersion corrections. We discourage its usage as a standard method without closer inspection of the results, as it still seems to be often done nowadays. Surprisingly, long-range corrected exchange functionals do in general not perform better than the corresponding standard hybrids. However, the omega B97X-D functional seems to be a promising method. The most robust hybrid is Zhao and Truhlar's PW6B95 functional in combination with DFT-D3. If higher accuracy is required, double-hybrids should be applied. The corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and PWPB95-D3 variants are the most accurate and robust functionals of the entire study. Additional calculations with MP2 and and its spin-scaled variants SCS-MP2, S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 revealed that double-hybrids in general outperform those. Only SCS-MP2 can be recommended, particularly for reaction energies. We suggest its usage when a large self-interaction error is expected that prohibits usage of double-hybrids. Perdews' metaphoric picture of Jacob's Ladder for the classification of density functionals' performance could unbiasedly be confirmed with GMTKN30. We also show that there is no statistical correlation between a functional's accuracy for atomization energies and the performance for chemically more relevant reaction energies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

85,"Warped compactifications with significant warping provide one of the few known mechanisms for naturally generating large hierarchies of physical scales. We demonstrate that this mechanism is realizable in string theory, and give examples involving orientifold compactifications of type-IIB string theory and F-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau fourfolds. In each case, the hierarchy of scales is fixed by a choice of Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz fluxes in the compact manifold. Our solutions involve compactifications of the Klebanov-Strassler gravity dual to a confining N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory, and the hierarchy reflects the small scale of chiral symmetry breaking in the dual gauge theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,"This article provides an introduction to surface code quantum computing. We first estimate the size and speed of a surface code quantum computer. We then introduce the concept of the stabilizer, using two qubits, and extend this concept to stabilizers acting on a two-dimensional array of physical qubits, on which we implement the surface code. We next describe how logical qubits are formed in the surface code array and give numerical estimates of their fault tolerance. We outline how logical qubits are physically moved on the array, how qubit braid transformations are constructed, and how a braid between two logical qubits is equivalent to a controlled-NOT. We then describe the single-qubit Hadamard, (S) over cap and (T) over cap operators, completing the set of required gates for a universal quantum computer. We conclude by briefly discussing physical implementations of the surface code. We include a number of Appendices in which we provide supplementary information to the main text.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"Solar cells based on the organic-inorganic tri-halide perovskite family of materials have shown significant progress recently, offering the prospect of low-cost solar energy from devices that are very simple to process. Fundamental to understanding the operation of these devices is the exciton binding energy, which has proved both difficult to measure directly and controversial. We demonstrate that by using very high magnetic fields it is possible to make an accurate and direct spectroscopic measurement of the exciton binding energy, which we find to be only 16 meV at low temperatures, over three times smaller than has been previously assumed. In the room-temperature phase we show that the binding energy falls to even smaller values of only a few millielectronvolts, which explains their excellent device performance as being due to spontaneous free-carrier generation following light absorption. Additionally, we determine the excitonic reduced effective mass to be 0.104m(e) (where me is the electron mass), significantly smaller than previously estimated experimentally but in good agreement with recent calculations. Our work provides crucial information about the photophysics of these materials, which will in turn allow improved optoelectronic device operation and better understanding of their electronic properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,"We present a classical protocol to efficiently simulate any pure-state quantum computation that involves only a restricted amount of entanglement. More generally, we show how to classically simulate pure-state quantum computations on n qubits by using computational resources that grow linearly in n and exponentially in the amount of entanglement in the quantum computer. Our results imply that a necessary condition for an exponential computational speedup (with respect to classical computations) is that the amount of entanglement increases with the size n of the computation, and provide an explicit lower bound on the required growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"This paper describes two digital implementations of a new mathematical transform, namely, the second generation curvelet transform in two and three dimensions. The first digital transformation is based on unequally spaced fast Fourier transforms, while the second is based on the wrapping of specially selected Fourier samples. The two implementations essentially differ by the choice of spatial grid used to translate curvelets at each scale and angle. Both digital transformations return a table of digital curvelet coefficients indexed by a scale parameter, an orientation parameter, and a spatial location parameter. And both implementations are fast in the sense that they run in O(n(2) log n) flops for n by n Cartesian arrays; in addition, they are also invertible, with rapid inversion algorithms of about the same complexity. Our digital transformations improve upon earlier implementations - based upon the first generation of curvelets - in the sense that they are conceptually simpler, faster, and far less redundant. The software CurveLab, which implements both transforms presented in this paper, is available at http:// www.curvelet.org.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formed porous plasmonic absorber can float naturally on water surface, efficiently absorb a broad solar spectrum (>96%) and focus the absorbed energy at the surface of the water to enable efficient (similar to 90%) and effective desalination (a decrease of four orders of magnitude). The durability of the devices has also been examined, indicating a stable performance over 25 cycles under various illumination conditions. The combination of the significant desalination effect, the abundance and low cost of the materials, and the scalable production processes suggest that this type of plasmon-enhanced solar desalination device could provide a portable desalination solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"In atomic physics, the coherent coupling of a broad and a narrow resonance leads to quantum interference and provides the general recipe for electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). A sharp resonance of nearly perfect transmission can arise within a broad absorption profile. These features show remarkable potential for slow light, novel sensors and low-loss metamaterials. In nanophotonics, plasmonic structures enable large field strengths within small mode volumes. Therefore, combining EIT with nanoplasmonics would pave the way towards ultracompact sensors with extremely high sensitivity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a nanoplasmonic analogue of EIT using a stacked optical metamaterial. A dipole antenna with a large radiatively broadened linewidth is coupled to an underlying quadrupole antenna, of which the narrow linewidth is solely limited by the fundamental non-radiative Drude damping. In accordance with EIT theory, we achieve a very narrow transparency window with high modulation depth owing to nearly complete suppression of radiative losses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"MP2 and CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limit interaction energies and geometries for more than 100 DNA base pairs, amino acid pairs and model complexes are for the first time presented together.

The CCSD(T) correction term, determined as a difference between CCSD( T) and MP2 interaction energies, is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ). Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized or experimental ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set, which is now available to the chemical community, can be used for testing lower-level computational methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22) containing 22 model complexes can be recommended.

93,"The characterization of native point defects in ZnO is still a question of debate. For example, experimental evidence for ZnO with an excess of Zn is inconclusive as to whether the dominant defects are metal interstitials or oxygen vacancies. This information is essential to understand the behavior of the material and to tailor its numerous technological applications. We use the first-principles pseudopotential method to determine the electronic structure, atomic geometry, and formation energy of native point defects in ZnO. Interstitials, vacancies, and antisites in their relevant charge states are considered and the effects of dopants are also discussed. The results show that both the Zn and O vacancies are the relevant defects in ZnO. We also propose a possible transition mechanism and defect center responsible for the experimentally observed green luminescence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this Colloquium the physical principles at the basis of this artificial (synthetic) magnetism are presented. The corresponding Aharonov-Bohm phase is related to the Berry's phase that emerges when the atom adiabatically follows one of the dressed states of the atom-laser interaction. Some manifestations of artificial magnetism for a cold quantum gas, in particular, in terms of vortex nucleation are discussed. The analysis is then generalized to the simulation of non-Abelian gauge potentials and some striking consequences are presented, such as the emergence of an effective spin-orbit coupling.

97,"The topological and energetic properties of the electron density distribution rho(r) of the isolated pairwise H...F interaction have been theoretically calculated at several geometries (0.8<d<2.5 Angstrom) and represented against the corresponding internuclear distances. From long to short geometries, the results presented here lead to three characteristic regions, which correspond to three different interaction states. While the extreme regions are associated to pure closed-shell (CS) and shared-shell (SS) interactions, the middle one has been related to the redistribution of rho(r) between those electronic states. The analysis carried out with this system has permitted to associate the transit region between pure CS and SS interactions to internuclear geometries involved in the building of the H-F bonding molecular orbital. A comparative analysis between the formation of this orbital and the behavior of some characteristic rho(r) properties has indicated their intrinsic correspondence, leading to the definition of a bond degree parameter [BD=H-CP/rho(CP); H-CP and rho(CP) being the total electron energy density and the electron density value at the H...F (3,-1) critical point]. Along with the isolated pairwise H...F interaction, 79 X-H...F-Y (neutral, positively and negatively charged) complexes have been also theoretically considered and analyzed in terms of relevant topological and energetic properties of rho(r) found at their H.F critical points. In particular, the interaction energies of X-H.F-Y pure CS interactions have been estimated by using the bond degree parameter. On the other hand, the [F...H...F](-) proton transfer geometry has been related to the local maximum of the electron kinetic energy density (G(CP))(max).

98,"Proper treatment of nonbonded interactions is essential for the accuracy of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, especially in studies of lipid bilayers. The use of the CHARMM36 force field (C36 FF) in different MD simulation programs can result in disagreements with published simulations performed with CHARMM due to differences in the protocols used to treat the long-range and 14 nonbonded interactions. In this study, we systematically test the use of the C36 lipid FF in NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER, OpenMM, and CHARMM/OpenMM. A wide range of Lennard-Jones (LJ) cutoff schemes and integrator algorithms were tested to find the optimal simulation protocol to best match bilayer properties of six lipids with varying acyl chainsaturation and head groups. MD simulations of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer were used to obtain the optimal protocol for each program. MD simulations with all programs were found to reasonably match the DPPC bilayer properties (surface area per lipid, chain order parameters, and area compressibility modulus) obtained using the standard protocol used in CHARMM as well as from experiments. The optimal simulation protocol was then applied to the other five lipid simulations and resulted in excellent agreement between results from most simulation programs as well as with experimental data. AMBER compared least favorably with the expected membrane properties, which appears to be due to its use of the hard-truncation in the LJ potential versus a force-based switching function used to smooth the LJ potential as it approaches the cutoff distance. The optimal simulation protocol for each program has been implemented in CHARMM-GUI. This protocol is expected to be applicable to the remainder of the additive C36 FF including the proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"We demonstrate for the first time that impact ionization (II) (the inverse of Auger recombination) occurs with very high efficiency in semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). Interband optical excitation of PbSe NCs at low pump intensities, for which less than one exciton is initially generated per NC on average, results in the formation of two or more excitons (carrier multiplication) when pump photon energies are more than 3 times the NC band gap energy. The generation of multiexcitons from a single photon absorption event is observed to take place on an ultrafast (picosecond) time scale and occurs with up to 100% efficiency depending upon the excess energy of the absorbed photon. Efficient II in NCs can be used to considerably increase the power conversion efficiency of NC-based solar cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
