J,"Hapishah, AN; Hamidon, MN; Syazwan, MM",Convenient method for Curie temperature determination in holmium and yttrium manganite based on capacitance value,"This study reported an alternative technique to measure the Curie temperature (T-c) of hexagonal manganite as multiferroic sample. The method is based on change identification in slope of capacitance value as a function of temperature. Temperature variation of the capacitance observed in holmium and yttrium manganite sintered at 1250 degrees C has been studied respectively. The optimum preparation of holmium and yttrium manganite with space group P6(3)cm by using high energy ball milling has been chosen in order to provide a convenient T-c. The changes of the capacitance value as a function of temperature range from 300 up to 1000 K at 50 Hz has been carried out in order to obtained the T-c value. Results obtained from the experiments showed that T-c transition could be clearly exhibited by the capacitance value for both the holmium manganite and yttrium manganite samples. The measured property values gave their T-c transition around reported value in previous studies. The ferroelectric T-c transition was observed to be 850 K and 860 K for HoMnO3 and YMnO3 respectively. A completely intrinsic behaviour of T-c was revealed by our simple and low cost method since no applied external field was used, yielding a truly spontaneous ferroelectric behaviour.",10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102665,0,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes

Our method consists of two steps, in first step: the main equation is converted to a homogeneous one using interpolation. In second step: two-dimensional approximation of functions by shifted Jacobi polynomials is used to reduce the problem into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. The archived system is solved by Newton's iterative method. Our method is stated in general case on rectangular [a, b] x [0, T] which is based upon Jacobi polynomial by parameters (alpha, beta). Several test problems are employed and results of numerical experiments are presented and also compared with analytical solutions. Also, we verify the numerical stability of the method, by applying a disturbance in the problem. The obtained results confirm the acceptable accuracy and stability of the presented method.",10.1515/ijnsns-2018-0339,1,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes

However, one of the significant challenges that hinder the wide application of singular beams is how to effectively identify the topological charge and the polarization order of arbitrary singular beams. We found that when a light beam with arbitrary polarization state illuminates a polarization-sensitive blazed-grating, the horizontal and vertical component can be separated from the incident beam. Based on this phenomenon, an effective method is proposed to probe the integral topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams. With this detection method, the vortex beam, cylindrical vector beam and cylindrical vector vortex beam with different topological charges and polarization orders have been experimentally identified. This effective detection method can be widely used to measure the topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams.",10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2944968,2,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes

The greatest developments were achieved in the Antiquity and in the Middle Ages, but modern physicists also contributed their part. In 1956, a former student of Wolfgang Pauli, Heinz Schilt, constructed an underwater sundial in his garden pond, using refraction to reshape the sundial's hour lines. His approach is developed further in this paper and combined with Thales' geometric concept of gnomonic projection. Together, this leads to a beautiful result: Snell's law can be used to build a sundial whose hour lines portray the Earth and its meridians.

Starting with the same batch of mixed oxide prepared from reverse microemulsions, different photocatalysts have been obtained by either solvothermal treatment, calcination or a combination of both. Extensive physicochemical characterization of the resulting materials shows that solvothermally treated oxides present lower crystallite size and larger surface area, although without previous calcination these samples appear to have a higher degree of structural disorder. These differences are sharply reflected in the changes in photocatalytic activity for the removal of methylcyclohexane (MCH) and toluene vapours at relatively high concentrations. Thus, the best performance for MCH elimination is obtained with the photocatalysts prepared by calcination and subsequent solvothermal treatment. Following this procedure, the resulting Ti1-xZrxO2 material presents larger surface area and high Zr surface concentration with minimal disturbance of the anatase structure. In contrast, for toluene photooxidation, the solvothermally prepared sample shows improved performance, most likely due to its larger surface area, which contributes to hinder deactivation.",10.1166/jnn.2019.16738,5,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no

This microstructure possesses both sharp edge and sharp corner (SESC) in topography. The sharp edge can hinder liquid spreading significantly, whereas the sharp corner enhance spreading. By lithography technology on polymer film, Parylene-C, the microstructure can be tailored into different shapes to achieve various liquid spreading properties, two of which are demonstrated here. 2-D SESC microstructure illustrates ultra-high contact angle difference in parallel and perpendicular directions as high as 93.8, as well as bidirectional wetting properties.

A multi-technique characterization was employed to fully describe the deposition of molybdenum as well as its sulfurization. Thus, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning electron and atomic force microscopies indicated that the molybdenum layers were completely transformed in MoS2.

Strong similarities are found between lumped and distributed dissipation. While distributed losses contribute to non-hermitian phase matching, lumped dissipation is shown to be a simple and universal quasi-phase matching method.

J,"Iliev, N; Trivedi, AR",Low-Power Sensor Localization in Three-Dimensional Using a Recurrent Neural Network,"This letter discusses a novel low-power circuit to self-localize a mobile sensor node in the three-dimensional space using a passive optical receiver. Self-localization of sensors, where a sensor node computes its spatial location by itself, reduces transmission demand, and improves real-time conformity of mobile wireless sensor systems. Our approach forms an over-determined system of angles-of-arrival (AoAs) to mobile sensor received from an optical anchor grid. The AoA system is solved with a linear program (LP) solver, which is implemented using a nonlinear feedback recurrent neural network. To solve the primal and dual LP optimization problems in the AoA system, we show a single multifunctional data path that does not require matrix inversions; thereby, enables within-sensor low-power computations to self-localize. Additionally, unlike other optical indoor positioning architectures, our approach does not require measurements of received signal strength and, thereby, is insensitive to power and alignment imbalances in the anchor grid. We show proof-of-concept field programmable gate array (FPGA) and ASIC simulations of our approach and validate its operation under noisy AoA data and for different numbers of anchors. An FPGA implementation in 180 nm CMOS achieves a peak similar to 0.12 mega localization operations per second per Watt (MOPS/W), while ASIC design in 45 nm CMOS shows a peak similar to 7.7 MOPS/W.",10.1109/LSENS.2019.2950335,11,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

As a result, the beam quality of amplified signal will become poor. In this article, a hybrid seeding scheme with a paired two-stage OPA system is used, where the first and second stages used the signal and the idler as seed sources, respectively. The numerical results show that the hybrid seeding OPA scheme can suppress the phase distortion transformation from pump to signal in both spatial and temporal domains. Consequently, the phase of output signal is well restored to its input state. Because of the restriction removal of beam quality for pump light under the conventional birefringent phase-matching method, this scheme had a good application prospect in high-energy OPA or optical parametric chirped pulse amplification systems.",10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102728,13,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no
J,"Jiang, YB; Zhu, YF; Du, X; Jin, T",The implicit network inferred from users' residences and workplaces enhancing collaborative recommendation on smartphones,"Personalized recommendation based on side information extracted from social networks has achieved promising performance in numerous applications. However, such side information is generally derived from users' explicit interactions, such as Twitter connections or trust lists, which is not always available in most scenarios. Alternately, obtaining such side information from users' implicit networks is easy. Thus, in this paper, we consider the similarity network for users' semantic locations, assuming that users with neighboring semantic locations have similar consumption habits. To demonstrate this, we evaluate our study in a practical scenario: the smartphone recommendation based on operator records. A novel recommendation paradigm is designed, which includes three key steps: discovery of semantic locations, hierarchical construction of the neighbor network, and items' popularity-based recommendation based on interpersonal similarities. The empirical results illustrate that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods (13% coverage improvement than models without introducing networks and about 5% higher than model with a call-log based network).

Previously, preliminary work in mice and in diabetic patients showed that Mn2 + ions could be used as a contrast agent to monitor the function of insulin-producing /3-cells by acting as a calcium analogue. Clinical translation of this work was hampered by a lack of available Mn contrast agents, but both mangafodipir and Mn gluconate are currently being used in clinical trials. As a first step towards using Mn in diabetic patients to monitor treatment or disease progression, we imaged the pancreas of healthy rats using mangafodipir, Mn gluconate and Mn chloride (as a control). The hypothesis was that Mn gluconate produces pancreatic enhancement similar to that seen previously with mangafodipir and Mn chloride, with greater enhancement following glucose challenge vs saline challenge. 18 Wistar rats were imaged at 7 T and normalised plateau pancreatic enhancement over baseline was compared for saline vs glucose challenge, calculated from a sigmoid fit to the enhancement curve. For saline vs glucose challenge, mean increases in plateau height +/- sd were: 22 +/- 18% for Mn chloride, 31 +/- 29% for mangafodipir and 41 +/- 17% for Mn gluconate. A paired t-test indicated that enhancement was greater for glucose vs saline (p = 0.01) and that there was no significant difference in the percentage enhancement between any of the compounds (p > 0.2). In conclusion, all three contrast agents produced similar enhancement, with greater plateau height under glucose challenge vs saline challenge.

The dimensional parameters were optimized for achieving the attenuation of more than 60 dB over 85-105 GHz. It was further examined that the hollow electron beam radius over various sections of the BCU should not lead to beam-wave interaction, and if so, it should not propagate toward the interaction cavity. For this purpose, azimuthal electric field intensities in various azimuthally symmetric modes below the operating mode were plotted against the radial coordinate in various sections of the BCU and checked for the azimuthal electric field intensity values with the range of beam radius in the corresponding section. The electric field intensity maxima should be avoided within the range of beam radius in the corresponding section. Furthermore, the transient thermal analysis of the BCU was carried out considering temperature varying thermal conductivity in two proposed models: 1) with radially constant and 2) radially varying heat loads within AlN-SiC disks to predict the maximum temperature attained in the ceramic as 76.8 C and 88.5 C, respectively, taking 8-L/min flow rate of deionized water and ten heat load pulses.",10.1109/TPS.2019.2950573,16,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

Second, disorder is assumed to be random dilution of lattice sites, i.e. particles cannot occupy disordered sites. The order parameter was found to be continuous for disorder of stochastic hopping, i.e. the first-order transition was rounded to the second-order transition for any small amount of disorder, whereas the transition remained first order but the critical exponent associated with the power law decrease of active-site densities varied for considerable amount of lattice site dilution.

Through symbolic computation, the analytic N-soliton solutions are obtained for the system. The N-soliton solutions can be used to describe the multiple wrinkles in graphene sheets. Furthermore, wrinkle propagation and interaction are discussed. Snake-, V- and Z-like wrinkles are observed graphically by choosing the heat transmission function as three specific functions. A collision between wrinkles is elastic. Before and after the collision, wrinkle energy and propagation direction remain unchanged. But at collision points, the energy carried by the larger wrinkles will be subtracted.

It was clearly shown that quasi-equiaxed nanocrystallites of similar to 50-100 nm in diameter and nanorods of similar to 40-50 nm in diameter and up to similar to 700 nm in length can be generated with (NH4)(10)W12O41 center dot 5H(2)O and K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O as tungsten sources, respectively. Introducing Tar(2-) into the K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O reaction system effectively transformed the primary crystallites of ZnWO4 from nanorods into quasi-equiaxed nanocrystals (similar to 20-50 nm) and then nanoplates (thickness of similar to 20 nm, lateral size of similar to 200 nm) and, meanwhile, aggregated the crystallites into spheroidal clusters (similar to 2-3 mu m in diameter) with the increasing Tar(2-)/Zn2+ molar ratio up to similar to 2. Optical spectroscopy revealed that the ZnWO4 products exhibit broad-band photoluminescence (similar to 425-700 nm) through T-3(1u) -> (1)A(1g) transition of the [WO6](6-) ligand under short ultraviolet excitation and the nanorods show the best luminescence among all tested samples. Calcination at 500 degrees C may effectively remove the adsorbed Tar(2-) species and greatly improve luminescence of the samples synthesized in the presence of Tar(2-).",10.1007/s42864-019-00030-9,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The integrated curved electrodes with the same curvature as the birdbath shell are embedded using a self-aligned process, which avoids the extra assembly process, ensures the symmetry and improves the driving capacity of the mu-BRG. The capacitive gap is defined by the sacrificial layer, and a uniform and small gap distance (2 mu m) between the curved electrodes and the birdbath shell is obtained. The mu-BRGs with a diameter of 1.2 mm and a thickness of 2 mu m have been demonstrated by employing boron-doped microcrystalline diamond films deposited using hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD).

A simple etching scheme describing the obtained results is presented for each type of plasma technique and mask type. Although the Al mask is widely believed to have outstanding properties over other metallic materials, we found that the Cu mask exhibits lower side edge etching for both types of plasma techniques. A formation of thick and crystalline copper oxide layer in contrast with thin amorphous aluminum oxide is believed to be the reason for this behavior.

The static effects were acquired by, using the pressure dependences of these fluorescence peak positions. The static effects for the ten fluorescence peaks resulted in thermal blue shift, but the dynamic effects for all peaks except Y-7 led to thermal red shift. The observed nature of thermal shift (i.e. red or blue) of a fluorescence peak was due to competition between the static and dynamic effects. Based on an approximate treatment, the static parameter A (characterizing the static effect) and electron-phonon coupling parameter alpha' (characterizing the dynamic effect) for these fluorescence peaks were estimated in the case where therrhal shift curves from low temperature to near or higher than room temperature were not measured. Parameters A for all fluorescence peaks and alpha' for all peaks except Y-7 were comparable in sign and magnitude with those of the sharp luminescence peaks of other rare earth ions in crystals and so were deemed to be reasonable.

By comparing them with the corresponding formulas in the diffuse interface model, the two coefficients are then obtained. The mass transition coefficient is proportional to the rate of molecular unidirectional transition under the mutual equilibrium of liquid and vapor species. The mass diffusion coefficient is proportional to the rate of molecular unidirectional travel through a unit surface under the condition that two local elements at two sides of the surface are in mutual equilibrium. This diffusion coefficient can finally be expressed as the product of the Fick concentration diffusion coefficient and the mixing density besides an energy (or temperature) factor.

S-Ge/Si semiconductor (as known as low tensile strained Ge grown on Si substrate) has a higher carrier mobility when compared with unstrained-Ge or Si material, so that s-Ge/Si is appropriate for the production of high-speed circuit. At the same time, transformation from indirect bandgap semiconductor Ge into Pseudo-Direct bandgap semiconductor (which is also called PD-Ge) will be happen after s-Ge/Si is heavy doped, which makes LED produced of PD-Ge material perform a higher luminous efficiency because the radiative recombining probability of carriers in PD-Ge material is greatly improved compared with unstrained one. Taking the advantages referred of s-Ge/Si into account, s-Ge/Si has the potential to PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration. Carrier mobility of the semiconductor is one of the key physical parameters during the design and simulation of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integrated system.

For strong enough magnetic amplitudes such magnetohydrodynamic flows are unstable against non-axisymmetric perturbations which may also transport angular momentum. In accordance with the often used diffusion approximation, one expects the angular momentum transport to be vanishing for rigid rotation. In the sense of a non-diffusive Lambda effect, however, even for rigidly rotating z-pinches, an axisymmetric angular momentum flux appears which is directed outward (inward) for large (small) magnetic Mach numbers. The internal rotation in a magnetized rotating tank can thus never be uniform. Those particular rotation laws are used to estimate the value of the instability-induced eddy viscosity for which the non-diffusive Lambda effect and the diffusive shear-induced transport compensate each other.

J,"Sakolowski, A",Applying Structural Mathematics in Physics: Case of Parallel Connection,"Research identifies two domains by which mathematics allows learning physics concepts: a technical domain that includes algorithmic operations that lead to solving formulas for an unknown quantity and a structural domain that allows for applying mathematical knowledge for structuring physical phenomena. While the technical domain requires employing only students' technical skills, the structural domain requires activating students' algebraic reasoning and applying it to learn more about physical systems beyond evaluating formulas. Students' technical skills in mathematics do not convert into structural skills automatically, and this is perceived as an obstacle that prevents complete appreciation of physics knowledge. There can be various ways to activate or to develop students' mathematical structural domain in physics. Most common are: (a) mathematical modeling that involves experimental activities concluding with algebraic relations; (b) stimulating students to work with symbols in limiting situations; or (c) developing the understanding of physics formulas (e.g., see Ref. 5). While all these methods are valuable, students still face difficulties with transferring their structural math skills to physics, thus new attempts are made. The process of developing students' algebraic structural skills proposed in this paper is a combination of the current approaches; however, as a means of developing mathematical reasoning, a mathematical structure is used that is derived from a physics formula. More specifically, this paper presents an attempt to interpret formula for the equivalent resistance of a parallel electric circuit using the properties of a rational function.

For repulsive interaction and finite magnetization the low energy excitation spectrum is a two-component Luttinger liquid with conformal charges c = 1. In zero magnetic field the spectrum of spin excitations is gapped. For higher energy excitations the single-hole (single-particle) spectral functions display edge singularities that deviate from those expected from a Luttinger liquid. The system can be described as a mobile impurity coupled to the Luttinger liquid yielding an effective x-ray edge type model.

J,"Spalek, D",Generalization of Maxwell Stress Tensor Method for Magnetically Anisotropic Regions,"This article comments on the Maxwell stress tensor method for force calculation in magnetically anisotropic regions. Force acting on the magnetically isotropic region can be always represented by means of Maxwell stress tensor surface integral. However, the magnetic anisotropy causes the asymmetry of Maxwell stress tensor. Subsequently, the force cannot be always evaluated by the surface integral of the Maxwell stress tensor, only. This article points out that the surface integral has to be often supplemented by the volume integral of a defined residual vector.

Two optical blockades are created at individual wavelengths of two probe fields in presence of one single strong standing-wave field. On one hand, ultra-narrow transmission windows are produced for probe pulse field 1 when probe field 2 is so strong as a controlling field in EIT configuration. The system can be designed as a phase-reverter of weak probe field 1 and can perform temporal differentiation calculation to it because a pi phase shift is created. On the other hand, the blockade at probe field 2 can be burst in two-photon resonance configuration when probe field 1 becomes strong and saturated absorption takes effect. So a two-photon switching is also expected in this standing-wave-dressed atomic system.

In order to reduce the overall energy consumption, the use of IP routers is reduced, and the idle data servers are shut down. Then, it is found that the total energy consumption increases slowly at different times. The energy consumption of evolutionary game theory is compared. Compared with non-evolutionary game theory, the optimized intelligent routing algorithm makes the energy consumption more stable, while reducing the use of servers can further reduce the good expenditure.

As a result, the conductance peak at the zero-bias limit has an opportunity to change into antiresonance in the case of appropriate structural parameters.
