0,"This study reported an alternative technique to measure the Curie temperature (T-c) of hexagonal manganite as multiferroic sample. The method is based on change identification in slope of capacitance value as a function of temperature. Temperature variation of the capacitance observed in holmium and yttrium manganite sintered at 1250 degrees C has been studied respectively. The optimum preparation of holmium and yttrium manganite with space group P6(3)cm by using high energy ball milling has been chosen in order to provide a convenient T-c. The changes of the capacitance value as a function of temperature range from 300 up to 1000 K at 50 Hz has been carried out in order to obtained the T-c value. Results obtained from the experiments showed that T-c transition could be clearly exhibited by the capacitance value for both the holmium manganite and yttrium manganite samples. The measured property values gave their T-c transition around reported value in previous studies. The ferroelectric T-c transition was observed to be 850 K and 860 K for HoMnO3 and YMnO3 respectively. A completely intrinsic behaviour of T-c was revealed by our simple and low cost method since no applied external field was used, yielding a truly spontaneous ferroelectric behaviour.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
1,"In this paper, a new method for the numerical solution of fractional sine-Gordon (SG) equation is presented. Our method consists of two steps, in first step: the main equation is converted to a homogeneous one using interpolation. In second step: two-dimensional approximation of functions by shifted Jacobi polynomials is used to reduce the problem into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. The archived system is solved by Newton's iterative method. Our method is stated in general case on rectangular [a, b] x [0, T] which is based upon Jacobi polynomial by parameters (alpha, beta). Several test problems are employed and results of numerical experiments are presented and also compared with analytical solutions. Also, we verify the numerical stability of the method, by applying a disturbance in the problem. The obtained results confirm the acceptable accuracy and stability of the presented method.",no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes
2,"Singular beams with spatially variant field distributions have various fantastic applications. However, one of the significant challenges that hinder the wide application of singular beams is how to effectively identify the topological charge and the polarization order of arbitrary singular beams. We found that when a light beam with arbitrary polarization state illuminates a polarization-sensitive blazed-grating, the horizontal and vertical component can be separated from the incident beam. Based on this phenomenon, an effective method is proposed to probe the integral topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams. With this detection method, the vortex beam, cylindrical vector beam and cylindrical vector vortex beam with different topological charges and polarization orders have been experimentally identified. This effective detection method can be widely used to measure the topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes
3,"The study of sundials is an age-old discipline of science. The greatest developments were achieved in the Antiquity and in the Middle Ages, but modern physicists also contributed their part. In 1956, a former student of Wolfgang Pauli, Heinz Schilt, constructed an underwater sundial in his garden pond, using refraction to reshape the sundial's hour lines. His approach is developed further in this paper and combined with Thales' geometric concept of gnomonic projection. Together, this leads to a beautiful result: Snell's law can be used to build a sundial whose hour lines portray the Earth and its meridians.

The chemical reaction of ND (a(1)Delta) with H can proceed via the depletion ND + H -> N + HD and the exchange pathways ND + H -> NH + D. So, we present the time-dependent wave packet quantum scattering calculations of initial-state-resolved reaction probabilities, integral cross sections and initial state-selected reaction rate constants for exchange and depletion channels of the title reaction.

5,"The modification of the structural and surface characteristics of Ti1-xZrxO2 nanocrystallites by post-synthesis treatments is revealed as an effective way to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Starting with the same batch of mixed oxide prepared from reverse microemulsions, different photocatalysts have been obtained by either solvothermal treatment, calcination or a combination of both. Extensive physicochemical characterization of the resulting materials shows that solvothermally treated oxides present lower crystallite size and larger surface area, although without previous calcination these samples appear to have a higher degree of structural disorder. These differences are sharply reflected in the changes in photocatalytic activity for the removal of methylcyclohexane (MCH) and toluene vapours at relatively high concentrations. Thus, the best performance for MCH elimination is obtained with the photocatalysts prepared by calcination and subsequent solvothermal treatment. Following this procedure, the resulting Ti1-xZrxO2 material presents larger surface area and high Zr surface concentration with minimal disturbance of the anatase structure. In contrast, for toluene photooxidation, the solvothermally prepared sample shows improved performance, most likely due to its larger surface area, which contributes to hinder deactivation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"Anisotropic wetting is important in industrial, medical and agricultural applications. In this paper, a novel microstructure performing prominent ultra-anisotropic wetting properties is proposed, with MEMS fabrication process. This microstructure possesses both sharp edge and sharp corner (SESC) in topography. The sharp edge can hinder liquid spreading significantly, whereas the sharp corner enhance spreading. By lithography technology on polymer film, Parylene-C, the microstructure can be tailored into different shapes to achieve various liquid spreading properties, two of which are demonstrated here. 2-D SESC microstructure illustrates ultra-high contact angle difference in parallel and perpendicular directions as high as 93.8, as well as bidirectional wetting properties. Another microstructure, namely 3-D SESC microstructure, demonstrates specific unidirectional wetting properties. The unique microstructure proposed in this paper provide new ideas for application of controlling liquid spreading on surface. [2019-0077]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Sulfurization of molybdenum layers is a promising route for obtaining large-scale and high-quality transition metal dichalcogenides. Here we describe the synthesis of continuous and homogeneous MoS2 in the centimeter scale by the thermal vapor sulfurization of pre-deposited molybdenum precursors on SiO2. Metallic molybdenum as well as MoO3 were used as precursors while the sulfurization was performed by chemical vapor deposition. A multi-technique characterization was employed to fully describe the deposition of molybdenum as well as its sulfurization. Thus, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning electron and atomic force microscopies indicated that the molybdenum layers were completely transformed in MoS2. The samples were homogeneous in the centimeter scale and quite flat with a root mean square roughness of 1.4 angstrom. Furthermore, its work function was 4.1 eV.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The spatial and temporal dependence of population dynamics caused by ultrafast a laser pulses are studied by Maxwell-Bloch equations in terahertz quantum cascade lasers with and without propagation effects. It is shown that the presence of propagation effects could decrease the flopping of population inversion and affect the oscillation intensity in recovery process. Due to the modification of total macroscopic nonlinear polarization and many-body items, local field varies not only with electron doping concentration but also with period position, which also reflected in the evolution of population dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Two blue light emitters M-2EtCz and P-2EtCz based on carbazole and triphenylphosphine oxide were synthesized and characterized. The 5% weight loss temperatures of emitters M-2EtCz and P-2EtCz solid powder were 437 and 495 degrees C, and their photoluminescent quantum yield in solution were 53.93 and 75.78%, which were both significantly improved to those of parent EtCz-Ph. The introduction of triphenylphosphine oxide into EtCz-Ph can lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels of emitters M-2EtCz and P-2EtCz, while keeping their highest occupied molecular orbital levels unchanged. All the emitters exhibited blue light emission with aggregation-induced enhanced emission characteristic. The non-doped deep blue light-emitting diodes with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 2.68% were obtained for M-2EtCz, and the electroluminescent color purity of P-2EtCz was better than that of M-2EtCz. The doped device hosted by P-2EtCz achieved a maximum brightness of 10,891 cd/m(2), external quantum efficiency of 2.04% and current efficiency of 5.65 cd/A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"Distributed dissipation in optical parametric processes has attracted renewed interests recently due to its rich physics including modulation instability, gain broadening, unidirectional energy transfer etc. Due to difficulties in practical implementation, lumped dissipation are investigated in this work as an alternative approach which can be realized more conveniently. Strong similarities are found between lumped and distributed dissipation. While distributed losses contribute to non-hermitian phase matching, lumped dissipation is shown to be a simple and universal quasi-phase matching method. Experimental validations of gain broadening and flattening in normal and anomalous dispersion regions are presented. As an application to wavelength conversion, enlarged conversion bandwidth when dissipation is introduced to the signal wave is revealed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"This letter discusses a novel low-power circuit to self-localize a mobile sensor node in the three-dimensional space using a passive optical receiver. Self-localization of sensors, where a sensor node computes its spatial location by itself, reduces transmission demand, and improves real-time conformity of mobile wireless sensor systems. Our approach forms an over-determined system of angles-of-arrival (AoAs) to mobile sensor received from an optical anchor grid. The AoA system is solved with a linear program (LP) solver, which is implemented using a nonlinear feedback recurrent neural network. To solve the primal and dual LP optimization problems in the AoA system, we show a single multifunctional data path that does not require matrix inversions; thereby, enables within-sensor low-power computations to self-localize. Additionally, unlike other optical indoor positioning architectures, our approach does not require measurements of received signal strength and, thereby, is insensitive to power and alignment imbalances in the anchor grid. We show proof-of-concept field programmable gate array (FPGA) and ASIC simulations of our approach and validate its operation under noisy AoA data and for different numbers of anchors. An FPGA implementation in 180 nm CMOS achieves a peak similar to 0.12 mega localization operations per second per Watt (MOPS/W), while ASIC design in 45 nm CMOS shows a peak similar to 7.7 MOPS/W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present paper, we also review the definition of supermodular form and we explicitly give answer to the following question: What differential operators do preserve supermodularity? These operators are supersymmetric generalization of Rankin-Cohen brackets. They are called Super Rankin-Cohen brackets. Finally, using the bijective correspondence between supermodular forms and superpseudodifferential operators invariants given by Cohen et al. (1997), we construct a star product involving the Super Rankin-Cohen brackets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"During the OPA (optical parametric amplifier) processes pumped by a high-energy laser, the phase distortion of pump light will transmit to the signal light inevitably. As a result, the beam quality of amplified signal will become poor. In this article, a hybrid seeding scheme with a paired two-stage OPA system is used, where the first and second stages used the signal and the idler as seed sources, respectively. The numerical results show that the hybrid seeding OPA scheme can suppress the phase distortion transformation from pump to signal in both spatial and temporal domains. Consequently, the phase of output signal is well restored to its input state. Because of the restriction removal of beam quality for pump light under the conventional birefringent phase-matching method, this scheme had a good application prospect in high-energy OPA or optical parametric chirped pulse amplification systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Personalized recommendation based on side information extracted from social networks has achieved promising performance in numerous applications. However, such side information is generally derived from users' explicit interactions, such as Twitter connections or trust lists, which is not always available in most scenarios. Alternately, obtaining such side information from users' implicit networks is easy. Thus, in this paper, we consider the similarity network for users' semantic locations, assuming that users with neighboring semantic locations have similar consumption habits. To demonstrate this, we evaluate our study in a practical scenario: the smartphone recommendation based on operator records. A novel recommendation paradigm is designed, which includes three key steps: discovery of semantic locations, hierarchical construction of the neighbor network, and items' popularity-based recommendation based on interpersonal similarities. The empirical results illustrate that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods (13% coverage improvement than models without introducing networks and about 5% higher than model with a call-log based network).

15,"Mangafodipir was approved for use as an MRI contrast agent in the late 1990s for liver and pancreas imaging but it was removed from the European market for commercial reasons in 2012. Previously, preliminary work in mice and in diabetic patients showed that Mn2 + ions could be used as a contrast agent to monitor the function of insulin-producing /3-cells by acting as a calcium analogue. Clinical translation of this work was hampered by a lack of available Mn contrast agents, but both mangafodipir and Mn gluconate are currently being used in clinical trials. As a first step towards using Mn in diabetic patients to monitor treatment or disease progression, we imaged the pancreas of healthy rats using mangafodipir, Mn gluconate and Mn chloride (as a control). The hypothesis was that Mn gluconate produces pancreatic enhancement similar to that seen previously with mangafodipir and Mn chloride, with greater enhancement following glucose challenge vs saline challenge. 18 Wistar rats were imaged at 7 T and normalised plateau pancreatic enhancement over baseline was compared for saline vs glucose challenge, calculated from a sigmoid fit to the enhancement curve. For saline vs glucose challenge, mean increases in plateau height +/- sd were: 22 +/- 18% for Mn chloride, 31 +/- 29% for mangafodipir and 41 +/- 17% for Mn gluconate. A paired t-test indicated that enhancement was greater for glucose vs saline (p = 0.01) and that there was no significant difference in the percentage enhancement between any of the compounds (p > 0.2). In conclusion, all three contrast agents produced similar enhancement, with greater plateau height under glucose challenge vs saline challenge. Mangafodipir and Mn gluconate show potential for translation into a clinical study investigating beta cell imaging of the pancreas in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"A four-section beam compression unit (BCU) with copper and aluminum nitride-silicon carbide (AlN-SiC) annular disks was proposed for a $W$ -band gyrotron. Various dimensional parameters were calculated, based on which the BCU was modeled in a high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS), and the transmission characteristics were plotted for various sets of dimensional parameters. The dimensional parameters were optimized for achieving the attenuation of more than 60 dB over 85-105 GHz. It was further examined that the hollow electron beam radius over various sections of the BCU should not lead to beam-wave interaction, and if so, it should not propagate toward the interaction cavity. For this purpose, azimuthal electric field intensities in various azimuthally symmetric modes below the operating mode were plotted against the radial coordinate in various sections of the BCU and checked for the azimuthal electric field intensity values with the range of beam radius in the corresponding section. The electric field intensity maxima should be avoided within the range of beam radius in the corresponding section. Furthermore, the transient thermal analysis of the BCU was carried out considering temperature varying thermal conductivity in two proposed models: 1) with radially constant and 2) radially varying heat loads within AlN-SiC disks to predict the maximum temperature attained in the ceramic as 76.8 C and 88.5 C, respectively, taking 8-L/min flow rate of deionized water and ten heat load pulses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A stretchable dipole antenna was fabricated using conductive polymer composite material composed of Ag flake filler and polyester binder. The dipole antenna was printed on a stretchable polyurethane substrate using a simple and inexpensive screen-printing technique. The stretchability and durability of the dipole antenna were evaluated by the stretching and cyclic stretching tests. The stretchable dipole antenna showed excellent stretchability and RF performances up to a tensile strain of 25%. The stretchable dipole antenna also exhibited outstanding mechanical durability in the 10,000-cycle cyclic stretching endurance tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,A complex envelope approach for the numerical solution of Maxwell's equations based on Faber polynomial expansions is investigated. The Faber polynomial expansion used for the approximation of the exponential time propagator offers a highly accurate and efficient calculation while allowing the application of large time steps.

This is especially beneficial when bandlimited source field distributions are investigated as it is the case for many applications from terahertz technology or photonics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

21,"We show, both analytically and numerically, that the non-relativistic and relativistic quantum predictions for the dynamics of a prototypical driven electron - the periodically kicked rotor - do not always agree in the non-relativistic regime. The surprisingly different quantum predictions could be tested experimentally using ultra-cold fermionic atoms in a periodically-pulsed 1D optical lattice. Similar breakdown of agreement should occur for driven quantum systems in general. Since the relativistic theory should be empirically correct, it must be used instead of the approximate non-relativistic theory to correctly study the quantum dynamics of a driven system after the breakdown time, which could lead to important contributions in a wide range of fields from atomic to molecular, chemical and condensed-matter physics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Influence of quenched disorder on critical behavior of the deterministic conserved threshold transfer process (DCTTP) was investigated. DCTTP is a variant of the conserved threshold transfer process modified such that active-particle hopping is deterministic and has been reported to exhibit discontinuous phase transition (Lee and Lee 2009 Phys. Rev. E 80 011106) in all considered dimensions, i.e. one, two, and four dimensions. Two disorder types were considered. First, while particle hopping on ordered sites is deterministic, hopping on disordered sites is subject to be stochastic, i.e. active particles on disordered sites hop to randomly selected neighboring sites. Second, disorder is assumed to be random dilution of lattice sites, i.e. particles cannot occupy disordered sites. The order parameter was found to be continuous for disorder of stochastic hopping, i.e. the first-order transition was rounded to the second-order transition for any small amount of disorder, whereas the transition remained first order but the critical exponent associated with the power law decrease of active-site densities varied for considerable amount of lattice site dilution. These results are consistent with predictions established for equilibrium n-vector spin systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We fabricated a single-grain bulk YBaCuO superconductor by controlling the distance between the seed and the upper surface of the YBaCuO bulk.

25,"This study analyzes a thermophoretic motion system with a variable heat transmission which models the nonlinear wrinkle motions in substrate-supported graphene sheets. Through symbolic computation, the analytic N-soliton solutions are obtained for the system. The N-soliton solutions can be used to describe the multiple wrinkles in graphene sheets. Furthermore, wrinkle propagation and interaction are discussed. Snake-, V- and Z-like wrinkles are observed graphically by choosing the heat transmission function as three specific functions. A collision between wrinkles is elastic. Before and after the collision, wrinkle energy and propagation direction remain unchanged. But at collision points, the energy carried by the larger wrinkles will be subtracted.

26,"Tungstate source and tartrate (Tar(2-)) additive were examined for their influences on the hydrothermal formation and characteristics of ZnWO4 nanocrystals. It was clearly shown that quasi-equiaxed nanocrystallites of similar to 50-100 nm in diameter and nanorods of similar to 40-50 nm in diameter and up to similar to 700 nm in length can be generated with (NH4)(10)W12O41 center dot 5H(2)O and K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O as tungsten sources, respectively. Introducing Tar(2-) into the K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O reaction system effectively transformed the primary crystallites of ZnWO4 from nanorods into quasi-equiaxed nanocrystals (similar to 20-50 nm) and then nanoplates (thickness of similar to 20 nm, lateral size of similar to 200 nm) and, meanwhile, aggregated the crystallites into spheroidal clusters (similar to 2-3 mu m in diameter) with the increasing Tar(2-)/Zn2+ molar ratio up to similar to 2. Optical spectroscopy revealed that the ZnWO4 products exhibit broad-band photoluminescence (similar to 425-700 nm) through T-3(1u) -> (1)A(1g) transition of the [WO6](6-) ligand under short ultraviolet excitation and the nanorods show the best luminescence among all tested samples.

By using the transition rate equation, the performance of the QD refrigerator was studied with respect to the electron transmission probability and the partition ratio (i.e. the fraction of Joule heat generated in the system that releases into the cold reservoir). The analytical expression of the maximum coefficient of performance (COP) was obtained under the exoreversible working condition.

34,"A novel three-dimensional (3D) micro-manufacturing technology of a curved surface diamond structure used for a micro birdbath resonator gyroscope (mu-BRG) with integrated curved electrodes is presented. The integrated curved electrodes with the same curvature as the birdbath shell are embedded using a self-aligned process, which avoids the extra assembly process, ensures the symmetry and improves the driving capacity of the mu-BRG. The capacitive gap is defined by the sacrificial layer, and a uniform and small gap distance (2 mu m) between the curved electrodes and the birdbath shell is obtained. The mu-BRGs with a diameter of 1.2 mm and a thickness of 2 mu m have been demonstrated by employing boron-doped microcrystalline diamond films deposited using hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD). In this paper, the device structure and basic working principle of the gyroscope are described. The key steps in the fabrication process, such as isotropic wet etching of the bulk silicon for a birdbath mold, photoresist spray-coating for patterning the curved electrodes, and deposition and etching of diamond films, are considered in detail and well solved. The radial deviation of the etched birdbath mold is about 0.31% for the similar to 560 mu m radius shell and the surface roughness of the birdbath mold is favorable (Rq = 4.933 nm, Ra = 3.945 nm).

36,"Ultraviolet radiation produced by corona discharge can be used for discharge diagnosis, but the ultraviolet imager is expensive and the ultraviolet signal is susceptible to external interference during the day, so it can not accurately identify the occurrence of corona discharge.

The design of optical lens to concentrate the ultraviolet signal so as to suppress external interference was presented. By carrying out insulator corona discharge experiments, the feasibility of the proposed method was studied. Finally, a comparison and verification was made with the combination of corona discharge images collected by UV imager. Research results by this paper indicate that, when the detection distance is smaller than 5 m, and the power supply is about 700 V, the proposed corona detection method can effectively collect the ultraviolet rays generated by corona discharge, thus realizing the feasible recognition of corona discharge.

37,"The pion-baryon triangle diagram is inspected for a special kinematic region where the squared momentum transfer t is close to 4m2:t4m2m4/mN2<i. Instead of arguing on the ground of anomalous threshold, we investigate possible impacts on power counting. The pion can have very small energies, as opposed to m<i in the physical region, which allows all three propagators to be extremely near their mass shell and contributes significantly to the loop integral. We find that in this narrow kinematic window the static-limit approximation for the baryon propagator is invalid and the resummation of the kinetic energy is necessary. Interestingly, in contrast to low-energy two-baryon processes, this resummation of baryon recoils does not lead to overall enhancement of power counting of the diagram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"We study the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of the axisymmetric linear strain, where the strain rate depends on time in a specific manner. It is known that the system admits solutions which blow up in finite time and whose profiles are in a backward self-similar form of the familiar Burgers vortices. In this paper it is shown that the existing stability theory of the Burgers vortex leads to the stability of these blow-up solutions as well. The secondary blow-up is also observed when the strain rate is relatively weak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"In this paper we investigate the influence of different metallic (or metal-based) masking materials and plasma techniques for etching and patterning polycrystalline boron-doped diamond thin films. Lift-off technique was used to prepare various testing mask patterns with dimensions ranging from 1 ?m to 15 ?m. The results of plasma etching utilizing 100?nm Al and Cu masks are compared. Radio frequency and inductively coupled pure oxygen plasma techniques were used to obtain the fine etched structures. A simple etching scheme describing the obtained results is presented for each type of plasma technique and mask type. Although the Al mask is widely believed to have outstanding properties over other metallic materials, we found that the Cu mask exhibits lower side edge etching for both types of plasma techniques. A formation of thick and crystalline copper oxide layer in contrast with thin amorphous aluminum oxide is believed to be the reason for this behavior. Consequently, the etched structures also possessed much better side wall angles which is a key parameter for micro-fabrication of boron doped diamond microelectrodes, microfluidics, sensors and microelectromechanical devices in general.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"The observed linear thermal shifts of ten fluorescence peaks Y-1-Y-10 from room temperature to about 1000 K for Y3Al5O12:Sm3+ (grown by the Czochralski method) were investigated by considering both the static effect owing to lattice thermal expansion and the dynamic effect stemming from electron-phonon interaction. The static effects were acquired by, using the pressure dependences of these fluorescence peak positions. The static effects for the ten fluorescence peaks resulted in thermal blue shift, but the dynamic effects for all peaks except Y-7 led to thermal red shift. The observed nature of thermal shift (i.e. red or blue) of a fluorescence peak was due to competition between the static and dynamic effects. Based on an approximate treatment, the static parameter A (characterizing the static effect) and electron-phonon coupling parameter alpha' (characterizing the dynamic effect) for these fluorescence peaks were estimated in the case where therrhal shift curves from low temperature to near or higher than room temperature were not measured. Parameters A for all fluorescence peaks and alpha' for all peaks except Y-7 were comparable in sign and magnitude with those of the sharp luminescence peaks of other rare earth ions in crystals and so were deemed to be reasonable. The causes of the exception for alpha' of Y-7 spectral peak (including the very large observed thermal blue shift of this peak) remain unclear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"Spatial-spectral interference is an effective way to characterize an unknown ultra-short pulse. The key of characterizing an unknown ultra-short pulse is to retrieve the dispersion. Considering that the spatial-spectral interference fringe is the equiphase line of different spectra in the space domain and that the phase difference between adjacent interferences is equal to 2p, we propose a novel method of dispersion retrieval for spatial-spectral interference. The analytic expression is deduced and demonstrated by simulated experiments. This method has the advantages of intuitive principle, less calculation and simple process with no Fourier transform, which are beneficial for practical applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

XRD patterns showed a single YBa2Cu3O7-delta phase for all samples. The resistance versus temperature measurements showed that all samples exhibited metallic normal state behavior. The addition of Li2O3 suppressed the superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O7-delta more than Na2CO3 and K2CO3. The AC susceptibility measurements showed a decrease in T-c chi ' for Li2CO3 addition. T-c chi ' was not much affected with Na2CO3 and K2CO3 addition which was around 93-94 K for x = 0-1.0 wt%. However, T-c chi ' was very much suppressed in the Li2O3-added samples with T-c chi ' decreasing from 94 K for x = 0 to 83 K for x = 1.0 wt%. The peak temperature T-p of the imaginary part of the susceptibility chi '' shifted to lower temperatures for Li2CO3, Na2CO3 and K2CO3 addition. This indicated the intergranular coupling and flux pinning force were suppressed when alkali metal carbonate was added. This work also showed that alkali metals with smaller ionic radius, Li, suppressed superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O7-delta more than the larger ionic radius, Na and K.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"In this work we develop a new reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) framework for inverse scattering problems using the Born approximation. We assume we have backscattered data of a field that is dependent on an unknown scattering potential. Our goal is to reconstruct or image this scattering potential. Assuming the scattering potential lies in a RKHS, we find that the imaging equation can be rewritten as the inner product of the desired unknown function with the adjoint of the forward operator applied to the kernel of the imaging operator. We therefore may choose the kernel of the imaging operator such that the adjoint applied to this kernel is precisely the reproducing kernel of the Hilbert space the reflectivity function lies in. In this way we are able to obtain an alternative definition of an ideal image. We will demonstrate this theory using synthetic aperture radar imaging as an example, though there are other applicable imaging modalities i.e. inverse diffraction and diffraction tomography [1, 6]. We choose SAR as it was the motivating application for this work. We will compare the RKHS ideal imaging technique to the standard microlocal analytic ideal image from backprojection theory. Note this method requires a variation of the standard SAR data model with the assumption of a full two dimensional data collection surface as opposed to a one dimensional flight path, however we are able to perform imaging with a single frequency and avoid the approximations made in the backprojection imaging operator derivation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Otherwise we encounter the Kochen and Specker paradox. We mention the supposition for Green-berger, Horne, and Zeilinger paradox. It is discussed that only Product rule is necessary for the paradox.

47,"This study is concerned with the phenomenon of flow instability in the entrance region of a pulsating pipe flow perturbed by a trip wire at the inlet, where the flow was uniform at the core with a thin boundary layer on the wall. First of all, it is illustrated by a case without the installation of a trip wire that small disturbance developed in the accelerating phase of pulsation, which was well explained by the inflection-point instability mechanism Subsequently, one of the cases studied with the installation of a trip wire indicates that the inflection-point instability mechanism still played the key role, but the instability was promoted further upstream. On the other hand, there were cases of which the flow instability development was rather due to the viscous effect mainly which was decaying in a certain downstream region, followed by a renewal growth with irregular fluctuations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"Dynamic characterization of self-induced beating sinusoidal wave (BSW) oscillations and related phenomena, which were previously explored in a thin-slice dual-polarization solid-state laser operating in the regime of incomplete mode-locking of orthogonally polarized transverse eigenmodes, namely, a quasi-locked state Otsuka (2018 Laser Phys. Lett. 15 075001), is performed in terms of the amplitude correlation coefficient and intensity circulation among various orthogonally polarized mode pairs. Polarization-dependent symmetry-breaking featuring a nonreciprocal intensity flow for different orthogonally polarized mode pairs operating in the BSW state are found. The singular state is hidden in a nonlinear system where a perfect mode-locked BSW state with a large amplitude correlation coefficient featuring reciprocal intensity flow is established for a transverse mode pair possessing particular polarization directions that are related to the intensity ratio of orthogonally polarized transverse eigenmodes. Self-organized chaos synchronization is shown to take place for such a single pair of transverse modes subjected to self-mixing modulations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"The purpose of this paper is to determine the mass transition and mass diffusion coefficients in the diffuse interface model. By means of the thermodynamic probabilities of molecules transiting (phase change) and shifting (diffusing), the rate of mass transition and the mass diffusion flux are derived first. By comparing them with the corresponding formulas in the diffuse interface model, the two coefficients are then obtained. The mass transition coefficient is proportional to the rate of molecular unidirectional transition under the mutual equilibrium of liquid and vapor species. The mass diffusion coefficient is proportional to the rate of molecular unidirectional travel through a unit surface under the condition that two local elements at two sides of the surface are in mutual equilibrium. This diffusion coefficient can finally be expressed as the product of the Fick concentration diffusion coefficient and the mixing density besides an energy (or temperature) factor. The Fick coefficient obtained at present is reduced to the self-diffusion coefficient at the gas boundary of the binary mixing layer and becomes the Fick diffusion coefficient of gas in pure liquid at the liquid boundary. The present coefficients (including Fick coefficient) are different from the existing ones in the literature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,"The low energy magnetic configurations in square 300 nm Fe islands, having their magneto-crystalline easy axes aligned along the diagonals of the squares, are studied by micromagnetic simulations with the help of the mumax3 package. For thicknesses above 2.4 nm vortex configurations become the lowest energy states. However for the thickness range 1.5-2.5 nm ""leaf"", vortex and ""C"" state configurations have comparable energies and can be all stabilized as the energy barriers that separate them are substantial (209 k(B)T to 401 k(B)T) and much larger than their energy differences. Therefore in ordered arrays of such elements different states could be simultaneously present depending on the local interactions and previous history. In view of their use as tunable magnonic metamaterials the high frequency response of each configuration is micromagnetically simulated. The resonance frequencies in single elements as well as for arrays, and the localized spin wave modes that correspond to each resonance, are extracted for each of the low energy micromagnetic states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

52,"Research of ionospheric electric current density is generally based on some theoretical formulas and empirical models. The electrodynamic process of charged particles in plasma with a magnetic field can help analyze the formation mechanism of ionospheric electric field and current so that the ionospheric electric field intensity and current density can be simulated and studied. Furthermore, by establishing partial differential equations in magnetic dipole coordinates, electric current density in mid- and low-latitude ionosphere can be calculated by means of a series of more reasonable boundary conditions in this article. Besides, the wind drag and particles diffusion are taken into account to make the results more accurate. The electric field value fitted by the empirical model is used to verify the rationality of current density calculated indirectly. Through this theoretical model, the distribution of electric fields and currents in ionosphere has been carefully studied. In addition, several physical elements influencing the current value and direction are also studied, including external environmental factors, such as solar activity and geomagnetic index, as well as the internal factors, such as electrons and ions temperature. These works will be a great help in the future for the precise determination of ionospheric currents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,"We discuss the notion of global scale invariance, as realized in the theory of induced gravity , whereby the Newton gravitational constant GN is generated from the expectation value of a scalar field phi. Assuming the Friedmann space-time ds2=dt2-a2(t)dx2, where the radius function is of the form a=(t/t0)2/3 gamma, and a power-law field phi=phi 0tn and matter energy-density source rho m=rho otm, which imply that m=-2 gamma m/gamma being the matter adiabatic index, conditions are derived for the positivity of epsilon. In the special case of the Milne universe, defined by gamma=2/3, which is also the string equation of state, the line element is invariant under global coordinate transformations t -> t=zeta t. There is then no creation of particle-anti-particle pairs, nor, analogously in the superstring theory, of string-anti-string pairs. These results follow from the correspondence principle, the respective classical wave states propagating without amplification or attenuation. Some aspects of scale and modular invariance of the superstring are also described.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

57,"Based on the difference of thermal expansion coefficient between Si and Ge, low-intensity tensile stress can be introduced into Ge epitaxial layer on Si substrate. S-Ge/Si semiconductor (as known as low tensile strained Ge grown on Si substrate) has a higher carrier mobility when compared with unstrained-Ge or Si material, so that s-Ge/Si is appropriate for the production of high-speed circuit. At the same time, transformation from indirect bandgap semiconductor Ge into Pseudo-Direct bandgap semiconductor (which is also called PD-Ge) will be happen after s-Ge/Si is heavy doped, which makes LED produced of PD-Ge material perform a higher luminous efficiency because the radiative recombining probability of carriers in PD-Ge material is greatly improved compared with unstrained one. Taking the advantages referred of s-Ge/Si into account, s-Ge/Si has the potential to PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration. Carrier mobility of the semiconductor is one of the key physical parameters during the design and simulation of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integrated system. While as far as the authors are aware, carrier mobility model of s-Ge/Si is still rarely reported to date. In view of that all above, based on the E-k relation in both conduction band and valence band of s-Ge/Si material, the analytical models of physical parameters in energy band are established, and the models are verified by experiments. Then the s-Ge/Si carrier models are further established based on our band structure model, and the Monte Carlo method is used to verify our s-Ge/Si carrier mobility model. The quantificational results of our paper will help understand s-Ge/Si material physics and provide an important theoretical basis for the design of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

60,"The stability of conducting Taylor-Couette flows under the presence of toroidal magnetic background fields is considered. For strong enough magnetic amplitudes such magnetohydrodynamic flows are unstable against non-axisymmetric perturbations which may also transport angular momentum. In accordance with the often used diffusion approximation, one expects the angular momentum transport to be vanishing for rigid rotation. In the sense of a non-diffusive Lambda effect, however, even for rigidly rotating z-pinches, an axisymmetric angular momentum flux appears which is directed outward (inward) for large (small) magnetic Mach numbers. The internal rotation in a magnetized rotating tank can thus never be uniform. Those particular rotation laws are used to estimate the value of the instability-induced eddy viscosity for which the non-diffusive Lambda effect and the diffusive shear-induced transport compensate each other. The results provide the Shakura & Sunyaev viscosity ansatz leading to numerical values linearly growing with the applied magnetic field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61,"Research identifies two domains by which mathematics allows learning physics concepts: a technical domain that includes algorithmic operations that lead to solving formulas for an unknown quantity and a structural domain that allows for applying mathematical knowledge for structuring physical phenomena. While the technical domain requires employing only students' technical skills, the structural domain requires activating students' algebraic reasoning and applying it to learn more about physical systems beyond evaluating formulas. Students' technical skills in mathematics do not convert into structural skills automatically, and this is perceived as an obstacle that prevents complete appreciation of physics knowledge. There can be various ways to activate or to develop students' mathematical structural domain in physics. Most common are: (a) mathematical modeling that involves experimental activities concluding with algebraic relations; (b) stimulating students to work with symbols in limiting situations; or (c) developing the understanding of physics formulas (e.g., see Ref. 5). While all these methods are valuable, students still face difficulties with transferring their structural math skills to physics, thus new attempts are made. The process of developing students' algebraic structural skills proposed in this paper is a combination of the current approaches; however, as a means of developing mathematical reasoning, a mathematical structure is used that is derived from a physics formula. More specifically, this paper presents an attempt to interpret formula for the equivalent resistance of a parallel electric circuit using the properties of a rational function. Such formulated aim reflects not only recommendations of the physics education research community but also mathematics because it guides students in how to merge mathematical knowledge with the behavior of a physical system to learn more about the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

64,Bariev's model for correlated hopping in one dimension is integrable and soluble within the framework of two nested Bethe Ansatze. For repulsive interaction and finite magnetization the low energy excitation spectrum is a two-component Luttinger liquid with conformal charges c = 1. In zero magnetic field the spectrum of spin excitations is gapped. For higher energy excitations the single-hole (single-particle) spectral functions display edge singularities that deviate from those expected from a Luttinger liquid. The system can be described as a mobile impurity coupled to the Luttinger liquid yielding an effective x-ray edge type model. Using the Bethe Ansatz solution for repulsive interaction we obtain expressions for the critical exponents for the single-particle and single-hole Green's functions in zero magnetic field.

The 1D PC consisting of dielectric multilayer stacks with alternating refractive indices forms a PBG in the reflection spectrum. When the position of the PBG of the 1D PC is tuned to be close to the MPPs, the MPPs and the PBG can couple together to lead to a hybrid mode within the PBG.

Material safety should be considered in biomedical devices, but the effectiveness of electrospun nanofibers is limited with only the approved chemicals. Therefore, we considered the material in FDA-approved polymers and solvents and developed nanofibers using the general additives in the pharmaceutical industry, such as hypromellose, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and Gellan. The nanofiber, mainly composed of hypromellose and PVA, was applied to a local peptide drug delivery system. Electrostatically complexed Gellan and peptide were loaded in the nanofiber by co-electrospinning.

The nanofiber composed of only hydrophilic polymers quickly wetted in water and became a transparent gel-like lump. A drug release test of peptide-loaded nanofiber was performed resulted in 37% of initial burst release suppression with the gellan and peptide loaded nanofiber compared with solely peptide loaded hypromellose nanofiber. In addition, higher PVA blending to hypromellose was slightly effective for sustained release of peptide compared with pure peptide-loaded hypromellose nanofiber.

However, the magnetic anisotropy causes the asymmetry of Maxwell stress tensor. Subsequently, the force cannot be always evaluated by the surface integral of the Maxwell stress tensor, only. This article points out that the surface integral has to be often supplemented by the volume integral of a defined residual vector. The residual vector does not vanish in the case of anisotropy and has to be incorporated into the Maxwell stress tensor method. Appropriate examples of force evaluations for anisotropic ball levitating in the electromagnetic field are presented. The total force value is four times checked by Maxwell stress tensor modified method (for cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems), sum of physical components (Lorentz and material forces), and coenergy method, subsequently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"We propose a scheme to realize all-optical temporal differentiation calculation to input pulse in an inverse Y-type four-level atomic system driven by a strong standing-wave. Two optical blockades are created at individual wavelengths of two probe fields in presence of one single strong standing-wave field. On one hand, ultra-narrow transmission windows are produced for probe pulse field 1 when probe field 2 is so strong as a controlling field in EIT configuration. The system can be designed as a phase-reverter of weak probe field 1 and can perform temporal differentiation calculation to it because a pi phase shift is created. On the other hand, the blockade at probe field 2 can be burst in two-photon resonance configuration when probe field 1 becomes strong and saturated absorption takes effect. So a two-photon switching is also expected in this standing-wave-dressed atomic system. The scheme has a potential for an all-optical transistor in quantum logical circuits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The research includes three types of electrode materials: (1) the electrodes with strong ability of oxygen reservoirs; (2) the electrode with poor ability of oxygen reservoirs; (3) the active electrode with injection ability. Through implementing different combinations of electrodes, three types of switching modes were obtained and the relative conduction mechanism was analyzed, as well as conduction model.

77,"Intermixing phenomenon that occurs in quantum structures offers an effective way to manipulate the energy bandgap profile of emitting materials. In this paper, a numerical analysis of the concentration-dependent indium interdiffusion in InGaN/GaN quantum-disk-in-nanowires light-emitting devices is presented. The numerical model couples the concentration-dependent interdiffusion equations to Schrodinger's equation to determine the effect of intermixing process on emission properties of single and double quantum well structures. The details of the developed Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) solution algorithm and its stability analysis are presented. The main model parameters are calibrated using experimental data. Simulation results show that, consistent with experimental observations, longer annealing times or higher annealing temperatures result in progressive blue shifts in the eigen-energies with strong dependence on indium concentration profile. This simulation tool provides invaluable insight into the intermixing process and helps in device design procedures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"The gas-phase InfraRed Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD) spectra in the fingerprint region of the anion (m/z 163) and mono-deprotonated homodimer of 9-methyl-guanine (2, m/z 329) and its d(5) analogue (2-d(5)) are reported here. The anionic dimer is reverse Watson-Crick paired with the hydrogen bonding pattern ADD/DAA (where A stands for acceptor and D stands for donor), in which the site of negative charge is unambiguously found to be N-1. The match between experimental vibrational spectra and DFT-computed spectra is good with the exception of the region between 2000 and 2900 cm(-1) that contains symmetrical and antisymmetrical N-H stretches of the adjacent hydrogen-bond donor-donor pair.

79,"In the current communication technology, optical technology has been applied to the network to obtain optical network technology. Among them, optical network technology is optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which can play a larger transmission capacity under lower energy consumption. Further breakthroughs in intelligent optical networks require improvements in routing issues. In this study, firstly, the optical network architecture is analyzed, including wavelength division multiplexing optical network and elastic optical network. Then, the routing problem in optical networks is analyzed, and the main factors affecting the routing problem are extracted. On the basis of studying the energy consumption characteristics of data centers and WDM optical networks, and considering the characteristics of cloud service configuration, evolutionary game theory and optical bypass theory are introduced to obtain an intelligent routing algorithm for cloud computing based on optical networks, and energy consumption tests are carried out on data transmission and processing. In order to reduce the overall energy consumption, the use of IP routers is reduced, and the idle data servers are shut down. Then, it is found that the total energy consumption increases slowly at different times. The energy consumption of evolutionary game theory is compared. Compared with non-evolutionary game theory, the optimized intelligent routing algorithm makes the energy consumption more stable, while reducing the use of servers can further reduce the good expenditure. The proposed algorithm is oriented to optical network, which solves the problem of low overall utilization of network resources and improves the service quality of cloud services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

81,"In this work, the drop casting method is utilized to obtain a thin graphene-like graphite layer as a photodetection layer on a SiO2/Si substrate, and its performance is characterized to determine its potential use in commercial applications. The thin layer is formed by first synthesizing graphite soot from a butane flame before being turned into a liquid solution and drop-casted onto the substrate to form a thin graphene-like graphite film. Field emission scanning electron microscope and Raman vibrational mode analyses indicate that the fabricated graphene-like graphite layer has characteristics similar to the graphene. The graphene-like graphite photodetector demonstrates a narrow photoresponse from 530 to 680 nm, covering visible sources from green to red. The responsivity and external quantum efficiency of the device under the illumination of red laser 660 nm is found to be around 148 mA W-1 and 27.8% respectively and is faster than that reported for similar systems using graphene and reduced graphene oxide previously. A fast response time of 83.7 and 28 mu s at a modulation frequency of 1.0 and 10000 Hz respectively from the graphene-like thinly layered graphite photodetector shows potential application for the development of low-cost carbon-based photodetectors in near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a procedure to construct a chain of systems of equations which are dual, with respect to an integral H, to the given system, by exploiting the integral relation, defined by the upshifted version and the original version of H. When the numerator of the integral relation is biquadratic or multi-linear, we point out conditions where a dual fails to exists.

The electron doping effect on ARPES is clarified by calculating the spectrum of Li-intercalated bilayer graphene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,A change of thermodynamic parameters of surrounding air is experimentally investigated in the vicinity of metal conductor in which electric current flows. Substantial variations of pressure that are comparable with large meteorological variations are experimentally observed upon flowing a direct current pulse with a small amplitude and alternating currents of an industrial frequency through the conductor. Such significant and fast variations of the pressure occur at the instant the current in the conductor changes. Even current pulses with a short duration influence the pressure distinctly. Jumps of the pressure are experimentally observed in an investigated volume upon both building up the current amplitude and switching off the current pulse. These jumps are not typical for a usual cooling or heating of air mixture. It is expected that an exact correspondence between current pulses and the pressure variations makes it possible to create new technical equipment. The possibility of applying experimentally obtained results in device physics and nanotechnology science is of special interest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A qualitative model is proposed to describe the anomalous behavior of the polyvinylchloride composite including effects that provide stabilization of the high-conductivity states, conditions for development of instability in the transitions between the states, and the reasons for long-lived high-conductivity state even in the absence of external voltage. Simple numerical estimations that prove the proposed effects are considered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"This work reports on low temperature deposition of conducing indium oxide films by a radio-frequency plasma enhanced reactive thermal evaporation (rf-PERTE) technique. The films were deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) without intentional heating of the substrate and at elevated temperatures up to 150 degrees C. The material stoichiometry was accurately controlled by adjusting deposition conditions including the oxygen flow, process pressure, pumping speed, and RF-power. Besides, fine turning of the critical deposition parameters during the deposition was implemented by measuring the variation of film conductance in-situ. The film morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Hall effect measurements were also performed to determine the relation between the deposition conditions and the electrical properties of the films. A resistivity of 4 x 10(-4) Omega-cm was reached under optimized deposition conditions.

90,"Fe-Ni core-shell nanoparticles are versatile functional materials, and their thermal stabilities are crucial for their performances in operating conditions. In this study, the thermodynamic behaviors of Fe-Ni core-shell nanoparticles are examined under continuous heating. The solid-solid phase transition from body centered cubic (bcc) to face centered cubic (fcc) in the Fe core is identified. The transition is accompanied with the generation of stacking faults around the core-shell interface, which notably lowers the melting points of the Fe-Ni core-shell nanoparticles and causes even worse thermal stability compared with Ni ones. Moreover, the temperature of the structural transformation is shown to be tuned by modifying the Ni shell thickness. Finally, the stress distributions of the core and the shell are also explored. The relevant results could be helpful for the design, preparation, and utilization of Fe-based nanomaterials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

92,"We propose a feasible temporal filtering (or spectrum weighting) system to implement optical differentiation with arbitrarily-tunable order. Differentiation order is tuned by programming the temporal weighting mask (TWM) as power function of different exponents, not limited by the structure of the system. Assembly of the system is feasible, since the active parts are implemented by electro-optic elements and some key elements are reused between sub-systems involved in the scheme. Tuning of the system is simple, since electronically pre-stored TWMs are easy to switch among each other. The order-tunable functionality is verified by numerically testing the differentiation cases of normalized input pulse duration ranging from 0.1 to 0.4, and of differentiation order tuned from 1 to 10. Good accuracy is achieved, and measured by root mean square error lower than 0.1. Feasibilities of the system are also verified in terms of accuracy maintaining and distortion avoiding. Compared with existing methods, apart from the arbitrary order-tunable capacity and good accuracy, our proposed optical differentiator also possesses properties of good compactness and constant complexity. The proposed differentiator has unique applications on multi-peak waveform generation for optical communications and photonics-aided Radars with enhanced agility and feasibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"The Andreev reflection induced by Majorana zero mode (MZM) is theoretically investigated, by considering the existence of two coupling manners between the MZM and normal metallic lead, i.e., the direct coupling and the indirect coupling via a quantum dot. We find that in the noninteracting or weak-Coulomb cases, the low-bias conductance can be modulated by the interplay among the structural parameters. As a result, the conductance peak at the zero-bias limit has an opportunity to change into antiresonance in the case of appropriate structural parameters. When strong intrados Coulomb interaction is taken into account, the zero-bias conductance tends to show up as one peak with its width tightly related to the level, Coulomb strength, and the Zeeman splitting of the quantum dot. We believe that this work is helpful for ascertaining the signature of MZM in the Andreev reflection spectrum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"The measurement of transient stagnation pressure in impulse facilities, such as shock tubes and expansion tubes, is critical due to the limited experimental time window. In the present study, we investigate the characteristic behavior of pressure sensors shielded by blunt and conical housings, and evaluate the specific influence of the housing dimensions on the stagnation pressure measurement in distinct flow conditions. Pressure signals of piezoelectric sensors were acquired and schlieren images visualizing the wave dynamics were recorded. We conducted additional numerical simulations to support our hypotheses concerning the flow inside the housings. Results indicate that the pressure signal for conical housings exhibits longer rise time and more pronounced oscillations compared to that for blunt housings. Enlarging the borehole diameter and reducing the cavity depth both shorten signal rise time but enhance overshoots. Additional experiments on the sensitivity to assembly misalignment, the effect of gelatin-filled housings and the performance of exposed sensors complete the study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"Charge-current-induced torque effects on the magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic/metal bilayer is interesting from the aspect of fundamental physics as well as the applications in spintronic devices. The torque-induced variation of damping constant of magnetization can be foreseen from the change of the linewidth of ferromagnetic resonance spectrum. The Oersted torque (tau Oe) and current-induced torque (tau C) are induced by charge current; while the spin-orbit torque (tau SO) and field-like torque (tau FL) are induced by spin current. However, the torque effects often were hindered due to the heating-induced artifacts. In this work, we particularly pay attention to minimize the Joule heating effects in order to investigate the intrinsic torque effects in cobalt (Co)/platinum (Pt) bilayer with an applied charge current ranging from -60 to 60 mA. In this range, the Oersted field is estimated as 0.25 Oe which is much smaller than the experimental result of Delta Hr (similar to 0.7 Oe), implying some contribution from the spin-current induced field like torque. The current-polarization-induced asymmetry of linewidth Delta W, Delta W equivalent to W+Jc-W-Jc, increases from 0 to 0.15 with Jc changing from 0 to 60 mA, which is attributed to the spin-orbit torque.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

97,"Shell model calculations have been carried out for Nb-90 nucleus with the model space in which the valence protons occupy the f(5/2), p(3/2), p(1/2), and g(9/2) orbitals and the valence neutrons occupy the p(1/2), g(9/2), d(5/2), and g (7/2) orbitals. According to the calculated results, the negative parity is from the contribution of the proton of the f(5/2), p(3/2), and p(1/2) orbits. The moderate spin states of Nb-90 are mainly due to the excitation of protons from the f(5/2) and p(3/2) orbits to the p(1/2) and g(9/2) orbits across the Z = 38 subshell closure, and the high spin states arise from the excitation of a single neutron from the g(9/2) orbit into the d(5/2) orbit across the N = 50 shell closure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an illustrative example, we consider the Ablowitz-Ladik system posed on a graph that is constituted by N semi-infinite lattices (edges) connected through some boundary conditions. We first show that analyzing this problem is equivalent to analyzing a certain matrix IBV problem; then we employ the unified transform method (UTM) to analyze this matrix IBV problem. We also compare our results with some previously known studies. In particular, we show that the inverse scattering method (ISM) for the integrable DDEs on the set of integers can be recovered from the UTM applied to our N = 2 graph problem as a particular case, and the non-local reductions of integrable DDEs can be obtained as local reductions from our results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
