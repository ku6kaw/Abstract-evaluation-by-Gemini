J,"Goodman, J; Weare, J",ENSEMBLE SAMPLERS WITH AFFINE INVARIANCE,We propose a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods whose performance is unaffected by affine tranformations of space. These algorithms are easy to construct and require little or no additional computational overhead. They should be particularly useful for sampling badly scaled distributions. Computational tests show that the affine invariant methods can be significantly faster than standard MCMC methods on highly skewed distributions.,10.2140/camcos.2010.5.65,0,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes
J,"Marzari, N; Mostofi, AA; Yates, JR; Souza, I; Vanderbilt, D",Maximally localized Wannier functions: Theory and applications,"The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized ""Wannier functions"" was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or ""Boys orbitals"" as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.",10.1103/RevModPhys.84.1419,1,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no

The technique is based on density functional theory using norm conserving nonlocal pseudopotentials to define the atomic core and nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF's) to calculate the charge distribution. The modeling of an open device system is reduced to a calculation defined on a finite region of space using a screening approximation. The interaction between the device scattering region and the electrodes is accounted for by self-energies within the NEGF formalism.

We apply this technique to investigate single wall carbon nanotubes in contact with an Al metallic electrode.

The growth of graphene on insulating silicon carbide (SiC) surfaces by high-temperature annealing in vacuum was previously proposed to open a route for large-scale production of graphene-based devices(5,6). However, vacuum decomposition of SiC yields graphene layers with small grains (30-200 nm; refs 14-16).

J,"Sinova, J; Valenzuela, SO; Wunderlich, J; Back, CH; Jungwirth, T",Spin Hall effects,"Spin Hall effects are a collection of relativistic spin-orbit coupling phenomena in which electrical currents can generate transverse spin currents and vice versa. Despite being observed only a decade ago, these effects are already ubiquitous within spintronics, as standard spin-current generators and detectors. Here the theoretical and experimental results that have established this subfield of spintronics are reviewed. The focus is on the results that have converged to give us the current understanding of the phenomena, which has evolved from a qualitative to a more quantitative measurement of spin currents and their associated spin accumulation. Within the experimental framework, optical-, transport-, and magnetization-dynamics-based measurements are reviewed and linked to both phenomenological and microscopic theories of the effect. Within the theoretical framework, the basic mechanisms in both the extrinsic and intrinsic regimes are reviewed, which are linked to the mechanisms present in their closely related phenomenon in ferromagnets, the anomalous Hall effect. Also reviewed is the connection to the phenomenological treatment based on spin-diffusion equations applicable to certain regimes, as well as the spin-pumping theory of spin generation used in many measurements of the spin Hall angle. A further connection to the spin-current-generating spin Hall effect to the inverse spin galvanic effect is given, in which an electrical current induces a nonequilibrium spin polarization. This effect often accompanies the spin Hall effect since they share common microscopic origins. Both can exhibit the same symmetries when present in structures comprising ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers through their induced current-driven spin torques or induced voltages. Although a short chronological overview of the evolution of the spin Hall effect field and the resolution of some early controversies is given, the main body of this review is structured from a pedagogical point of view, focusing on well-established and accepted physics.

There is particularly a focus on quantum quenches: the temporal evolution following a sudden or slow change of the coupling constants of the system Hamiltonian. Several aspects of the slow dynamics in driven systems are discussed and the universality of such dynamics in gapless systems with specific focus on dynamics near continuous quantum phase transitions is emphasized. Recent progress on understanding thermalization in closed systems through the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is also reviewed and relaxation in integrable systems is discussed. Finally key experiments probing quantum dynamics in cold atom systems are overviewed and put into the context of our current theoretical understanding.,10.1103/RevModPhys.83.863,23,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no
J,"Reneker, DH; Yarin, AL; Fong, H; Koombhongse, S",Bending instability of electrically charged liquid jets of polymer solutions in electrospinning,"Nanofibers of polymers were electrospun by creating an electrically charged jet of polymer solution at a pendent droplet. After the jet flowed away from the droplet in a nearly straight line, it bent into a complex path and other changes in shape occurred, during which electrical forces stretched and thinned it by very large ratios. After the solvent evaporated, birefringent nanofibers were left. In this article the reasons for the instability are analyzed and explained using a mathematical model. The rheological complexity of the polymer solution is included, which allows consideration of viscoelastic jets. It is shown that the longitudinal stress caused by the external electric field acting on the charge carried by the jet stabilized the straight jet for some distance. Then a lateral perturbation grew in response to the repulsive forces between adjacent elements of charge carried by the jet. The motion of segments of the jet grew rapidly into an electrically driven bending instability. The three-dimensional paths of continuous jets were calculated, both in the nearly straight region where the instability grew slowly and in the region where the bending dominated the path of the jet. The mathematical model provides a reasonable representation of the experimental data, particularly of the jet paths determined from high speed videographic observations.

The CALYPSO method is based on several major techniques (e.g. particle-swarm optimization algorithm, symmetry constraints on structural generation, bond characterization matrix on elimination of similar structures, partial random structures per generation on enhancing structural diversity, and penalty function, etc.) for global structural minimization from scratch. All of these techniques have been demonstrated to be critical to the prediction of global stable structure. We have implemented these techniques into the CALYPSO code. Testing of the code on many known and unknown systems shows high efficiency and the highly successful rate of this CALYPSO method [Y. Wang, J. Lv, L. Zhu, Y. Ma, Phys. Rev. B 82 (2010) 094116] [29].

J,"Neese, F; Wennmohs, F; Hansen, A; Becker, U","Efficient, approximate and parallel Hartree-Fock and hybrid DFT calculations. A 'chain-of-spheres' algorithm for the Hartree-Fock exchange","In this paper, the possibility is explored to speed up Hartree-Fock and hybrid density functional calculations by forming the Coulomb and exchange parts of the Fock matrix by different approximations. For the Coulomb part the previously introduced Split-RI-J variant (F. Neese, J. Comput. Chem. 24 (2003) 1740) of the well-known 'density fitting' approximation is used. The exchange part is formed by semi-numerical integration techniques that are closely related to Friesner's pioneering pseudo-spectral approach. Our potentially linear scaling realization of this algorithm is called the 'chain-of-spheres exchange' (COSX). A combination of semi-numerical integration and density fitting is also proposed. Both Split-RI-J and COSX scale very well with the highest angular momentum in the basis sets. It is shown that for extended basis sets speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional implementations can be obtained in this way. Total energies are reproduced with an average error of <0.3 kcal/mol as determined from extended test calculations with various basis sets on a set of 26 molecules with 20-200 atoms and up to 2000 basis functions. Reaction energies agree to within 0.2 kcal/mol (Hartree-Fock) or 0.05 kcal/mol (hybrid DFT) with the canonical values. The COSX algorithm parallelizes with a speedup of 8.6 observed for 10 processes. Minimum energy geometries differ by less than 0.3 pm in the bond distances and 0.5 degrees in the bond angels from their canonical values. These developments enable highly efficient and accurate self-consistent field calculations including nonlocal Hartree-Fock exchange for large molecules. In combination with the RI-MP2 method and large basis sets, second-order many body perturbation energies can be obtained for medium sized molecules with unprecedented efficiency. The algorithms are implemented into the ORCA electronic structure system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

PSO technique is different with the genetic algorithm and has apparently avoided the use of evolution operators (e.g., crossover and mutation). The approach is based on an efficient global minimization of free-energy surfaces merging total-energy calculations via PSO technique and requires only chemical compositions for a given compound to predict stable or metastable structures at given external conditions (e.g., pressure). A particularly devised geometrical structure parameter which allows the elimination of similar structures during structure evolution was implemented to enhance the structure search efficiency. The application of designed variable unit-cell size technique has greatly reduced the computational cost. Moreover, the symmetry constraint imposed in the structure generation enables the realization of diverse structures, leads to significantly reduced search space and optimization variables, and thus fastens the global structure convergence. The PSO algorithm has been successfully applied to the prediction of many known systems (e.g., elemental, binary, and ternary compounds) with various chemical-bonding environments (e.g., metallic, ionic, and covalent bonding). The high success rate demonstrates the reliability of this methodology and illustrates the promise of PSO as a major technique on crystal structure determination.",10.1103/PhysRevB.82.094116,30,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y = f (X-1 , X-2, ... , X-k) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X-1 , X-2, ... , X-k) needed to complete the analysis. as f(X-1 , X-2, ... , X-k) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time.

J,"Scalmani, G; Frisch, MJ",Continuous surface charge polarizable continuum models of solvation. I. General formalism,"Continuum solvation models are appealing because of the simplified yet accurate description they provide of the solvent effect on a solute, described either by quantum mechanical or classical methods. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) family of solvation models is among the most widely used, although their application has been hampered by discontinuities and singularities arising from the discretization of the integral equations at the solute-solvent interface. In this contribution we introduce a continuous surface charge (CSC) approach that leads to a smooth and robust formalism for the PCM models. We start from the scheme proposed over ten years ago by York and Karplus and we generalize it in various ways, including the extension to analytic second derivatives with respect to atomic positions. We propose an optimal discrete representation of the integral operators required for the determination of the apparent surface charge. We achieve a clear separation between ""model"" and ""cavity"" which, together with simple generalizations of modern integral codes, is all that is required for an extensible and efficient implementation of the PCM models. Following this approach we are now able to introduce solvent effects on energies, structures, and vibrational frequencies (analytical first and second derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates), magnetic properties (derivatives with respect of magnetic field using GIAOs), and in the calculation more complex properties like frequency-dependent Raman activities, vibrational circular dichroism, and Raman optical activity.",10.1063/1.3359469,48,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

However, despite its intriguing properties, one of the biggest hurdles for graphene to be useful as an electronic material is the lack of an energy gap in its electronic spectra. This, for example, prevents the use of graphene in making transistors. Although several proposals have been made to open a gap in graphene's electronic spectra, they all require complex engineering of the graphene layer. Here, we show that when graphene is epitaxially grown on SiC substrate, a gap of approximate to 0.26 eV is produced. This gap decreases as the sample thickness increases and eventually approaches zero when the number of layers exceeds four.

We report an implementation of analytic excited state gradients and charge moments for local, gradient corrected, and hybrid functionals, as well as for the configuration interaction singles (CIS) and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) methods. By exploiting analogies to ground state energy and gradient calculations, efficient techniques can be transferred to excited state methods. Benchmark results demonstrate that, for low-lying excited states, geometry optimizations are not substantially more expensive than for the ground state, independent of the molecular size. We assess the quality of calculated adiabatic excitation energies, structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies by comparison with accurate experimental data for a variety of excited states and molecules. Similar trends are observed for adiabatic excitation energies as for vertical ones. TDDFT is more robust than CIS and TDHF, in particular, for geometries differing significantly from the ground state minimum. The TDDFT excited state structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies are of a remarkably high quality, which is comparable to that obtained in ground state density functional calculations.

This review provides a pedagogical introduction into the field of topological quantum matter with an emphasis on classification schemes. Both fully gapped and gapless topological materials and their classification in terms of nonspatial symmetries, such as time reversal, as well as spatial symmetries, such as reflection, are considered. Furthermore, the classification of gapless modes localized on topological defects is surveyed. The classification of these systems is discussed by use of homotopy groups, Clifford algebras, K theory, and nonlinear sigma models describing the Anderson (de) localization at the surface or inside a defect of the material. Theoretical model systems and their topological invariants are reviewed together with recent experimental results in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective of the field. While the bulk of this article is concerned with the topological properties of noninteracting or mean-field Hamiltonians, a brief overview of recent results and open questions concerning the topological classifications of interacting systems is also provided.",10.1103/RevModPhys.88.035005,72,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no

J,"Eisert, J; Cramer, M; Plenio, MB",<i>Colloquium</i>: Area laws for the entanglement entropy,"Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: the entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such ""area laws"" for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium the current status of area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models, and disordered systems, nonequilibrium situations, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. These questions are considered in classical and quantum systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a variety of correlation measures. A significant proportion is devoted to the clear and quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. Matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogs, and variational sets from entanglement renormalization are also discussed and the paper is concluded by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations of quantum states.",10.1103/RevModPhys.82.277,76,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no
J,"Monticelli, L; Kandasamy, SK; Periole, X; Larson, RG; Tieleman, DP; Marrink, SJ",The MARTINI coarse-grained force field: Extension to proteins,"Many biologically interesting phenomena occur on a time scale that is too long to be studied by atomistic simulations. These phenomena include the dynamics of large proteins and self-assembly of biological materials. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling allows computer simulations to be run on length and time scales that are 2-3 orders of magnitude larger compared to atomistic simulations, providing a bridge between the atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed a new CG model for proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force field. Here, we validate the model for its use in peptide-bilayer systems. In order to validate the model, we calculated the potential of mean force for each amino acid as a function of its distance from the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer. We then compared amino acid association constants, the partitioning of a series of model pentapeptides, the partitioning and orientation,of WALP23 in DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. A comparison with results obtained from atomistic models shows good agreement in all of the tests performed. We also performed a systematic investigation of the partitioning of five series of polyalanine-leucine peptides (with different lengths and compositions) in DPPC bilayers. As expected, the fraction of peptides partitioned at the interface increased with decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine content, demonstrating that the CG model is capable of discriminating partitioning behavior arising from subtle differences in the amino acid composition. Finally, we simulated the concentration-dependent formation of transmembrane pores by magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with atomistic simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In conclusion, the model is computationally efficient and effectively reproduces peptide-lipid interactions and the partitioning of amino acids and peptides in lipid bilayers.",10.1021/ct700324x,77,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has an ionic lattice conductivity of 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C, and the Gd3+ ion is the preferred dopant, compared to Sm3+ and Y3+, at this temperature. Thermodynamic investigations indicate that for CeO2-Re2O3 solid solutions at intermediate temperatures it becomes easier to reduce Ce4+ as the concentration of Re2O3 is increased. As the associated electron mobilities do not appear to be a strong function of composition it follows that Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has a wider ionic domain than Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 at intermediate temperatures. particular attention is drawn to the deleterious effects of impurities (principally SiO2) which are responsible for large dopant concentration dependent grain boundary resistivities. These grain boundary resistivities can obscure the intrinsic lattice ionic conductivities and cause investigators to select non-optimal dopant compositions. It follows that the use of clean (SiO2 < 50 ppm) powders is strongly recommended, particularly as these are now commercially available. At present there is also no compelling evidence to confirm that the intrinsic lattice electronic conductivity is significantly changed by co-doping with Pr6O11. Finally the I-V characteristics of single cells incorporating 25-mu m thick Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolytes are modelled, and the requirements for composite electrodes briefly discussed so that power densities of 0.4 W cm(-2) at 500 degrees C can be attained.

We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques.

To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, we performed a range of NVT-MD simulations on various hydrocarbon/O-2 systems. From simulations on methane/O-2, o-xylene/O-2, propene/O-2, and benzene/O-2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene > o-xylene > methane > benzene), following the trend in the C-H bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO/CO2/H2O mixture and found that the pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition-and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and hydrocarbon radical species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system.

The two limits are identified as the cases of infinitely small and infinitely large upconversion rates, respectively. In the latter case, the dependence of luminescence intensities from intermediate excited states on pump power changes with the underlying upconversion and decay mechanisms. In certain situations, energy-transfer upconversion and excited-state absorption can be distinguished by the measured slopes. The competition between linear decay and upconversion in the individual excitation steps of sequential upconversion can be analyzed. The influence of nonuniform distributions of absorbed pump power or of a subset of ions participating in energy-transfer upconversion is investigated.

J,"Deegan, RD; Bakajin, O; Dupont, TF; Huber, G; Nagel, SR; Witten, TA",Contact line deposits in an evaporating drop,"Solids dispersed in a drying drop will migrate to the edge of the drop and form a solid ring. This phenomenon produces ringlike stains and occurs for a wide range of surfaces, solvents, and solutes. Here we show that the migration is caused by an outward flow within the drop that is driven by the loss of solvent by evaporation and geometrical constraint that the drop maintain an equilibrium droplet shape with a fixed boundary. We describe a theory that predicts the flow velocity, the rate of growth of the ring, and the distribution of solute within the drop. These predictions are compared with our experimental results.",10.1103/PhysRevE.62.756,97,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes
J,"Cui, Y; Zhong, ZH; Wang, DL; Wang, WU; Lieber, CM",High performance silicon nanowire field effect transistors,"Silicon nanowires can be prepared with single-crystal structures, diameters as small as several nanometers and controllable hole and electron doping, and thus represent powerful building blocks for nanoelectronics devices such as field effect transistors. To explore the potential limits of silicon nanowire transistors, we have examined the influence of source-drain contact thermal annealing and surface passivation on key transistor properties. Thermal annealing and passivation of oxide defects using chemical modification were found to increase the average transconductance from 45 to 800 nS and average mobility from 30 to 560 cm(2)/V(.)s with peak values of 2000 nS and 1350 cm(2)/V(.)s, respectively. The comparison of these results and other key parameters with state-of-the-art planar silicon devices shows substantial advantages for silicon nanowires. The uses of nanowires as building blocks for future nanoelectronics are discussed.",10.1021/nl025875l,98,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
J,"Mahoney, MW; Jorgensen, WL","A five-site model for liquid water and the reproduction of the density anomaly by rigid, nonpolarizable potential functions","The ability of simple potential functions to reproduce accurately the density of liquid water from -37 to 100 degrees C at 1 to 10 000 atm has been further explored. The result is the five-site TIP5P model, which yields significantly improved results; the average error in the density over the 100 degrees temperature range from -37.5 to 62.5 degrees C at 1 atm is only 0.006 g cm(-3). Classical Monte Carlo statistical mechanics calculations have been performed to optimize the parameters, especially the position of the negative charges along the lone-pair directions. Initial calculations with 216 molecules in the NPT ensemble at 1 atm focused on finding a model that reproduced the shape of the liquid density curve as a function of temperature. Calculations performed for 512 molecules with the final TIP5P model demonstrate that the density maximum near 4 degrees C at 1 atm is reproduced, while high-quality structural and thermodynamic results are maintained. Attainment of high precision for the low-temperature runs required sampling for more than 1 billion Monte Carlo configurations. In addition, the dielectric constant was computed from the response to an applied electric field; the result is 81.5 +/- 1.5 at 25 degrees C and the experimental curve is mirrored from 0-100 degrees C at 1 atm. The TIP5P model is also found to perform well as a function of pressure; the density of liquid water at 25 degrees C is reproduced with an average error of similar to 2% over the range from 1 to 10 000 atm, and the shift of the temperature of maximum density to lower temperature with increasing pressure is also obtained.
