1,"A simple and solvent-minimized sample preparation technique based on hollow fibre-protected liquid-phase micro-extraction has been developed for extraction of fifteen organic sulfur compounds (OSCs) from aqueous samples. The analysis of the extracted OSCs was performed by gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry and/or flame photometric detectors. 3.3 mu l of organic solvent located in the lumen of hollow fibre was used to extract OSCs from 8 ml of an aqueous sample. Several parameters influencing extraction efficiency such as salt concentration, stirring speed, temperature, sample volume, organic phase volume and extraction time were studied and optimized using super-modified simplex method. Under optimized conditions, including extraction solvent (toluene) extraction time (15 min), salt addition (4% w/v), stirring rate (1200 rpm), sample volume (8 ml SV), organic solvent volume (3.3 mu l) and extraction temperature (35 degrees C), the limits of detection varied from 0.1 to 8.7 mu g l(-1) and 0.7 to 99.4 mu g l(-1) for GC-FPD and GC-MS, respectively. The calibration graphs were linear over three orders of magnitude for most of the studied OSCs. The relative standard deviations for inter- and intra- day analysis were in the range of 5-10%, and the relative recoveries of the analytes from three different real water samples were more than 83%. The results were compared with those obtained using direct single drop micro-extraction and headspace single drop micro-methods. The proposed method is reliable and can be considered useful for routine monitoring of the organic sulfur compounds in surface water samples.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,
2,"The novelty of this work is to fabricate the Nanosticks (NSs) like CdS sensitizer on the surface of TiO2 electrode by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method with a very high vacuum annealed at 350 degrees C for 30 min. Whereas, nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes have been prepared on FTO (SnO2: F) glass by a spin-coating method with high purity (99.99%, Degussa P25) TiO2 powder. The surface of the CdS layer has been covered by NSs like structures which are confirmed by the scanning electron microscope image. The 100 nm of platinum-coated FTO substrate and polysulfide-based electrolyte are used to assemble the Gratzel Solar cell (GSC). The performance of solar cell (SC) based on NSs like CdS has been compared with the nanoparticles (NPs) based CdS sensitized SC, where CdS NPs has synthesized by CBD without any post-annealing. The efficiency of NSs like CdS sensitized SC exhibits 2.44%, which is 2 folds of the efficiency of the CdS NPs sensitized SC. The NSs like CdS sensitized SC shows the highest photocurrent 20.24 mA/cm(2) compared to CdS NPs based SC.",no,happy,happy,no,no,happy,happy,happy,happy,happy,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,happy,happy,no,no,yes,yes,happy
3,"In nanoarchitectonics, the advanced technology of directional etching is highly demanded for the fabrication of modern electronic device with high anisotropy ratio of structures. To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle. The featured surface morphologies, including the pyramid, ripple, mounds and etch pits, are reproduced numerically, and these simulation results correspond well with the observations of directional etching experiments. This study provides the fundamental knowledge and detailed information for the advanced application of the directional etching technology.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes
4,"A rapid screening assay for the measurement of octanol-water partition coefficients (logP) of pharmaceuticals such as quinolines, quinolones and fluoroquinolones compounds were developed using quantum chemical calculations. In this paper, we report the logP of the pharmaceutical derivative compounds determined by the calculation of the difference in the solvation free energies in water-octanol using the thermodynamic integration method. The logP values calculated by this method are closer to the experimental values compared to other ab initio methods. Solvation free energy in water and octanol, free energy of cavity formation in water and Henry's constants, and some other parameters are determined at the density functional theory (DFT) and Hartree-Fock (HF) level with 6-31++G** basis set.

6,"In this work, a few layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite have been synthesized by liquid exfoliation method. The morphological and structural properties are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. The optical properties are also investigated using absorption and Raman spectroscopy. This report presents quantification of swift heavy ion irradiation induced defects using Raman spectroscopy. We found both Raman mode E-2g(1) and A(1g) corresponding to MoS2 and Raman modes of rGO are strongly affected by increasing ions doses. The defect induced lattice strain in the rGO/MoS2 nanocomposite is also estimated from Raman spectroscopy. MoS2 layers are found to be much more sensitive than rGO in the rGO/MoS2 nanocomposite. These types of study further used in device based application of rGO/MoS2 nanocomposite system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,A simple cost effective Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was fabricated for urea sensing. Urea is the key end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans. Increased level of urea leads to loss of kidney function. Thus determination of urea is important in analysis of kidney diseases. Al-TiO2 thin films were deposited with different concentration of Al by Spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the anatase phase of the Al-TiO2 thin films with tetragonal structure. A shift is observed in the XRD peak position compared to as prepared TiO2 thin film indicates the incorporation of Al ions into Ti ions. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study shows that the absorption increases and the absorption peak shifts towards the visible region for Al-TiO2 thin films compared with that of the as prepared TiO2 thin film. The optical band gap values changes with the change in the Al concentration in TiO2 thin films. The electrochemical analysis for optimized Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. CV studies of Al-TiO2 thin film electrode show the good stability and linearity which is essential to fabricate biosensor. The sensor response to urea is linear with correlation coefficient of 0.944 and the sensitivity is 3.17 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Typical syntheses for the mesostructural design were performed with strategic deviations, being substantially powerful for changing the molecular structure of frameworks, from the synthetic conditions optimized for the preparation of lamellar and 2-d hexagonal mesostructured materials where the frameworks were constructed by aluminophosphate (AlPO) like units with and without organic groups in the molecular scale. A series of the materials such as mesostructured aluminum organophosphonate (AOP) and AlPO type ones were investigated according to the molecular structure and crystallinity of inorganic-organic hybrid and non-hybrid inorganic frameworks. Considering a uniqueness of AlPO based frameworks, a rational insight on strength of interactions between crystalline/amorphous AlPO based units and cationic surfactant molecules was surveyed as one of the most significant factors for understanding the mesostructural variation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Alga contamination was a major problem in microalgae open cultivation. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of silicon on microalgae growth by mixed-culture experiments with four different microalgae. The results showed that under the osmotic pressure caused by high concentration of Na2SiO3, Navicula sp. N6 had a competition advantage of absorbing nutrient compared with the other three microalgae. The impacts (initial pH, nitrogen content, and silicon content) on cell growth and lipid accumulation were investigated by response surface analysis and the biomass and lipid content increased from 1.01 g/L and 10.98% to 1.33 g/L and 20.04% under the optimal conditions, with lipid yield raised from 110.90 mg/L to 266.53 mg/L. Comparison on the growth under optimum and silicon deficiency condition indicated that silicon played an important role on the growth of Navicula sp. N6 and algal contamination in diatom open scale cultivation could be solved by regulating the sodium silicate concentration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"Glucose and microcrystalline cellulose were selected as model compounds to investigate the formation of ethyl levulinate (EL). Optimal glucose and microcrystalline cellulose transformation conditions resulted in yields of 41.05 wt.% and 38.56 wt.% for EL, 0.73 wt.% and 2.63 wt.% for ethyl-glucoside (EG), 0.42 wt.% and 0.36 wt.% for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and 2.18 wt.% and 2.16 wt.% for 5-ethoxy methyl furfural (EMF), respectively. Increasing the reaction time and temperature resulted in an optimized yield of EL. These increases also resulted in decreased EG and EMF yield, and the change trend of HMF was not significant. EMF, HMF, and EG are intermediates in the formation of EL. Finally, we concluded that biomass conversion occurs first through cellulose degradation to glucose followed by the production of EG through alcoholysis and hydrolysis and dehydration of the reaction products to produce EL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"Black spot disease which significantly reduces the quality of medicine plants is quite common in Dendrobium officinale fields. In this study, GXDF33, a strain of Alternaria, together with the reported pathogen Cladosporium, was isolated from symptomatic leaves. The in vitro pathogenicity tests on seedlings showed GXDF33 can cause black spot disease. Based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) result, it was found that the biomass of both Cladosporium and Alternaria increased as the symptom went severer. According to amplicon sequencing data for the symptomatic samples from Guangxi and Zhejiang Provinces in China, Cladosporium and Alternaria were both common genera in symptomatic plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report unveiling the relationship between black spot disease of a officirrale and Ciadosportum as well as Alternaria.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"A nanocomposite of Polypyrrole (PPy) and zinc oxide (ZnO), termed as PPy-ZnO, was synthesized by two step route. In the first step, synthesis of PPy was carried out by chemical oxidative route. In the second step, the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The as-synthesized PPy-ZnO nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) and Ultra violet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy to reveal the phase, morphology, chemical and optical properties. The physical and chemical characterizations confirmed presence of both PPy and ZnO phases in the nanocomposite. In the present work, antimicrobial activity of the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite against human pathogen Y. lipolytica has been investigated. Attempts have been made to reveal the influence of PPy percentage on the antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, all PPy-ZnO nanocomposites, irrespective of PPy percentage showed 90 to 95% inhibited growth of Yarrowia lipolytica. The results obtained herein imply the potential of PPy-ZnO biofilm in inhibiting the growth of Y. lipolytica and thus preventing infections caused due to Y. lipolytica in humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"AlN nanowires macro-array were successfully fabricated on Si substrate by double template method and chemical vapour deposition. The research shows that AlN nanowires array with different diameter, length and coverage can be prepared by controlling the experimental conditions.

Furthermore, the Ultraviolet absorption of AlN nanowires array as a sensors was investigated and calculated with the first principle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Here, a simple and general approach was developed for depositing metal nanoparticles on alkanedithiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) based on the spontaneous reduction of metal ions by the free SH sites of SAMs. By immersing the alkanedithiol SAM/Au in a corresponding metal containing solution (HAuCl4, AgNO3, H2PtCl6 and PdSO4), Au, Ag, Pt and Pd clusters, respectively, could be formed on top of the SAM/Au(111) electrode surface, which was confirmed by STM characterization. The size, morphology and coverage of clusters/islands can be tuned by modulating the immersion time, which allows for possible utilization of the metal/SAM/Au(111) in catalysis, nanoelectronics and biodetection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"In this study, TiWVOx/TiO2 thin-films were fabricated using a bipolar pulsed magnetron sputtering technique and were characterized. The results obtained using the X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the anatase phase structure with a highly oriented TiO2 (101) plane. The surface images obtained through scanning electron microscopy revealed the uniform distribution of pebble-like or cell-like clusters with no noticeable crack formation. In this study, an increasing WV alloy pulse power was positively associated with increasing proportions of WOx and VOx in the films. The TiO2 with WV alloy sputtered at a power of 50 W was found to be more hydrophilic than TiO2 with WV alloy sputtered at 200 W, thereby exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"Thin MgO nanostructure layer was grown on a-plane GaN film in this study using low temperature aqueous method. The thin MgO layer showed uniform sheet-like morphology. Meanwhile, ultraviolet (UV) photoconductive detector based on MgO/a-GaN heterostructure was fabricated by simple way. The obtained detector displayed excellent UV sensing properties. Results showed that the thin MgO nanostructure layer can effectively decrease the dark current and passivate the surface defects. The facile method will provide a new route to adopt nanostructures for applications in enhancing the performance of GaN-based UV detector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"In this research, the effect of temperature and anodizing voltage on the morphology and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanotubes which were fabricated in the organic electrolyte containing sodium carbonate as an additive was investigated. The FESEM results indicate that by increasing temperature, the growth rate, wall thickness of nanotubes decreased and disordered nanotube was fabricated. Besides, the photocatalytic activity of nanotubes was decreased as well. Furthermore, enhancing the anodizing voltage from 30 to 50 V leads to improvement of morphology and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanotubes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"Porous biocompatible microgranules, such as hydroxyapatite (HAp), are potential candidates for various bio-medical applications including drug delivery and remediation. Using the principle of evaporation-induced assembly in contact free dispersion droplets, we have synthesized porous micrometric HAp granules consist of interlocked ellipsoidal nanoparticles. We have shown that the shape of the microgranules can be tuned from spherical to doughnut solely by controlling the drying temperature during assembly. The structure and interparticle correlation in the synthesized granules have been probed by electron microscopy and small-angle scattering. The observed morphological transition has been attributed to the buckling of elastic shell made of interlocked HAp nanoparticles. Alteration of granular morphology at higher drying rate does not affect the local packing fraction of the correlated HAp nanoparticles in the granules. The absorption of bovine serum albumin protein by the synthesized granules has been tested as a potential application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"Lithium-sulphur batteries are considered as some of the most potent secondary-battery systems. These batteries are expected to have extensive applications in fields requiring high-energy density. However, such applications are hindered by some serious intrinsic obstacles. Herein, TiO2 nanosheets-rGO/sulphur (TiO2 NS-rGO/S) composites were fabricated through a two-process hydrothermal method. TiO2 nanosheets served as active sites for polysulphide absorption, whereas rGO offered space for sulphur improvement and TiO2 NS-rGO/S composites. The TiO2 NS-rGO/S composite exhibited high discharge capacity of 1099 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2 C rate and retained a capacity of 690 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles, with high sulphur loading of 3 mg.cm(-2). The high initial specific discharge capacity and improved cyclic stability were attributed to the synergistic effects of TiO2 nanosheets and rGO. These results indicated that the simple, low-cost and scalable method provides a novel perspective on practical utilisation of lithium-sulphur batteries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Thermal behavior of hydrotalcites, which is a calcination process, is critical to prepare the metal oxide catalysts with high performances in the practical applications. In this paper, the MgFe-LDH with Mg/Fe molar ratio of 3.0 was prepared by urea method and the calcined products are obtained by calcining at different temperatures (473 K, 573 K, 673 K, 773 K, 873 K and 973 K) under a N-2 atmosphere for 4 h. The structure, morphology, texture, pyrolysis kinetics and mechanism of the MgFe-LDH were studied in detail. On one hand, based on the TG/DSC curves, Starink, Kissinger and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) methods were used to calculate the activation energy, on the other hand, the Satava-Sestak, Achar and Malek methods were used to define the most probable reaction mechanisms of pyrolysis behavior. The results suggested that the thermal decomposition of the LDH experienced two steps, i.e., removal of the interlayer water, followed by dehydroxylation and decarbonation. Moreover the Makel method was used to define the most probable reaction mechanisms of the pyrolysis behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"Oroxylum as a traditional Chinese medicine, was used as a green and novel bio-template to synthesize tremella-like Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C composite (LVPC) cathode materials by adopting a facile immersion method. The microstructures were analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties were investigated by galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments. The LVPC revealed specific capacity of 95 mAh center dot g(-1) at 1 C rate within potential range of 3.0-4.3 V. After 100 cycles at 0.2 C, the retention of discharge capacity was 96%. The modified electrochemical performance is mainly resulted from the distinct tremella-like structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"A new 2,2'-dipyridyl compound 1, along with three known analogues (2-4), was isolated from the culture broth of endophytic Streptomyces sp. KIB H017c derived from Fragaria ananassa. Their structures were elucidated by analysis of 1D and 2D NMR as well as HRESIMS data, and comparison with literature data. The biological properties of all isolates were explored for antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activity. All four compounds exhibited weak antifungal activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and compound 4 exhibited weak antifungal activity against Penicillium decumbens ATCC 10436.

23,"A novel, rapid, simple and sensitive syringe-to-syringe-dispersive liquid-phase micro-extraction (SS-DLPME) method followed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry was proposed for pre-concentration and determination of nickel ion in water and herbal samples using 1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-naphthol as a chelating agent. Various experimental factors on pre-concentration and determination of nickel such as pH of sample solution, concentration of the complex agent, volume of the extraction solvent, shooting times, centrifugation time and ionic strength were investigated using Plackett-Burman design for screening and Box-Behnken design as an optimization method. Under optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear over the range of 10- 875 mu g L-1 with the coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.997 and the detection limit of 1.800 mu g L-1. Relative standard deviation (R. S.D) for 8 replicate determinations and the enrichment factor (EF)-, were 2.050% and 86, respectively. Finally, the proposed method was applied successfully to pre-concentration and determination of the analyte in environmental water and herbal samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"In this work, we study the indentation deformation of a Cu47.5Zr19Hf28.5Al5 bulk-metallic glass-matrix composite and characterize the effects of the indentation-loading rate and the holding time at the peak-indentation load. For the same peak-indentation load, increasing the holding time and/or decreasing the indentation-loading rate cause the increase of the indentation depth. There exists the ""bulge"" of the unloading curve at the onset of the unloading for small indentation-loading rates. The Vickers hardness is a monotonically increasing function of the indentation-loading rate for the same peak-indentation load. For the indentations with the same loading and unloading time of 30 s and without an intermediate stage at the peak-indentation load, the Vickers hardness of the Cu47.5Zr19Hf28.5Al5 bulk-metallic glass-matrix composite decreases with the increase of the indentation load. The strain energy dissipated through plastic deformation during the indentation is a power-law function of the indentation load with a power index of 3/2, and the energy ratio (total energy/plastic energy) linearly increases with the depth ratio (residual indentation depth/maximum indentation depth).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"Tin monoxide is a kind of IV-VI metal monoxides that has attracted great deal of attention due to its wide optical band gap and high field effect mobility in the past decade. On the other hand, nanoshell is a unique porous structure. Its curved shell provides a shelter for the hollow core, as well as a much bigger special surface area. We in this study systematically prepared SnO nanoshells through a facile self-assembly method under different annealing conditions. The lithium ion batteries were fabricated immediately based on the as prepared nanoshells. The capacity of as fabricated lithium ion batteries was 559.3 mAhg(-1) at rate performance of 0.1 Ag-1 and 497.5 mAhg(-1) at 1 Ag-1 in 30th cycle. This work exhibited high application performance of SnO nanoshells. We hope this work will help study similar structure and applications of IV-VI metal monoxides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"Different glomerular diseases are associated with various neoplasms. It seems obvious that Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP) induced nephrotic syndrome is rare. In this regard, the present article introduces a patient suffering from nephrotic syndrome associated with CUP. Patient is a 65-year-old non-smoker male who referred to the clinic for one-month generalized edema. The patient was also complaining from coughing and bulky yellowish sputum with no signs of blood. Patient's chest radiography revealed pulmonary pleural effusion of the left lung, but no other pathological findings were revealed. Patient's cytology report of pleural fluid indicated metastatic carcinoma, and therefore, the patient needed additional examinations so that the origin of metastases (lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, etc.) could be detected. Finally, chemotherapy treatments began when the patient was diagnosed with Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP). With the continuation of chemotherapy treatment and follow-up after more than a year of treatment, the patient is now generally well-off; his nephrotic syndrome has also been in remission parallel to chemotherapy. Significant point in the treatment of this patient is proteinuria, hypercholesterolemia and hyponatremia remission in two stages of chemotherapy. These findings suggest probable para-neoplastic nephrotic syndrome. The treatment of paraneoplastic is the treatment of underlying cause.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"Certain 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazolines bind at 5-HT3 serotonin receptors and act as antagonists (e.g. 6-chloro) whereas others bind with little to no affinity and lack functional activity (e.g. 8-chloro). The purpose of this investigation was to gain insight as to why this might be the case. X-Ray crystallographic studies revealed that the N-C-N distances in the examined analogs are nearly identical (1.31-1.34 angstrom), suggesting that differences in N-C-N delocalization does not account for differences in affinity/action. Homology modeling hydrophatic interactions (HINT) analysis revealed that the 6-chloro analog formed a greater number, and more favorable, interactions with the receptor, whereas the 8-chloro analog formed fewer, and unfavorable, interactions. The affinity and activity of the 6-chloro quinazoline relative to its 8-chloro counterpart are unrelated to the N-C-N delocalization pattern but might be related to specific (favorable and unfavorable) interactions of quinazoline substituents with certain receptor features as determined by HINT analysis.

28,"In this paper, a diamine ligand having an electron-withdrawing oxadiazole in its molecular structure was designed. With the help from an auxiliary ligand PPh3, its Cu(I) complex was synthesized and analyzed, including single crystal structure, electronic transitions and photophysical features. A distorted tetrahedral coordination field was adopted by this Cu(I) complex which experienced intense geometric distortion. To limit this excited state geometric distortion and consequently improve its emissive performance, this Cu(I) complex was dispersed and immobilized into a polymer rigid framework through electrospinning method. A detailed analysis on the photophysical parameters of solid sample, solution sample and electrospinning fibrous samples suggested that polymer immobilization was highly effective in limiting excited state geometric distortion. Dopant molecules were dispersed and immobilized in polymer's rigid and protective microenvironment. In this case, their geometric distortion was effectively limited, showing improved photophysical performance, such as emission blue shift, long-lived emissive center and better photostability.

29,"Infrared spectra of the photochemical products of bis(cyclopentadienyl)dicarbonyl titanium, TiCp2(CO)(2), isolated in an Ar matrix and a N-2 matrix were measured. UV-irradiation of TiCp2(CO)(2) produced TiCp2(CO) in the Ar matrix, and three types of nitrogen-containing compounds, TiCp2(CO)(N-2), TiCp2(N-2), and TiCp2(N-2)(2) were produced in the N-2 matrix. The yields of the species changed with the duration of UV-irradiation. Annealing of the sample resulted in the disappearance of unstable TiCp2(N-2) and an increase of TiCp2(N-2)(2). Isotope shifts of the infrared spectra were measured using N-15(2) to confirm the assignments. The structures of the species were estimated using a double hybrid density functional theory calculation (mPW2PLYP/cc-pVTZ), and the calculated infrared frequencies were in very good agreement with the experimentally measured spectra.

30,"We report the complete recover of ketones from their corresponding hydrazones under UV-radiation. A series of -CH3, -H and -NO2 p-substituted acetophenone hydrazones was prepared and subjected to irradiation experiments using UV light (254 nm) in CCl4, CHCl3 and CH2Cl2. The process was monitored by UV-VIS and 1D/2D NMR spectra. The recovery time was found to be profoundly affected by the halogenation degree of the solvent with the shortest times observed for CCl4. Small fluctuations in recovery times were observed for the distinct substituents, but no clear trend could be stablished. In CCl4, the recovery time is essentially independent of the substituent. Additionally, NMR spectra showed that the process goes to completion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the recovery time is closely related to the bond dissociation enthalpy for the C-Cl bond. Based on these observations, a mechanism was proposed and analyzed by DFT calculations. Al the reactions involved presented activation energies much bellow the energy required to break the C-Cl bond. Therefore, the C-Cl bond breaking is identified as the rate determining step. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"Butanols can be incorporated as biofuels in gasoline. As a consequence, the thermodynamic behaviour in the blend of the different type of accompanying hydrocarbons (paraffins, cycloparaffins, olefins, aromatics) should be explored. Being a multicomponent mixture the best testing ground for checking prediction is the generation of the ternary systems made up of combinations of representatives of the indicated hydrocarbons two by two with alcohols. This paper reports the isothermal vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) at 313.15 K of the two remaining ternaries of an overall comprehensive study involving 1- or 2-butanol. A recognized accurate static technique consisting of an isothermal total pressure cell has been used for the measurements (Van Ness apparatus). Data were reduced using Barker's method together with Wilson equation, as excess Gibbs energy model, enabling the determination of all phase equilibrium properties. Starting from our new data we complete the study by discussing the ternary prediction from four model equations by Wohl, Wilson, NRTL and UNIQUAC commonly used. Parameters fed by their constituent binaries reported in previous papers conclude that Wilson model provides the best result in both of our ternary systems.

33,"Biomass resources are widely available and stored as green renewable energy, but biomass power generation (BPG) technology is rarely used in stand-alone microgrid (SAMG) systems in remote areas. In this paper, a two-mode optimal control scheme for biomass/wind/diesel/storage independent microgrid system is proposed, which includes economic operation scheduling under normal operation and emergency power control under large disturbances, based on the operation characteristics of distributed power supply. Diesel generating unit runs near the base point of higher power generation efficiency, absorbs the instantaneous fluctuation of net load, and provides the reserve capacity for system operation. The fluctuating output of the apparent net load of biomass power generation system can effectively cooperate with wind power to generate electricity and improve the permeability of renewable energy. A new control method of battery energy storage system (BESS) is proposed, which gives priority to emergency power control, followed by peak shaving and valley filling, reduces the allocation requirement of energy storage capacity and optimizes operation conditions. Aiming at an independent microgrid system in a remote community, simulation studies are carried out from two aspects, namely, quasi-steady-state-based system operation economy and transient stability in typical operation scenarios. The results show that the method is effective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles were prepared via the alcohol-solution combustion process, the morphology and magnetic property of them were investigated by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the transmission electron microscope (TEM), the X-ray diffraction (XRD), the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The as-prepared magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles calcined at 400 degrees C for 2 h with absolute alcohol of 30 mL were characterized with the average nanoparticle size of around 30 nm and the specific magnetization (Ms) of 14.7 emu/g. The adsorption characteristics of reactive blue (RB) from aqueous solutions onto Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles were investigated by UV spectroscopy at room temperature; the adsorption kinetics data were in good agreement with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model in the initial RB concentrations of 100-400 mg/L. Compared with Langrnuir and Freundlich models, the Temkin model (correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.9998) could be used to evaluate the adsorption isotherm of RB onto the magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles at room temperature, which revealed that the adsorption of RB onto the magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles was a hybrid of monolayer and multilayer adsorbing mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"A DFT investigation was performed to evaluate the structure, electronic properties of the doped graphene, and the adsorption behavior of C2H2 and H-2 on the graphene sheet. Two kinds of doping scenarios are considered, namely dopants into pristine graphene and vacancy graphene. It is observed that the doping energy is negative for dopant (N, P, S) into vacancy graphene at pyridinictype site, yet it is positive at graphitic-type site for pristine graphene. It could be inferred that the introducing process is exothermic reaction for defective graphene. Meanwhile, for the adsorption of C2H2 on the surface of defective graphene, we notice that C2H2 would prefer to be adsorbed at the top site of the doping atom and the adsorption energy increases with the introducing of dopants, indicating that the dopant would enhance the interaction between C2H2 and graphene. Regarding hydrogen molecule, the dopant has less promotion effect on the adsorption. Moreover, the graphene plays a role of electron donor while the gas molecule (C2H2/H-2) is the electron acceptor when it is adsorbed. For the co-adsorption, the C2H2 is privileged to interact with the graphene and the pre-adsorbed C2H2 on doped graphene would weaken the opportunity of the uptake of H-2 molecule. We anticipate that our results would provide information to design the optimized catalysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"The surface phonon dispersion of a deuterium-terminated Si(110)-(1 x 1) surface [D:Si(110)-(1 x 1)] is investigated by using high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) with the local density approximation (LDA). The characteristics of D:Si(110)-(1 x 1) are unique compared to those of H:Si(110)-(1 x 1) (Matsushita et al., 2015) in terms of the resolved vibrational modes. By the HREELS, one-dimensional surface phonons consisting of D-Si stretching vibrations are observed above the bulk-phonon band energy edge of 64.5 meV. Ten modes are observed below this value, classified as surface, surface resonant, and bulk phonons according to the calculated energy dispersion as well as the depth profile of spectral density and displacement vectors. In particular, five D Si bending modes are observed out of the seven theoretically predicted modes. The bending modes are strongly coupled with the displacements across the D and five Si layers. The DFT-LDA surface phonon dispersion is in good agreement with the experimental results except a few frequency/dispersion mismatches, as the structure optimized by DFT-LDA mismatches with the previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results (Matsushita et al., 2015). D:Si(110)-(1 x 1) elucidates the nature of covalently bonded phonons and their characteristics both experimentally and theoretically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,"A real-time regulating CO2 supply strategy based on pH value was introduced into industrial Haematococcus pluvialis cultivation modules to enhance the accumulation of astaxanthin and lipids. Compared to the group with constant influent CO2 concentration, astaxanthin and lipids content of the group with stable pH value adjusted by floating CO2 supply increased by 93% and 9%, respectively. Lipids from H. pluvialis, which contained 63.6% of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid, could be a considerable biodiesel feedstock. The presence of astaxanthin in lipids also improved the performance of biodiesel in many aspects. Lipids transesterification efficiency with astaxanthin increased to 1.4 times as that without astaxanthin. Crystallization temperature of biodiesel with astaxanthin (-7 degrees C) was 4.7 degrees C lower than that without astaxanthin. Thermal analysis indicated that the presence of astaxanthin might avail to enhance biodiesel thermostability, which increased the pyrolysis temperature to 212.6 degrees C and increased the activation energy to 84.8 kJ/mol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The autogenous shrinkage of high-performance cementitious matrix materials with different incorporation of GNPs was also researched with water to cement ratio of 0.25, 0.30 and 0.35. According to hydration heat, hydration products, microstructure and porosity of GNPs cementitious matrix materials, the microcosmic mechanism for autogenous shrinkage was also investigated. It was testified that moderate addition of GNPs decreased the autogenous shrinkage of cement-based composites.

Here we study, as a function of Bi-doped Si film thickness, the evolution and ultimate removal of lattice defects that are associated with a recently demonstrated viable route to precisely incorporate Bi dopants in homoepitaxial Si thin films. Scanning tunneling microscopy imaging reveals how the elongated defect structures in the Si lattice, originating from prefabricated Bi nanolines on the substrate surface that are the source of the Bi dopants, evolve with increasing Si overlayer thickness. Moreover, we demonstrate that a prolonged low-temperature annealing is able to annihilate these defect structures while leaving a significant Bi dopant concentration in the Si films.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

43,"Poor aqueous solubility of some minor steviol glycosides (SGs) has prevented their potential widespread usage as non-nutritional high intensity sweeteners in beverage industry. Rebaudioside B (reb B) is one of the minor SGs found in stevia leaf, and has a better taste quality than many of the major SGs. However, reb B suffers from poor aqueous solubility and low dissolution rate, which greatly limits its application, especially in beverages. In our effort to enhance its solubility by using natural means, we discovered that under certain conditions reb B forms hemihydrate crystal, which has much lower solubility and dissolution rate than commercial powder reb B product. The crystal was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). This may offer more insight into the interaction of SGs with water at molecular level, and therefore provide new guidance on current efforts to enhance the solubility of SGs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

45,"The formation of mesostructured polymer and carbon single-crystals is very difficult due to increased complexity of the energy hypersurface and the role of slowed-down kinetics. Here we reported the synthesis of ordered mesostructured phloroglucinol-formaldehyde single crystals through mesoscale self-assembly of reactive monomicelles under acidic conditions which were traditionally thought very difficult to control the morphology because of the rapid polymerization rate. Polymeric and carbon single crystals from unusual curved hexagonal rods and spindles with two-dimensional hexagonal mesostructures, to previously unreported lozenge single-crystal sheets with lamellar mesostructures were obtained. Contrary to the literature reports, the lamellar mesostructured lozenge single-crystal sheets were successfully transformed to graphene-like layered carbons after calcination under 800 degrees C, and they can be further exfoliated into unprecedented high-quality single-layered carbon nanoribbons. These results unambiguously expanded our understanding about mesocrystals, and opened up new avenues for the efficient production of single-layered carbon nanoribbons which possess promising applications in electrochemical devices.

47,"Conventional dissociation-enhanced lanthanide (Ln(3+)) fluoroimmunoassays (DELFIAs) using Ln(3+) chelate-labeled antibodies as molecular probes exhibit limited sensitivity because of their relatively low Ln(3+) labeling ratio per biomolecule. Herein, we applied gold nanoflowers (AuNFs) as amplified nanocarriers to increase the Ln(3+) labeling ratio in a single molecular binding event for improving the sensitivity of traditional DELFIA. Two thiolated amphiphilic ligands (thiolated ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and thiolated acylhydrazine-terminated ligands), consisting of a hydrophobic alkane chain, oligo(ethylene glycol) unit, and functional terminal of the EDTA or acylhydrazine group, were designed for the surface modification of AuNFs. The resultant ligand-coated AuNFs exhibited dual functions of Ln(3+) chelation via the EDTA group and oriented attachment of antibodies via the acylhydrazine group. By utilizing 80 nm AuNFs as amplified carriers, we demonstrated that the maximum Eu3+ loading amount reached 1.07 x 10(4) Eu3+ ions per AuNF, which is approximately two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of traditional molecular probes, thereby amplifying the luminescence signal and enhancing the sensitivity of DELFIA. By combining a magnetic-mediated sandwich-type DELFIA method, the designed amplified AuNF nanoprobes achieved an ultrasensitive luminescence detection of Cronobacter muytjensii with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 x 10(2) cfu mL(-1) in a powdered infant formula. This LOD value was ca. 230-fold lower than that of the traditional colorimetric immunoassay. The designed signal amplification strategy using bifunctional ligand-modified AuNFs as enhanced Ln(3+) nanocarriers provided a huge potential for building various ultrasensitive luminescence immunoassays for in vitro biodetection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For substance characterizations FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analysis were used. The crystal structures of the synthesized compounds were determined using X-ray powder diffraction technique. The neutral complexes had specific system of intermolecular contacts in the crystals that allowed distinguishing two forms, A and B. Despite of the similar structure and sizes, trans[Pt(C2H5NH2)(2)Cl-2] and trans-[Pd(C2H5NH2)(2)Cl-2] complexes created different hydrogen bond networks and crystal structures. The first had a grid topology of 3(6) with the cells from three and the second - 4(4) from four complexes. It resulted in different thermal behavior. Trans- [Pt(C2H5NH2)(2)Cl-2]-A demonstrated irreversible solid state transition into B-form at 165 degrees C and got new H-bond system with the topology similar to the palladium analog (4 4 ), however, the realized complex arrangement was significantly different. The structure of B-form was stable until the decomposition at 220 degrees C. High-temperature X-ray diffraction demonstrated high elasticity of the H-bond network in trans-[Pd(C2H5NH2)(2)Cl-2]-A. Notwithstanding significant alterations during heating, the H-bond system returns the structure to its initial state. The interpretation of structural transformation was proposed. The H-bond network formation was influenced by the dynamic properties of the molecules. For the platinum compound, the option with more dense molecular packing occurred. For palladium, the atomic mass distribution was responsible for a larger molecular volume and for a more symmetrical packing. Thermal decomposition of both compounds occurred with simultaneous separation of the halogen and amminoalkyl particles resulting in a low-temperature reduction of the metal and the formation of nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 5 -10 nm.

54,"Structural and dynamic properties and molecular relaxation processes in crystalline sodium NaClO4 perchlorate in the temperature range from 300 K to 650 K were studied by Raman spectroscopy. The temperature dependences of the position of the maximum v (frequency), the width w and the intensity I of the spectral band, corresponding to the fully symmetric vibration v(1)(A) of the ClO4-1 perchlorate ion, in the spectral range from 933 cm(-1) to 944 cm(-1) were analyzed. The frequency v and intensity I decrease, and the width w increases with the increasing temperature. It is shown that these temperature dependences have certain features at a temperature of 460 K. With a further increase in temperature, the frequency v decreases more rapidly, the width w increases, and the intensity I decreases more intensively. In the temperature range from 460 K to the temperature T-str = 581 K of the first order structural phase transition, we observe a deviation of the temperature dependence of the frequency and width from the linear dependences characteristic of lower temperatures. These deviations appear at a temperature of 460 K and increase with the increasing temperature and approaching the phase transition temperature. It has been established that in the crystalline sodium perchlorate NaClO4 a structural first-order phase transition is stretched.

55,"A method for calculating the most likely product compositions of athermal mixture separation in complex distillation systems, including systems of simple recycling and non-recycling columns, complex columns with side sampling, systems with joint heat flows, and others. The method is based on an extended version of the maximum entropy principle. The informational entropy of complex experiment involving conditional entropy and conditional probabilities is used as the like-lihood criterion. The adopted axiomatic allows one to obtain the most probable component distributions in the product flows of the system, which corresponds to the complex experience maximum entropy in accordance with the balance restrictions. It has been demonstrated that athermal properties accounting of the mixture create dependencies that include entropic activity coefficients associated with the conditional entropy in a typical thermodynamics form. Dependencies are a special case of the correlations obtained for ideal mixtures. The method for calculating the entropy activity coefficients as functions of the components molecule relative volumes and the mixture molar composition has been provided. This method is focused on the design version of the distillation system calculation. It allows to determine the parameters characterizing the process length (the number of theoretical separation steps in the non-selective mode) and the product flow composition products under the product quality restrictions. The accounting of mixture athermal nature leads to an increased duration of the process and has a slight impact on the product compositions.

Their alternating current impedance characteristics, under various frequencies, were measured and studied as a function of temperature in the range 200 to 400 K. Both the real (Z') and imaginary (Z '') parts of the complex impedance were temperature dependent. It was apparent that the Z ''-Z' curve for all temperatures exhibited single semicircles. The center of these semicircles was below the Z' axis. With temperature increment, the diameter of the semicircles decreased. The characteristics of the semicircular curve indicated that the parallel resistance (R-p) and constant phase element (CPE) in parallel combination with the series resistance (R-s) should be appropriate for the equivalent electrical circuit model for the produced heterojunctions. Through simulation, the value of R-s at 200 K was found to be 5.04 x 10(3) Omega, and fell to 252.05 Omega at 400 K. Also, the value of R-p was 1.34 x 10(7) Omega at 200 K and decreased to 3.37 x 10(5) Omega at 400 K.

The results of current density-voltage (J-V) curves justified a large leakage current along with minimal response under illumination. A recombination process controls the mechanism for carrier portage in the zone of V <= 0.16 V, while a space-charge-limited current process governs the carrier portage mechanism in the circumstance of V value beyond 0.16 V. Frequency (f) dependent conductance (G/omega)-V and capacitance (C)-V curves were measured to extract the series resistance (R-s) and density of the interface state (N-ss).

With zero bias voltage applied, the value of R-s was 189.84 Omega at 2 MHz and rose to 715.10 Omega at 20 kHz. The acquired R-s may be attributable to the occurrence of R-s in the neutral zones as well as Ohmic contact.

Oxygen was introduced during the sputtering process to prevent the reduction of transmittance and the formation of nonstoichiometric compositions. The dependence of the optical and electrical properties of MTO thin films on the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio was systematically investigated. The transmittance of the MTO single layer (24 nm) at 550 nm gradually increased from 85.9% to 88.2% with an increase of the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio from 0% to 7.9%. The optical band gap was also affected by the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio, varying from 3.30 to 3.64 eV. The MTO film deposited at an O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio of 2.7% showed the minimum resistivity (0.03 Omega . cm). The XPS spectra indicated that the SnO2 thin films become almost stoichiometric as the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio increased.

In this study, pattern visibility was examined by comparing the differences in the color and reflectance of oxide/metal/oxide multilayers before and after adding the PDMS and MTO IMLs. In addition, the effects of the PDMS dilution ratio on the electrical and optical characteristics were also investigated. The MTO/Ag/MTO/PDMS/MTO multilayer films showed high transmittance (>86% at 550 nm) except at the dilution ratio of 1:50. As the PDMS dilution ratio increased from 1:50 to 1:200, the reflectance difference (Delta R) increased from 0.08% to 0.35% and the color difference (Delta b*) increased from 0.31 to 1.23. The maximum resistance changes of the multilayer films were 0.126% and 0.124% after outer and inner bending, respectively, for 10,000 cycles with a radius of curvature of 4 mm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"Recently, better understanding of nano-area is required for 5 nm or less technology node. In particular, the high contact resistance generated in a nano-area significantly degrades the device performance. In this study, we propose a direct contact resistance measurement method without a test structure by separate processes to improve the nano-area contact resistance. The nano-area contact resistance of Ti-Ti and Cu-Cu decreased from 6.46 M Omega to 1.08 M Omega and from 3.78 M Omega to 1.48 M Omega, respectively, when the metal line and native layer formed on the surface were removed. In addition, it is confirmed that the contact resistance decreased with an increase in bonding strength in the case of nano-area homo-metal contact. However, the contact resistance is affected by the tunneling effect and bond energy according to the distance between the first layers of atoms in the case of nano-area hetero-metal contact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"There is an urgent need for in situ methods for detecting environmental pollution quickly and accurately. With the development of nanotechnology, a huge potential has been created for the design of highly sensitive sensors with low energy consumption and low costs. If a composite material constructed with carbon nanotubes is used as an electrode in contact with a contaminant, this material undergoes an oxidation-reduction reaction with the contaminant that allows the electrode to function as an electrochemical sensor. This study involved the application of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and modified working electrodes constructed with multi-walled carbon nanotube composites (Ag- and ZnO-multi-walled carbon nanotubes) as electrochemical sensors. These electrodes have good response speed and sensitivity at low concentrations, and they are reusable. To lower the price of these sensors, our goal was to maximize their sensitivity by using the low-cost multi-walled carbon nanotubes in conjunction with silver electroless plating of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotube composites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

67,"Water repelling, perfluorinated, polyanilines and their composites with multi-wall carbon nanotubes are synthesized using interfacial polymerization in either flake-like or fibrillar shapes. This class of polyanilines exhibits electrochemical activity, capacitive behaviour, and a contact angle of 119-125 degrees with water. The addition of multi-wall carbon nanotubes facilitates the control of the polymer morphology and increases the specific capacitance of the material. We obtained microfibers or flake-like morphologies depending on the amount of multiwall carbon nanotubes added in the organic phase and through cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge, we evaluated the effect of the backbone geometry and the addition of nanotubes on the electrochemical properties of the composites and the pristine polymers. The capacitance of the linear 3-perfluoroctyl polyaniline is consistently better than the cross-linked 4-perfluoroctyl polyaniline, where the para position relative to the amine group is blocked by fluorocarbon chains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present paper considers the simple nonlinear chemical feedback model for standard glycolytic route with prototype autocatalytic steps. Quadratic S + P reversible arrow 2P. Cubic S + 2P reversible arrow 3P. We couple these steps to get the mixed quadratic-cubic model but remarkable array of complex behavior and oscillatory patterns as expected on coupling is surprisingly missing. The observation is in conformity with natural glycolytic alternatives like the Entner-Doudoroff (ED), and phosphoketolase pathways found in Archaea - Thermoproteustenax and other prokaryotes. The fundamental and the practical implications of our findings are thoroughly discussed with pilot calculations and numerical simulations supported via non-linear dynamic analysis. A basic kinetic scheme is suggested for natural glycolytic alternative, ED pathway with its comparison and contrast to other standard routes for glucose metabolism.

71,"Mg and Mg-system alloys are the materials of choice among hydrogen energy storage media due to their high hydrogen storage capacity (7.6 wt.%) and lighter weight (Huot, J., et al., 1999. Structural study and hydrogen sorption kinetics of ball-milled magnesium hydride. Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 293, pp. 495-500). However, the formation of hydrogen products at high temperatures, the phenomenon of rapid alloy deterioration, and the low rate of reaction in the hydriding and dehydriding processes have been the main hindrances to commercialization of these alloys for hydrogen storage. In this study, to increase the reaction rate with hydrogen, Mg-Al-Zn-CaO-H-x hydrogen storage alloys were fabricated HIMA (Seok, S., et al., 2005. Evaluations of microstructure and hydrogenation properties on Mg2NiHx. Transactions of the Korean Hydrogen and New Energy Society, 16(3), pp. 238-243). The Alloying times of 72 and 96 h and BCR of 30: 1 and 66: 1 were used for the HIMA process; the rotation speed was fixed at 200 rpm and the hydrogen pressure was 3 Mpa. SEM was used to confirm the shape of the particles. The crystal structure of the synthesized materials was analyzed by XRD, and BET measurements were performed to determine the correlation between the BCR and specific surface area. The weight change of the composite material was measured by TGA, and the kinetics was evaluated to determine the hydrogen adsorption rate (at 150, 250, and 350 degrees C).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"In this paper, the Wigner-Kirkwood quantum theory and the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) effective diameter method in Classical DFT are employed to account for the effects of quantum corrections on the Helmholtz free energy of bulk and confined fluids. Initially, experimental data are exploited toward accurate prediction of pressure-volume isotherms and vapor-liquid equilibrium in bulk fluids. In the second part, the effects of quantum correction on the structure and thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in slit pores are investigated. Our results show that quantum effects may come into account by considering the effective size of the particles and also intermolecular interaction which both of them have direct effects on the density distribution of molecules in the slit pore. Furthermore, the excess adsorption of fluids at a fixed bulk density is shown to increase with quantum effect, but this trend is reversed with increasing wall fluid interaction because of the entropy and energy effects. Also, it is found that the excess adsorption and interfacial tension of the fluid against the solid surface of fluids exhibit oscillatory behaviors with maximum and minimum values for half integer and integer values of pore width. This oscillatory behavior disappears at high values of pore width with increasing quantum effect. Another finding of the present study indicates that the interfacial tensions of the fluid against the solid surface for a classical fluid are negative but quantum effect increases it and shifts its sign to positive. Finally, it is shown that the locus of phase transition is shifted toward higher bulk densities as a result of increasing quantum effect. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The ligand was obtained via reduction of the corresponding thiosemicarbazone of glyoxylic acid by borohydride. The structure of the synthesized nickel complex coordination compounds has been studied by the methods of IR and electronic absorption spectrometry, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetry. The molecular structure of the complex 1 has been characterized by crystal X-ray diffraction. X-ray diffraction studies have shown that the Ni(C3H6N3O2S)(2) (1) complex is mononuclear, in which the coordination around the metal is octahedral coordination geometry of nickel, made up of two sulfur atoms of thiolic, two nitrogen atoms of the azomethine group and two oxygen atoms of carboxylate from two ligands.

77,"Along with the increase in the demand for existing colored concrete, the demand for secondary concrete products of various colors is also increasing. However, the initial surplus water in mortar causes the internal calcium component to leach out and contaminate the surface, and the hardening of concrete that contains pigment is generally slower than that of normal concrete. This study was to evaluate the physical properties of mortar colored by carbon amino silica black (CASB), using a methyl cellulose (MC) polymer to reduce surface efflorescence and increase early strength by means of steam curing. MC modifies the mechanical properties of mortar by forming a polymer film, which prevents the soluble calcium from migrating to the surface and reduces whitening in steam cured mortar. However, steam curing significantly decreased the strength with increasing MC content when CASB content was high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"The electrolyte of lithium secondary batteries is an important component. Among lithium secondary batteries, the lithium polymer battery, which has similar performance to the lithium secondary battery, is made of a solid polymer electrolyte. Lithium ions in a solid polymer electrolyte exist in the form of a solution by a polar group in a polymer matrix. Lithium ions in the solid polymer electrolyte migrate via the segmental motion of the polymer. That is, the properties of a polymer matrix in a solid polymer electrolyte can affect the conduction of lithium ions. Therefore, this study focused on the electrochemical properties of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer-based solid polymer electrolyte. For this, poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer-based solid polymer electrolytes, which have spherical micelles, and various sizes of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer micelle, were prepared. Amino acids were added to the poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer-based solid polymer electrolyte as an ion dissociator to assist in the dissociation of a lithium salt and increase the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolyte.

79,"Light Emitting Diodes (LED) are highly energy efficient and offer long-life times for display applications. Long life and minimal energy consumption are often the most attractive advantages for electronic devices. Because LEDs are based on compound semiconductors, which explore the direct transition between the conduction and valance band edges, thermal energy loss can be minimized during operation. However, even though these types of LEDs are based on direct transition type semiconductors, thermal energy is still emitted during operation owing to forward conduction and reverse leakage currents. This research proposes capturing this energy loss through thermoelectric module-based energy recycling methods to improve the energy efficiency of LED applications, achieving savings of up to 18%.

Moreover, ZnO nanorods (NR1) obtained on the seed layer prepared by oxidation of Zn films exhibited the faster growth rate than those (NR2) synthesized on the seed layer prepared by spin-coating method due to having access to a sufficient amount of Zn2+ ions. The ZnO nanorods obtained at a precursor concentration of 0.025 M exhibited the highest photocurrent, dark current, and photoresponsivity, with the photoresponsivity and photosensitivity of ZnO NR1 exceeding those of ZnO NR2, owing to the larger surface area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,"Magnesium hydride has a high hydrogen storage capacity (7.6 wt.%), and is cheap and lightweight, thus advantageous as a hydrogen storage alloy. However, Mg-based hydrides undergo hydrogenation/dehydrogenation at high temperature and pressure due to their thermodynamic stability and high oxidation reactivity.

On the other hand, carbon materials have been mainly studied in the field of hydrogen storage with high specific surface area and lightweight properties; however, results show that they cannot store a large amount of hydrogen.

Vickers hardness of Al6061, Al6063 and Cu decreases as annealing time decreases; however, that of the interface between Al alloys and Cu increases with an annealing time of 1 h, and then decreases as annealing time increases further. The growth of a diffusion layer in Al6063/Cu is larger than that in Al6061/Cu, because the activation energy in the Al6063/Cu is lower than that in Al6061/Cu during the annealing process. Cracking of the diffusion layer occurs by annealing for extended periods of time in both materials, which contributes to the decrease in hardness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

84,"Breast nuclear medicine imaging has gradually become a supplemental method for detection of mammographically occult cancer in dense breasts. However, mammary glands and ducts are highly sensitive to radiation; the absorbed dose to glandular tissue may increase the risk of secondary breast cancer. Therefore, accurate suborgan breast dosimetry for breast nuclear medicine imaging represents an important issue. In this study, a series of anthropomorphic software breast phantoms (ASBPs) with various volumes and glandularitles were built. The realism of the ASBPs was assessed by using the two-dimensional projection and fractal dimension (FD) analysis. Breast self S values and suborgan S values for F-18 and Tc-99(m) were simulated using the Monte Carlo technique. The projected images of the ASBPs were similar to clinical mammograms in tissue distribution and image contrast. The mean FD value for the ASBPs was 2.23. The maximum differences between the breast self S values of ASBPs and OLINDA/EXM for (18)( ) and Tc-99(m) were -14.4% and -16.7%, respectively. For the breast suborgan S values, the maximum ratios between the S value from gland to gland S(g <- g) and the S value from breast to breast S(1).-b) were 4.84 for F-18 and 3.60 for Tc-99(m). The mean ratios between the S value from gland to duct S(d <- g) and that from gland to gland S(g <- g) were 0.296 for F-18 and 0.356 for Tc-99m.

86,"A study of the effect of the nature of the plasticizer on the characteristics (lower detection limit and selectivity) of electrodes that are reversible to carbonate, hydrogen phosphate, sulfate, selenate, selenite, sulfite, molybdate, tungstate, and thiosulfate ions was carried out. It was found that the membranes of carbonate and hydrophosphate selective electrodes based on quaternary ammonium salts are preferable to plasticize with o-nitrophenyl decyl ether, membranes of sulfate, selenate, selenite-selective electrodes - 1-bromonaphthalene, sulfite, molybdate, tungstate, and thiosulfate selective electrodes - dibutyl phthalate. For sulfate, selenate, and selenite-selective electrodes, there is an improvement in selectivity and a decrease in the detection limit in the series: o-nitrophenyldecyl ether - dibutylphthalate approximate to didecylphthalate approximate to bis (ethylhexyl) sebacinate -1-bromonaphthalene. The replacement of o-nitrophenyldecyl ether with 1-bromonaphthalene leads to a decrease in logK(Pot) for these electrodes by 0.2-1.0 orders of magnitude depending on the interfering ion. The detection limit for sulfate, selenate, and selenite-selective electrodes is reduced by 0.2-0.65 orders of magnitude. For carbonate and hydrogen phosphate selective electrodes from o-nitrophenyldecyl ether to 1-bromonaphthalene, the detection limit decreases, for example, for a carbonate selective electrode by 0.6 orders of magnitude, for a hydrogen phosphate selective electrode by 1 order; the values of logK(Pot) (CO32-, j) decrease by 0.1-0.9 orders of magnitude, and the values of logK(Pot) (HPO42-, j) decrease by 0.6-1.25 orders of magnitude depending on the interfering ion. The results are explained in terms of the theories of Aigen-Denison-Ramzi-Fuoss and Born. The plasticizer that is optimal for carbonate and hydrophosphate selective electrodes has a large dielectric constant epsilon = 24; for all other electrodes, the optimal plasticizers have lower e values (epsilon = 5-6). The use of dibutyl phthalate and 1-bromonaphthalene membranes as plasticizers is consistent with the Aigen-Denison-Ramzi-Fuoss theory, and the use of o-nitrophenyldecyl ether with the Born theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"Background: Eusiderin A is a neolignan derivate, which makes up the majority of the secondary metabolite of Eusideroxylon zwageri. It has been reported as a potent biopesticide and antifungal agent. Previous studies on the oxidation of terminal methylene of the allylic chain in Eusiderin A have been able to produce primary alcohol, pinacol, and an aldehyde which demonstrated strong activity against plant pathogenic fungi, therefore activity against dermal fungi needs to be studied. Objective: The current study aims to improve the hydrophilicity of Eusiderin A via oxidation of the allylic chain in order to derive a potent antifungal property. Methods: Transformation of Eusiderin A has been achieved by using the Wacker Oxidation Method in combination with the a-Hydroxylation-Ketone Method to produce 7,3'-epoxy-8,4'-oxyneolignane-1'carboxylic acid. The structure of the 7,3'-epoxy-8,4'-oxyneolignane-1'-carboxylic acid was identified from spectroscopy data. The in vitro antifungal activity study was performed using the paper disc diffusion method against Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Results: New molecule of natural Eusiderin A through the oxidation of the allylic chain to increase the hydrophilicity of Eusiderin A has been designed. Based on the observed UV, IR, H-1 and C-13-NMR, and MS spectra, it can be stated that the 7,3'-epoxy-8,4'-oxyneolignane-1'-carboxylic acid has been formed. At a concentration of 50 ppm, this compound showed antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes.

88,"The spatial and electronic structure of 2-methyl-5,7-dinitrobenzo[d]oxazole, which is the substrate for the synthesis of hydride sigma-adducts, was studied by the DFT/B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ method. Analysis of the charges on the atoms showed that the largest positive NBO charge is concentrated on the carbon atom C-2 of the oxazole ring, while the carbon atoms C-4 and C-6 annelated benzene nucleus have the highest Mulliken charges both in the gas phase and in water. Thus, it has been established that a rigid base, a methoxide ion, is attached to the carbon atom C-2, which is a hard reaction center, and a reaction with a soft base, a hydride ion, can also proceed through softer reaction centers - carbon atoms of the benzene ring C-4 and C-6. The bond lengths calculated by the quantum-chemical method are in good agreement with the experimental data obtained by X-ray diffraction, which confirms the correctness of the choice of the quantum-chemical calculation method. New derivatives of 3-azabicyclo [3.3.1]nonane have been synthesized by Mannich condensation of 2-methyl-5,7-dinitrobenzo[d]oxazole hydride sigma-adduct with methylamine and beta-aminopropanoic acid. This method is distinguished by relative simplicity, availability of reagents and allows under mild conditions to transfer from the aromatic system activated by nitro groups to 3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives containing the nitro groups that are promising from the point of view of further functionalization. The structure of the compounds obtained was proved by IR, H-1-, C-13-, two-dimensional correlation NMR spectroscopy, as well as elemental analysis data.

Density functional theory calculations were used to find the activation barriers for the initial reaction of Zn, Ga, and In precursors with tris (trimethylsilyl)phosphine, and differences in reactivity between dissimilar metal precursors were revealed. The coordinations of the P precursor to Zn, In, and Ga precursors were found to differ significantly, depending on the coordination number and the ionic radius, and these results were consistent with reports that found that InZnP can be alloyed, but InGaP is not easily alloyed. The activation energies become close to each other when using thiol ligands with less steric hindrance in monodentate ligands. These results will lead to achieving precise composition control and great luminescence properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The observed pseudo first order rate constants for the substitution reactions obey the rate law k(obs) = k(2)[Nu]. The reactivity of the studied complexes depends on strength of pi-backbonding of the attached ligands, which is enhanced by the strong electron withdrawing nature of the carboxamide group on the non-leaving ligands of Pt(II) complexes. Quinoline moieties of Pt5 and Pt6 lie out-of-the square plane, resulting in enhanced reactivity due to the aided entrapment of the nucleophile by the non-planar groups of the ligand.

To make the solution and results more similar to the actual scenario, gas leakage rate from the pipeline fracture was investigated in the steady state flow and transient flow modes were assessed. The numerical results revealed that, as the pressure at the fracture point was equal to the atmospheric pressure, the Mach number was smaller than one. In the pipe model, as the length of the pipe was long and the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pipe was high, the Mach number tended to one and the gas leak rate to the sound speed. The main source of gas emission was divided into four main sections including, the pressure reducing stations, piping and branching and users' instruments. In this study, the findings were calculated using PHAST software.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"Vertical ablation, which is caused by oblique transmission geometry, was applied for high reproducible matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). In terms of desorption behavior of analytes and reproducibility of MALDI-MS measurements, comparative evaluations of this oblique transmission geometry with a reflection geometry were done in this paper. We found a large difference in laser ablation direction and amount of desorbed sample between these two irradiation techniques. This difference directs to drastic improvements of signal intensity and shot-to-shot reproducibility in mass spectra.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"In the present research, salting out and vortex assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on solidification of floating organic drop microextraction (SO-VADLLME-SFODME) for the extraction and determination of phenol and chlorophenols in water samples followed by HPLC have been studied through a novel, simple, low-cost, selectable and environment friendly (so called green) method. Three approaches have been combined in a way that their advantages have been used while reducing their deficiencies. The effects of various empirical parameters such as pH, type and volume of dispersive solvent, the volume of extracted organic solvent, salt concentration, the condition of centrifuge, and mixing time were studied and optimal conditions were achieved by using Mini-Tab software and Respond Surface Methodology (RSM) based upon Box-Behnken Design (BBD) and Desirability Function (DF). Under the optimum conditions, calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.1 to 1000 mu gL(-1), limit of detections (LODs) were in the range of 0.06 to 0.34 mu gL(-1) and r(2)>0.9916, respectively.

97,"Two types of nanoclusters were detected using DSC thermal analysis operating at -50 degrees C with liquid nitrogen. The formation of Cluster (1) was substantially suppressed by the formation of Cluster (2) during step quenching at 100 degrees C for 0.06 ks. The hardness increase was retarded for a period during two-step aging at 170 degrees C in the case of natural aging for 604.8 ks. The hardness decrease was determined to be due to the dissolution of nanoclusters in the early stage of two-step aging at 170 degrees C. On the other hand, hardness was directly increased in the step-quenched samples during multi-step aging at 170 degrees C. It is noted that Cluster (2) directly transforms into the strengthening phase. The bake hardening response is fairly enhanced by the formation of Cluster (2), which is formed by the step quenching process. It was confirmed that the step-quenched samples had a higher number of precipitates than the naturally-aged ones based on TEM images. The structure of the precipitate was identified to be the beta '' phase by analyzing HRTEM image.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,"This research deals with the investigation of adsorption characteristics of different types of composite coagulants-flocculants, combined by polyaluminum chloride (aluminum oxychloride) with organic polymer. The effect of this composite coagulants-flocculants on solution's turbidity removal and characteristics of cohesion and coagulation process have been studied too. On the basis of experimental data obtained the character and mechanism of cohesion and coagulation for different types of composite coagulants-flocculants were discussed. It was stated out that the adsorption isotherm of cationic composite coagulants-flocculants conforms to Langmuir adsorption law, and it characterized by monolayer adsorption parameters, which increases their ability to neutralize electric charge. The anionic composite coagulants-flocculants enhance the adsorption value and bridging ability with the help of organic polymers, showing multilayer adsorption characteristics. It was observed specifically, that under the same conditions the flocculation rate and sedimentation rate of composite coagulants-flocculants are higher than polyaluminum chloride has. This fact was explained by the advantages of organic polymer due to its long chain which is able to form larger floc within short time. The large floc has strong attractive potential energy for tiny particles, which make the opportunity of effective collision between particles what leads to sharply increased coagulation. The influence of storage time period on composite coagulants-flocculants coagulation effectiveness has been examined. The experimental results witness that the coagulation characteristics of reagents will be reduced to some extent after long-term storage, but composite coagulants-flocculants have advantages in this aspect over polyaluminum chloride. It should be concluded that, in general, the quality of composite coagulants-flocculants in relation to their stability remained at a high level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"We assess the performance of two different types of basis sets for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics at conical intersections. The basis sets of both types are generated using Ehrenfest trajectories of nuclear coherent states. These trajectories can either serve as a moving (time-dependent) basis or be employed to sample a fixed (time-independent) basis. We demonstrate on the example of two-state two-dimensional and three-state five-dimensional models that both basis set types can yield highly accurate results for population transfer at intersections, as compared with reference quantum dynamics. The details of wave packet evolutions are discussed for the case of the two-dimensional model. The fixed basis is found to be superior to the moving one in reproducing true nonlocal spreading and maintaining correct shape of the wave packet upon time evolution. Moreover, for the models considered, the fixed basis set outperforms the moving one in terms of computational efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And we also examined preservice chemistry teachers' perceptions of modeling in different audience groups. The participants of the study were 18 university students in the first grade of preservice chemistry teachers taking a general chemistry experiment course. They completed eleven topics of general chemistry experiment using argument-based modeling strategy. The understanding of chemistry concept was compared with the effect size of pre- and post-chemistry concept test scores.

A test consisting of three similar data sets regarding daily-life and scientific contexts was developed, and administered to 151 ninth graders. They were expected to construct proportional, inverse-proportional, and increasing and become constant form of graphs for each data set. Graphs constructed were analyzed in the aspects of constructing a trend line (types of a trend line, interpolation/extrapolation), selecting axes variables, scaling axes, and plotting points. Analyses of the results revealed that the students with set paradigm tended to construct a curved trend line, while those with point paradigm constructed a broken trend line in inverse-proportional graph questions. In the aspects of interpolation/extrapolation, most students with set paradigm performed both interpolation and extrapolation better than those with point paradigm in scientific context. Most students with set paradigm performed both interpolation and extrapolation regardless of contexts, while the proportion of interpolation of those with point paradigm was higher in scientific context than in daily-life context. In selecting axes variables, scaling axes, and plotting dots, there were no statistically significant differences between set and point paradigms.

The measurements of thermal cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C and 24-hour temperature cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C withstanding the effects of 20-hour penetration of 85 degrees C were carried out in CdS/CdTe solar cells with structures of FTO/CdS/CdTe/Au, FTO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, and FTO/MZO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, respectively. The performances of these cells before and after the thermal aging experiments were investigated by using light and dark I-V together with C-V. The results reveal varied performance degradation before and after thermal aging in the cells with different structures. Among these, the most deteriorated device is the one without back contact (BC), whose efficiency decreased by 25.12% after thermal cycling accompanying an obvious roll-over phenomenon when forward bias was greater than open circuit voltage. On the contrary, the reduction in the efficiency was about 16.80% in the case cells with BC, and the roll-over phenomenon was not so significant. Furthermore, for the devices with optimized front contact of FTO/MZO, the thermal stability was improved obviously. Interestingly, short-circuit current density associated with the carrier concentration of cells remained relatively small variations compared with the change of Voc and fill factor.

129,"Calix [4]arenes are macrocyclic compounds which can assume four main conformations (cone, partial cone, 1,2-alternate, and 1,3-alternate) driving their desired host-guest ability. Here we report a new polymorph of 25,26,27,28-tetrakis(methoxycarbonylmethoxy)calix [4]arene, which is present with two similar crystallographically independent molecules. These molecules are cone-shaped, in contrast to the 1,3-alternate conformation found in the previously known crystal form of the same compound. Our DFT calculations have also pointed out that the literature 1,3-alternate conformation is more stable than the cone one in the gas phase. Therefore, the higher energy cone conformation is assisted in the solid state by C-H center dot center dot center dot pi contacts, since these interactions occur only in the polymorph described here. We also reported in this study the simultaneous occurrence of two conformations in the crystal lattice of 5,11,17,23-tetra(p-fluoroaminobenzylidene)-25,26,27,28-tetrabutoxycalix [4]arene. Pinched cone conformations are assumed through either pi center dot center dot center dot pi or C-H center dot center dot center dot pi intramolecular contacts between phenyl rings of the upper rim substituents. These non-covalent contacts are responsible for pointing two alternate phenyl rings from the annulus and their interacted upper rim substituents inwards the cone cavity. DFT calculations reveal that these conformations have very similar energies, helping us to understand the conformerism phenomenon into the elucidated solid state form. Such conformerism found either in two distinct solid state forms or into a same one shows the high conformational complexity of simple calixarenes, which can be decisive to their desired host-guest properties.

132,"The nonpeptide small molecule, MES207, exhibits 17-fold preferential binding to the neuropeptide FF receptor 1 (NPFFR1) over NPFFR2 and shows antagonist functionality at NPFF receptors. In order to further the development of MES207 as a NPFFR1 probe, an UPLC-MS/MS bioanalytical method was developed and validated to quantify MES207 in rat plasma for a linearity range of 3-200 ng/mL. The method was applied in the analysis of the plasma, brain, and urine samples collected during pharmacokinetic studies in healthy male and female Sprague Dawley rats. The animals were dosed through oral gavage (50 mg/kg) and intravenously (2.5 mg/kg). Test samples were analyzed using the validated bioanalytical method to generate plasma concentration-time profiles. The results were further subjected to non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix 6.4 (R). MES207 exhibits a large volume of distribution (1.2 +/- 0.6 L), high clearance (0.8 +/- 0.1 L/h), and a poor oral bioavailability (1.7 +/- 0.4%).

134,"The Macroscopic Atom Model (MAM) is extended with the halogens to obtain formation enthalpies and molar volumes of halides. Molar volumes and electron densities were obtained with ab initio methods assuming a hypothetical metallic state. The electronegativity parameter and transformation enthalpy were obtained by linear extrapolation and regression analysis. Negative transformation enthalpies were introduced to obtain reliable values for the formation enthalpy of halides. Formation enthalpies of halides are computed within 25 kJ/mol.at and their molar volumes are underestimated by 20%. The MAM provides better estimates than models using Palling electronegativity or Born-Haber cycle calculations assuming an ionic lattice of the Born-Haber type. The inclusion of the halogens in the MAM scheme has extended its application to both alloys and ionic compounds. This model can now predict their formation enthalpies and molar volumes, which is not the case in all other electronegativity schemes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,"A mechanistic study on Rh-catalyzed synthesis of stereospecific Z-enamide from salicyladehydes and isoxazoles has been performed with DFT calculations. The aldehydic C-H bond activation was found directed by anionic phenolic group rather than neutral phenolic hydroxyl, which reasonably rationalizes the reversibility of the C-H bond activation. Direct ring-opening rather than N-O oxidative addition of isoxazole, and subsequent C-C reductive elimination generate the stable tripodal intermediate that has been demonstrated by LC-MS analysis. Finally, sequential amino and phenolic protonations of the tripodal species produce the product Z-enamide. Stereospecificity of Z-enamide can be attributed to the rigid carbon-carbon double bond formed by direct ringopening of isoxazole. The rate-determining process is found to include the directing ring-opening and C-N reductive elimination with an overall barrier of 26.7 kcal/mol. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

141,"Low-fat food products often contain natural, edible polymers to retain the desired mouth feel and elasticity of their full-fat counterparts. This type of product, however, can suffer from syneresis: densification due to the expulsion of fluid. Gaining insight into the physical principles governing syneresis in such soft hybrid dispersions remains a challenge from a theoretical perspective, as experimental data are needed to establish a basis. We record non-accelerated syneresis in a model system for low-fat mayonnaise: a colloid polymer mixture, consisting of oil in water emulsion with starch in the aqueous phase. We find the flow rate of expelled fluid to be proportional to the difference in hydrostatic pressure over the system. The osmotic pressure of the added starch, while being higher than the hydrostatic pressure, does not prevent syneresis because the soluble starch is lost to the expelled fluid. From these findings, we conclude that forced syneresis in these systems can be described as a gravity-driven porous flow through the densely packed emulsion, explainable with a model based on Darcy's law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,"Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is a promising cathode material with high capacity, which can be paired with1 nonlithium metal anodes such as silicon or tin so that the safety issues caused by the Li anode can be effectively avoided. However, the Li2S full cell suffers from rapid capacity degradation due to the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. Herein, a Li2S/Si full cell is designed with a Li2S cathode incorporated by titanium nitride (TiN) polysulfide immobilizer within parallel hollow carbon (PHC). This full cell delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(Li2S)(-1) (1007 mAh g(sulfur)(-1)) at 0.5 C rate and excellent cyclability with only 0.4% capacity fade per cycle over 200 cycles. The long cycle stability is ascribed to the strong polysulfide anchor effect of TiN and highly efficient electron/ion transport within the interconnected weblike architecture of PHC. Theoretical calculations, self-discharge measurements, and anode stability experiments further confirm the strong adsorption of polysulfides on the TiN surface. The present work demonstrates that the flexible Li2S cathode and paired Si anode can be used to achieve highly efficient Li-S full cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,"The spatio-temporal localization of a system in the presence of an oscillating electric field for a symmetric double-well potential is examined via numerical simulations of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. For an initial state with equal probability densities in both the wells, stabilized localization atop the barrier can be achieved on a periodic high-frequency driving. The barrier localization is characterized using Shannon information entropies in position and momentum spaces, defined as S-rho = - integral |psi|(2) ln |psi|(2) dx and S-gamma = - integral |phi|(2) ln |phi|(2) dp, where psi and phi refer to position and momentum space wave functions, respectively. The information entropy sum, S-rho + S-gamma, goes through a minimum indicating the formation of the barrier-localized state, when the peak intensity of the oscillating field is reached. The generalized uncertainty via the Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski inequality (S-rho + S-gamma >= 1 + ln pi) is saturated upon this minimization. This serves as a signature of the formation of the barrier-atop localized state, in terms of Shannon entropies of measurable densities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

146,"The aim of the present study is to develop a theoretical concept of multi-property mineral separator (MPMS). In general, most of the conventional mineral separators exploit a single physical property difference for beneficiation. However, the idea behind MPMS is to utilize multiple physical properties of particles in a single separator for beneficiation. Mathematical formulations were developed for conceptual MPMS, where physical properties of particles such as density, magnetic susceptibility, and surface work function will be exploited in a single separator. Simulations were carried out for tracing particle trajectories in MPMS using MATLAB. Simulation results indicate that separation efficiency can be enhanced by exploiting multiple physical properties of particles simultaneously in a single separator. Based on the developed theoretical model of MPMS in the present paper, the fabrication of a prototype separator is under construction. Experimental results and validation using prototype MPMS will be reported in near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

148,"Recording the data necessary to assess the kinetics of a reaction can be labor-intensive. In this technology brief, we show a method to automate this task by utilizing parts of an aKTApurifier chromatography system to automatically take samples from a reaction vessel at predefined time intervals and place them in 96-well plates and also enable correlating the samples with in-line spectral data of the reaction solution. Automatic sampling can reduce experimental bottlenecks by enabling overnight reactions or a higher degree of parallelization. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we performed batch-PEGylation of lysozyme with varying conditions by changing the molar excess of the PEG reagent. We used analytical cation-exchange chromatography to analyze the samples taken during the batch reaction, determining the concentrations of the individual species present at each time step. Subsequently, we fitted a kinetic model on these data.

149,"Here, we used a novel method to deform silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) into nanodiscs through the application of a transverse mechanical force using a homebuilt Teflon puncher. The application of different forces (16, 33, and 50 N) resulted in the formation of Ag nanodiscs with different heights (106, 99, and 88 nm) from polyhedral Ag NPs (similar to 114 nm). We observed a clear red-shift in the plasmonic resonance for completely deformed Ag nanodiscs produced using 50 N force. We show that the fluorescence emission from Rhodamine B (RhB) is enhanced by >30 fold (with respect to RhB on bare glass) in the presence of Ag nanodiscs due to a simultaneous increase in the excitation intensity and photonic mode density. The observed increase in RhB emission on Ag nanodiscs is explained in terms of the nanodisc's scattering spectrum red-shifting toward the RhB emission wavelength, which results in an increased local electric field and higher photonic mode density for Ag nanodiscs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,"Shewanella woodyi cultures were used to correlate bioluminescence intensity with changes in the electrochemical potential of a saltwater medium using soluble electron acceptors. A relationship between the concentration of NaNO3 or CoCl2 to bioluminescence intensity was confirmed using aerobic cultures of S. woodyi at 20 degrees C with glucose as the sole carbon source. In general, increasing the concentration of nitrate or Co(II) reduced the bioluminescence per cell, with complete luminescence being repressed at >= 5 mM nitrate and >= 0.5 mM Co(II). Results from cell viability fluorescent staining concluded that increasing the concentration of Co(II) or nitrate did not affect the overall viability of the cells when compared with cultures lacking Co(II) or nitrate. These data show that potentials of <0.2 V vs Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE) repress the luminescence from the cells, but the exact mechanism is unclear.

151,"Normally, cultivation of most Streptomyces species for the purpose of mutant-screening is an arduous process, needing a large amount of material. Moreover, the quantitative analysis of corresponding metabolites is done using HPLC, which is both expensive and time-consuming, and hence not ideal for screening of large numbers of isolates. A novel two-step high-throughput screening strategy has been designed to efficiently identify high-titer virginiamycin-producing mutants of Streptomyces virginiae. The high-throughput screening strategy described here can be used to cultivate a large number of mutant S. virginiae strains in 24-well deep-well microtiter plates and rapidly evaluate a large number of strains with varying virginiamycin titers. This is done based on the cylinder-plate bioassay method using Micrococcus luteus CMCC (B) 28001 as an indicator without compromising the accuracy. After one round of microwave-mediated mutagenesis, S. virginiae strain number 74 identified from nearly 1244 isolates, was shown to have the highest titer. The titer of virginiamycin was approximately 61.26 +/- 2.53 mg/L, which is nearly three times compared to the value for the parent strain. Thus, this approach holds promise in facilitating the screening of high-titer virginiamycin producing strains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

157,"The scale-up of laboratory procedures to industrial production is the main challenge standing between ideation and the successful introduction of novel materials into commercial products. Retaining quality while ensuring high per-batch production yields is the main challenge. Batch processing and other dynamic strategies that preserve product quality can be applied, but they typically involve a variety of experimental parameters and functions that are difficult to optimize because of interdependencies that are often antagonistic. Adaptive Bayesian optimization is demonstrated here as a valuable support tool in increasing both the per-batch yield and quality of short polymer fibers, produced by wet spinning and shear dispersion methods. Through this approach, it is shown that short fiber dispersions with high yield and a specified, targeted fiber length distribution can be obtained with minimal cost of optimization, starting from sub-optimal processing conditions and minimal prior knowledge. The Bayesian function optimization demonstrated here for batch processing could be applied to other dynamic scale-up methods as well as to cases presenting higher dimensional challenges such as shape and structure optimization.

Target compounds included pentachlorobenzene, hexachlorocyclohexanes (alpha, beta, gamma), hexachlorobenzene, DDE/DDD/DDT (o,p ' and p,p ' isomers) and PCBs (no. 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180). Involved assays were accomplished by analyzing real contaminated samples without previous spiking and using gas chromatography with a mass detector (GC/MS). As interesting aspects, a light oven drying with subsequent grinding and the addition of purchasable copper to remove sulfur were found to make the proposed procedure more affordable. In addition to describing the development of the analytical procedure, the reliability of the results was also assessed. In detail, the presence of possible bias and intermediate precision were estimated. The absence of bias in the analytical results was investigated by the Youden method. Regarding analytical variability, intermediate precision was estimated from the overall analyses of different real samples. Values were mainly between 6 and 15%, except for the DDT isomers, DDE and HCH, which ranged from 15 to 30%. The limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 ng mL(-1). This study describes a simple method for determining organochlorines in sediments, which can be easily conducted in routine laboratories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
163,"In this paper, the linear isotherm regularity (LIR) equation of state has been used to predict some of the most important thermodynamic quantities and also a series exploring the physical consequences in dense fluids. A new method in this paper is introduced to derive these empirical rules from the LIR equation of state. Thus, first, the thermodynamic quantities are extracted and then verified by the experimental data. The monatomic fluids whose experimental data are used to test the ability of the equation of state are helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon. Boyle's temperature and density are also derived in this paper for monatomic fluids, which is in good agreement with the quantities reported in literatures. The modified model was compared with the other two-parameter equation of state and the results showed the modified model can provide better correlation results with the average absolute relative deviation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

165,"The influence of supporting ligands and co-ligands on the dioxygen reactivity of a series of iron(ii) complexes, [(6-Me-3-TPA)Fe-II(GN-H)](+) (1), [(6-Me-3-TPA)Fe-II(DHN-H)](+) (1a), [(BPMEN)Fe-II(GN-H)](+) (2), [(BPMEN)Fe-II(DHN-H)](+) (2a), [(TBimA)Fe-II(GN-H)](+) (3), and [(TBimA)Fe-II(DHN-H)](+) (3a) (GN-H-2 = 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and DHN-H-2 = 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid) of N4 ligands, is presented. The iron(ii)-gentisate complexes react with dioxygen to afford the corresponding iron(iii) species. On the contrary, DHN-H undergoes oxidative C-C coupling to form [2,2 '-binaphthalene]-1,1 ',4,4 '-tetrone 3-hydroxy-3 '-carboxylic acid (BNTHC) on 1a, and [2,2 '-binaphthalene]-1,1 ',4,4 '-tetrone 3,3 '-dicarboxylic acid (BNTD) on 2a and 3a. In each case, the reaction proceeds through an iron(iii)-DHN species. The X-ray single crystal structures of [(6-Me-3-TPA)Fe-II(BNTD)] (1(Ox)) and [(BPMEN)Fe-II(BNTD)] (2(Ox)) confirm the coupling of two DHN-H molecules. The formation of iron(iii) product without any coupling of co-ligand from the complexes, [(BPMEN)Fe-II(HNA)](+) (2b) and [(BPMEN)Fe-II(5-OMeSA)](+) (2c) (HNA = 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, 5-OMeSA = 5-methoxysalicylate) confirms the importance of para-hydroxy group for the coupling reaction. The unusual coupling of DHN-H by the iron(ii) complexes of the neutral N4 ligands is distinctly different from the oxygenolytic aromatic C-C cleavage of DHN by the iron(ii) complex of a facial N3 ligand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
166,"Corticosterone is an important steroid for the regulation of metabolism and stress response. Existing methods for the measurement of corticosterone include radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). While each of these approaches have their advantages, RIAs use radioactive isotopes that necessitate specially regulated usage and disposal. Furthermore, both ELISAs and RIAs require expensive kits and can only measure a single analyte. In this study, we establish a new sample preparation technique based on a modified Folch extraction that allows for the simultaneous isolation of corticosterone and lipids from serum. The extract is then analyzed by LC-MS. Using only 5 mu L of serum, quantification of corticosterone was achieved with coefficients of variation at 3% or less and a detection limit of 0.12 mu M. Overall, the results of this study should be beneficial to the measurement of circulating corticosterone and lipids for a variety of studies using small volumes of samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examine the case of methane bubble dissolution in the bulk, along with the cases of methane bubble dissolution within simple/regular networks of pores, where all pores have the same size. In our calculations, we consider experimental values for the equilibrium solubilities of methane in water, along the hydrate-forming line, as well as, values obtained from predictive tools that are based on different thermodynamic models. The effect of aqueous NaCl solutions on the results is also investigated. As a result of the relatively low solubility of methane in water, large volumes of water are required for complete dissolution of a methane bubble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
168,"The paper focuses on the use of heat generated during a chemical reaction as an alternative source of environmental energy. Exothermic reaction heat in the presence of light chemical elements have been studied. The heat of these reactions is summed up by the heat of combustion of hydrogen. Therefore, the effectiveness of alternative energy sources increases significantly. Electrochemical and mixed (electrochemical + carbo-thermal) methods have been developed to restore the starting components from the reaction products. The energy efficiencies of the electrochemical and mixed methods were calculated giving (without using the heat of exothermic reaction heat) 47.4% and 74%, respectively, whereas using the heat of exothermic reactions, energy efficiency is 82% and 99%, respectively. In general, for 1 kg of magnesium in the five-step electrochemical process 21012 kJ of heat are released, 165 g of hydrogen and one cubic meter of oxygen are formed. The mixed method produces 247 g of hydrogen and 21065 kJ of heat. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
169,"Stereo- and regioselective formation of glycosidic linkages is a challenging topic in oligosaccharide syntheses. The stereoselective construction of 1,2-trans-glycosides generally involves neighboring group participation, which is less successful when synthesizing beta-1,3-linked oligosaccharides. The combined steric effect of a 2-O-substituent and an aglycon moiety in acceptors increases the efficiency of glycosylation via neighboring group participation. This steric effect was reduced by using vicinal polyol acceptors and was demonstrated in the synthesis of 1,3-linked branched oligosaccharides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This type of polymers theoretically cannot retain metal cations from solutions. We assume that cations sorption on this polymer takes place due to the formation of jarosite mineral-type compounds. By increasing the temperature in the range of 0-60 degrees C, the cations sorption increases slightly but in the pH range of 2-6, it increases more considerable in the following order: La3+< Nd3+ < Eu3+ approximate to Er3+. The sorption at 21 and 50 degrees C is adequately described by the pseudo-first-order (PFO) kinetic model, and the limiting step of the rate which decreases in order Er3+ > Eu3+ > Nd3+ > La3+ is internal diffusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

173,"While a water droplet beads up on a hydrophobic fibrous surface, it does not necessarily detach or move on the surface under its own weight. The underlying physics of droplet adhesion to a rough surface is very complicated, and the ability to engineer a fibrous texture that promotes or prevents droplet mobility for droplets of different liquids has been a long-standing challenge. In this concern, the current work is devised to develop easy-to-use correlations for the force needed to detach a droplet from a hydrophobic fibrous coating in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These correlations are obtained by first writing an equation for the balance of forces acting on a detaching droplet in terms of its geometrical dimensions at the moment of detachment, and then relating these dimensions to those in the absence of an external force via curve fitting to a series of computational data. These easy-to-use correlations only require the physical properties of the fibrous coatings (e.g., fiber diameter, fiber spacing, and fiber contact angle) and the droplets (e.g., volume and surface tension) as inputs, and they can therefore be used to optimize the surface geometry prior to manufacturing. To examine their accuracy, predictions of these correlations are compared to experimental data obtained for droplet detachment from fibrous mats with fibers having a diameter of about two orders of magnitude smaller than those considered in developing the correlations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
174,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion measurements of surfactants suffer from fast exchange of the surfactant between the micellar aggregate and bulk solution. Therefore, hydrophobic probe molecules are commonly used to directly measure aggregate diffusion under the assumption that the probe molecules remain solubilized inside the micelles. Aggregate size is then determined or estimated from the aggregate diffusion value. Unfortunately, the probe molecule also experiences rapid exchange between the aggregate and bulk, leading to inaccurate or unreasonable micelle diffusion values, a fact that has often been ignored in the literature. In this article, we present a systematic evaluation of probe molecules in cationic and anionic surfactants, obtained by measuring the diffusion of probe molecules with varying hydrophobicity. We find that an octanol-water partition coefficient of at least similar to 5 is required for correct measurements of aggregate diffusion in the systems studied. Notably, some commonly used probes have a partition coefficient much lower than five and are therefore not suitable for aggregate diffusion measurements. Consideration of these results will help researchers obtain accurate results for micelle sizing or partitioning studies with pulsed-field-gradient NMR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
175,"The relative stability and kinetics of CH4 horizontal ellipsis O2 horizontal ellipsis MO and the reaction potential energy surface under the transition metal oxide catalysts (RuO/RhO/PdO) during methane oxidation reaction were studied with density functional calculations. The results show that the reaction can be easily carried out under the catalysis of transition metal oxides. The transition barriers and the reaction rate constant all show oscillation modes that are consistent with the increase of atomic number at 298 K. while the calculated reaction energies (Er/kcal mol-(1)) are gradually increased. The oxidised dioxide can be treated to form metal and oxygen that can still be used as a catalyst for methane oxidation; the resulting oxygen can continue to be used as an oxidant. We also calculated the rate constant of methane oxidation reaction to give the resulting methanol pathway. The calculated dynamic characterisation shows that the rate constant has a positive temperature dependence. Our calculation show that this reaction is exothermic reaction via the RuO/RhO/PdO catalyst, and the reaction is thermodynamically feasible. This study also provides theoretical reference data for us to identify new catalysts for the catalytic oxidation of methane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
176,"A dielectric ink thermal processing method has been developed to bond bicomponent poly(ethylene)/poly (propylene) (bico-PE/PP) fibers that are commonly used to make nonwoven fabrics for a variety of applications including medical, hygiene, and filtration needs. Dielectric inks applied to the fibers offer a number of potential advantages over conventional calendar bonding including more efficient energy conversion, faster heating rates, heating directed to desired bond sites, facile patterning, the ability to function on materials with substantial amounts of loft, and avoidance of fiber damage induced by calendar roller contact. Poly(ethylene) and poly (propylene) do not efficiently convert microwave energy to heat on their own; therefore, propylene carbonate (PC) and glycerine carbonate (GC) were selected as ink candidates due to their large dipole moments and dielectric constants. The temperature-dependent dielectric constant and dielectric loss values of both carbonates were measured as well as their thermal responses to microwave energy at 2.45 GHz. The dispersion of each carbonate on bico-PE/PP fibers, including the application to nonwoven fabrics, was characterized by optical microscopy. The thermal response for ink loading as a function of microwave radiation exposure time was investigated. Tensile test results showed that the bonding strength of dielectric ink bonded samples was comparable with the bonding obtained using conventional calendar bonding. The results presented herein demonstrate that dielectric inks provide fast heating rates, excellent fiber bonding, and the ability for facile nonwoven patterning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
177,"[a(3) + H](2+) ions generated from Ln(3+)/tripeptide complexes, where Ln = La or Ce, have similar structures to the linear [a(n)](+) ions but with protonation at both the terminal NH2 and N=CH2 groups. Ion stability is favored by having the basic secondary amine of the proline residue at the N-terminus and by an amino acid residue accommodating one of the protons on the side chain. Dissociation of [a(3) + H](2+) ions derived from peptides containing only aliphatic residues is by cleavage of the second amide bond to give [b(2)](+) or [a(2)](+) ions along with internal [a(1)](+) ions. For [a(3) + H](2+) ions containing a tryptophan residue in the central location, in addition to cleavage of the amide bond, losses of neutrals NH3, HN=CHR, (NH3 + CO), and HNCO were observed. Dissociations of some unsolvated Ln(3+)/tripeptide complexes gave [b(3) + H](2+) ions in low abundance; formation of these [b(3) + H](2+) ions was favored by the presence of a proline residue at the N-terminus and by either a histidine or tryptophan residue in the central position. Dissociation of these [b(3) + H](2+) ions was by the loss of (H2O + CO) and not only CO, indicating that these ions did not have the same type of oxazolone structure as found for [b(n)](+) ions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the observed [b(3) + H](2+) ions of ProGlyGly were formed from [Ce(ProGlyGly)](3+) complexes in which the peptide was bound to the metal ion as an enolate. Dissociation of the slightly lower-energy complex, where the peptide is bound in the keto form, would produce an oxazolone but the high barrier required to create this isomer of the [b(3) + H](2+) ion would be sufficient to result in further dissociation. Two isomers of the [b(3) + H](2+) ion of ProHisGly have been created, one from the [Ce(ProHisGly)](3+) complex that characteristically dissociates by the combined loss of (H2O + CO) and the other by the loss of glycine from [ProHisGlyGly + 2H](2+). The [b(3) + H](2+) ion derived from [ProHisGlyGly + 2H](2+) dissociated by the loss of only CO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
178,"Dislocations are always observed during crystal growth, and it is usually desirable to reduce the dislocation density in high-quality crystals. Here, the annihilation process of the 30 degrees Shockley partial dislocation pairs in CdTe is studied by first-principles calculations. We found that the dislocations can glide relatively easily due to the weak local bonding. Our systematic study of the slipping mechanism of the dislocations suggests that the energy barrier for the annihilation process is low. Band structure calculations reveal that the band bending caused by the charge transfer between the two dislocation cores depends on the core-core distance. A simple linear model is proposed to describe the mechanism of formation of the dislocation pair. More importantly, we demonstrate that hole injection can affect the core structure, increase the mobility, and eventually trigger a spontaneous mutual annihilation, which could be employed as a possible facile way to reduce the dislocation density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
179,"LiFePO4/C-Li4Ti5O12 composite electrode materials were synthesized by blending LiFePO4/C and Li4Ti5O12 materials then calcining at 500 degrees C for 14 h. The effects of different composite ratios on the phase structure and electrochemical properties of LiFePO4/C-Li4Ti5O12 composite cathode materials were investigated. The results showed that the structure of LiFePO4/C and Li4Ti5O12 in the composite prepared by the simple blending method did not change.

180,"A quantitative structure-retention relationship study was performed by thin layer chromatography on a number of beta-blockers using 315 molecular descriptors of which nine were selected to be having the most important physicochemical properties. These descriptors provide good correlations with chromatographic behavior of the studied structurally related drugs.

The retention parameters were obtained by utilizing four solvent systems of two additives of variable ratios, consequently specific polarities in addition to imparted different pH values using either glacial acetic acid or liquid ammonia. Calculated theoretical approaches prove good correlations between investigated descriptors and retention factors.

Additionally, second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) level in combination with 6-311++G(d,p) basis set was employed for comparison purpose. The thermodynamic stability of the self assembled structures in gaseous phase has been obtained according to the analyses of total electronic energies and hydrogen bonding interactions. The bulk water environment has been simulated using the universal solvation model based on solute electron density (SMD). Stability and structure of homochiral and heterochiral imexon dimers resulting from the three imexon tautomers have been carried out to investigate the chiral discrimination. The imexon dimer with heterochiral configuration resulting from self-assembling oxo-amino tautomer is found to be thermodynamically most stable in both gas and aqueous phases. The interaction energies for these self assembled structures were further evaluated with the basis set superposition error corrections. The so-called seven-point interaction energy which includes corrections for BSSE and deformation was calculated.

183,"The synthesis, structure and photophysical properties of dinuclear bis(phenylpyridine)(salicylaldiminato)Ir(III) complexes bearing polymethylene linkers are described herein. Chiral and achiral dinuclear Ir complexes bearing short (n = 2), medium (n = 5) and long (n = 8) polymethylene linkers were prepared by reacting [Ir(2-phenylpyridinato)IrCl](2) with the corresponding salicylaldimine derivatives. The facial configurations of the coordination sites and the polymethylene-linked structures were unequivocally established based on X-ray crystallography. The emission wavelengths of these polymethylene-linked binuclear complexes in 2-MeTHF in a glassy state at 77 K were found to vary with the length of the linker, such that a hypsochromic shift from yellow to green was observed upon changing from pentamethylene (n = 5) or octamethylene (n = 8) to ethylene (n = 2) linkages. X-ray crystallography and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance analysis combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the present chromism arises from variations in the proximity and conformational rigidity between the two iridium cores, both of which are controlled by the length of the polymethylene linkage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
184,"This work describes a procedure to improve the quality of an Am-241 alpha source obtained by means of electrodeposition. The technique of design of experiments (DoE) was applied in order to perform a multivariate analysis of the experimental variable effects taking into consideration the following: i-amperage, d-cathode-anode distance, t-time and PP-polishing process. A 3(4-2) fractional design was employed using four experimental factors, three levels per factor, and three response variables were studied: H-area = electrodeposited active area, %R = activity recovery percentage, and Delta(1/2) = width at half-height. Thanks to this simple design, 9 experiments were enough, done in triplicate, to discern how Delta(1/2) and %R are modified when experimental factors change. Additionally, this work provides tools to perform effect statistical analysis of experimental factors, and to pose linear models applying significant terms.

185,"This article further develops the Coulson-Fischer formalism in conjunction with the optimised effective potential method [V.N. Glushkov and S. Wilson, Molec. Phys. 110, 149 (2012)] to incorporate both exchange and static correlation effects for excited states having the same symmetry as the ground state. By using this formalism, we compute complete potential energy curves for the ground and first excited states of the molecule and the isoelectronic heteronuclear ion. Effective potentials are generated in according to a novel density functional theory [A.K. Theophilou, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 074104 (2018)] in which the Kohn-Sham (KS) like potential has spherical symmetry around each nucleus. In this way, the inconsistencies of standard density functional theory concerning the asymmetry of the KS potential are remedied. In our implementation, an effective potential which satisfies this requirement is expressed as a direct mapping of the external potential. Different approximations for the effective potentials are investigated. It is shown that applications of the proposed formalism support good agreement with the exact Coulson-Fischer theory for both the ground and first excited state potential energy curves and thus a qualitatively correct description of dissociation.

Subsequently, they were used as an initial precursor and placed in the plasma-chemical reactor, where the multicomponent C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanostructures were synthesized under the influence of the pulsed electron beam. This method was based on the volume excitation of the reaction gas by a pulsed electron beam in such a way as to control the uniform process implementation in the entire excitation region. The morphology and phase composition of the synthesized C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanocomposites were studied.

With the increase in ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic in polymeric surfactant, the CMC values of the surfactants decreased, and the emulsification and foaming properties of these surfactants increased, and the HLB values of them decreased. This type of polymeric surfactants was used to disperse single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in water, and their dispersal capacities were comparatively determined by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to quantify the amount of surfactant attached onto the nanotubes. More intuitive image of their dispersion states were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that this type of polymeric surfactants had good dispersion capacity and dispersion stability to SWCNTs in water through strong hydrophobic attraction and weak van der Waals interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thermal stability of the samples with pecan nutshell was verified by TG compared with the sample with only carbon black. The value of tan delta evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis in the specific temperature values indicates the wet traction and rolling resistance for tires. Higher tan delta at 0 degrees C was observed in the samples containing pecan nutshell, which indicates better wet traction; however, the higher results observed at 60 degrees C indicate a worst rolling resistance. Results of oxidation induction time, by differential scanning calorimetry, show that the oxidation time increased with the addition of pecan nutshell in the compounds, indicating better antioxidant properties, justified by the presence of lignin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

198,"The dominant molecular orbitals (MO) making roles in electronic transitions responsible for optical processes in an OLED molecule are investigated. Whole molecule transition during absorption of stimulus light in such devices are commonly described first-principally as a summation of electronic transitions between several MOs. Time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can determine the percent of each electronic transition contributing into a specific molecular transition between ground and excited states. This scheme, however, ignores electronic correlation during the transitions, which of crucial importance for correcting the difference energies between MO levels. This electron-hole interaction energy can be recovered considering every peak of absorption spectrum of the molecule to one single electronic transition between two specific MOs. The corresponding single-excited molecular orbitals (SEMO) are employed to calculate the intensities of absorption peaks of a well-known OLED molecule Alq(3). First, TDDFT is used to simulate the molecule and to obtain its MOs and it is shown that TDDFT is capable to track the dominant electronic transitions and their specific MOs responsible for the optical process, and so, it provides a reliable basis for calculations of SEMO. The SEMO is then applied on MOs contributing dominantly in each absorption peak of the molecule. The calculations, performed within this scheme, move the computational curve excellently closer to experimental measurement of the absorption peaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
199,"Worldwide, toxicological consequences are arising from vehicular contributions to environmental pollution. Herein, elemental monitoring has been conducted of road dirt via three analytical techniques, sampling being made along the busy campus roads of universities/research institutes in Guildford and Riyadh. Using the ICPOES and ICPMS techniques, absolute values have been determined for Ti, Mn, Mg, Co, Zr, Mo, Ba, Tl, V, Rd, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cd, and As, while an SEM/EDX technique has provided weight % values. Results, both qualitative and quantitative, are compared. By using SEM most prominent among the elements observed in the road samples are Al, Fe, Mg, and Si, particularly in the Gulf city of Riyadh and are in agreement with values observed in previous work by the same group. By using ICPMS and ICPOES Mg, Ti, V, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr and Ba have also been observed in both climates, albeit at lower concentrations than that found for Al, Fe, and Mg, with particle sizes of < 45 mu m. Elemental presence is seen to be influenced by climatic conditions as well as vehicle engine size.

200,"The use of bioprocess to convert low valued biomass or agroindustrial byproducts into high-value chemicals is an emerging area. However, laboratories usually use outdated analytical techniques to identify bioproducts. losing valuable information, such as the identification of unexpected compounds. In this work, we presented a successful systematic and modern analytical approach based on direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) for an automated high-throughput screening of untargeted compounds from glycerin bioconversion process. We describe advantages of DIMS and its combined application with chemometrics towards an untargeted metabolomics approach to analyze several samples in a short time (11 samples per h). Three batches with 34 samples from the bioconversion of glycerin using several filamentous fungi strains were analyzed.

203,"Combining autoantigens with immune-modulating drugs has emerged as an attractive approach to selectively reinstate tolerance in autoimmune diseases. The disparate properties of autoantigens and small-molecule immunosuppressants commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases can confound efforts to co-deliver these therapies. However, both components may be co-delivered with adjuvants which have been successful in delivering antigens to immune cells. We evaluated several common adjuvants as vehicles to co-deliver a model antigen and immunosuppressant, ovalbumin (OVA) and dexamethasone (DEX), respectively. Formulations were developed, and the release of DEX from adjuvants was investigated. Next, the effect of adjuvant, DEX, and OVA was tested in vitro using a DC line. A MF59-analog (MF59a) formulation was advanced to more sophisticated co-culture studies using OVA-primed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and splenocytes or T-cells from OT-II mice. Most of these studies indicated MF59a-based antigen-specific immunotherapies could diminish the markers of inflammation associated with OVA recognition. We rationalized MF59a co-delivery of antigen and drug could reduce the risk of side effects typically associated with these drugs and reinstate immune tolerance, thus prompting continued investigation of emulsion adjuvants as delivery vehicles for antigen-specific immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases.

206,"For the purpose of modeling internal corrosion of the stainless steel fuel pins in fast nuclear reactors, the present work presents a thermodynamic description of the Fe-Ni-Te system modeled via the Calphad method. The liquid phase was modeled using the ionic 2-sublattice liquid model. Only binary parameters were optimized in the beta 2, delta and tau solid phases, to fit the isothermal section at 600 degrees C. The liquid did not require much adjustment from the extrapolation from the binary Fe-Te, Ni-Te and Fe-Ni systems. The paper presents a re-optimization of the Fe-Te liquid description in order to remove inverted liquid miscibility gaps at high temperatures. The resulting phase diagrams reproduce experimental isothermal sections well, and fits liquidus and solidus data very well.

Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis were used to characterize CaO, which confirmed that after calcining at 800 degrees C for 2 hr, CaCO3 was completely converted into porous micronized CaO with a surface area of about 7.295m(2)/g and a particle size of 0.5-1.5 mu m. The porous CaO microparticles were used as heterogeneous catalysts for producing biodiesel from transesterification of soybean oil and methanol.

209,"Anecdotal evidence and a further report from leather experts show that there is close to no enlightenment of the production of leather vessels in Ghanaian leather industries. This study was, therefore, conducted as a result of the need to add leather as supplementary material to the traditional materials such as clay, metal, wood and half-gourd used for producing vessels in Ghana. The purpose of the study was to find out how Ghanaian indigenous leather could be used in the production of leather vessels. The qualitative study employed three key techniques, namely: 'Cuir bouilli' leather hardening methods, the sand pounding technique, and assemblage and construction technique. Based on the results, the baking and hot wax methods adversely affected the indigenous leather positively in the hardening of the leather. The results also show that using only one part of the leather (the back, belly or butt) affected the quality of the leather vessels, but incorporating the various parts of the hide helped improve the quality and durability of the leather vessels. The implications of the results and future research directions are also presented. This study has, therefore, expanded the usefulness of the Ghanaian indigenous vegetable tanned leather apart from the conventional usage for making shoes, bags and belts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the advances in molecular, morphological, and evolutionary studies about several aspects of rattles, there are no studies elucidating these nanoscale topographical features using high-resolution techniques. Here we propose a set of approaches to show these micro/nano surface features searching for patterns or hidden signatures. The results showed that the older rattle ring (segment 8) presented higher roughness values when compared to other segments. Cluster analysis allowed the observation of similarities/differences among some groups, which reinforced the strong discrepancy of the segment 8 when compared to the others and enable possible topographical transitions among each segment features, considering their linkages and Euclidean distances. Attractive forces and surface hardness were also significant increased on segment 8, while adhesion was significantly decreased on the segments 5, 6, and 7 compared to segment 1 (P < 0.05). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed typical profiles of keratin spectra considering the amino acids present in this protein structure.

Structural and spectroscopic analysis of these phases revealed that derivatives (1) and (2) are isomers of previously reported (3) [Brahmia et al. (2013). Acta Cryst. E69, o1296]. The crystal structures of meta derivative (1) and para derivative (2) were ab initio determined from powder X-ray diffraction data using the direct-space approach. Both (1) and (2) adopt the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). These isomers show hydrogen bonds and rich pi-pi stacking, together with pi center dot center dot center dot H interactions, which are built by conjugated systems of coumarin and phenol rings. In the crystalline lattice, the packing of (1) and (3) are mainly stabilized through O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding between neighbouring coumarin molecules, while hydrogen bonds between coumarin and water molecules build the stable crystal structure of derivative (2). A big similarity in the skeletons of the IR spectra of these isomers was noticed. Derivative (2) exhibits two weak bands which were not present in the spectra of the other two derivatives, at 2370 and 2948 cm(-1), which can be assigned to the O-H vibrations of the solvent (H2O) trapped in the structure of (2). These aminocoumarin derivatives display absorption maxima in the visible region, attributed to pi-pi delocalization involving the whole electronic system of the compounds with a considerable charge-transfer character originating from the aminophenyl ring and pointing towards the coumarin system which is characterized by a high electron-accepting character.

In November 2018 new-build tanneries with radically different layouts were at an advanced stage of construction and installation of new equipment. These were designed to management and technical requirements of this specific technology. In addition, the technology had made the transition from bovine manufacture to nappa leathers production in a major sheepskin tannery. And within small scale operations - bovine hides, bovine bellies, sheep and goat skins - chrome tannage was taking place with processing adapted around the prevailing conditions and tanners requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
228,"Pyridinium based ionic liquids derived from beta-picoline and n-alkylbromides were synthesized by a simple procedure at ambient temperature and then characterized. These neutral ionic liquids were investigated for their dual role as the solvent and promoter for the selective synthesis of a series of N-monomethylanilines using dimethylcarbonate as the methylating agent. A solvent free green procedure was developed. Reaction conditions were mild and the product recovery was simple. Excellent selectivity for N-monomethylation, the high yield of the product and recyclability of the ionic liquids are some of the promising features of this protocol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
229,"Quercetin (Qu), a noted polyphenolic flavonol molecule, exhibits remarkable antioxidant properties against bioenzymes like peroxidase and tyrosinase. However, it was found that under pH = 3.5-5.5 and room temperature, Qu cannot reduce hydrogen peroxide (HP) which is a well-perceived reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for oxidative stress. We found that in presence of noble-metal nano-particles, such redox interactions can be accomplished. We thus synthesized homogenous PVP-coated nano-platinum particles (PNP) to catalyze the oxidation of Qu by HP. On reaction, Qu is oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone (QQ) following the first-order kinetics. The observed rate constant, k(o), gradually increases and tends to saturate with increasing [HP](T) where T represents the analytical concentrations of the reactant. The saturation kinetics indicates that the activities of PNP resemble to that of bioenzymes and similarly, the nano-particles host the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The estimated value of the k(cat) reveals that the extent of catalysis of even 10(-10) M PNP is nearly comparable with the rate constants of oxidation of Qu in presence of enzymes like horseradish peroxidase and tyrosinase. Graphical abstract Quercetin (Qu) is a ubiquitous natural antioxidant. However, in acidic buffer media (pH = 3.5-5.5), hydrogen peroxide (HP) cannot oxidize Qu. Strikingly, in presence of nano-platinum particles (PNP), Qu is promptly oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone following the first-order kinetics. PNP hosts the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The saturation kinetics with respect to HP resembles to enzyme-like activities of PNP, and indeed, the calculated value of the rate constant, k(cat), is comparable with those of the rate constants of enzyme-mediated oxidation of Qu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
230,"This work was undertaken to understand the mode of interaction of makaluvamines, a class of marine pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids isolated from sponges of the genus Zyzzya, used in the treatment of several human cancer cell lines. This analysis was done by the quantum chemistry method. First, we used electrostatic potential (ESP) to reveal the different sites that accept and donate hydrogen bonds (HB) of charged forms (protonated and methylated) of makaluvamines (at level B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)). In a second step, we studied the interactions by hydrogen bond between these molecules and water molecule on the one hand (at level B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)) and on the other hand glutamic acid a protein residue of topoisomerase II (at level B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)).

Spectrophotometric studies were carried out at different temperatures in the range of 293.15-313.15 K. The concentration of the [Fe(H2O)(6)](3+) (Fe3+) ions was kept within the range of 2 X 10(-4) to 8 X 10(-4) mol L-1, and the concentration of VO(ida)(bipy) was 1 X 10(-3) mol L-1.

232,"Mesophase pitch, as an important chemical intermediate, belongs to highly structured pitch materials that has good property for conducting heat or electricity. Pitch can be naturally derived from petroleum or coal tar. Prior to producing the mesophase pitch materials, the removal of complex low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the original petroleum pitch is essential. In the study, we have developed a two-step process using high pressure CO2 for separating the useful part with desired properties from the raw petroleum pitch sample. Firstly, a stepwise supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)) extraction process was employed for removing the lightest molecular weight fractions. The residual and CO2-insoluble fractions were further separated by a subcritical anti-solvent (SAS) process using CO2 at 25 degrees C and three high pressure conditions. A modified SAS apparatus was utilized in this study. The gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis system with standard calibrations was used to determine the molecular weight of various pitch samples. The GPC system was equipped with dual Ultraviolet (UV) and Refractive Index (RI) detectors. The polydispersity index (PDI) value of the raw petroleum pitch 6 (PP6) sample was 6.9, and it was reduced to 3.8 after the scCO(2) extraction and under the appropriate SAS processing pressure. The corresponding weight average molecular weight (M-w) was increased from 987 to 1493 g/mol. This study provides an effective separation and product identification method that only employs commonly used GPC analyses with dual UV and RI detectors. A useful screening method has been developed for selecting the most appropriate separation parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
233,"Currently, there is no imaging procedure for radionuclide therapy utilizing Erbium-169 (Er-169). We have recently published the first post-radiosynovectomy imaging of Er-169 citrate in a case report (Farahati et al., 2017). In this study, we performed in-vitro and in-vivo studies to evaluate the feasibility to assess the distribution of Er-169 citrate after radiosynovectomy in fourteen patients with seventeen affected joints treated for refractory chronic synovitis. Post-radiosynovectomy imaging revealed the feasibility of post-radiosynovectomy detection and distribution utilizing Er-169 citrate in all cases. However, additional in-vitro studies including in-vitro imaging, gamma spectrometry and analysis of half-life indicated that emitted gamma-rays of the Ytterbium-169 in the radio-pharmaceutical together with bremsstrahlung induced by Er-169 are the imaging source of emitted counts. Post-radiosynovectomy imaging utilizing Er-169 citrate is feasible and should be implemented in the guidelines for theranostics for quality control, patient safety and therapy monitoring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
234,"A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was used to characterize and identify mixed selenium-sulfur compounds with the formula SenSm in synthetic selenium-sulfur melts and selenium-impacted sediments. This method shows strong fragmentation of SenSm compounds in the electron ionization source, which makes conclusive identification of discrete compounds difficult. Despite these limitations, three SenSm compounds (SeS4, SeS5, and SeS6) were identified conclusively in synthetic samples, and several others were shown to be mixed SeS compounds, without being able to determine a molecular formula. Three selenium-impacted sediments from sites containing similar total selenium concentrations (11.0-18.5 ppm) were extracted with carbon disulfide (CS2); each of the three sediments contained at least 12 SenSm compounds, ten of which were common to all three sediments. Two of the compounds identified in the synthetic samples were also found in all three sediments, SeS4 and SeS5, and a third, SeS6 was found in one sediment sample. This is the first time that cyclic SenSm compounds have been confirmed to exist in the environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
235,"SrTiO3 nanopowders doped with various percentages of Fe (0, 1, 3, and 5 mol%) was synthesized, determining its chemical and structural properties using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of the samples were studied using hysteresis curves obtained by an alternating gradient magnetometer. Theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory are also performed to support experimental data. The results indicated that Fe incorporated into de SrTiO3 structure induced intrinsic magnetic properties, which increase as the Fe percentage increase. At 5 mol% of Fe in the sample showed a single-domain state, typical of a ferromagnetic material capable for information storage. This latter result would be due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies as more Fe was added and to the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions reinforced the magnetic behaviour of the compound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
236,"Some processes such as air conditioning absorption systems have been developed as a feasible and economical alternative to help reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and prevent the impact of gas emission produced by electrical air conditioning. However, a main disadvantage of these systems is the absorbent's crystallization phenomenon in the working mixture, which occurs when the absorbent concentration is higher than the saturation point. Among the aqueous working mixtures, NaOH solution shows several advantages for absorption system applications. The aim of this paper is to propose new mathematical correlations to predict or estimate the NaOH concentrations and refractive index in aqueous solutions (H2O NaOH) for an air conditioning absorption system application. The experimental measurements of NaOH concentration and refractive index were made in situ from aqueous solutions with concentrations from 20 to 50% (weight/weight %, with increases of 5%) and temperatures between 10 and 60 C (with increments of 1 C). Two correlations for predicting the concentration of NaOH and refractive index based on cubic regression models with R2 of 0.99704 and 0.99918, respectively, are presented for the first time. The normalized error for NaOH estimation using experimental data lies between 0.026 and 0.040, and for refractive index, the estimation lies between 0.002 and 0.001. Both correlations present a good fit to predict the NaOH concentration between 25 and 45% of concentration ratio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
237,"Heterocyclic moieties have become more interesting for chemists, pharmacologists, microbiologists, and other researchers owing to their indomitable biological potential as anti-infective agents. Among heterocyclic compounds, 1,2,3-triazole nucleus is one of the most important and well-known heterocycles. Triazole core is considered as essential structure in medicinal chemistry which is widely used to synthesize molecules with medical benefits. In this work, a set of triazole analogues were identified as anti-tubercular agents through a series of computer-aided drug design processes, including three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) modeling, molecular docking, and ADMET studies to determine properties of these new proposed drugs. The CoMFA and CoMSIA models employed for a training set of 25 compounds reliable values of Q(2) (0.63 and 0.65, respectively) and R-2 (0.85 and 0.71, respectively). These results indicate that the developed models possess good predictive ability. Based on the 3D-QSAR contours, new molecules with high predicted activities were designed. Moreover, surflex-docking was applied to highlight the important interactions between the ligand and mycobacterium tuberculosis receptor, supporting the stability of the predicted molecules in the receptor.

240,"As many studies have revealed, the introduction of a CF3 group into an organic compound can result in significant enhancement of biological activity. Factors which lead to this enhancement are thus of great interest. To investigate further this area, we have looked at the ability of fluorine to form close contacts with various atoms in organic compounds, e.g. F center dot center dot center dot F, F center dot center dot center dot O/O center dot center dot center dot F, F center dot center dot center dot C/C center dot center dot center dot F, H center dot center dot center dot F/F center dot center dot center dot H and F center dot center dot center dot N/N center dot center dot center dot F, as indicated from crystal structure determinations and Hirshfeld analysis studies on trifluoromethylated compounds. Herein we first report the crystal structures, Hirshfeld surface analyses (HSA), and PIXEL energy calculations of three trifluoromethylated quinoline derivatives, namely 2-(trifluoromethyl) quinolin-4-ol, 1, 4-ethoxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)quinoline, 2, and N-1-(2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinolin-4-yl)ethane-1,2-diamine, 3. Of particular interest is the determination of the various fluorine. atom close contacts. The total percentages of fluorine. -atom close contacts in compounds 1-3 were determined to be high at 47, 41.2 and 60.7%, respectively. As relatively few HSA studies on trifluoromethylated compounds have reported the percentages of individual atom atom close contacts, we have also determined the percentages of atom center dot center dot center dot atom close contacts for 20 more trifluoromethylated compounds: the range of total fluorine center dot center dot center dot atom close contacts for these compounds was 20-60%. While these data are based on connections between similar molecules in a crystalline state, they also clearly suggest that a compound containing CF3 group(s) has the potential to make extensive intermolecular connections/close contacts with organic material. Thus a possible factor for the enhanced biological activity of a compound bearing CF3 group(s) could be the propensity of the CF3 group to form many close contacts, thereby aiding binding or interaction with a biological target.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
241,"In this paper, we demonstrate the formation of Schottky contact formed by Al with a new class of synthesized conjugated pure poly(Schiff base) (PSB) and its blend with varied concentrations of polyaniline (PANI). The Schottky behavior was transformed into Ohmic in the blended polymer. PSB was synthesized from the solution of polycondensation of terephthaloyl chloride (T) and 4-(4-hydroxybenzylideneamino)phenol (SB). The polymer showed good thermal stability with T-g of 312 degrees C as determined by thermal gravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry TGA-DSC and high molecular weight 3.5 x 10(5) (g/mol) with coiled conformation as determined by laser light scattering. PBS was blended with various weight percentage ratios of PANI (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 percent by weight of the pristine polymer). The metal contact (Au) was formed and studied in the temperature range of 293-373 K, which showed that Schottky behavior in the intrinsic polymer with an ideality factor was close to 2 and then reduced to 1.0-1.2 in the blended polymers. In blended polymers, the conduction across the junction was characterized by Schottky emission at low field and Poole-Frenkel emission at high field. The Schottky barrier height showed a small increase with temperature, which was attributed to reduction in the built up of image charge. The Schottky and Poole-Frenkel emission coefficients were also determined and Schottky emission coefficient agreed with the theoretical value, while Poole-Frenkel emission coefficient was small. In short, the metal-semiconductor junction was affected by the blending, while conduction within the polymer remained independent of PANI concentration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
242,"The structure of periodic metallic slits with asymmetric binary grooves is proposed to reduce the width of the transmission peak due to the similar Fabry-Perot (F-P) resonances. It is well known that the F-P resonance in a slit can enhance the transmission and performs as a peak in the spectrum. However, the groove F-P resonance appeared as a dip in the spectrum. In the proposed structure, by coupling the slit and the groove modes, the width of transmission peak can be reduced due to the two dips introduced by the asymmetric binary grooves. The proposed plasmonic structure is promising in application of improving the quality factor, sensing sensitivity, and narrow band filters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
243,"In this research, we focused on the tuning of the absorption properties of acceptor materials based on naphthothiophene diimide (NTI) with a triad structures (NTI-pi-NTI) by modifying the central pi-unit. Novel NTI-based acceptors with a spirobifluorene (SF) unit (SF-NTIs) were designed and synthesized. Their absorption range (400-600 nm) were clearly different from that of previously reported acceptor with a NTI-indacenodithiophene-NTI structure (IDT-NTI, 650-800 nm). Although, the SF-NTI with the same solubilizing groups as IDT-NTI (2-ethylhexyl groups) is not soluble enough for solution processes and favorable molecular orientation properties for OSC devices, the 1-hexylheptyl substituted SF-NTI showed a good solubility and favorable ""face-on"" orientation in the active layer films. The fabricated OSCs showed power conversion efficiency as high as 5.2%, and excellent thermal stability. These results indicate that the absorption of the NTI-triads can be tuned by modifying the central pi-unit and that their orientation nature and solubility can be controlled by altering the alkyl groups on the imide moieties. These properties allow us to develop efficient NTI-based acceptors with various absorption ranges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

245,"Metabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of all metabolites and intermediate products of reactions present within a biological system, is a promising field to enable precision medicine. Clinical metabolomics faces two main challenges at the bioanalytical level. The first is the need for high resolution to obtain maximum metabolome coverage. This is exemplified by the latest version of the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), which reports more than 110,000 metabolites and endogenous compounds. The second is the high-throughput needed to enable the analysis of a large number of samples typically encountered in large-scale cohort studies. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC)-at regular or ultrahigh pressures-combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has long been considered the ""gold standard"" in metabolomics. However, these conventional reversed-phase LC-MS approaches are no longer sufficient to analyze the vast variety of polar compounds, as well as discriminate closely related compounds such as isomers or enantiomers. This review article discusses the novel separation and detection strategies that are considered promising in clinical metabolomics to enhance the metabolome coverage. It includes hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), multidimensional LC approaches, as well as ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) analysis methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
246,"The modification of the structural and surface characteristics of Ti1-xZrxO2 nanocrystallites by post-synthesis treatments is revealed as an effective way to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Starting with the same batch of mixed oxide prepared from reverse microemulsions, different photocatalysts have been obtained by either solvothermal treatment, calcination or a combination of both. Extensive physicochemical characterization of the resulting materials shows that solvothermally treated oxides present lower crystallite size and larger surface area, although without previous calcination these samples appear to have a higher degree of structural disorder. These differences are sharply reflected in the changes in photocatalytic activity for the removal of methylcyclohexane (MCH) and toluene vapours at relatively high concentrations. Thus, the best performance for MCH elimination is obtained with the photocatalysts prepared by calcination and subsequent solvothermal treatment. Following this procedure, the resulting Ti1-xZrxO2 material presents larger surface area and high Zr surface concentration with minimal disturbance of the anatase structure. In contrast, for toluene photooxidation, the solvothermally prepared sample shows improved performance, most likely due to its larger surface area, which contributes to hinder deactivation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
247,"In this article, hybrid functional B3LYP method is used to construct the reactant structure of energetic components in propellant at the bhandhlyp/6-31 g(d) level, and to calculate the closed-shell layer of the system. At the bhandhlyp/6-31g(d) level, the energy difference (activation energy) between the transition state and the reactant was calculated and the reaction mechanism between energetic components was analyzed.

With the further separation of O-30, it also acts with Al-11 until it completely breaks away from N-26 atom. The activation energy of this reaction is 56.448 x 10(3) J mol(-1). The oxygen dioxide atom in ammonium perchlorate is more likely to interact with the Al-11 atom of the Al-13 cluster.

248,"Exploring hybrid gap surface plasmon polariton waveguides (HGSPPWs) is an important milestone in developing the nextgeneration, nanoscale integrated photonic circuit technology. To advance their potential applications, HGSPPWs are required to have tunable capability, highly reliable, simple fabrication process, and feasible integration. In this paper, we propose two tunable HGSPPWs fulfilling the requirements. The proposed HGSPPWs consist of a metallic wedge laterally coupled with a dielectric waveguide. The modal characteristics of HGSPPWs are investigated at the optical telecommunication wavelength, which shows the modal characteristics could be effectively controlled by tuning the key geometry parameters and structure of HGSPPWs. The propagation length could achieve the centimeter scale while maintaining the propagation mode size at the deep-subwavelength scale (similar to lambda(2)/10(5)). The studies on fabrication tolerance and waveguide crosstalk show their robust property for practical implementations. The effective tunable mechanism is also proposed and studied, which shows remarkable feasibility to realize multifunctional plasmon-based photonic components. Compared with the conventional HGSPPWs, the proposed HGSPPWs exhibit superior features in ultralow loss deep-subwavelength light guiding, are highly reliable, and are easy to integrate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
249,"A proof of concept for a novel approach towards enantiomerically highly enriched acyclic secondary amines and beta-aminothiols as non-cyclic target molecules when starting from 3-thiazolines as heterocycles is presented.

250,"The minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) is one of the crucial and substantial parameters in the gas injection projects for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This parameter indicates the minimum pressure at constant temperature and composition conditions for reaching 100 percent of the oil production recovery, which leads to a huge economic income. Therefore, an inaccurate prediction of the MMP may lead to increase the costs of oil production. Among the various methods for prediction of the MMP: slim-tube experiment, slim-tube simulation techniques and their simplified cell-to-cell could be considered as the most accurate methods. Although the experimental methods for calculation of the MMP take into account the real crude oil, but they are always expensive; therefore, thermodynamic simulation is a better way for the estimation of this parameter. Indeed, the analytical methods are fast and some of them like multiple mixing-cell method used in this study lead to the reliable results and often show good agreements with the experimental methods. A combination of multiple mixing-cell model proposed by Ahmadi-Johns and pressure-temperature (P-T) flash calculations including the PC-SAFT equation of state (EoS), and the cubic equations of state of Peng-Robinson (PR) and Esmaeilzadeh-Roshanfekr (ER) were used in this work for the prediction of MMP. The overall AAD% of the PC-SAFT, PR and ER EoSs were 3.49%, 6.32% and 7.59%, respectively. It is concluded that the SAFT EoS can decrease the AAD of MMP calculation by about 50%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In toluene, a weakly polar solvent, the emission originates from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state; in tetrahydrofuran (THF), a strongly polar solvent, the existence of a nonradiative channel from ICT to twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) accelerates the relaxation rate of the ICT state. The rate of the evolution process of ATT-(1-3) increases with increasing number of donor branches, which could ascribed to enhancements in the electron donor and acceptor abilities of the triazines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
259,"Cabbage waste (CW), as one important source of vegetable wastes, was a potential alternative for the biogas production due to the readily biodegradable properties. Therefore, optimization of acidogenesis of CW in two-stage process was studied in leaching bed reactor (LBR). The main influential parameters such as regulated initial pH and leachate recirculations with different volumes were investigated in this study. Inoculum to substrate ratio (ISR) and sprinkle frequency which had negligible effect on the VFAs production played an important part in the acidification rate. The diversity of microbial community was analyzed and great changes in bacteria and archaea distribution were observed. The relative abundance of acidogenic bacteria increased to 99.8% after acidification, which mainly consisted of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, however, the archaea population was substituted by rapid-growing bacteria and decreased sharply. The optimization of acidogenesis and microbial analysis would provide information on how to operate the LBR efficiently based on the process and microbiological control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

261,"It is of great importance to separate potassium salts from carbonate-based lakes, especially the low-[K+] but high-[Nal brine which has been discovered around the world. Here the phase diagram of the quaternary system Na+, K+/Cl-, CO32--H2O was experimentally studied at 298.15 K via the method of isothermal evaporation, and the results corrected the previous diagram reported by Blasdale (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1923, 45, 2935-2946). The type of salts appeared and their solubility during the evaporation, and the density vs composition diagram and the pH values were plotted based on the experimental data. It was found that there were six invariant points, seven univariant curves, and five crystallization fields in the equilibrium phase diagram. To extract single-salt of potassium, certain areas in the Na+, K+//C1-, C032 --H2O diagram were chosen to be acidified by the compressed CO2, and potassium in the form of KHCO3 was precipitated from the mother solution. The compressed CO2 was able to avoid formation of NaKCO3.6H2O during evaporation of the original system Na+, K+//C1-, CO32--H2O. Based on experiment data, the region area for potassium salt extraction was determined, and this area was suitable for extracting K+ salts from brines with a [Na+/ICl ratio even lower than 0.44. This strategy opened a new way to recovery of potassium with a maximum yield of 59.88% from the carbonate-chloride -based brine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
262,"Anisotropy photoresponse can be effectively achieved based on gradient organic heterojunction. However, the gradient heterojunction has yet been studied due to the complicated process and great random error inside. Especially in the field of transient optics, the light on/off in femto/picosecond range is vitally important for high-speed optical systems, such as application in fiber communications. In this paper, the wedge-structured organic heterojunction was fabricated based on molecular beam epitaxy. The devices were combined with both wedge-structured heterojunction and half-wave plate. When the probe light was tuned to 2.0 eV, a narrow passband was instantly observed once the pump and probe light were perpendicular to each other. The photoresponse can be achieved within 0.84 ps which can tune the optical signals on and off in transient optics. The results have demonstrated an exciting application in photo sensing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is shown that the relaxation of internal atomic positions inhibits fully activated MnO6 Jahn-Teller distortions, as determined by calculating the EFG tensor and the Jahn-Teller distortion parameter.. In fact, a strong correlation between the EFG values, especially at the La site, and the Jahn-Teller distortion was found and used to confirm the importance of an appropriate description of the electron-electron correlations when predicting the ground state properties of LaMnO3 using a GGA + U approximation for the exchange-correlation functional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

265,"Dependence of amplification A of the tunnel current in the electrochemical bridged tunneling junction on the bias voltage V-b, reorganization free energy E-r, the broadening A of the electronic level of the redox molecule (RM) and intensity of the Debye screening in the tunneling gap is studied for the cases of the fully adiabatic and partially adiabatic electron transitions. We consider a one-level single RM within the spin-less model and assume the wide-band approximation for the electronic structure of the working electrodes. It is shown that amplification in the fully and partially adiabatic limits is appreciably smaller than that in the diabatic limit studied earlier [I.G. Medvedev, Electrochim. Acta 186 (2015) 613-623] due to the sufficiently large values of the broadening Delta. It is also shown that, in contrast to the diabatic limit, amplification depends weekly on the asymmetry of the coupling of the RM to the working electrodes. On the other hand, similar to the diabatic limit, amplification as a function of the bias voltage V-b approaches to relatively large values at large values of V-b in the case of the full Debye screening while, in the realistic case of the intermediate Debye screening, amplification increases at first with the increase of V-b, then reaches a maximum value A(max) at some value V-b max and, when V-b farther increases, decreases to A = 1. The functions A(V-b) are calculated for different values of the parameters of the tunneling junction and it is shown that A(max) increases with the increase of E-r and the intensity of Debye screening and decrease with the increase of Delta. The approximate analytical expression which shows in the explicit form the dependence of A on the parameters of the system is presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
266,"The observed linear thermal shifts of ten fluorescence peaks Y-1-Y-10 from room temperature to about 1000 K for Y3Al5O12:Sm3+ (grown by the Czochralski method) were investigated by considering both the static effect owing to lattice thermal expansion and the dynamic effect stemming from electron-phonon interaction. The static effects were acquired by, using the pressure dependences of these fluorescence peak positions. The static effects for the ten fluorescence peaks resulted in thermal blue shift, but the dynamic effects for all peaks except Y-7 led to thermal red shift. The observed nature of thermal shift (i.e. red or blue) of a fluorescence peak was due to competition between the static and dynamic effects. Based on an approximate treatment, the static parameter A (characterizing the static effect) and electron-phonon coupling parameter alpha' (characterizing the dynamic effect) for these fluorescence peaks were estimated in the case where therrhal shift curves from low temperature to near or higher than room temperature were not measured. Parameters A for all fluorescence peaks and alpha' for all peaks except Y-7 were comparable in sign and magnitude with those of the sharp luminescence peaks of other rare earth ions in crystals and so were deemed to be reasonable. The causes of the exception for alpha' of Y-7 spectral peak (including the very large observed thermal blue shift of this peak) remain unclear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are discussed in terms of the metallocyclic rings, and coordinations are drawn between donor atoms, bond lengths, and interbond angles, with attention to any trans-influence. Distortion isomers, differing only by the degree of distortion in Pt-L and L-Pt-L angles, are the most numerous. In this series of distortion and ligand isomers, the squareplanar configuration about the Pt(II) atom has only cis-configuration.

Multiple spectroscopic techniques, viz. intrinsic and 3-D fluorescence, UV-Vis absorption, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy along with molecular docking were used. Decrease in the Stern-Volmer constant (K-sv) as well as the association constant (K-a) with increase in temperature suggested BrdU-HSA complex formation. Intermediate binding affinity between BrdU and HSA was evident from the K-a values (2.49-3.97 x 10(4) mol(-1) dm(3)), while BrdU-HSA complex formation was driven by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions along with hydrogen bonds, as revealed by thermodynamic data (Delta S = + 28.48 J mol(-1) K-1; Delta H = - 17.16 kJ mol(-1)). Minor changes occur in both secondary and tertiary structures as well as in the fluorophores' microenvironment of HSA, as recognized from the CD spectral results in the far-UV and the near-UV regions and 3-D fluorescence spectra, respectively. Use of site markers (warfarin and indomethacin for site I; diazepam for site II) as well as docking results suggested BrdU binding to both site I (more preferred) and site II, located in subdomains IIA and IIIA, respectively, of HSA.

Salicylic acid was complexed with phospholipid through simple mixing and incorporated into carbopol 940 gel containing drug-loaded vesicles, prepared by thin-film hydration method. The morphology, physicochemical properties, rheological behavior, release profile, and dermatokinetics of developed gel were compared with control gel (developed gel without keratolytic agent). In ex vivo drug release studies across the rat skin, there was significant increase in the steady-state permeation flux (J(ss)) and skin retention of drug from developed gel in comparison with control. Therewas favorable change in almost every evaluated dermatokinetic parameter. The innocuous nature of control gel had not changed on addition of skin structure-altering agent.

Two minima were found on the potential energy surface (PES) for each complex, one in which HF is forming directly an H-bond with pnicogen while the other one in which HF is interacting with the heterocyclic ring in addition to normal H-bond. The latter one is highly stable with MP2/CBS extrapolated binding energies ranging from -10.67 kcal mol(-1) to -6.33 kcal mol(-1). The interaction energies in these complexes follow the order P-PyrHF > P-ThioHF > P-FuHF > P-PyHF > As-PyrHF > As-ThioHF > As-FuHF > As-PyHF. NBO analysis demonstrated that LPAs/P -> sigma H-F orbital interaction plays a major role in stabilizing these complexes, and the largest charge is transferred in P-type complexes compared with their As-type analogs.

Material safety should be considered in biomedical devices, but the effectiveness of electrospun nanofibers is limited with only the approved chemicals. Therefore, we considered the material in FDA-approved polymers and solvents and developed nanofibers using the general additives in the pharmaceutical industry, such as hypromellose, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and Gellan. The nanofiber, mainly composed of hypromellose and PVA, was applied to a local peptide drug delivery system. Electrostatically complexed Gellan and peptide were loaded in the nanofiber by co-electrospinning. The morphology of the nanofibers with different PVA blending ratios was visualized by scanning electron microscope. The nanofiber composed of only hydrophilic polymers quickly wetted in water and became a transparent gel-like lump. A drug release test of peptide-loaded nanofiber was performed resulted in 37% of initial burst release suppression with the gellan and peptide loaded nanofiber compared with solely peptide loaded hypromellose nanofiber. In addition, higher PVA blending to hypromellose was slightly effective for sustained release of peptide compared with pure peptide-loaded hypromellose nanofiber.

A second band at ca. 300 nm is much weaker and largely obscured by the pi-pi* band. This second band is assigned to an IL n-pi* transition. Both complex anions exhibit a photoluminescence (fluorescence), which originates from the n-pi* state. The position of the n-pi* state is recognized by the excitation band which distinctly overlaps with the fluorescence band.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

292,"DNA levels in mitochondria are closely related to serious genetic diseases, but their inherently low levels and high dynamic changes, present great obstacles to the precise detection of trace changes of DNA content in mitochondria, especially for living cells. This work aims to precisely detect DNA in mitochondria of living cells, by using ultrasmall fluorescent hybrid Ag2Se-imide nanodots (NDs) ( < 3.0 nm, negative surface charge zeta = - 29.2 mV) with signal amplification. The hybrid NDs are constructed by integrating naphthalene fluorophore in the Ag2Se core with a modified layer of chitooligosaccharide and bovine serum albumin (ACBH). The lowest detection for DNA is as low as 107.5 ng mL(-1). On the basis of multiple synergistic interactions, ACBH can specifically bind to mitochondrial DNA of living cells. ACBH can also emit an amplified signal (163-fold), which is beneficial for sensitivity analysis. Given its high sensitivity and selectivity, as well as signal amplification, ACBH can be used to in situ image trace DNA in the mitochondria of living cells. In particular, ACBH has been successfully used to sort different cell cycle stages under high-throughput. We expect the proposed ACBH probe to provide comprehensive information for the analysis of trace DNA in mitochondria and guide the early diagnosis of mitochondria-related genetic diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
293,"Drug resistance is a major challenge in antineoplastic chemotherapy, which could be possibly solved through multifunctional anti-cancer therapy. This study constructs a drug delivery system with Zn(II)-Co(II) bimetal-organic framework nanoparticles with encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX), a model chemotherapeutic molecule. Beyond conventional therapeutic mechanisms powered by DOX, the newly applied Co(II) to the drug delivery system catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a Fenton-like process, leading to necrosis due to oxidative stress beyond threshold. The system displayed DOX-based and Co(II)-based dual mechanism anti-cancer therapy to overcome DOX-resistance while demonstrating significant cytotoxicity promotion in non-resistant cell lines, as effects of ROS were further acknowledged by following cell characteristic examinations. This bifunctional DOX-encapsulated bimetal-organic framework nanoparticle opens a new strategy to construct multiple anti-cancer mechanism drug delivery systems with great simplicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
294,"The equilibrium solubility of gatifloxacin in four nonaqueous solvent mixtures of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF,1) + methanol (2), DMF (1) + ethanol (2), DMF (1) + isopropanol (2), and DMF (1) + n-propanol (2) was studied at the temperatures from 273.15 to 318.15 K under a local pressure of 101.1 kPa. The solubility values of gatifloxacin increased with an increase of the mass fraction of DMF and temperature for each system. At the same DMF composition and temperature, the mole fraction solubility of gatifloxacin was largest in the DMF (1) + n-propanol (2) mixture. The attained solubility was represented mathematically by the Jouyban-Acree, van't Hoff-Jouyban-Acree, and Apelblat-Jouyban-Acree models acquiring average relative deviations smaller than 2.49% and root-mean-square deviation smaller than 1.15 X 10(-4).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the calculated results, the negative parity is from the contribution of the proton of the f(5/2), p(3/2), and p(1/2) orbits. The moderate spin states of Nb-90 are mainly due to the excitation of protons from the f(5/2) and p(3/2) orbits to the p(1/2) and g(9/2) orbits across the Z = 38 subshell closure, and the high spin states arise from the excitation of a single neutron from the g(9/2) orbit into the d(5/2) orbit across the N = 50 shell closure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
296,"Electrode-electrolyte interface, where the electrochemical reaction happens, plays an importantrole in the investigation of electrochemical mechanism. The traditional electrochemical techniques pay more attention on the charge transfer process happened on the electrode. However, they cannot provide information of the electrode-electrolyte interface at molecular level. How to realize the in-situ electrochemical monitoring of the intermediates on the electrode-electrolyte interface during redox reaction is of great significance to the study of electrochemical mechanism. In this work, electrochemical reaction of coenzyme Q(0) (CoQ(0)) on the gold electrode was studied by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). A high vacuum compatible microfluidic electrochemical cell was fabricated for the electrochemical study of CoQ(0). Then, a micro-hole with diameter of 2 mu m was fabricated on the electrochemical cell by the primary ion beam of ToF-SIMS for the subsequent analysis. To evaluate the feasibility of ToF-SIMS for liquid sample measurement, the chemical distribution of CoQ(0) and the SiN- around the micro-hole were measured. The stable distribution of CoQ(0) and the SiN- during the ToF-SIMS measurement indicated that the microfluidic electrochemical cell was compatible for the in-situ detection of the electrode-electrolyte interface in high vacuum environment (1 x 10(-5) Pa). Electrochemical behavior of CoQ(0) in the electrochemical cell was further studied. The variations of CoQ(0), CoQ(0)H(2) and related intermediate at different potentials agreed well with the electrochemical reaction of CoQ(0) in aqueous solution, which showed that the direct molecular evidence of the electrode-electrolyte interface was obtained. The direct monitoring of electrode-electrolyte interface by ToF-SIMS revealed the electrochemical evolution on the electrode at molecular level, which was of great potential for the detailed understanding of the electrochemical reaction mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lower ordered smectic phase of SmA emerged in a very wide temperature range of 130 degrees C in all DBN derivatives, which allowed us to study the carrier transport properties in SmA phase in detail for the first time: we purified Cl-DBN-C10 enough to evaluate the carrier transport property in the SmA phase by time-of-flight method. It showed the temperature and electric field dependence of the mobility, indicating the energetic disorder of transport levels. We analyzed it within the framework of the Gaussian disorder model for electrons and obtained a Gaussian width of the density of states to 109meV in the SmA.

299,"The cationic water-pillar[5] arene (CP5A) modified zeolite (NZ) was prepared for adsorption of anionic dye bromocresol purple (BCP). The CP5A/NZ was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The effects of NZ particle size, concentration of CP5A during modification, adsorption time, initial BCP concentration and solution pH on the removal percentage of BCP were studied. In addition, the kinetics and adsorption isotherms of BCP adsorption by CP5A/NZ were also analyzed, and the adsorption mechanism was discussed. SEM showed that the scaly structure of the NZ disappeared after CP5A modification, showing an enlarged bulk structure. The vibration of CH3-N+ and -CH2-N+ in CP5A appeared in the CP5A/NZ. XRD revealed that the zeolite had different crystal structure after CP5A modification, and all of the above phenomena indicated that CP5A was successfully loaded into the NZ. Adsorption studies showed that due to charge repulsion, NZ had no scavenging ability to BCP. However, when CP5A solution (10 g/L) was used to modify NZ in the range of 0.42-0.59 nm, the removal percentage of BCP was 93.98%, and the adsorption reached equilibrium in 300 min. CP5A/NZ had a high removal percentage when treated with low concentrations (< 100 mg/L) of BCP solution. The second-order kinetic equation and the Langmuir isotherm could better fit the adsorption process of CP5A/NZ to BCP. The adsorption mechanism of CP5A/NZ on BCP could be described as follows: after the cation exchange of CH2-N+ with NZ in CP5A, -CH2-N+ bound to the negative potential point on the surface of NZ, which increased the positive charge activity adsorption site of NZ surface, and thus the anion dye BCP had good scavenging ability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this complex, the CdII centres are connected by the carboxylate ligands to form two-dimensional wave-like layers, which are pillared by bpy ligands and extended into a rare three-dimensional (3,6)-connected sqc27 framework. The complex demonstrated good water stability and strong luminescence emissions. It not only possesses excellent luminescence sensing activities toward Fe3+ and Cr2O72 in aqueous solution, but can also distinguish between Cr2O72 and CrO42 by luminescence. Furthermore, it could be simply and quickly regenerated at least five times.

The wear rate of this specimen was also lower than that of the forged sample at the same temperature and loading force.

With an average absolute error less than 10 kJ mol(-1), all five methodologies yielded mutually comparable results. Considering low computational cost of semiempirical methods, the influence of structural features on Delta H-f degrees of PAPs was investigated using the PM5 and PM7 methods. It was found that the greatest influence on Delta H-f degrees has the size of the molecules, while the effects of other properties, i.e., the position of the OH group, number of bay regions, and molecular branching are weaker. The influence of the OH group position decreases with its moving away from molecular ends, and eventually becomes insignificant. As branching and the number of bay regions are mutually dependent and respective molecules are often nonplanar, it is difficult to examine individual contributions of these two structural features.

306,"The degradation temperatures (DTs), heat stability (IPDT), degradation kinetics, and water uptake of epoxy resin were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis. Epoxy resins were prepared by crosslinking epoxydized oils with vital wheat gluten (VG) and millet flour. The reactions included three oils (cottonseed, sesame, and sunflower) and three levels of zinc chloride (ZC) (1, 2, and 3%). The apparent activation energy (E-a) was calculated using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method. The DT increased at higher heating rates within the same ZC level of the same oil type. Cottonseed oil exhibited the highest DT. The highest IPDT was 637 degrees C of the sunflower oil/millet resin (3% ZC), and the least was the cottonseed/millet (1% ZC) at 479 degrees C. The sesame-millet resin exhibited the highest E-a (622 KJ/mol) followed by sunflower-gluten (496 KJ/mol) and sesame-gluten (454 KJ/mol). The profiles of all resins point to a multistep degradation, but some of the profiles display two dominant kinetic processes, and the remaining resins showed three processes. The variation in crosslinking density between the oils is attributable to the different amounts of oxirane rings which are associated with the double bonds of the fatty acid of the oils. Like other parameters, the water uptake was affected by the ZC content, where most of the resins did not reach water uptake equilibrium. Nonetheless, the 3% ZC resin reached equilibrium after 5 days of immersion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the presence of concentration of calcium ions is known to work as a trigger for the Cx functionality, the structural changes induced by calcium binding still need to be well elucidated. In this computational study, we have explored the structural effects promoted by Ca2+ on both the wild type (Cx26WT) and on two post-translationally modified Connexin 26 (Cx26): Cx26E42-47 gamma, which contains two glutamates (E42 and E47) that are gamma-carboxylated and Cx26R75m, where a key arginine (R75) is N-monomethylated. These modified amino acids, whose forcefield parameters have been developed in this work, alter Cx26 structure around the Ca(2+)coordination site. Structural changes were assessed from the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We observed a strict relation between the chemical properties of the post-translational modifications and significantly different responses of Cx26 to Ca2+-binding, while charge-adding modifications have destabilising effects upon calcium coordination, the uncharged ones share the same structural properties of the wild-type counterpart. Overall, these findings suggest the critical role of the electrostatic network flanking the Ca2+ coordination site in maintaining the native tertiary and quaternary structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stabilization affected by the intramolecular charge separation established by PhBPPh3 ligands dramatically increases the robustness of these seventeen-electron Cr(i) complexes. Previous attempts to isolate salts of mer/fac-[Cr(CO)(3)P-3](+) were frustrated by the thermal instability of these cations. The EPR spectroscopic data of Cr(CO)(3)(PhBPPh3) supports Rieger's hypothesized low temperature preparation of fac-[Cr(CO)(3){CH3C(CH2PPh2)(3)}](+). The robust [Cr(CO)(3)P-3](+) unit of Cr(CO)(3)(PhBPPh3) motivated the preparation of structurally characterized Cr(0)/Cr(i) (Cr(CO)(3){eta (6)-(PhBPPh3)Cr(CO)(3)}, Cr(CO)(3){eta (6)-(((3,5-CH3)C6H3)BPPh3)Cr(CO)(3)}) and W(0)/Cr(i) (W(CO)(3){eta (6)-(((3,5-CH3)C6H3)BPPh3)Cr(CO)(3)}) complexes. While these bimetallics feature classical kappa (3)-phosphine and eta (6)-arene metal-binding, they are noteworthy since all other reported mixed-valent Cr(0)/Cr(i) complexes exhibit (a) significant thermal instability that has precluded their isolation and (b) greater uncertainty regarding the presence of distinct Cr(i) and Cr(0) centers.

The most stable structures of these clusters are triplet except for the Li2O2 monomer. In the Li2O2 monomer, the closed shell singlet is strongly favored. There are superoxide-like characteristics in terms of bond lengths and spin in the stoichiometric peroxide lithium clusters, which may have implications for the formation and decomposition of peroxide lithium in Li-O-2 batteries.

In addition, the values of energy gaps for the (Li2O2)(n) clusters are much smaller than the band gap of bulk phase, and thus the (Li2O2)(n) cluster can enhance the electron conductivity in the peroxide lithium. The frontier molecular orbitals analysis indicates that there are pi* antibonding on the surface of (Li2O2)(n) clusters, making their structures more stable.

312,"Carbon nanotube-based semiconductors are of great interest for optoelectronic applications at the nanoscale. The present study investigates the structural, optoelectronic and charge transport properties of non-covalent complexes formed between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and quaterthiophene (4T) by employing dispersion-corrected density functional methods. The effect of different functionals viz., B97-D, B3LYP-GD3 and omega B97X-D on the properties of endo- and exohedral complexes is examined. The endohedral complex (4T@CNT) is found to be energetically more stable than the exohedral one (4T-CNT). Electronic properties such as the ionization energy, electron affinity and energy gap between the frontier molecular orbitals of the CNT are not significantly changed by the adsorption or the encapsulation of 4T. Contrary to the p-type characteristics of 4T, its complexes formed with CNTs exhibit n-type characteristics due to the higher electron mobility than the hole mobility. Among the endo- and exohedral complexes, the former one shows the highest electron mobility of 3.79 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The absorption properties of all the systems were studied by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). It is found that the complexes undergo several charge transfer transitions in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The above results unequivocally suggest that the charge-transfer characteristics of 4T can be altered on forming complexes with CNTs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

316,"From the NIST website and the literature, we have collected the Ionisation Energies (IE) of 3,052 and the Proton Affinities (PA) of 1,670 compounds. For 614 of these, both the IE and PA are known; this enables a study of the relationships between these quantities for a wide variety of molecules. From the IE and PA values, the hydrogen atom affinities (HA) of molecular ions M center dot+ may also be assessed. The PA may be equated to the heterolytic bond energy of [MH](+) and HA to the homolytic bond energy. Plots of PA versus IE for these substances show (in agreement with earlier studies) that, for many families of molecules, the slope of the ensuing line is less negative than -1, i.e. changes in the PA are significantly less than the concomitant opposite changes in IE. At one extreme (high PA, low IE) are the metals, their oxides and hydroxides, which show a slope of close to -1, at the other extreme (low PA, high IE) are the hydrogen halides, methyl halides and noble gases, which show a slope of ca. -0.3; other molecular categories show intermediate behaviour. One consequence of a slope less negative than -1 is that the changes in ionic enthalpies of the protonated species more closely follow the changes in the enthalpies of the neutral molecules compared with changes in the ion enthalpies of the corresponding radical cations. This is consistent with findings from ab initio calculations from the literature that the incoming proton, once attached to the molecule, may retain a significant amount of its charge. These collected data allow a comparison of the thermodynamic stability of protonated molecules in terms of their homolytic or heterolytic bond cleavages. Protonated nitriles are particularly stable by virtue of the very large hydrogen atom affinities of their radical cations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total analysis run time was 3.5 min and the elution time of loratadine and diazepam occurred at 1.1 and 2.1 min, respectively. This method has the advantages of higher sensitivity (0.04 ng mL(-1)), wider linear range (0.04-400 ng mL(-1), r(2) > 0.995), shorter analysis time (3.5 min), needing only a smaller plasma volume (50 mu L) and simple preparation process.

318,"Organic contamination has been recognized as a matter of concern, and simultaneous monitoring of various organic contaminants in the complex environment has always been a part of the efforts of scientists. In the present study, settled house dust (SHD) was selected to establish HPLC fingerprint method for simultaneously evaluating organic matters in an indoor environment. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the relative retention time (RRT) and relative peak area (RPA) for precision were 2.46% and 0.47%, respectively, while the RSDs of RRT and RPA for repeatability were 2.51% and 0.50%, respectively, and for stability within 24 h were 2.51% and 0.49%, respectively, which indicated good reliability of the method. Then, the method was used to evaluate the trend of indoor organic matters of Yunyan district (urban) and Gangou village (rural) from 2012 to 2014. The results showed the overall organic matters of Yunyan did not change significantly within 2 years, while the organic matters of Gangou village were a little aggravated by the appearance of some suspicious matters.

320,"The array of analytes that can be measured by MADLI MS has created an equally vast range of calibration mixtures. The inherent problem with this is that acquiring all of them at commercial rates can be prohibitively expensive. With this in mind, we have created a low-cost alternative to the most commonly used peptide calibrants. We were able to achieve an overall 78 ppm mass accuracy across a mass range of 900 to 2500 Da which was comparable to the mass accuracy achievable with commercial peptide mixes and hence has become a viable alternative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
321,"Since the pioneering works by Nomikos and MacGregor, the Batch Multivariate Statistical Process Control (BMSPC) methodology has been extensively revised, and a sheer number of alternative monitoring approaches have been suggested. The different approaches vary in the batch data alignment, the pre-processing approach, the data arrangement, and/or the type of model used, from two-way to three-way and from linear to nonlinear. One of the most accepted pre-processing schemes, referred to as the trajectory centering and scaling (TCS), is based on the normalization to zero mean and unit variance around the average trajectory. However, the main drawback of TCS is the inherent increase of the level of uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters. In this work, we illustrate how to improve parameter estimation while maintaining the good properties of this pre-processing approach. This enhancement is achieved with the new pre-processing approach we call PARAMO, which uses more observations than TCS to estimate the pre-processing parameters. We show that this improvement favorably impacts the performance of the monitoring system. The results of this research work affect a large amount of the monitoring approaches proposed to date, and we advocate that the pre-processing procedure proposed here should be generally applied in BMSPC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

323,We use electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) to image single-crystal surfaces of the layered bismuth chalcogenide Sn0.01Bi1.99Te2Se in situ under electrochemical control for the first time. The Bi chalcogenides are of interest for their thermoelectric properties and as model topological insulators (TIs). We show that oxidative dissolution takes place via the progressive nucleation of pits in the initially smooth surface terraces rather than at their edges. Nanometer-resolution EC-STM images show that the pit depth is generally equal to the thickness of a complete chalcogenide quintuple layer. The preferential redeposition of dissolved components at step and defect edges on application of a more negative potential after oxidation is observed. Our work demonstrates the ability to control and characterize the surface morphology of single-crystal TIs in an electrochemical environment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Al3+ doping suppresses the ferromagnetic metal phase of La0.6Ca0.4MnO3-delta by weakening the double-exchange interaction of Mn3+-O2--Mn4+, leading to a phase separation state. Al3+ doping dependent irreversible metamagnetic transitions are observed at lower temperatures, especially a martensitic-like transition appears in x = 0.125 and 0.15 system below 4.2 K. Phase diagrams of La0.6Ca0.4Mn1-xAlxO3-delta (0.1 <= x <= 0.15) in the B-T plane are presented, in which the antiferromagnetic insulator and ferromagnetic metal phases boundary is figured out. The antiferromagnetic matrix and magnetic disorders caused by the random distribution of Al3+ ions and the spontaneous oxygen vacancies grow into a pinning center to pin the Mn moments. As magnetic field is increased to the critical field, the localized magnetic moments rotate to parallel to the magnetic field direction, leading to a martensitic-like transition.

We investigate these bonds locally using a probe programmed as a virtual molecule. Unlike the hydrogen bond, electric fields are detected having strengths that are different from the sum of the separated parts, meaning that molecular electrostatic potential surfaces analysis of the different parts are not enough to analyze the bonds. Based on an application of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which states that intermolecular bonds are fully described by Coulombian interactions (electrostatic plus polarization), we connect the electric field strength with the bond strength measured in experiments, so that it can be considered as a quantifier for the bonds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

333,"Thermal analyses, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dilatometry, reveal an important anomaly at low temperature for Au-25 wt.% Cu composition after homogenization at 700 degrees C during 2 hours under vacuum followed by heating up to 160 degrees C before water quenching. This anomaly has been already observed and not explained. Surface characterization, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), exhibits a specific topography, consisting of a nanostructured surface. The precipitates of nanostructured particles are homogeneously scattered all over the surface for this 18-carat gold alloy. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the composition of the observed particles corresponds to cuprous oxide phase (Cu2O). The formation of such material can be explained by the diffusion of copper atoms from the lattice to the surface at 160 degrees C. Pulsed radio-frequency glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (RF GD-OES) further proves the proposed Cu2O formation through a diffusion process. The appearance of such cuprous oxide nanoparticles on the Au-Cu alloy surface explains the low-temperature DSC and dilatometry anomaly and affects directly the surface electrical resistance at low temperature. These results might open a large gate for new ideas to investigate in catalytic, electronic, and antimicrobial activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
334,"BACKGROUND Materials from renewable sources are in great demand to reduce carbon fingerprint. Olive pomace is a waste with high lignin content (>25%) and generated in high volumes. Therefore lignin from olive pomace is susceptible to be transformed into added value chemicals such as monomeric phenols through its catalytic depolymerization combining hydrogen donors (i.e. molecular hydrogen, polar protic solvents and formic acid) and catalysts based on transition metals (i.e. palladium and ruthenium supported on carbon, and SHVO catalyst, also ruthenium-based). RESULTS The reaction conditions for the nitrogen and hydrogen experiments were temperatures of 250 and 200 degrees C and initial pressures of 4 and 20 bar respectively. The bio-oil obtained after the catalytic process was approximately half of the initial sample weight, although somewhat lower under hydrogen conditions. The SHVO catalyst yielded 15 and 10% of monomeric phenols under nitrogen and hydrogen conditions respectively, while the other two catalysts yielded between 6 and 9% irrespective of the gas. CONCLUSION Overall, the SHVO catalyst provided a richer mixture of phenolic compounds owing to its milder hydrogenation activity compared with the other catalysts, although at the end of the reaction the catalyst did not preserve its native form. The use of formic acid under nitrogen atmosphere was advantageous to increase the yields of phenols. The most abundant monomers in the experiments using SHVO catalyst under both atmospheres were 4-propylguaiacol, (Z)-propenylguaiacol, 4-propylsyringol, dihydroconiferyl alcohol, (Z)-propenylsyringol and dihydrosinapyl alcohol.

335,"While variation of the energy functional yields the Schrodinger equation in the usual, linear case, no such statement can be formulated in the general nonlinear situation when the Hamiltonian depends on its eigenvector. In this latter case, as we illustrate by sample numerical calculations, the points of the energy expectation value hypersurface where the eigenvalue equation is satisfied separate from those where the energy is stationary. We show that the variation of the energy at the eigensolution is determined by a generalized Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Functionals, other than the energy, can, however be constructed, that result the nonlinear Schrodinger equation upon setting their variation zero. The second centralized moment of the Hamiltonian is one example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

339,"The electronic structure and spectroscopy of some representative dinuclear compounds containing CpM(CO)(3) and CpM(CO)(2) groups were studied using TDDFT (Time Dependent Density Functional Theory). These compounds contain Cp (cyclopentadienyl) as a ligand, and M can be Cr, Mo or W. Their main electronic transitions were calculated and the results are in good agreement with the experimental data. This allows the assignment of some bands whose origin was not clear. In all the cases, the carbonyls and Cp groups restrict the symmetry. The molecular orbitals that would be involved in M-M bonding interact strongly with the carbonyls and show unusual shapes and occupations. The strongest electronic bands are caused by sigma ->sigma* transitions in most of the molecules containing CpM(CO)(3) groups, whereas in molecules such as Cp(CO)(2)M equivalent to M(CO)(2)Cp the most intense bands are produced by pi ->pi* transitions. The origin of other bands is now explained.

341,"Many functional materials have relatively low decomposition temperatures (T <= 400 degrees C), which makes their synthesis challenging using conventional high-temperature solid-state chemistry. Therefore, non-conventional techniques such as metathesis, hydrothermal, and solution chemistry are often employed to access low-temperature phases; the discovery of new chemistries is needed to expand access to these phases. This contribution discusses the use of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) as a molten flux to synthesize superconducting iron selenide (Fe1+delta Se) at low temperature (T = 325 degrees C). Powder X-ray diffraction and magnetism measurements confirm the successful formation of superconducting iron selenide while nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and in situ X-ray diffraction show that the formation of superconducting FeSe at low temperatures is enabled by an adduct between the triphenylphosphine and selenium. Exploration of the Fe-Se-PPh3 phase space indicates that the PPh3-Se adduct effectively reduces the chemical potential of the selenium at high concentrations of triphenylphosphine. This contribution demonstrates that the use of a poorly-solvating yet reactive flux has the potential to enable the synthesis of new low-temperature phases of solid materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

345,"Understanding the physical nature behind experimental phenomena is rather significant to further optimize the performance of a material. Now, density functional theory (DFT) has become a well-accepted tool for unveiling the origin of physical/chemical properties of materials and designing new materials with desirable properties. Recently, two novel POXD-based (N-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-diphenylphosphinic amide) iridium(iii) complexes 1 and 4 with different cyclometalated ligands showed significant performance differences. Herein, we employ DFT calculations to investigate the electronic structures, absorption and emission spectra, and charge transportation properties of iridium(iii) complexes 1 and 4. In comparison with 4, the good performance of 1 can be attributed to its favorable charge transport properties. Based on complex 1, two new iridium complexes (2 and 3) were theoretically designed by substituting phenyl rings with a tert-butyl group (-t-Bu) and methyl group (-CH3), respectively. The results clearly indicated that the -t-Bu and -CH3 groups enhance the hole and electron injection abilities and improve the charge balance. On the other hand, the designed complexes 2 and 3 also show a blue-shift in emission spectra with respect to complex 1. As a result, complexes 2 and 3 are expected to be promising phosphorescence emitters with good device performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of novel amide-sulfonamide derivatives were investigated for their gas-phase fragmentation behaviors using electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in negative ion mode. Upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), deprotonated amide-sulfonamides mainly underwent either an elimination of the amine to form the sulfonyl anion and amide anion or a benzoylamide derivative to provide sulfonamide anion bearing respective substituent groups. Based on the characteristic fragment ions and the deuterium-hydrogen exchange experiments, three possible fragmentation mechanisms corresponding to ion-neutral complexes including [sulfonyl anion/amine] complex (INC-1), [sulfonamide anion/benzoylamide derivative] complex (INC-2) and [amide anion/sulfonamide] complex (INC-3), respectively, were proposed. These three ion-neutral complexes might be produced by the cleavages of S-N and C-N bond from the amide-sulfonamides, which generated the sulfonyl anion (Route 1), sulfonamide anion (Route 2) and the amide anion (Route 3).

350,"Recently a nanorod-to-nanodot reversible transformation was reported by Niya et al. in case of nano-ZnO colloidal dispersion. The reversibility of this transformation, coupled with the need for a specific surfactant and solvent, indicates thermo-chemical origins of the phenomenon. Results indicate that surfactants play a critical role in the process. However, an explanation for this phenomena has not been reported yet. In this work, we derive and develop the chemical potential expressions that capture the roles played by surface-interactions, in driving this reversible transformation. Equations associated with both the dot (spherical) and rod (cylindrical) morphologies are reported. Using agent based modelling, and realistic parameters, we indeed observe a temperature induced morphology transformation that is consistent with experiment. The transition temperature is shown to vary slowly for a wide range of surfactant-surface chemistries and surface charges, which are parametrically captured. We indicate that such rod-to-dot transitions in colloids can be expected across other compositions as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It constitutes the fifth member of the homologous series of the trigonal (space group R (3) over barc) compounds Rb-2n(Mo9S11)(Mo6nS6n+2). Consequently, its crystal structure is based on an equal mixture of Mo9S11 and Mo30S32 cluster units interlinked through Mo-S bonds with the Rb+ cations localized in the voids between the Mo9S11 and Mo30S32 units.

The formation, crystal chemistry, and physical properties of U2Ni21B6 and Nb3-yNi20+yB6 [ternary derivatives of the cubic Cr23C6-type (cF116, Fm3m)] have been studied; the formation of the hypothetical ""U3Ni20B6"" and ""Nb2Ni21B6"" has been disproved. U2Ni21B6 [a = 10.6701(2) angstrom] crystallizes in the ordered W2Cr21C6-type, whereas Nb3-yNi20+yB6 [a = 10.5842(1) angstrom] adopts the Mg3Ni20B6-type. Ni in U2Ni21B6 can be substituted by U, leading to the solid solution U2-xNi21+yB6 (0 <= x <= 0.3); oppositely, Nb in Nb3Ni20B6 is partially replaced by Ni, forming the solution Nb3-yNi20+yB6 (0 <= y <= 0.5), none of them reaching the limit corresponding to the hypothetically ordered ""U3Ni20B6 "" and ""Nb2Ni21B6"". These results prompted us to investigate quaternary compounds U2-zNbzNi21B6 and U6Nb3-delta Ni20B6: strong competition in the occupancy of the 4a and 8c sites by U, Nb, and Ni atoms has been observed, with the 4a site occupied by U/Ni atoms only and the 8c site filled by U/Nb atoms only. U2Ni21B6, U2.3Ni20.7B6, and Nb3Ni20B6 are Pauli paramagnets. Interestingly, Nb2.5Ni20.5B6 shows ferromagnetism with T-c approximate to 11 K; the Curie-Weiss fit gives an effective magnetic moment of 2.78 mu(B)/Ni, suggesting that all Ni atoms in the formula unit contribute to the total magnetic moment. The M(H) data at 2 K further corroborate the ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation moment of 10 mu(B)/fu (approximate to 0.49 mu(B)/Ni). The magnetic moment of Ni at the 4a site induces a moment in all of the Ni atoms of the whole unit cell (32f and 48h sites), with all atoms ordering ferromagnetically at 11 K. Density functional theory (DFT) shows that the formation of U2Ni21B6 and Nb3Ni20B6 is energetically preferred. The various electronic states generating ferromagnetism on Nb2.5Ni20.5B6 and Pauli paramagnetism on U2Ni21B6 and Nb3Ni20B6 have been identified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
359,"The objective of this study is to determine if men would follow the ""red effect"" when choosing colors for women to wear on a date, and also to determine if the colors that men would wear when going on a date would be the same as the colors that females (their date) would wish them to wear. A set of psychophysical data was generated from this experiment, where participants were asked to rank a set of 10 colored samples based on preference for each question asked. There were three different sets of colored samples. The set of colored samples given to the participant depended on the question. A total of five questions were asked. Scaling analysis was done on the data to organize a set of items according to preferences providing values, an interval scale (Z values), that correspond to the relative perceptual differences among the stimuli. The Z values were graphed to show the general preference of colors for women to wear, and the preference of colors for men to wear. A Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient (SRCC) was calculated comparing each individual's rank order with the mean rank order for that specific question. An average Spearman's rank order was calculated for each question and each gender in order to determine the variability in answers. Scaling results indicate that men follow the ""red effect,"" but women preferred to wear other colors such as turquoise, blue, or yellow depending on the outfit. Males and females agreed that no matter the colored bottoms (denim or black), blue was the preferred color top for men to wear. SRCC results showed a lot of variability between individual answers and the mean answer indicating that participants' rankings did not necessarily agree with general color preferences presented in the scaling analysis. While scaling analysis might suggest certain color preferences such as men following the ""red effect"" and women preferring to wear blue, the poor correlation found using SRCC between the individual answers and the mean rank orders suggests that color preferences for each individual are inherently unique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
360,"It is important to determine the time-dependent evolution of the excited monolayer WS2, which will provide a basis for the reasonable design of optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. Here, we made a simple and large-area photodetector based on the monolayer WS2, with high light sensitivity and fast response, benefiting from the special dynamics of carrier involving the exciton, trion, and charge. Moreover, we tested the relaxation behavior of the excited monolayer WS2 by employing transient absorption (TA). It was found that the multi-body interaction among exciton would occur after the density of pump photon increases to 3.45 x 10(14) photons per cm(2). The exciton dissociation accompanying the generation of trion would appear in the photo-induced relaxation process, which would be a benefit for the operation of this photodetector. Increasing the energy of the exciton is good for the generation of carrier by comparing the relaxation behavior of WS2 excited to A and B exciton states. However, the bound exciton relaxation, originating from the capture process of the defect state, would exist and play an unfavorable role during the functioning of devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
361,"An ion-controllable molecular switch comprising a tetracationic cyclophane (CBPQT(4+)) macroring bound to [2]pseudorotaxanes has been investigated by density functional theory. The role of noncovalent interactions has been assessed with the reduced density gradient method and binding energies. Moreover, the natural bond orbital is used to evaluate the strength of hydrogen bonding, pi-pi and cation-pi interactions. The electrostatic repulsions between the bound K+ ion and tetracationic cyclophane were also calculated. The theoretical calculations confirmed that the 18-crown-6 derivative containing a 1,5-dioxynaphthalene residue station exhibits the strongest binding interaction, and the hydrogen bond and electrostatic forces are prevalent at all stations. These calculated results are in agreement with the hypothesis proposed by Stoddart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
362,"We consider a problem of obtaining information about the scattering potentials of the monolayer graphene sample using available experimental data on its resistance. For this purpose, we study theoretically the dependence of graphene resistance on Fermi energy having in mind to compare it with experimental data where super-high mobility electrons in suspended graphene samples without chemical doping were investigated. As far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the Coulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering potentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The empty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical shortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage of the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We consider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit formulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution of this scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function of the Fermi energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results are consistent with experiment, where the resistance was measured as a function of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene. This fact gives a possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the basis of the available experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with the gate voltage controlled Fermi level position. It is clear to be very important for applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

364,"We calculate vibrational and Raman spectra for B-doped, P-doped, and B-P codoped Si nanocrystals using real-space pseudopotentials constructed within density functional theory. An experimental extrinsic peak in the Raman spectra near 650 cm(-1) is observed in codoped nanocrystals. We analyze the origin of this peak and find that it can be best explained by the presence of B-P bonds, which are located near the surface of the nanocrystal. We propose that the spectral details of this peak are related to quantum confinement and the breaking of local symmetry associated with the phonon modes involving dopant bonds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

366,"The quality of the alignment and adjustment of lower limb prostheses is fundamental in the rehabilitation process, mainly because it contributes to preventing the prostheses from being abandoned. Prosthesis alignment is often performed subjectively based on the experience and knowledge of the healthcare professional. In this work, we present the development of a referenced static alignment equipment for lower limb prostheses. The equipment has an instrumental platform that measures important parameters for suitable alignment of lower limb prostheses, giving the therapist objective data that allow for the best adjustment and alignment of the prosthesis to the individual. The developed system has a novel procedure in the prosthesis adjustment where through a movable base. The prosthesis length can be adjusted with a smooth displacement of 0.35 mm. This minimum displacement is important because the difficulty is greater when the longitudinal adjustment required in the prosthesis is less than 10 mm. The equipment can measure the individual's center of pressure (COP) in the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directions, making it possible to adjust the knee and ankle angulation of the prosthesis, and also the alignment in the frontal plane between the healthy and the prosthetic lower limb. The measurement weight accuracy was less than 1%, while the COP measurement accuracies were found to be less than 0.4 cm in both the AP and ML directions. With a sampling frequency of 80 Hz, it is possible to carry out stabilometry analysis and use these data to improve the prosthesis adjustment procedure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
367,"The von Braun reaction, discovered at the dawn of the past century, consists of the reaction between a tertiary amine and cyanogen bromide. It leads to the cleavage of a CN bond with the formation of an N-dialkylcyanamide and an alkyl bromide and has been extensively used in organic synthesis. A detailed in silico study (PCM/density functional theory [DFT]/B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) calculations) of this venerable reaction has shown that in the first stage a zwitterionic adduct with a multibonded bromine atom is formed. The widely accepted mechanism involving an S(N)2 reaction occurs in the second step, thus accounting for its selectivity. Quantum chemical calculations were performed for the von Braun-like reactions in systems formed by cyclic tertiary amines (N-alkyl azetidines). In these cases, the first stage is almost the same as in the classical von Braun processes, and selective S(N)2 mechanisms can occur in the second step.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

380,"Contractile tails are key components of the biological nanomachinery involved in cell membrane puncturing, where they provide a means to deliver molecules and ions inside cells. Two intriguing examples of contractile tails are those from bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin. Although the two systems are different in terms of biological activity, they share a fascinatingly similar injection mechanism, during which the tail sheaths of both systems contract from a so-called extended state to around half of their length (the contracted state), accompanied by release of elastic energy originally stored in the sheath. Despite the great prevalence and biomedical importance of contractile delivery systems, many fundamental details of their injection machinery and dynamics are still unknown. In this work, we calculate the bending and torsional stiffness constants of a helical tail sheath strand of bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin, in both extended and contracted states, using molecular dynamics simulations of about one-sixth of the entire sheath. Differences in stiffness constants between the two systems are rationalized by comparing their all-atom monomer structures, changes in sheath architecture on contraction, and differences in interstrand interactions. The calculated coefficients indicate that the T4 strand is stiffer for both bending and torsion than the corresponding R2-pyocin strands in both extended and contracted conformations. The sheath strands also have greater stiffness in the contracted state for both systems. As the main application of this study, we describe how the stiffness constants can be incorporated in a model to simulate the dynamics of contractile nanoinjection machineries.

The High Content Screening (HCS) technique was used to investigate P2Y1R mediated signal transduction processes based on the distribution of fluorescent receptors or the beta-arrestin2/receptor complex. All procedures including aggregation, endolysis and resensitization that were involved in the interaction between the P2Y1 receptor and its ligand can be visualized using the tGFP labeled receptor combined with HCS technology in this study. ADP activated P2Y1R to induce a distinguished pattern of fluorescent vesicle formation inside both cell types. These two cell lines produced different peak fluorescence signals when activated by ADP at 100 mu M, and the time to form the maximal vesicles was detected as 15 and 20 min respectively. The EC50 values of the concentration-response curves of ADP induced formation of fluorescent vesicles were 35.7 nM and 71.8 nM respectively.

A similar effect was confirmed for the process of sulfuric acid alkylation of high-octane gasoline production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

390,"The chance of apparent isotope anomalies either in closed systems at equilibrium or during Rayleigh processes is investigated. The term 'apparent' is chosen to highlight that only mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) processes are considered. A goal is finding analytical expressions that could be used for dealing with the complexity of real systems. For example, the formula for calculating the isotopic fractionation in systems with any desired number of phases involved is identified. Terrestrial samples could exhibit artificially low MIF signatures because Delta is not invariant with the choice of the reference material. An alternative parameter Delta* only depending on beta is therefore introduced. The potential transfer of sample points in a three-isotope plot to parallel lines during reversible processes is also investigated. Larger apparent anomalies are expected in systems lacking an infinite reservoir and for large enrichment factors. Pyrite is stable beyond the conditions for a reducing environment and MIF signatures from Archaean sediments could be compatible with reversible processes involving oxidised species. Isotope anomalies in pyrite from the Dresser Formation, Australia, are compatible with post-depositional incorporation of 2-5% sulphur of atmospheric origin. Overall, observed delta values could mainly be related to changes in the local absolute isotope abundances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

393,"Seven ascidiacyclamide [cyclo(-Ile-oxazoline-d-Val-thiazole-)(2)] (ASC) analogues incorporating the beta-amino acids beta Ile, beta oxazoline, and/or d-beta Val were synthesized. We then investigated the effects of the position and number of incorporated beta-amino acids on the structure, cytotoxicity, and copper binding by these seven analogues. The structural analyses revealed that both beta Ile and d-beta Val favor a gauche-type theta torsion angles, while beta oxazoline favors a trans-type theta torsion angle. Expansion of the macrocycle by incorporation of beta Ile or d-beta Val readily induced molecular folding. On the other hand, the incorporation of two beta oxazoline residues strongly extended the peptide conformation, and the incorporation of one was sufficient for the moderate restriction important for conformational equilibrium and cytotoxicity. Despite expansion of the macrocycles, the structure-cytotoxicity relationships were largely maintained. In studies of complexation of the analogues with Cu (II) ion, the position and number of incorporated beta-amino acids had a large impact on the structure of the metal complex and may contribute to its stabilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
394,"The co-kneader is a proper tool for processing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compounds. Gelation of PVC is complex because of a narrow processing window. At low temperature, gelation is incomplete and leads to poor mechanical properties, while at high temperature, degradation may occur. The aim of this study is to gain a fundamental understanding of the gelation process of PVC in co-kneaders. Careful examination of the gelation state of extruded PVC samples was carried out qualitatively by swelling the extruded samples in acetone and quantitatively by differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Gelation in various conditions of temperature and shear was firstly studied in a capillary device that ensures both pre-shearing and extrusion through a circular die. This provided a reference basis for comparison with gelation state obtained in the co-kneader. Samples were collected in the co-kneader by means of opening the barrel. The gelation state was particularly examined in connection with the measured temperature at a fixed position along the screw at which a temperature sensor was positioned. The obtained results showed that the co-kneader allows fast gelation with a mixing energy value lower than 200kJ/kg when the temperature is higher than a critical value of 165 degrees C for the studied formulation.

396,"A kinetic study of the reaction of the 4-methylphenyl radical (4-C6H4CH3) with the oxygen molecule was conducted using experimental and theoretical approaches. The absorption spectrum for the lambda = 266 nm photolysis of the 4-C6H4CH3X (X = Cl, Br)/N-2/O-2 mixture was measured in the wavelength range of lambda = 503-512 nm using N-2 as the buffer gas at a total pressure of 40 Torr using a cavity ring-down spectroscopy apparatus coupled with a pulsed laser photolysis system. Based on the absorbance of the product of the 4-C6H4CH3 + O-2 reaction at lambda = 504 nm, the reaction rate coefficient for the 4-C6H4CH3 + O-2 reaction was determined to be k = (1.21 +/- 0.10) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and k = (1.18 +/- 0.21) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) using 4-C6H4CH3Cl and 4-C6H4CH3Br, respectively, as the radical precursor. And there was no pressure dependence in the total pressure range of 10-90 Torr varying partial pressure of N-2 buffer gas at T = 296 +/- 5 K. The geometries, vibration frequencies, and potential energy surfaces of the reactants, major products, and transition states in the 4-C6H4CH3 + O-2 reaction were determined using the CBS-QB3 method. The k value at the high-pressure limit was calculated to be 1.26 x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) using the variational transition-state theory. The calculated value of k was consistent with the experimental value, which indicated that the 4-C6H4CH3 + O-2 reaction reaches the high-pressure limit at 10 Torr. Therefore, the oxidation of the 4-C6H4CH3 radical is almost 10 times faster than that of the benzyl radical, which has the same chemical formula, at the high-pressure limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

409,"Type I collagen scaffolds for tissue reconstruction often have impaired mechanical characteristics such as limited stiffness and lack of strength. In this study, a new technique is presented to fine-tune stiffness and biodegradability of collagen scaffolds by treatment with concentrated salt solutions. Collagen scaffolds were prepared by a casting, freezing and lyophilization process. Scaffolds were treated with 90% saturated salt solutions, the salts taken from the Hofmeister series, followed by chemical crosslinking. Treatment with salts consisting of a divalent cation in combination with a monovalent anion, e.g. CaCl2, resulted in fast shrinkage of the scaffolds up to approximately 10% of the original surface area. Effective salts were mostly at the chaotropic end of the Hofmeister series. Shrunken scaffolds were more than 10 times stiffer than non-shrunken control scaffolds, and displayed reduced pore sizes and swollen, less organized collagen fibrils. The effect could be pinpointed to the level of individual collagen molecules and indicates the shrinking effect to be driven by disruption of stabilizing hydrogen bonds within the triple helix. No calcium deposits remained in CaCl2 treated scaffolds. Subcutaneous implantation in rats showed similar biocompatibility compared to H2O and NaCl treated scaffolds, but reduced cellular influx and increased structural integrity without signs of major degradation after 3 months. In conclusion, high concentrations of chaotropic salts can be used to adjust the mechanical characteristics of collagen scaffolds without affecting biocompatibility. This technique may be used in regenerative medicine to stiffen collagen scaffolds to better comply with the surrounding tissues, but may also be applied for e.g. slow release drug delivery systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gold electrodeposition on these ultrathin (3-15 nm) molecular assemblies, bound to a conductive substrate, follows an instantaneous nucleation regime that results in multiple small clusters. On thicker assemblies (15-55 nm) a progressive nucleation mode is dominant, which leads to the formation of larger (up to 50 times) and highly branched microstructures.

417,"A nonlinear general rate model (GRM) of liquid chromatography is formulated to analyze the influence of temperature variations on the dynamics of multi-component mixtures in a thermally insulated liquid chromatographic reactor. The mathematical model is formed by a system of nonlinear convection-diffusion reaction partial differential equations (PDEs) coupled with nonlinear algebraic equations for reactions and isotherms. The model equations are solved numerically by applying a semi-discrete high-resolution finite volume scheme (HR-FVS). Several numerical case studies are conducted for two different types of reactions to demonstrate the influence of heat transfer on the retention time, separation, and reaction. It was found that the enthalpies of adsorption and reaction significantly influence the reactor performance. The ratio of density time heat capacity of solid and liquid phases significantly influences the magnitude and velocity of concentration and thermal waves.

The sample components are radially transported from the center of the circle toward the periphery by the solvent flow. RTLC is an efficient separation and semi-preparation method, with the advantages of fast separation, low diffusion, and absence of tailing at a certain distance.

Qualitative and quantitative verification of RTLC was then conducted. With the aid of computer technology, qualitative and quantitative methods of radially expanded TLC for Yiqing tablets were investigated. The results showed that the qualitative RTLC method has good reliability, but the quantitative RTLC method has inherent drawbacks, which may be associated with the experimental environment.

428,"Libyan Desert Glasses (LDGs) and Darwin Glasses (DGs) are impact glasses produced by the impact of an extraterrestrial body into the Earth million years ago. LDGs were formed in the Libyan Desert (Africa) and DGs in Tasmania (Australia). From their formation, they have suffered terrestrial weathering processes due to their interaction with the environment. This is the first work that has evaluated their weathering processes according to their composition, the surrounding environment, and the climate. An innovative methodology based on the leaching of organic and inorganic ions and chemical modeling simulations was employed. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), ionic chromatography (IC), and solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and head space (HS) injections coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detection were used. As a result, soluble organic compounds such as oxalates, n-hexadecanoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzalacetone were detected. The inorganic ions suffered a similar process, going inside the body of glasses and precipitating the corresponding salts when water evaporated. As these compounds are polar, they were probably transported by infiltration waters from outside the glasses, remaining inside in the pores, cavities, or cracks of the glasses during thousands of years. In the case of the DGs, it could be observed that under the oxidizing conditions of the terrestrial atmosphere, sulfides present in some samples transformed into sulfates. Finally, this methodology could be applied in other extraterrestrial materials discovered in deserts, ice fields, or in locations with great living activity like those of Tasmania.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
429,"The electrochemical response of several alloys (stainless steel 316, Hastelloy C276, Inconel 600, and tantalum) was investigated in molten LiCl-Li2O (1 wt%) at 923 K while bubbling oxygen gas into the molten salt. Tafel and zero resistance ammeter (ZRA) electrochemical methods were used to measure electrochemical effects of oxidation processes at the surface of each alloy. The Tafel method required approximately 15 min and was, thus, applied only in intervals between periods of oxygen bubbling in the salt. ZRA measurements were made in real time, while the O-2 was actively being bubbled into the salt. This method recorded both open circuit potential of the alloy relative to a Ni/NiO reference electrode and current between the alloy and the galvanically coupled platinum plate that served as the counter electrode. Both open circuit potential and galvanic oxidation current started to increase at the initiation of oxygen flow. Based on the observed oxidation current trend, it was inferred that the metals in order of increasing resistance to oxidation in molten LiCl-Li2O are as follows: tantalum < SS-316 < Inconel 600 < Haynes C276. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated formation of an oxide layer of thickness 560-3370 nm that correlates with the galvanic oxidation current measurements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
430,"Two new tin(iv)-containing phosphate fluorides, K2SnPO4F3 and K6Sn(P2O7)(2)F-2, have been obtained in a sealed system. Interestingly, K2SnPO4F3 and K6Sn(P2O7)(2)F-2 are the first tin(iv)-containing phosphate fluorides in the K-Sn(iv)-P-O-F system. Both of them crystallize in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c; however, the 2D [SnPO4F3](infinity) layer and isolated [Sn(P2O7)(2)F-2] units can be found in K2SnPO4F3 and K6Sn(P2O7)(2)F-2, respectively. A structural comparison indicates that K6Sn(P2O7)(2)F-2 is the first inorganic tin(iv)-containing phosphate with an isolated Sn(iv)-P-O framework. Meanwhile, the structural evolution from KSnOPO4 to K2SnPO4F3 is discussed in detail.

432,"The reaction of Fe-3(CO)(12) with O,O '-dialkyldithiophosphate diethylamine salts (RO)(2)P{S}SH center dot Et2NH (R = CH3, CH2CH3) resulted in the formation of trinuclear cluster complex {mu-SP(OR)(2)Fe[S2P(OR)(2))]S-mu]}Fe-2(CO)(6) [R = CH3 (1), CH2CH3 (2)]. The two complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, NMR (H-1, P-31 and C-13) spectroscopy, as well as by X-ray diffraction analyses. Crystal structures reveal that one P-S bond is cleaved during the reaction, yielding the [2Fe2S] unit together with FePS3(CO)(2). The other dialkyldithiophosphate coordinated with iron by S, S chelating model. The trinuclear cluster was observed with the P-Fe and S-Fe bond formed by the P-S activation.

For the same DBM mixtures plus with n-pentane and except with dipropyl ether and 3-pentanone, partial molar enthalpies, H-i, and excess molar enthalpies, H-E, are obtained through a heat flow calorimeter and a titration method purposely devised. Both excess properties are positive for cyclohexane, tetrachloromethane, and n-alkanes, the latter exhibiting an increase with increasing number of carbon atoms. Dipropyl and dibutyl ether mixtures exhibit negative V-E values, while n-hexane, tetrahydrofuran, and 3-pentanone mixtures show an S-shaped V-E curve. Negative H(E)s are observed only for tetrahydrofuran, whereas dibutyl ether exhibits an S-shaped H-E curve. H-E results are compared with the predictions of the DISQUAC model. The partial molar volumes at infinite dilution, V degrees, as well as the enthalpies of solvation, Delta H-solv degrees, of the examined substances in DBM are evaluated and discussed also considering data on other compounds found in the literature. For V degrees and Delta H-solv degrees, a group additivity scheme is proposed to enable the estimation of these properties for other molecules and how much structural peculiarities such as chain length, polarity of groups, and cyclic structures influence their values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
438,"A core-shell NiAlO@polypyrrole composite (NiAlO@PPy) with a 3D ""sand rose""-like morphology was prepared via a facile in situ oxidative polymerization of pyrrole monomer, where the role of PPy coating thickness was investigated for high-performance supercapacitors. Microstructure analyses indicated that the PPy was successfully coated onto the NiAlO surface to form a core-shell structure. The NiAlO@PPy exhibited a better electrochemical performance than pure NiAlO, and the moderate thickness of the PPy shell layer was beneficial for expediting the electron transfer in the redox reaction. It was found that the NiAlO@PPy5 prepared at 5.0mLL(-1) addition amount of pyrrole monomer demonstrated the best electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 883.2Fg(-1) at a current density of 1Ag(-1) and excellent capacitance retention of 91.82% of its initial capacitance after 1000cycles at 3Ag(-1). The outstanding electrochemical performance of NiAlO@PPy5 were due to the synergistic effect of NiAlO and PPy, where the uniform network-like PPy shell with the optimal thickness made electrolyte ions more easily accessible for faradic reactions.

443,"Secondary alkanesulfonate has been widely used as an antistatic additive in polymers for producing anti-dust food packaging containers. Currently, no reported method exists for accurate quantification of secondary alkanesulfonate in ethanolic and acidic food simulants. A new liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to quantify the migrated amount of secondary alkanesulfonate at trace levels in food simulants from a poly(tetramethylene terephthalate) containing secondary alkanesulfonate. The poly(tetramethylene terephthalate) samples loaded with the antistatic additive were exposed to various food simulants. The collected extracts were directly analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry in electrospray ionization negative mode. As secondary alkanesulfonate is a mixture containing C14 to C17 chain lengths, it was separated on a Poroshell 120 EC-C8 column adopting methanol water gradient program. The migration of secondary alkanesulfonate ranged from 58 to 329 ppb; which is well within the allowed permissible regulatory limits and the adopted method was validated by conducting spiking studies and acceptable recoveries were obtained. The developed method was not only sensitive to detect lower levels of the migrated antistatic additive, but it also avoided more cumbersome sample preparation methodologies like sample enrichment and other derivatization approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
444,"The peculiar magnetic properties of rare earth nitrides (RENs) make them suitable for a wide range of applications. Here, we report on a density functional theory (DFT) study of an interesting member of the family, two-dimensional (2D) NdN film, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), including the Hubbard (U) parameter. We consider different film thicknesses, taking into account the effects of N vacancies (V-N) and dopants (C and O). Formation energy values show that, even though N vacancy is the predominant defect, C and O dopants are also probable impurities in these films. Individual Nd and N magnetic moments oscillate in the presence of V-N and dopants owing to the induced lattice distortions. The density of states calculations show that the 2D NdN film has a semi-metallic nature, while the f orbitals are separated into fully filled and empty bands. A magnetic anisotropy energy of similar to 50 mu eV is obtained, and the easy axis aligns along the film orientation as the film thickness increases, revealing that such films are ideal candidates for spintronic applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
445,"HEK-293 cells are increasingly being used in the production of human adenovirus (HAdV) vaccines. However, the production of HAdV vaccine has not met the requirements of industrial production. Recently, we investigated the effects of various regulatory genes of the pyruvate metabolism node on the substance and energy metabolism and adenovirus reproduction in HEK-293 cells. Initially, single regulatory genes, including pkm2, pdh alpha, pyc2, mpc3, aralar1, ldha and pdk1, were studied. We found that metabolic performance and adenovirus reproduction capacity in HEK-293 cells were improved, and maximum adenovirus titre was increased approximately 15-fold. Next, we co-overexpressed the key genes, including pkm2, pyc2 and aralar1. The PYC2-A-P-L cells that had the appropriate co-overexpression levels of three genes had the most pronounced regulatory effect. The maximum cell density and maximum specific growth rate were increased by 21% compared with that in the control. The Delta Lac/Delta Glc and Delta NH3/Delta Gln were decreased by 26% and 27%, respectively. The ATP production rate and the ATP/O-2 ratio were increased by 110% and 20%, respectively. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reduced by 60%. The adenovirus reproductive ability of the PYC2-A-P-L cells was approximately 30-fold higher than that of the control. The results showed that proper overexpression of the aralar1, pkm2 and pyc2 genes can significantly improve the substance and energy metabolism efficiency in HEK-293 cells, maximize the metabolic balance of pyruvate, and ultimately improve HAdV reproduction. This study provides a method of regulation of pyruvate metabolism and polygenic metabolic engineering in mammalian cells cultured in vitro and suggests an effective method for efficient HAdV production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
446,"The effect of electropulsing treatment (EPT) on the surface general corrosion behavior of an AISI/SAE 1045 steel under different machining regimes is studied. In the study, the following variables are alternated: high-speed steel (HSS) vs. hard metal (HM), and with and without the assistance of high-density electropulses. The corrosion rates are determined using comparative studies such as gravimetric analysis, salt spray chamber test, electrochemical polarization curve techniques (PC), and linear polarization resistance (LPR). Differences in surface microhardness were evaluated by applying optical microscopy and planimetric procedures. Specimens subjected to electropulses and turned with HM reported greater reductions of corrosion rates. Changes in corrosion behavior can be explained in terms of grain shape factor h variation.

Results showed that azithromycin monohydrate can be obtained by lowering the water activity and the transition water activity in acetone-water solvent mixtures at temperatures (293.15 K, 298.15 K, 303.15 K and 308.15 K) was 0.17, 0.21, 0.242 and 0.287, which increased with temperature. Besides, the metastable zone width (MSZW) of azithromycin dihydrate in water-acetone solvent mixtures was measured by laser method. The effect of initial temperature and cooling rate on MSZW of azithromycin dihydrate was studied. It was observed that the MSZW decreases with the increase in initial temperature.

449,"Hamstring tendon is one of the best graft choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The upper age limit of reconstruction is not determined because tenocytes from old individuals have less proliferative ability than young ones. Dexamethasone is commonly used to deal with musculoskeletal disorder with dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward tenocytes. Ascorbic acid is essential for tenocytes culture and collagen secretion and can alleviate the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone. In the current study, a microfluidic platform was used to screen the best dexamethasone and ascorbic acid combination treatment for tenocytes from young and old donors because it has been proven to provide a high throughput analysis platform. Comparison of their proliferation under three concentrations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone was performed. Tenocytes proliferation among young and old donors was also measured when exposed to nine combinations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone. The result confirmed the differences in cells proliferation when hamstring tenocytes from different ages of donors are exposed to different concentrations of dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. Tenocytes from old donors are not always more susceptible to dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. An optimal dose of ascorbic acid in decreasing the cytotoxic effect of dexamethasone can be screened by a high throughput microfluidic platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

452,"Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-based maxillary templates can transfer a surgical plan accurately only when the template is positioned correctly. Our study aimed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the CAD/CAM-based template for maxillary orthognathic surgery using dry skulls. After reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual skull model, a surface-based surgical template for Le Fort I osteotomy was designed and fabricated using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology. To determine accuracy, the deviation of the template between the planned and the actual position and the fitness of the template were evaluated. The mean deviation was 0.41 +/- 0.30 mm in the medio-lateral direction, 0.55 +/- 0.59 mm in the antero-posterior direction, and 0.69 +/- 0.59 mm in the supero-inferior direction. The root mean square deviation between the planned and the actual position of the template was 1.21 +/- 0.54 mm. With respect to the fitness of the template, the mean distance between the inner surface of the template and the underlying bone surface was 0.76 +/- 0.24 mm. CAD/CAM-based templates showed precise positioning and good fitness. These results suggest that surface topography-based CAD-CAM templates can be considered as an alternative solution in replacing the traditional intermediate splints for the transfer of surgical plans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
453,"In this paper, we introduce a novel system for physics-based vehicle simulation from input trajectory. The proposed system approximates the physical movements of a real vehicle using a proportional derivative (PD) servo which estimates proper torques for wheels and controls a vehicle's acceleration based on the conditions of the given trajectory. To avoid expensive simulation calculation, the input trajectory is segmented and compared to the optimized trajectories stored in a path library. Based on the similarity of the curve shape between the input and simulated trajectories, an iterative search method is introduced to generate a physically derivable trajectory for convincing simulation results. For an interaction with other objects in the virtual environment, the surface of the vehicle is subdivided into several parts and deformed individually from external forces.

A corrective function was then utilized to improve the accuracy of reference phase extraction. The method was then corroborated by demonstrating tumor discrimination in mice skin by means of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). B16-F10 melanoma cells were used to grow the tumor. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was applied for histology characterization of the sample. A comparison of both acoustics and histology was conducted.

457,"We have observed the conversion of a level perturbing the Yb series into a forced autoionisation resonance by the application of a static field. The perturbing level is barely visible in the zero field excitation spectrum, leading us to expect the forced autoionisation resonance to be manifested as a dip in the spectrum as a Fano 0 feature. Instead, we observe a pronounced peak with a 3. As shown by a quantum defect theory analysis, the zero field spectrum is consisitent with 3. The apparent discrepancy arises from the combination of the rapid radiative decay of the perturbing level, the weakness of the configuration interaction and the discreteness of the zero field spectrum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
458,"The modular structure has a discontinuity owing to the joint between the modules; thus, structural behavior verification is required. In this study, the tensile behavior of a steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was evaluated in the joint of a modular flexural member. The modular specimen was fabricated with a 400 mm joint, and an integral specimen was fabricated with the same specifications as the modular specimen, without a joint. The largest crack width of the integral specimen was measured at the center of the beam, and that of the modular specimen was measured at the discontinuity interface. The maximum crack width of the modular specimen was greater than that of the integral specimen. The strain of the steel reinforcement was estimated using the measured crack width and six formulas for evaluating the crack width. The estimated strain of the modular specimen was higher than that of the integral specimen, and the deformation of the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was accelerated with the increasing load. Therefore, the tensile load was concentrated at the discontinuity interface in the modular specimen, and the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was likely to yield earlier than the integral specimen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
459,"The visual search performance of radiologists is systematically challenged due to the use of flat-panel displays when viewing multi-slice images. Three-dimensional visualization of information is expected to facilitate visual search for radiologists. However, as the differences in user performance, depending on radiologist experience, have not yet been assessed for real three-dimensional images, it is difficult to estimate the usability of new visualization systems for radiologists with different amounts of professional search experience. In this study, we aimed to determine how three-dimensional visual search is affected by radiologist experience and the physical properties of stimuli. Radiologists, residents, and medical students accomplished visual search tasks with varying set sizes and target-distractor similarities. Search items were presented on multiple display planes and image manipulation was conducted using a computer keyboard. We compared the search outcome and strategy among three groups of participants. All three groups submitted a similar number of correct responses depending on target-distractor similarity. However, in contrast to radiologists and residents, it took a considerably longer time for students to find the targets. The major differences were evident in search strategy when comparing the image manipulations of radiologists with those of residents and students. Our results demonstrated that experienced radiologists' search performance benefited from seeing the entire three-dimensional view of an image, whereas residents and students focused instead on reducing the amount of information and searched in a selective manner. These findings should be taken into account when planning the implementation of new workstations with three-dimensional visualization in radiology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resolution (R = 1.54) of dextrorphan and levorphanol was achieved using the Lux i-amylose-1 column (5 & mu;m, 150 x 4.6 mm) with a mixture of mobile phases consisting of 0.1 % DEA in n-hexane and 0.1 % DEA in 2-propanol (90:10, v/v). To demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, sensitivity and effect on matrix in equine urine samples were carried out. For both analytes, the method was linear over the concentration range of 1-50 ng/mL in equine urine. The intra and inter-day precisions expressed as relative standard deviation and the inter-day precisions of dextrorphan, levorphanol were 3.45 % and 3.63 % respectively. The accuracy was in the range of 97-102 %. The limit of detection was 0.1 ng/mL and that of quantification was 0.5 ng/mL for both analytes. Recovery and matrix effect on the analytes were also evaluated. This method is capable of distinguishing racemorphan enantiomers when both of the isomers are simultaneously present in equine urine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
461,"Nanoscale CMOS technology has encountered severe reliability issues especially in on-chip memory. Conventional word-level error resilience techniques such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC) suffer from high physical overhead and inability to correct increasingly reported multiple bit flip errors. On the other hands, state-of-the-art applications such as image processing and machine learning loosen the requirement on the levels of data protection, which result in dedicated techniques of approximated fault tolerance. In this work, we introduce a novel error protection scheme for memory, based on feature extraction through Principal Component Analysis and the modular-wise technique to segment the data before PCA. The extracted features can be protected by replacing the fault vector with the averaged confinement vectors. This approach confines the errors with either single or multi-bit flips for generic data blocks, whilst achieving significant savings on execution time and memory usage compared to traditional ECC techniques.

463,"The statistical properties of photon emission counting, especially the waiting time distributions (WTDs) and large deviation statistics, of a cavity coupled with the system of double quantum dots (DQDs) driven by an external microwave field were investigated with the particle-number-resolved master equation. The results show that the decay rate of the WTDs of the cavity for short and long time limits can be effectively tuned by the driving external field Rabi frequency, the frequency of the cavity photon, and the detuning between the microwave driving frequency and the energy-splitting of the DQDs. The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction. This also demonstrates that the effect of the DQDs can be replaced a thermal reservoir when the rate difference of a photon absorbed and emitted by DQDs is larger than zero; otherwise, it is irreplaceable. The results deepen our understanding of the statistical properties of photon emission counting. It has a promising application in the construction of nanostructured devices of photon emission on demand and of optoelectronic devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
464,"To confirm the usefulness of zebrafish for evaluating the teratogenic potential of drug candidates, the effect of O-ethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (OHY), which induces mutagenesis by methylation, was evaluated in teratogenicity studies in rats and zebrafish. In the rat teratogenicity study, OHY-induced cardiovascular malformations such as increased abnormal vascular structures and ventricular septal defects. In the teratogenicity study using zebrafish-injected microspheres and green fluorescent protein-expressing Tg zebrafish (flk1:EGFP), OHY exposure was associated with the loss or malformation of the mandibular arch, opercular artery, and fourth branchial arch. These results suggested that OHY-induced external malformations in zebrafish eleutheroembryos adequately reflect OHY's teratogenicity in rat fetuses. Moreover, the zebrafish teratogenicity study incorporating vascular morphological examinations, including those of blood vessels in the heart, head and trunk, is an easy and reliable screening method to detect potential drug-induced teratogenicity and phenotypic characteristics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
465,"Featured Application Featured Application: The results of the experimental tests were carried out in the laboratory of BSSTC.PL Sp. z o.o. and OLATECH DR INZ. Andrzej Bachowicz using an obstacle lighting lamp that is currently in production. The developed simulation model, which has been verified experimentally, was used to determine the influence of changes in meteorological parameters on the temperature distributions on the surface of the lamp. It will be used in the future to optimize the geometry of the heat sink used in the lamp in terms of electricity consumption and thermal resistance. It is planned to extend the application of the lamp under difficult climatic conditions. Abstract The article presents the results of experimental and theoretical works aimed at determining the distribution of heat emitted by an obstacle lighting lamp. These kind of lamps are commonly applied as a warning for air traffic vehicles. There is a need for lighting devices with various intensities, whose application depends on the location and operating conditions. The overall aim of the author's work is to develop a computer model that would enable us to conduct research aimed at determining the optimal parameters of lamp operation without the need to build many physical models. Measurements of heat emitted by a currently manufactured lamp were made, and based on these, a numerical model of the lamp operating under laboratory conditions was developed. The considered lamp has two heat sources, one of which is light-emitting diodes (LEDs), while the other heat source consists of stabilizers and other elements of the lamp power supply system. After positive experimental verification of the numerical model, theoretical analyses of heat emission under various meteorological conditions were carried out, while the values of ambient temperature and airflow velocity were changed; then, the influence of these parameters on the temperature distribution on the surface of the lamp was determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,"We report the preparation of a 780.2 nm and 852.3 nm laser device based on single-pass periodically poled magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate (PPMgO:LN) bulk crystals and diode-laser-seeded fiber amplifiers. First, a single-frequency continuously tunable 780.2 nm laser of more than 600 mW from second-harmonic generation (SHG) by a 1560.5 nm laser can be achieved. Then, a 250 mW light at 852.3 nm is generated and achieves an overall conversion efficiency of 4.1% from sum-frequency generation (SFG) by mixing the 1560.5 nm and 1878.0 nm lasers. The continuously tunable range of 780.2 nm and 852.3 nm are at least 6.8 GHz and 9.2 GHz. By employing this laser system, we can conveniently perform laser cooling, trapping and manipulating both rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms simultaneously.

467,"Scientists all over the world are making tremendous efforts to solve the problem of earthquake prediction. Dozens of different phenomena and signs that could serve as precursors of earthquakes are found. But these effects were very unstable and had a mosaic character in the propagation of development and time. They appeared not always and not before every major earthquake. There are many cases where earthquakes occurred without the manifestation of any precursors. Such non-stationary phenomena do not allow formulating adequate strong earthquakes preparing models and their methods of predicting. Among well-studied and encouraging earthquake precursors, hydrogeodynamic and hydrogeochemical anomalies are considered to be the most promising, which has a sufficiently substantiated scientific background. In this class of precursors, the mechanism of their formation during the preparation of earthquakes remains debatable. There are several problems due to abnormal concentration sources and their transport during a little time period in the observation points. In the proposed work, it is proved that the main mechanism of the occurrence of exotic transient fluid anomalies is the interphase rearrangement in the local balanced hydrogeochemical system as a reaction to strong earthquakes factors preparing influence. The internal phase reorganization in the hydrogeochemical system is realized through structural relaxation as a result of the occurrence of rapid physicochemical reactions exchange.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

469,"The purpose of this study is to enhance the performance of Multistream Fast Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keeping in view the recent web-based applications that are being deployed on long-range, high-speed, and high-bandwidth networks. To achieve the objective of the research study, a congestion control after fast-recovery module for congestion control scheme of Multistream Fast TCP is proposed. The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Consequently, Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP consumes the available network bandwidth in lesser time and increases the throughput and goodput. The proposed module enhanced the performance of the transport layer protocol. Our findings demonstrate the performance impact in the form of a decrease in the convergence time to consume the available network bandwidth and the increase in the throughput and the goodput.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relevance of the research is in the need to inform farmers on the efficiency of such technologies and how to use them. Economic valuation, cost-benefit analysis were used to compare traditional and digital agricultural technologies in grain production. Wealthy farmers from developed countries widely use digital technology, reducing operating costs for wage labour and productive resources. In this research, the authors attempted to prove the hypothesis of significant economic and environmental efficiency in the application of precision technologies. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the results of the application of precision farming tools from an economic standpoint, these results can contribute to the study of the efficiency of digital technologies at the global and local levels. This research displays that with application of modern digital technologies in production, under certain circumstances, a farm can increase wheat yield by at least 25-30%.

The results obtained were compared to those obtained using PRP-X100 anion-exchange chromatography. Inorganic arsenic species were not eluted from the zirconium column due to the strong interaction with the zirconia stationary phase. Measurements of SO3-ribose and OSO3-ribose concentrations were in close agreement with those obtained using the PRP-X100 column with a 0.005 mg As kg(-1) detection limit. Peak shapes of these arsenoriboses were improved allowing lower amounts to be quantified. The quantification of OH-ribose and PO4-ribose, however, was sample dependent and not possible if arsenobetaine (AB) and (DMA) were present at large concentrations in samples because of coelution of these species with OH-ribose and PO4-ribose, respectively. In the absence of OH-ribose, AB can be determined using the zirconium column while AB on the PRP-X100 column coelutes with arsenic cations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
472,"Hydride transfer is widespread in nature and has an essential role in applied research. However, the mechanisms of how this transformation occurs in living organisms remain a matter of vigorous debate. Here, we examined dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that catalyzes hydride from C4' of NADPH to C6 of 7,8-dihydrofolate (H2F). Despite many investigations of the mechanism of this reaction, the contribution of polarization of the pi-bond of H2F in driving hydride transfer remains unclear. H2F was stereospecifically labeled with deuterium beta to the reacting center, and beta-deuterium kinetic isotope effects were measured. Our experimental results combined with analysis derived from QM/MM simulations reveal that hydride transfer is triggered by polarization at the C6 of H2F. The sigma C-H bonds contribute to the buildup of the cationic character during the chemical transformation, and hyperconjugation influences the formation of the transition state. Our findings provide key insights into the hydride transfer mechanism of the DHFR-catalyzed reaction, which is a target for antiproliferative drugs and a paradigmatic model in mechanistic enzymology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, the model named the Gupta many-body is used for interatomic potentials. Weighted histogram analysis is applied to resolve non-ergodicity subject owing to the complex potential energy surfaces of these nanoalloys. The melting characteristics such as caloric curve, heat capacity, the Lindemann parameter, radial distribution function, velocity autocorrelation function, and power spectrum have been computed at some temperatures during the simulation which is used as the criteria to find the melting mechanism. The calculation shows that the melting of Na19Li36, Na36Li19, and Na54K1 nanoalloys occur at about 145 K, 185-190 K, and 161 K, respectively.

The colorimetric probe exhibits high detection limit of 8 nM for melamine determination in raw milk, which is very low as compared to other capping ligands employed for Au NPs such as borohydride, citrate and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid.

476,"Lake Mashu is the only lake that serves as a baseline station of the United Nations Global Environment Monitoring System/Water (GEMS/Water) Programme. In this study, the concentration of trace lead in lake-water samples was determined by solid-phase extraction/concentration-ICP-MS to clarify the depth vertical profiles of lead. The finding that the lead concentration in the lake water above the thermocline shows a higher value than that in the lake water below the thermocline means that the input of lead into the surface water occurs during the thermocline-stratification period. The isotopic ratios (Pb-208/Pb-206 and Pb-207/Pb-206) were measured to estimate the origin of the lead. The obtained lead isotopic ratios in the surface water samples are similar to the reported values of the lead emitted in Japan rather than those at the Eurasia continent. The quantitative and isotopic analytical results in this study suggest a potential input of anthropogenically derived lead, presumably originating in Japan, into the surface water of Lake Mashu via the atmosphere since there is no inflowing river to the lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
477,"With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate the isolation of protected thiols by chromatography, we propose 2-(3-cyanopropyldimethylsilyl)ethyl as a polar protecting group analogue of 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl. The masked thiophenol is obtained in two synthetically complementing ways. Either an existing thiophenol is protected, or the protected thiol group is introduced by a cross-coupling reaction. In both cases the required reagents are readily available from inexpensive starting materials. Thiol protection and thiol introduction both tolerate a large variety of functional groups and substitution patterns, and the protected thiophenols are stable toward a broad range of reaction conditions. The stability of the protected derivatives in cross-coupling reactions and the mild reaction conditions for the release of the protecting group further emphasizes the potential of the methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conductance data show that in most cases, the stoichiometry of the complex formed between the macrocyclic ligand and the Y3+ cation is 1 : 1 [ML]. But in some systems such as, in the case of EtOAc-DMSO (90 mol % DMSO) binary solvent solution, in addition to formation of a 1 : 1 (ML) complex, a 1 : 2 (ML2) complex is formed in solution, which shows that the stoichoimetry of complexes may be changed by the nature of the medium. The stability order of (kryptofix 22DD center dot Y)(3+)complex in the studied binary solvent solutions at 25 degrees C was found to be: EtOAc-MeOH > EtOAc-DMF > EtOAc-DMSO and in the case of pure non-aqueous solvents at 25 degrees C it was: EtOAc > MeOH > DMF similar to NM. A density functional theory (DFT) study of the interaction of yttrium(III) cation with kryptofix 22DD in the liquid phase for the pure organic solvents was performed. The results are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data. A non-linear behavior was observed for changes of log K-f of (kryptofix 22DD center dot Y)(3+) complex versus the composition of the binary mixed solvents, which was explained in terms of solvent-solvent interactions and also the preferential solvation of the species involved in the complexation reaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the main objective of the paper was to evaluate the mass-transfer during laser surface alloying in the reflow mode. To evaluate the effectiveness of surface hardening technology, it was proposed to use two new parameters - reduced wear and reduced integrated micro hardness of the modified surface layer. Based on an analysis of the experimental data on the wear of a cutter made of HVG and U10 steel, processed by a laser with smears in the reflow mode, the existence of a correlation between the entered parameters is demonstrate and the regression equation is obtained.

Previously, we developed targeted nanosomes with anti-type II collagen monoclonal antibody (MabCII) on their surface that can bind to the damaged cartilage. The efficiency of nanosomes is highly dependent on their physicochemical nature. Therefore, in this study, we presented a rigorous method for examining the physicochemical characteristics and biological efficacy of nanosomes. Nanosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Specificity of nanosomes for type II collagen was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Release kinetics of nanosomes was determined by dialysis method using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye. The biological efficacy of targeted nanosomes encapsulating TGF-beta 3 was determined in porcine chondrocytes (pChon).

The direct fabrication of hierarchically porous macroscopic shapes, without the use of additional binders or complex post-treatments, is both challenging and promising. Flow devices offer a convenient route, with high controllability, to synthesize monodisperse particles. Hierarchically macro/mesoporous silica beads were prepared by means of a co-axial flow device combined with the co-micelle/emulsion dual templating strategy. Precursor droplets, which react to form the silica beads, were produced with the flow device and the size of the droplets was strongly influenced by the external fluid flow rate. Hierarchically porous silica beads with diameters from 300 to 800 mu m were produced as the flow rate was decreased over the range investigated. Furthermore, it was observed that the hierarchical pore structure and sizes of the pores on the different length scales were not significantly affected by the bead sizes, which provides the ability to optimize the size of the beads independently.

Upgrading of production processes and development of new technological processes of both domestic aircraft propulsion engineering and aviation arms remain topical and needed. Engine operational reliability depends on that of turbine blades. They are the most loaded details because they are experienced to action of static, dynamic and cyclic loadings as well as are subjected to cyclic thermal stresses. Therefore the main objective of our paper is to analyze the effect of high-current electron beam irradiation on-resistance of sulfide-oxide corrosion (SOC)of Ni-Cr-Al-Yion-plasma coatings. To achieve this purpose, beam irradiation was performed using the RITM-SP complex automated electron-beam setup. Modification of surface layer of SDP 2+VSDP16 ion-plasma coating by microsecond high-current electron beams of selected mode made it possible to increase considerably the SOC resistance. An analysis of the surface and microstructure of samples after SOC testing enabled to determine different effects of medium on sample coating depending on the state of the sample surface. When investigated samples microstructure, we found that after modification certain cracks on sample surface did not develop in the course of testing. It was found that some craters were not necessarily centers of corrosion damage origin, i.e., the existence of given types of craters and their impact on SOC resistance stability are ambiguous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
491,"The low intensity ultrasound has been adopted by researchers to enhance the bactericidal effect against bacteria in vitro and in vivo. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, one dominant opinion is that the permeability increases because of acoustic cavitation. However, the relationship between ultrasonic exposure parameters and cavitation effects is not definitely addressed. In this paper, by establishing a modified artificial neural network (ANN) model between ultrasonic parameters and cavitation effects, the cavitation effects can be predicted and inversely the direction for choosing parameters can be given despite of different ultrasonic systems. Compared with the generic model, the computational results obtained by modified model are more close to experimental results with low calculation cost. It means that as an efficient solution, the validity of the new model has been proved. Although the research is of preliminary stage, the new method may have great value and significance because of reducing the experimental expense. The next step of this research is to explore an optimization method to obtain the most suitable parameters based on this identification model.

The effect of the lanthanide terbium addition to the Al-Si system, in the Al-rich corner, has been experimentally studied. The constitution of the alloys and the liquidus surface projection have been determined by means of differential thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis and X-ray powder diffraction. In the system investigated have been identified five regions of primary crystallization: TbAl(3 - x)Six, Tb2Al3Si2, TbAlxSi2 - x, (Al) and (Si).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
493,"Three manganese complexes of the anionic azo-phenolate ligand [L-1](-), obtained from the reaction between HL1 and Mn(OAc)(2)center dot 4H(2)O (OAc = acetate) or Mn-2(CO)(10), are reported. The chosen manganese precursors are of different characters: the hydrated Mn(OAc)(2) is a common source of Mn(II), while the carbonyl complex is known for its strong reducing character. The reaction between the Mn(II)-salt and HL1(HL1 = 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(pyridin-2-ylazo)-phenol) produced a low-spin Mn(III) complex, Is- [Mn-III(L-1 )-(L-1)(.2-)]; 1 via substitution and internal electron transfer (Mn(II) -> [L-1](-)). The chemical oxidation of this molecular complex with l(2) provided access to the cationic complex, Is-[Mn-III(L-1)(2)-]I-3; [1](+)[l(3)](-) in quantitative yield. On the other hand, the reaction between Mn-2(CO)(10) and 4 equivalent of HL1 is complex. The reaction produced a heteroleptic high-spin Mn(III)-complex, hs-[Mn-III(L-1)(-)(L-2)(2-)]: 2 in moderate yield. The ligand H2L2 (H2L2 = 2,2'-dihydroxo-3,5,3',5'-tetra-tert-butylazobenzene) produced in situ via simultaneous azo-cleavage of [L-1](-) and recombination of two amido-phenolate fragments. The electronic structures of all three complexes coordinated by the two redox noninnocent ligands [L-1/2](-/2-) have been elucidated by using a host of physical methods: X-ray crystallography, magnetic susceptibility measurements, cyclic voltammetry, absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Their experimental structures are well reproduced by DFT calculations and support the overall electronic structures of the above compounds. The complexes 1, [1](+)[l(3)](-) and 2 have one, two and four unpaired electrons respectively, as evidenced by room temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements. The redox process between [1](+)/1 is ligand centred which does not affect the trivalent oxidation state of the metal ion. The chemical conversion [L-1](-) -> [L-2](2-) occurs only in aerobic condition and a rationale for the reaction is discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

494,"Fundamentally different responses of a LiTaO3 thin film detector are observed when it is subjected to short microwave pulses as the pulse intensity is altered over a wide range. We start from weak microwave pulses which lead to only trivial pyroelectric peak response. However, when the microwave pulses become intense, the normally expected pyroelectric signal seems to be suppressed and the sign of the voltage signal can even be completely changed. Analysis indicates that while the traditional pyroelectric model, which is a linear model and works fine for our data in the small regime, it does not work anymore in the large signal regime. Since the small-signal model is the key foundation of electromagnetic-wave sensors based on pyroelectric effects, such as pyroelectric infrared detecters, the observation in this work suggests that one should be cautious when using these devices in intense fields. In addition, the evolution of detector signal with respect to excitation strength suggests that the main polarisation process is changed in the large signal regime. This is of fundamental importance to the understanding on how crystalline solids interact with intense microwaves. Possible causes of the nonlinear behaviour is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
495,"The effect of an Electro-Fenton system on the deep treatment of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and corresponding removal rate was investigated in this article. By using simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater, it included a Cl- concentration of 3000 mg/L, SO42- concentration of 100 mg/L according to conventional leather wastewater conditions. Furthermore, Cl- and SO42- can be used as supporting electrolyte. After pretreatment, the ammonia nitrogen concentration kept about 100 mg/L. The optimal treatment conditions of Electro-Fenton system were obtained throughout single factors experiments. The current density was 150 A/m(2), the reaction time was 30 min, the plate spacing distance was 40 mm, and the reaction temperature was adjusted to 40 degrees C. After flocculation treatment of leather wastewater, the ammonia nitrogen concentration was 142.11 mg/L, and the tanning wastewater was further treated with an Electro-Fenton system. The final ammonia nitrogen concentration was 11.23 mg/L, which meets the first-level wastewater discharge standard. The removal rate was 92.10%, which indicated that the Electro-Fenton system is one kind of clean, feasible and sustainable treatment method for the deep treatment of ammonia nitrogen in tannery wastewater.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
496,"In this article we present LLSR, an R package for the characterization of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS). The scope of existing mathematical descriptions is ported to R and expanded with the implementation of a database of phase diagram parameters. The package applies nonlinear regression analysis to calculate the fitting parameters of well-known empirical equations-such as the ones described by Merchuk and Murugesan-using data obtained from articles published in high quality journals. The database is based on empirical data obtained from published manuscripts and provides a software package with the potential to reduce experimental effort and save resources throughout the development of an ATPS-based process or product. The package requires only minimal knowledge of R and can be installed directly from its console, and the results are easily exported for subsequent analyses. Detailed examples of usage and descriptions of the package capabilities, including built-in database search functions, are demonstrated by characterizing a poly(ethylene glycol) 2000/ammonium sulfate ATPS, the data of which is provided with the package. Additional online resources for the package are also described, including the procedure to allow users to contribute to LLSR in order to expand its database and capabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
497,"This paper reports on the thermoluminescence (TL) emission (from 250 to 500 nm) of a 10 Gy irradiated natural Na-rich aluminosilicate from Minas Gerais (Brazil), previously characterized by Raman spectroscopy and differential thermal analysis techniques. 3D-TL spectrum of the analyzed sample displays a complex glow curves with five different emissions bands peaked at 290, 380, 420, 460 and 500 nm that could be associated with structural and point defects. The UV-blue emission bands have the following characteristics: (i) the 290 run waveband could be due to defects-sites by the presence of Na ions; (ii) the 380 nm band, caused by intrinsic defects in the lattice (i.e. Non-Bridging Oxygen Hole Centers (NBOHCs), [AlO4]degrees centres, alkali planar defects and Oxygen Defect Centers (ODCs), among others); (iii) the 420 nm waveband, linked to the recombination on a centre formed from a hole-oxygen atom adjacent to two aluminum atoms (Al-O-Al) and Al-O-Si complexes; (iv) the 460 nm band, associated with the presence of Ti4+ in the plagiclase crystal lattice. The green waveband could be linked to de-excitation of Mn2+ ions. The estimation of the activation energy (E-a) from the 10 Gy-induced TL glow curves analyzed by means of the initial rise method display linear regressions with acceptable r coefficients (r > 0.977) that reveal three groups of components with traps at different depth in the crystal lattice of the albite with Ea values in the range of 0.5-0.64 eV.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
498,"Conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to therapeutic molecules is a widely used technique to increase in vivo half-life of therapeutics. A multimeric PEG protein conjugate, which contains eight antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) conjugated to an 8-arm PEG core, was developed as a therapeutic candidate for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The increased molecular size of the conjugate, compared to the Fab alone, produces a significant longer half-life, and requires less frequent intravitreal (ITV) injections, which can greatly benefit the patient. Due to the major impact that molecular size has on in vitreous half-life, it is crucial to have an analytical method to monitor the size attribute of the conjugate. Here we report a simple and robust size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) method that was developed for the conjugate. A wide range of size variants of the conjugate, ranging from 50 kDa to >1000 kDa, can be resolved and quantitated. The method was evaluated for precision, accuracy, linearity, and robustness, and was deemed suitable for routine use in product quality control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
499,"Analysis of overhead power transmission lines (OPL) involves the simulation of statics and oscillation. Solving such problems strictly requires the proper accounting of the internal conductor structure, in particular for power safety and reliability systems of information-telecommunication supply of aerodromes and aircraft systems, as well as for overhead transmission lines subjected to intense wind, especially in icing conditions. Due to the complexity of wire structures, known issues arise in the estimates of their deformations, stiffness, bearing capacity, etc. For instance, the bending stiffness of the conductor can vary considerably. Consequently, the stiffness can vary along the conductor axis as well as in time. This paper proposes a new deformation model of wire structures similar to typical OPL conductors. Such structures include not only conductors and cables, but spiral clamps intended for tension, suspension, joining, protection, and repair of conductors. Based on energy averaging each wire layer is considered as an equivalent elastic anisotropic cylindrical shell. Therefore a conductor or a spiral clamp can be modeled as a system of shells nested into each other and interacting by means of pressure and friction forces. In the process of the study, calculations were made that made it possible to formulate equations for the matrices of flexibility and cruelty of spiral structures. The interaction problem for a tension clamp with an external wire layer of a conductor has been formulated and solved. Finally, the mechanism of the force transfer from the clamp on the conductor has been investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
500,"2-amino-2-oxoacetic acid, carbamoyl formic acid, or oxamic acid is an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of great importance mainly because is an inhibitor of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). It acts as an inhibitor to the metabolic pathways of the tumor cells and exhibited significant anticancer activity against nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells in vitro and can be considered as a potential drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Also, this compound could be used as a building block in the design of supramolecular architectures based on hydrogen bonds through the complimentary hydrogen-bond functionalities of the carbonyl and amide functional groups present. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction is the most powerful technique for crystal structure determination of small molecules. However, for several materials, including oxamic acid, it could be complicated to grow single crystals of suitable size and quality that make them appropriated to structure analysis. For this reason, the structural study was conducted with powder X-ray diffraction which is a process significantly more challenging than structure determination from single-crystal data. Oxamic acid has been characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopic techniques, thermal TGA-DSC analysis, semi-empirical PM7 calculations, and X-ray powder diffraction. The title compound crystallizes in the monoclinic system with space group Cc, Z=4, and unit cell parameters a= 9.4994(4) angstrom, b= 5.4380(2) angstrom, c= 6.8636(3) angstrom, beta= 107.149(2)degrees, V= 338.79(2) angstrom(3).

Based on density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory methods, we clarify that fluoride anions could trigger the cleavage reaction of the Si-O bond of BIPA in the ground state. And, the potential energy curve of desilylation process reveals the rapid response to fluoride anions. Comparing the binding energies between fluoride anions and other anions, we confirm that only the fluoride anions could be detected using the BIPA chemosensor in ethanol solvent.

The molecular structure was characterized by FT-IR, H-1-NMR, and P-31-NMR. The thermal stability of phosphonium benzene sulfonate was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Its surface properties were studied systematically through equilibrium surface tension, electrical conductivity, and dynamic surface tension measurements. The wettability, foam properties, and emulsification of phosphonium benzene sulfonate were estimated in this paper. TGA results revealed that it has an excellent thermostability and could be used below 350 degrees C. Equilibrium surface tension results indicated that it has a low critical micelle concentration (CMC, about 0.10 mmol/L), lower than that of ammonium benzene sulfonate and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate. Furthermore, the micellization of phosphonium benzene sulfonate in aqueous solution is an entropy-driven spontaneous process.

The electrode was modified with a 1x10(-3) mol.L-1 CoPc methanolic solution containing 10% Nafion. For voltammetric measurements in Differential Pulse mode, an amplitude of 0.7V and a scan rate of 0.04V s(-1) were used.

Under these optimized conditions, an analytical curve was obtained in the 0.49 to 2,4 mu M concentration range, with a detection limit of 1,2 x 10(-10) mol.L-1. The method was applied to a real groundwater sample from a water well located at a fuel station, and an average concentration of 0.037 mu M FEN was found (n = 5), presenting a variation coefficient of 0.88, indicating good precision.

The aptamer includes a recognition region for the microRNA (miR) Let-7i. Upon selective miR hybridization, the aptamer undergoes a conformational shift to release FAD and thus produce a measurable response.

515,"The mechanical properties of protective powder coatings based on epoxy-polyester applied to steel substrates were studied. The mechanical characteristics of coatings, as well as their influence on the behavior of samples under mechanical loading, were determined. Tests of samples with coatings, created by Nano indentation methods, with subsequent processing of experimental data using standard analytical simplified models and using numerical finite element modeling were performed. In tensile tests it was demonstrated that presence of coatings leads to changes in the nature of fracture of the samples. In stability tests, the results of experimental data were compared with the results of analytical and numerical calculations, which demonstrated the effect of coatings on the stability of thin-walled samples. The mechanical properties of samples with coatings on one or both sides of the sample were studied, which also confirmed the elastic modulus of the studied coatings at a level of up to 10 GPa (with the average value for bulk materials up to 3.5 GPa). In the process of testing at elevated temperature, the importance of ensuring tight clamping of the samples was established, in the absence of which significant increase in the measurement error takes place. Due to temperature deformations, stiffness of the samples is reduced and, accordingly, deviate from conditions assumed in calculations.

The purpose of this study was to compare the US findings of patients with diabetic nephropathy with the pathologic findings of their renal biopsy. In this descriptive study, US parameters including resistivity index (RI), renal size and volume and cortical and medullary echogenicity, and histopathological findings of renal biopsy (fibrosis, inflammation and chronicity) of 60 patients (27 women and 33 men) with diabetic nephropathy admitted in Hasheminejad kidney center (HKC) of Tehran were extracted and analyzed. Of 60 patients, interstitial fibrosis (IF) in 47 patients, interstitial inflammation (II) in 50 patients and signs of chronicity in 43 patients in pathology report were observed. Patients with IF had larger renal length, higher sinus volume, coarse echogenicity, and abnormal medullary echogenicity, significantly. The presence of II was associated with larger renal length, higher renal and sinus volume, higher cortical echogenicity, and more patients with coarse echogenicity and abnormal medullary echogenicity. The observation of chronicity was significantly correlated with higher sinus volume and more patients with irregular renal rim. According to the findings of this study, renal length and volume, renal sinus volume, and the presence of coarse echogenicity and abnormal medullar echogenicity strongly correlate with renal histopathologic findings in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

It is shown how Hylleraas' constrained problem can be reduced to an unconstrained one by minimal computational efforts. The asymptotic projection (AP) method proposed earlier to minimize Rayleigh's quotient subject to some orthogonality restrictions is applied to construct a modified Hylleraas' functional whose solution fulfills the required constraints automatically. Specifically, equivalence between the original problem and the one for the modified Hamilton operator is derived. It is shown that the AP methodology allows additional restrictions to be treated in a unified approach for both Rayleigh's quotient and Hylleraas' functional. Specific features of the method are demonstrated on the electronic parallel polarizability of H-2(+). Some emphasis is put on the choice of specific distributed basis set adapted for polarizability computation.

Results showed that Cu, Cu2O, CuO, and SiO2 (Cu-SiO2) composite particles were plated on the surface of KH550-modified PA12 powders. The Cu-SiO2 particles existed independently on PA12 surface, and the size was around 200 nm. The melting temperature and crystallization temperature of Cu-SiO2/PA12 composite powders were 183 degrees C and 150 degrees C. The results indicate that the selective laser sintering (SLS) process involved the contact of Cu-SiO2/PA12 powders, the formation of sintering neck, the growth of sintering neck, and the formation of fused solid.

521,"Rhenium(I) and (VII) complexes with cyclohex-1-enylolonium cation and bridging pyridyl derivatives are reported. Additionally, the CO-bridged pyridyl and their related compounds have shown interesting behaviour in their reactivity towards compounds containing two amino groups. The unusual cationic compound: (2,6-diaza-cyclohex-1-enylolonium)2-aza-benzoate (H(2)den), was isolated from the reaction mixture of 1,2-di(pyridin-2-yl)ethane-1,2-dione with propane-1,3-diamine in methanol. The latter ligand: H(2)den, was used in the synthesis of rhenium(I) complex in its reaction with [Re(CO)(5)Cl] that gave rise to novel rhenium(I) complex fac-[Re(CO)(3)(Hhdm)] (1). The surprising aspect in the formation of (1) is the modification of H(2)den which was stabilized into a coordinated six-membered pyrimidine ring, 1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-2-yl)di(pyridin-2-yl)methanol (H(2)hdm) chelate. The derived ligand acts as a tridentate monoanionic N-2,O-donor ligand towards the fac-[Re(CO)(3)](+) core. Surprisingly, the 2-aza-benzoate counter-ion that was present in the used ligand is not displayed in the crystal structure of complex 1, and might have been stabilized into 2-aza-benzoic acid (picolinic acid). The reaction of the potential tridentate N-2,O-donor ligand 2,2 '-dipyridylketone (dpk) with trans-[ReOI2(OEt)(PPh3)(2)] led to the isolation of [ReO3(dpk center dot OH)] (2). The ligand H(2)den and the rhenium complexes were spectroscopically characterized, and the structures of H(2)den, 1 and 2 were established by X-ray diffraction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
522,"The present research aimed at comparing the effectiveness of promethazine and diazepam in patients suffering from acute peripheral vertigo. This is a double blind clinical trial with a sample of 154 patients visiting the emergency section of Shahid Mohammadi Hospital in Bandar Abbas in 2017-18. The participants were randomly divided into two groups of 77, one treated with intravenous promethazine (50 mg) and the other with intravenous Diazepam (10 mg). The severity of vertigo was measured qualitatively and quantitatively 20 minutes later in both groups. Participants were 46 (29.9%) male and 108 (70.1%) female visiting the emergency section of hospital. The mean score of vertigo severity in Promethazine group was 44.44 +/- 17.94 and that of Diazepam group was 2.49 +/-+3.87. The severity scores before and after the treatment in promethazine group were respectively 7.75 +/- 1.59 and 2.72 +/- 1.93. The mean scores of vertigo severity before and after the treatment in promethazine group was -5.04+2.10 and in the diazepam group it was -3.83+3.09. The intergroup difference was statistically significant (p=.013). The results revealed that intravenous promethazine and diazepam applied 20 minutes after prescription are both effective in controlling the severity of vertigo. Considering the probability of occurrence of extrapyramidal side-effects it can be suggested that the infusion of this medication can be done slowly as it takes longer time. Meanwhile, vital signs should be precisely controlled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
523,"It is important to be able to control the physical and chemical integrity of carbon-based porous monolith structures while being tailored for targeted analytical, energy and catalytic based applications. A set up using a CO2 laser in continuous mode (CW CO2 laser) was implemented to cut fragile and porous carbon monolithic (CM) and nanotemplated carbon monolithic (NTCM) rods into discs with a prescribed thickness and dimensional integrity (denoted as LCM and LNTCM, or LCMs). Changes in structure, porosity and composition of LCMs were induced by the efficient thermal energy afforded by the CW CO2 laser irradiation under tightly controlled process conditions. The main effects observed before and after laser cutting were studied in comparison with traditional scalpel blade cutting of carbon monolithic (SCM). FE-SEM images confirmed that the resulting LCMs exhibited a more open, interconnected macroporous structure and smoothed mesopores to a depth of approximately 5 while the structure of the bulk section remained intact. Minimal changes in chemical compositions were confirmed by XPS. Raman spectroscopy revealed a modest increase in the graphitic content on the cross sections of LCM discs. Phenol and Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as a model analyze for demonstration of resulting discs adsorption performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
524,"Electrolytic conductivity measurement is one of the important parameters to evaluate the concentration of dissolved substances in a solution and has been widely used in various fields of life, science, and technology. It was being used for process control and quality assurance. The traceability of the measuring results is a crucial requirement to guarantee reliability. The electrochemistry laboratory - chemical metrology Indonesia has started to develop a secondary method for electrolytic conductivity measurement. The objective of this work is to provide a traceability chain for electrolytic conductivity measurement in Indonesia through secondary reference material of Potassium Chloride (KCI) 1 M. The secondary reference material of KCI 1 M can be used as a standard for calibrating the conductivity meter, especially in seawater analysis. The secondary reference material that is developed has an electrolytic conductivity value of about 111 mS/cm and was measured using cell type D from ZMK, Germany. This cell is made from glass with two platinization electrodes inside. The distance of the electrodes is 60 mm, and the diameter of the electrode is 20 mm. The uncertainty measurement was estimated according to the ISO GUM recommendation by identifying all possible uncertainty sources in the electrolytic conductivity measurement process. The result showed that the expanded uncertainty of electrolytic conductivity measurement for KCI 1 M by a secondary method using cell type D was 0.33% at k=2 for 95% confidence level with a repeatability of the measurements and cell constant as the biggest sources of uncertainty which contributed as 80% and 17%, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
525,"The aim of this questionnaire survey study is to find out if the three socio-demographic aspects gender, age and household size have any influence on washing-up behaviour and whether people's washing-up behaviour changes due to them. The data was collected via a questionnaire created and carried out by Forum Waschen"" that could be answered by German consumers either on the internet or on the day of sustainable washing created by Forum Waschen"". In addition to the socio-demographic facts, the questionnaire involved questions about both manual and automatic dishwashing. The results of this study vary; some aspects of washing-up behaviour are correlated and some are not. Only some aspects are dependent on gender, more the manual dishwashing behaviour than the automatic. By contrast, most aspects depend on or correlate with the participant's age. The biggest difference between households of different size are the quantities of dishes used and need to be washed per day. Besides the connections to socio-demographic aspects, there are also connections between different aspects of dishwashing behaviour itself, such as the positive correlation between the frequency of changing the tea-towel and its usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
526,"Stiffness and anisotropy of culture substrates are important factors influencing the cell behavior and their responses to external stimuli. Herein, we report a fabrication method of oblique polymer pillars which allow modulating both stiffness and anisotropy of the substrate for spreading and elongation studies of Rat Mesenchymal Stem Cells (RMSCs). Poly (Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid) (PLGA) has been chosen to produce micropillars of different heights and different pitches using a combined method of soft-lithography and hot embossing. The stiffness of such pillar substrates varies over a large range so that RMSCs show effectively different spreading behaviors which are also sensitive to the inclining angle of the pillars. Our results showed that with the increase of the pillar height the area of cell spreading decreases but the cell elongation aspect ratio increases. Moreover, cells preferentially elongate along the direction perpendicular to that of the pillars' inclining, which is in agreement with the calculated anisotropy of the pillar substrate stiffness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
527,"Fatty acids (FAs) are basic components in plants. The pharmacological significance of FAs has attracted attentions of nutritionists and pharmaceutists. Sensitive and accurate detection of FAs is of great importance. In the present study, a pre-column derivatization and online mass spectrometry-based qualitative and quantitative analysis of FAs was developed. Nineteen main FAs were derivatized by 2-(7-methyl-1H-pyrazolo-[3,4-b]quinoline-1-yl)ethyl-4-methyl benzenesulfonate (NMP) and separated on reversed-phase Hypersil BDS C8 column with gradient elution. All FAs showed excellent linear responses with correlation coefficients more than 0.9996. The method obtained LOQs between 0.93 ng/mL and 5.64 ng/mL. FA derivatives were identified by both retention time and protonated molecular ion corresponding to m/z [M + H](+). A comparative study based on FA contents in peel and pulp, seeds and leaves of Nitraria tangutourum Bobr (NTB) from different geographical origins was performed with the established method. Results indicated that NTB were rich in FAs, and the types and contents of FAs varied among tissues.

528,"For a supercritical solvent-solute system, as a critical end point (CEP) is approached, the solubility becomes sensitive to temperature variations. By virtue of this phenomenon, a conceptual model is proposed to combine extraction and crystal growth. CO2-naphthalene is chosen as the reference system. Theoretical optimizations suggest that the newly defined pseudo-CEPs are favorable reference states, especially those close to the lower CEP. In each near-CEP region, the performance is promoted when the CEP is approached. The temperature at the bottom wall should be higher than that at the top one to offset the stabilizing concentration gradient due to gravity and initiate double-diffusive convection in the cooperative regime. Numerical simulations confirm that the performance of the current model operating at the optimized reference state is better than the previous experimental results in terms of crystal growth rates. The conceptual model provides an efficient configuration for coupled extraction and crystal growth apparatuses. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
529,"La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/alpha-Al2O3 shows its potential to be an efficient catalyst for CH4-SCR of NO in our former study. This paper focuses on its activity with water vapor in simulated flue gas and two different pretreatments aimed at improving its performance were also studied. The effects of temperature, residence time and initial O-2 content were investigated by experiment. XRD and SEM results indicate that all three catalysts can remove NO and the vapor-treated catalyst may have the worst behavior due to its poor porous structure. Experiment results show the fresh catalyst can gain a high NO removal rate (> 95%) in certain conditions as well as the other two pretreated catalysts. In general, the NO conversion rates decrease with the increase of the initial O-2 content. The calcined catalyst has the best oxygen resistance ability while the vapor-treated catalyst has the worst tolerance to O-2. NO conversion rates over the calcined catalyst can remain steady above 90% with 0-4% O-2. It seems calcination plays a role in improving the catalytic properties of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/alpha-Al2O3.

The ciprofloxacin was diazotized with phenol using acidified sodium nitrite in a domestic microwave oven. Faster microwave heating and microwave effects were found to be very effective for the process of diazotization. The microwave-assisted reaction was initiated in an acidic media and the colored product was stabilized in a slightly basic medium using a NaOH solution as a neutralizer. The product was found to exhibit the maximum absorbance at 440 nm. All of the experimental conditions like the concentration of reagents, microwave power and reaction time were optimized. The optimum concentrations for phenol, sodium nitrite, HCl and NaOH were found to be 140 ppm, 300 ppm, 0.006 M and 0.006 M respectively. The optimum reaction time was found to be 2 min and a medium high power of the microwave was found to be most effective. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were found to be 1.08 and 3.61 mg L-1 respectively.

In this work, a kind of nonionic gemini aliphatic polyurethane surfactants (GPUs) with different hydrophobic chain lengths as a retanning agent combined with polyacrylic acid (PAA) for condensed tannin tanned leathers to improve their performances. The effects of the alone or combined use of the PAA and GPU, the hydrophobic chain length of GPU, and the offer percentage of retanning agent were studied by evaluating the organoleptic properties, shrinkage temperature, mechanical properties of the obtained leathers. The best performance was found in the leather retanned with PAA and 12-GPU-550 complex retanning agent, and the mechanical properties of leather could be improved when the total offer percentage was controlled at 4 wt%.

543,"Bispecific antibodies open new opportunities in drug development and have become a desirable drug format in cancer immunotherapy. In this type of application, one arm of the bispecific antibody binds to a cancer-specific receptor, while the other arm binds to a T-cell specific receptor to induce cancer cell elimination. Because up to four different polypeptide chains are involved in the assembly of a full-length bispecific antibody, many strategies have been developed to maximize the yield of the desired product (heterodimer) and facilitate the removal of undesired variants, such as homodimers. The successful adaptation of each strategy requires the development of suitable analytical methods to detect and measure the levels of undesired variants. Because the physicochemical properties of the undesired variants can be very similar to those of the desired heterodimer, it is paramount to magnify the minor differences as part of method development. In addition, given that the facilitation of heterodimerization of bispecific antibodies often relies on specific mutations that may impact the physicochemical properties, additional method assessments may need to be considered to ensure their suitability, such as interference from desired product to undesired variants. In the first half of this article, a summary of the common strategies employed in the production of full-length bispecific antibodies is provided. Then two case studies are presented in the second half. In the first case study, the proof-of-concept results are shared for a novel analytical method for variant detection using hinge specific proteases that cleave at defined sites above or below the disulfide bonds in the hinge region.

548,"A method is described for the determination of DNA via nucleic acid amplification by using nucleic acid concatemers that result from DNA supersandwich self-assemblies (SSAs). The method employs two auxiliary probes to form self-assembled biotin SSAs. These exhibit strong fluorescence if labeled with intercalator SYBR Green I. In the presence of the target (as exemplified for a 30-mer), streptavidin is released from the surface of the functionalized magnetic microparticles (FMMPs) by competitive hybridization on the surface. However, the SSA products do not conjugate to the FMMPs. This leads to a large amount of SYBR Green I intercalated into the concatemers and eventually results in amplified fluorescence in the supernate. The SSA products can be prepared beforehand, and amplification therefore can be completed within 50 min. The method is more efficient than any other conventional amplification. The detection limit for the 30-mer is 26.4 fM which is better by a factor of 10 compared to other amplification methods. Conceivably, the method can be further extended to the determination of a wide variety of targets simply by replacing the sequences of the probes. Finally, this rapid and highly sensitive method was employed for detection of Ebola virus gene (approximate to 30-mer) and ATP in spiked serum with satisfactory results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

550,"Bio-degreasing technology based on the use of lipases has attracted more attention in the leather industry. Although lipases have been applied in leather making in the past, the previously reported lipase degreasing ratio is still not very high, i.e. less than 60%. In order to correctly understand the mechanism of lipase degreasing and to choose lipases and optimize the degreasing process for achieving efficient degreasing, a novel method of evaluating the catalytic hydrolysis properties of lipases towards skin fats based on a greasy skin powder substrate in an aqueous medium was established. This simulated the actual leather degreasing process and detected the amount of fatty acids produced. The special substrate was prepared; the determination conditions were optimized; then the performances of several typical lipases were evaluated. The results revealed that the lipase performances determined by the novel method were quite different from the standard method using emulsified olive oil substrate. There was a strong product-inhibition characteristic in the catalytic hydrolysis reaction of lipase, and the inhibition concentration of fatty acids varied with the lipase type, thus the maximum hydrolysis ratio of fats was only 67%. The lipases exhibited ""super-activity"" at pH around 9.5. This occurred because the fatty acids produced transformed into soluble soaps, thus the product-inhibition was weakened. According to the above results, a two-step lipase processing was made, i.e., beginning at pH 7.5 then 9.5. The hydrolysis ratio of fats rose to 82.57% from 46.23%, and the degreasing ratio increased from 50.78% to 89.68%. The new method with better repeatability can be used as a tool to correctly select lipases and optimize process parameters for lipase degreasing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They show reasonable geometries and a binding free energy of -7 to -10.03 kcal/mol. The most favorable values were obtained for the venom of the Asian snake Naja atra (5Z2G, -10.03 kcal/mol). Good results were also obtained from the venom of the Latin American Bothrops pirajai (3CYL, -9.71 kcal/mol) and that of Ecuadorian Bothrops asper snakes (5TFV, -9.47 kcal/mol) and Bothrops atrox (5TS5, -9.49 kcal/mol). In the 5Z2G and 5TS5 L-amino acid oxidases, quercetrin binds in a pocket adjacent to the FAD cofactor, while in the myotoxic homologues of PLA2, 3CYL and 5TFV, it joins in the hydrophobic channel formed when oligomerizing, in the first one similar to alpha -tocopherol.

552,"A popular and important grape 'Sahebr and a less known local grape 'Halagho' in Iran, were studied to unmask the influence of pruning severity and cane length on fruit bioactive potentials; total phenolic and anthocyanin content in which they affected significantly. In this investigation, effects of 4, 6 and 8 buds per cane with pruning intensity as light, moderate and severely pruned and their interaction in the course two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018 in 'Sahebr and 'Halagho' were studied. Results revealed striking differences which in either cultivar, pulp phenolic content was 2 to 5 fold higher in 2017 compared to 2018 with the severely pruned 'Halagho' at the highest (5.14 mg/g DVV). Whereas, lightly pruned 'Halagho' with 6 buds per canes had the highest peel anthocyanin content (1.09 mg/g DVV), in the same condition but with severely pruning 'Halagho' showed the highest anthocyanin content in pulp (0.86 mg/g DVV) while in the second year, 2018, severely or lightly pruned this type with 6 buds per cane had a significant increase in phenolic compound accumulation (10 mg/g DVV). From the results of this experiment, it could be concluded that the pruning of the vines is a stressor and generates enhanced phytochemical constitutes to possibly mitigate the negative consequences. However, variation in the biochemical properties manifested a notable grape cultivar dependency in addition to the time factor, which was more pronounced in 'Halagho' than Zahebr. To some extent the effect of cultivars on the differences of two cultivars was predominant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

554,"In a present work, a comparative study of two types of LiTiZn samples of ferrite ceramics, which were sintered using conventional ceramic technology at a temperature of 1010 degrees C for 2 h and which were made with preliminary mechanical treatment in a ball planetary mill, was carried out. It is shown that mechanical treatment in a ball mill leads to a decrease in the defects level, an increase in the Curie point and a demagnetizing factor of ferrite ceramics. The growth of the demagnetizing factor is associated with an increase in the porosity of ferrite ceramics samples pre-grinded in ball. According to the X-ray phase analysis data, the lattice parameter and the coherent scattering region decrease in this case, and the microstrain is reduced by an order of magnitude. The defects level was assessed by the results of mathematical processing of the temperature dependences of the initial permeability using the previously proposed phenomenological expression. Measuring TG/DTG curves in a magnetic field allowed, on the one hand, to confirm a significant difference in Curie points for different types of samples, on the other hand, to detect the presence of an additional magnetic phase in ball-milled ferrite ceramics samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
555,"Fish burgers as new products require their shelf life investigated. Sensory results usually do not follow a homogeneous profile, as it measures human perception. Once the sensory and physicochemical monitoring of the shelf life takes time and considerable investment, the Near Infrared spectroscopy comes as a fast instrumental technique, which can access multiple parameters from the sample at the same time. In order to replace traditional methods improving mathematical modeling, the objective of this study is the estimation of the data preprocessing and homogeneity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) influence in the quality parameters of Partial Least Squares modeling. Calibration and validation models were evaluated by means of correlation coefficient, Rank, robustness and Residual Prediction Deviation. All the preprocessing available on the software Opus Lab (R) were tested and compared. 72 readings/8 samples of refrigerated grass carp burgers originated the data regarding its water activity, rancid taste, pH and reactive substances of thiobarbituric acid results. The preprocessing methods accessible were Standard Normal Variate, Multiplicative Scatter Correction, 2nd derivative, 1st derivative, Straight Line Subtraction and Min/Max. Each chosen preprocessing generated a model with different parameters. The homogeneity of data proved to have a direct influence on the robustness, confirming the challenge to fit sensory results in Partial Least Squares prediction models.

556,The Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde with various phosphonate-stabilized carbanions has been performed under ultrasound irradiation. The reaction time at ambient temperature was considerably shortened (5-15 min) compared to nonsonicated conditions requiring often refluxing for 6-24 h. Control of the reaction time can be achieved by tuning the base strength in different solvents. This method was successfully applied to the preparation of various 2-substituted vinylferrocenes. The as-prepared (E)-2-ferrocenylvinylphosphonic acid was used to modify ITO electrodes to form redox-active functionalized ITO electrodes which have been characterized by means of electrochemical techniques.

557,"The main purpose of this article is the in vitro study of elastin from the bovine neck ligament using dielectric spectroscopy in the alpha electric field dispersion region in the temperature range from 22 to 200 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the relative permittivity of wet elastin indicates a maximum of about 50 degrees C due to the thermal decomposition of loosely bound water, as well as a rapid decrease in this parameter above 185 degrees C. For a dry elastin, the change in relative permittivity with temperature represents only one peak of high temperature around 185 degrees C, corresponding to the glass transition temperature (T-g). Below T-g, the activation energy of conductivity for wet and dry elastin at 50 kHz, responsible for the breaking of hydrogen bonds between bound water molecules and hydrophilic polar groups of the main elastin chains, is 27 and 11 kJ mol(-1), respectively, and above T-g, corresponding activation energy values associated with relaxation of the main chain increase to 72 and 34 kJ mol(-1). In this article, dielectric processes related to the glass transition temperature, especially in the case of dry elastin, can play an important role in the use of solid-state elastin as a biomaterial for various tissue engineering applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such materials are of importance in many applications where thermal energy storage is needed, including solar systems, buildings, electronic devices, or radionuclide encasements. We show how theoretical parameters that appear in the formula can be adjusted in order to fit experimentally measured peaks. Two of these parameters are interesting in applications: the specific latent heat and phase change temperature. We illustrate this procedure for four peaks associated with phase changes in four different materials for which the heat capacity peaks had been measured at slow heating rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
559,"The problem of post-stress disorders of cerebral circulation, the most severe of which is cerebral hemorrhage, or hemorrhagic stroke, is extremely urgent. Concerning the survival rate, previous studies have shown that in the same type of conflict situations, individuals resistant and predisposed to emotional stressful influences are clearly distinguished. However, the neural mechanisms providing neuromediatory regulation of responses to stressful effects are still little studied. The analysis of neurochemical sensitivity to acetylcholine and norepinephrine of the sensorimotor cortex neurons of rats having different activity according to behavior parameters, i.e., resistance to emotional stress influences before and after experimental hemorrhagic stroke (EHS) was carried out. The recovery process after an EHS due to neural activity in prognostically stable (VA) and predisposed (NA) to stressful situation rats has individual characteristics. Acute stress influence before EHS development changes the nature of neurons activity of the sensorimotor cortex in VA and NA rats on the third and seventh day after EHS. EHS leads to specific changes in the sensitivity of neurons to acetylcholine and norepinephrine in VA and NA rats. Acetylcholine microionophoresis causes activation of the neuron impulse activity in VA and NA rats, and these changes are the same after EHS. Acute stress influence before EHS development does not change nature of neuron responses to norepinephrine microionophoresis in VA animals. On the contrary, in NA rats loss of neuron sensitivity to norepinephrine during EHS development against stress was noted. It is possible that acute stress influence before EHS development can change brain noradrenergic system activity in NA rats, which are prognostically predisposed to stress influences. The data obtained stress the plasticity of the central nervous structure in development of response to stressful influences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
560,"Hydrogen peroxide is a green propellant used in nanosatellites for micro-propulsion. The flow pattern and concentration of hydrogen peroxide decide the thrust produced in such micro-thrusters in which the thrust is of the order of milli-Newton. A mini/micro-fluidic cross-sectional geometry can dramatically vary the fluid flow characteristics, particularly for a capillary-driven flow in such devices. In the present work, experiments are carried out in a mini-square channel of 50 x 2 x 2 mm size and thickness of 0.5 mm with air-hydrogen peroxide as two-phase flow fluids. Bubble and slug flow regimes formed during the flow are recorded using a PROMON high-speed camera. An infrared transceiver circuit is used for identifying the flow regimes. COMSOL Multiphysics package is used to develop a numerical model. The developed numerical model is validated with the experiments by comparing the signal behaviour. The shape effects of the square, circular, and triangular channel on IR transceiver irradiation during two-phase flow are detailed. The effects of dimensional ratio of the test section on IR transceiver irradiation are discussed.

SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances. Accurate estimations of the magnetic properties of the heme derivatives is essential for the development of the SWI technique. In this paper, we study structural and magnetic properties of the heme derivatives from Density Functional Theory calculations. By applying the Stoner model we obtained the magnetic susceptibility of the heme derivatives. We find that the paramagnetic phase of heme, deoxyhemoglobin and aquomethemoglobin to be more stable than the diamagnetic phase as expected from experimentation but the diamagnetic phase of the oxyhemoglobin and hemichrome is more stable.

562,"3-Substituted 1,2,4-triazines easily react with nitronate anions to replace hydrogen atom in the position C-5 according to nucleophilic substitution mechanism and form appropriate oximes of 5-formyl- or 5-acyl-1,2,4-triazines. Present study has shown that the course of the reaction strongly depends on the structure of the substituent in the position C-3 of 1,2,4-triazine ring. Thus, 2-ethoxyphenyl substituent in 1,2,4-triazine allowed to form, besides appropriate oximes, also new nitronic acid derivatives stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The synthesis pathway and molecular structures of oximes were confirmed by X-ray analysis performed for model compound 1-[3-(2-ethoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazin-5-yl]ethanone oxime. The presence of the new nitronic acid derivatives in the reaction mixture and the theoretical calculations at DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level strongly suggest that intermediate stabilized by bifurcated intramolecular hydrogen bond is a common intermediate for the construction of appropriate oximes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
563,"In the present work a tissue-equivalent (TE) nanocomposite is prepared by mixing polyamide 6 (PA6), polyethylene (PE) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to be a substitution for the expensive and difficult to obtain A-150 plastic as the wall material of tissue-equivalent proportional counters (TEPCs). It is found that 3% of CNTs in the nanocomposite produced 3 x 10(-6)S cm(-1) electrical conductivity comparable with that of A-150 and the soft tissue. Also, TEM picture shows the electrical network formation in the continuous PA phase and the interface of PA and PE phases. Determination of the density and the weight percentage of elements of this nanocomposite reveal that the obtained values are similar to A-150 and the soft tissue. On the other hand, simulations carried out by Geant4 toolkit show that the fluence of secondary charged particles of the gamma rays or neutrons inside the gas cavity originating from A-150 and the nanocomposite (3% CNT) is similar. In addition, microdosimetric distributions derived from a TEPC with the nanocomposite wall agree well with a TEPC with A-150 wall. Hence, the frequency-mean and dose-mean lineal energies obtained by the two TEPCs are also compatible. A maximum difference 3% is observed between the frequency-mean lineal energies. Also, the dose-mean lineal energies differ up to 10%. Consequently, the dose-equivalent determined by the two above TEPCs is found similar. Finally, it is concluded that the fabricated nanocomposite can be a reliable substitution for A-150 plastic as a wall material of TEPCs in the neutrons and gamma ray measurements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

566,"Small sized electrocatalysts, which can be obtained by rapid nucleation and high supersaturation are imperative for outstanding methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Conventional microwave synthesis processes of electrocatalysts include ultrasonication, stirring, pH adjustment, and microwave irradiation of the precursor mixture. Ethylene glycol (EG), which serves as a reductant and solvent was added during the ultrasonication or stirring stage. However, this step and pH adjustment resulted in unintended multi-stage gradual nucleation. In this study, the microwave reduction approach was used to induce rapid nucleation and high supersaturation in order to fabricate small-sized reduced graphene oxide-supported palladium (Pd/rGO) electrocatalysts via the delayed addition of EG, elimination of the pH adjustment step, addition of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), prior microwave irradiation of the EG mixed with Na2CO3, and addition of room temperature precursor mixture. Besides its role as a second reducing agent, the addition of Na2CO3 was primarily intended to generate an alkaline condition, which is essential for the high-performance of electrocatalysts. Moreover, the microwave irradiation of the EG and Na2CO3 mixture generated highly reactive free radicals that facilitate rapid nucleation. Meanwhile, the room temperature precursor mixture increased supersaturation. Results showed improved electrochemically active surface area (78.97 m(2) g(-1), 23.79% larger), MOR (434.49 mA mg(-1), 37.96% higher) and stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The necessity of performance of such investigations was determined by two aspects. The first is the development of the innovative technologies with the purpose of formation of the heat-resistant coatings and other coatings with various functions and necessary properties (formation of such coatings with the help of supersonic heterogeneous streams). The second is the creation of the supersonic heterogeneous streams, which are required for the development of experimental investigations of processes of the erosive and corrosive wear of structural components of the high-speed air vehicles, which conduct flights in atmospheric anomalies (rain clouded sky and dust-in-air conditions). This study describes the entire cycle of the experimental investigations, which were performed with the purpose of construction of the more reliable mathematical model of flow of the nonisentropic heterogeneous streams in the gas-dynamic accelerators with great elongation. The viscous gas flow parameters were calculated using the classical model of a flat boundary layer. The value of the characteristics of the carrier gas flow, the dispersion of particles and their material for accelerating particles in a heterogeneous flow were found out. The study showed that the design of gas-dynamic micro accelerators must be carried out taking into account the increase in the thickness of the boundary layer along the walls of the particle accelerator. In addition, this article presents a more detailed description of gas dynamics of flow and heat exchange of the heterogeneous mixtures within supersonic gas-dynamic accelerators with mass concentration of the powder particles (""K-phase"") in the stream up to 15%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

571,"Gradient descent method is an essential algorithm for learning of neural networks. Among diverse variations of gradient descent method that have been developed for accelerating learning speed, the natural gradient learning is based on the theory of information geometry on stochastic neuromanifold, and is known to have ideal convergence properties. Despite its theoretical advantages, the pure natural gradient has some limitations that prevent its practical usage. In order to get the explicit value of the natural gradient, it is required to know true probability distribution of input variables, and to calculate inverse of a matrix with the square size of the number of parameters. Though an adaptive estimation of the natural gradient has been proposed as a solution, it was originally developed for online learning mode, which is computationally inefficient for the learning of large data set. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive natural gradient estimation for mini-batch learning mode, which is commonly adopted for big data analysis.

Unlike existing approaches, the proposed framework provides natural 3D manipulation of a face without background distortion and interactive face editing by a user's input, which leads to freeform manipulation without any limitation of range or shape. To achieve these features, a 3D morphable face model is fitted to a face region in a video frame and is deformed by the user's input. The video frame is then mapped as a texture to the deformed model, and the model is rendered on the video frame.

Performance evaluation and comparison results show that the proposed framework is promising for 3D face editing in live video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article aims to analyze the parameters of lipid spectrum and markers of vascular inflammatory reaction in patients with CHD, in groups with stable angina and unstable angina episode after angioplasty with stenting, to trace the dynamics of biochemical parameters and to reveal the predictors of undesirable coronary events. Patients with CHD with significant coronary artery stenosis (CKS, n=95) revealed after coronary angiography (CAG) at the point of maximum increase in the markers of the inflammatory response (3 months after angioplasty) are divided into 2 groups - patients with stable angina pectoris (AP, n=77) until the end of the study and patients with a developed post-revascularization episode of unstable angina (UA, n=18) after angioplasty with stenting. It was established that patients with UA at the initial stage have a significantly higher risk of developing coronary blood flow instability in the post-revascularization period due to initially elevated levels of homocysteine and rf-CRP.

580,"The purpose of this paper is to study the diffusion of silver ions, Ag+, into TiO2 nanotubes, using Fick's second law. The mathematical simulations were carried out using the finite element method to solve this partial differential equation. A single nanotube, immersed in an aqueous solution containing Ag+ ions, composes the physical two-dimensional model. The most relevant results show that the system final concentration can be calculated in the function of solution initial concentration, of solution volume and nanotube volume. The equation obtained can be generalized to the study of diffusion for other ions in aqueous solution through nanotubular structured materials, because the equation does not take into account the diffusion coefficient of the ions. The height of nanotube is exponentially proportional to the equilibrium time, proving the relation of height with the diffusion course. On the other hand, the diameter of nanotube does not have a significant relationship with the equilibrium time. These results indicate that for ions incorporation into materials, with nanotubular structure, it should prioritize experimental conditions that favor the vertical growth of the nanotubes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present work was to study the antagonistic interactions between the soil bacteria of the order Bacillales and phytopathogenic fungi. The spore-forming soil bacteria attract increasing interest as biocontrol agents, but little is known about the influence of local soil conditions on the development of antagonism in indigenous bacterial strains. This can lead to unsuccessful attempts of bacterial antagonists isolation. To determine the sequences of primary nucleotide DNA, the authors used the Sanger sequencing method, the detection of sequencing products was performed automatically, using the method of capillary electrophoresis. Homology of at least 97% was considered as the criterion for classifying a microorganism as a certain species. This study presents new data on the influence of soil type and preceding crop on the level of antagonism against Fusarium and Plectosphaerella.

582,"Gold nanostructures were fabricated on a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) coated PET substrate by an electrodeposition technique from a potassium gold (III) chloride solution for two different types of applications. It was found that the optical transparency of lightweight ITO electrodes could be maintained by depositing isolated gold nanostructures while opening up the use of these electrodes for inner sphere electron reactions, such as hydroquinone oxidation, which are not possible at ITO electrodes. For practical applications the adhesion of gold to the ITO electrode was improved by modifying the ITO surface with 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS). Compared to Au/ITO, the Au/MPS/ITO electrode showed vastly improved electrochemical activity toward various electron transfer reactions when subjected to mechanical stress. The biosensing properties of the Au/MPS/ITO electrode was also investigated by studying the detection of immobilized DNA on the Au/MPS/ITO electrode via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
583,"The article discusses the thermal protection of spacecraft under various types of thermal and climatic influences. During the pre-launch preparation, several types of icing are possible on the surface of the tiled structure, consisting of quartz heat-shielding tiles. It is very important in the process of operation, to determine normal and shear stresses during icing and the impact of ice formed in the tile gaps. It is necessary to calculate the strength and performance of the tiled thermal protection in active stages of flight of spacecraft. A mathematical model was constructed that allows, with a sufficient degree of accuracy, to research the tiled structure for strength, shear and tearing of the tile when exposed to ice. Calculations for strength, shear, and tearing of tiles under the influence of ice were performed. Theoretical and experimental studies were compared. The performed calculations made it possible to show that the tile will not collapse under the considered load. The strength of the substrate withstands the emerging shear forces. The values of the adhesion strength of ice appearing on the surface of quartz fiber heat-protective coating were obtained. It was demonstrated that the proportion of tangents in the stressed state of the tile does not exceed 10%. The proposed mathematical model for studying the characteristics of the tiled thermal protection of a spacecraft adequately describes the processes under study. Experimental studies have shown satisfactory agreement with theoretical results. The calculations performed to determine the ultimate shear stresses in the substrate showed that the strength of the substrate withstands the emerging shear forces. Consideration of climatic conditions can significantly reduce risks in the design of thermal protection of modern aircraft. The results of this study can be used in further studies, and they can also be taken into account in the construction of aircraft.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the maturation of the biotherapeutic market over recent years, novel protein products such as conjugates, bispecifics, fusion proteins, and coformulations are being developed. The detailed characterization and quality control of complex biopharmaceuticals has proven to be more challenging than the typical two-light-chain/two-heavy-chain monoclonal antibody products. This study presents applications of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) for characterization and quality control of novel biotherapeutic products, including antibody-drug conjugates, hydrophobic proteins, and coformulations.

586,"The basis of SLT is the postulate of nonequilibrium, according to which there is an objective property of matter - ""nonequilibrium"", which characterizes the uneven distribution of matter and motion in space. A new formulation of the SLT is given in relation to the set of locally equilibrium subsystems that make up the nonequilibrium system: when real (irreversible) processes occur, the nonequilibrium of the isolated system (IS) decreases, and in reversible processes the nonequilibrium in the system of locally equilibrium subsystems does not change (the increment of one kind of nonequilibrium completely compensated by a decrease in the disequilibrium of some other kind). The maximum work that can be done when the nonequilibrium system goes into equilibrium is considered as a quantitative characteristic of the nonequilibrium system. The article provides a calculated confirmation of the theoretical provisions of the concept of nonequilibrium and its mathematical apparatus by examples of determining the loss of IS disequilibrium during operation of a heat engine performing an irreversible cycle and the nonequilibrium state of an adiabatic system (AS). Schemes of an IS consisting of a hot body, the environment, and a working fluid performing a temperature-imperfect Carnot cycle are given, as well as an AS consisting of the environment and a working fluid, upon expansion of which work is given to an external work receiver. It is shown that the external work of the adiabatic system should be determined not by the decrease in the thermodynamic potential of the working fluid, as is generally accepted, but by the decrease in the potential of all AS bodies (the working fluid and the environment). As a result, analytical expressions are obtained for the practical calculation of nonequilibrium and its reduction during real processes in systems consisting of an aggregate of locally-equilibrium subsystems, which is new in thermodynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In isomer ""b"", one phosphine remains in the open mouth of the butadienesulfonyl ligand, and the CO and the second phosphine have exchanged positions, being now the CO near to the SO2 group, and the phosphine opposite to the SO2 group. The most abundant isomer is assignable to a for 9a-11a and 12a-15a, while the opposite is observed in 8a and 12a with the bulkier triphenylphosphine. Electronic and predominant steric factors have been implicated as being most responsible for leading to a preference for one isomeric form over the other. A comparative study of these derivatives was carried out through the analysis of the IR, mass spectrometry, and H-1, C-13{H-1} and P-31{H-1} NMR, as well as through crystalline structures of 9a ', 11a, 12b ', 13a ', 14a and 15a, as well as precursors 5-7. The presence of the butadie-nesulfonyl ligand in all isomers 8a, b-15a, b induces a total asymmetry that is reflected through the H-1 and C-13{H-1} NMR, in addition to the preferred coordination mode (1-2,5-eta-) of this ligand.

591,"The reaction of silica with various cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by water electrolysis was investigated as a means of preventing the formation of silica scales in geothermal binary power generation. Through batch and continuous experiments, it was found that all silica in the cathode phase of a reaction device could be removed if the necessary amounts of magnesium and calcium were present. This occurs because a silica-magnesium-calcium compound is produced via a polymerization reaction with cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by electrolysis. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows that this material has the formula 2CaO-5MgO-8SiO(2)-H2O, and thus is likely generated by the reaction proposed by Sheikholeslami et al. (2019). Increasing the current sent through the reaction solution subsequently produces calcium carbonate. This technique for the separation of silica and calcium from aqueous solutions can be operated continuously without channel clogging, which indicates the possibility of practical applications. However, overly high currents promote the migration of protons from the anode to cathode phases, which inhibits the formation of precipitates due to a neutralization reaction. The proposed method is an effective approach for removing silica from a solution in geothermal binary power generation; although, a means of suppressing the effects of proton generation will be necessary if the process is also to be used to remove calcium ions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of Benthic foraminifera, sponge sparkles, and ammonites in the Sharaf section alludes the existence of shallow to deep open marine. Such diagenetic processes as cementation, micritization, porosity, accumulation, iron oxide and bioturbation are observed in Dalichai formation.

One of the mode was deduced using Maxwell relation eta = B-m tau(r), where eta is dynamic viscosity, B-m is bulk modulus, and tau(r) is relaxation time. The latter (tau(r)) depending on temperature was used to estimate Debye relaxation time and its fast component (tau(2)).

607,"The T-1 of a hyperpolarized site in solution is a key parameter that determines the time-window in which its NMR signals are observable. For C-13 sites adjacent to protons, H-1-decoupling has been shown to increase the hyperpolarized signal resolution and SNR. Additionally, polarization transfer to protons has shown utility in increasing the sensitivity of detection. However, H-1-decoupling could lead to a change in the decay rate of a hyperpolarized C-13 site. Here we tested this possible effect in a case where the protons are directly bound to an sp(3) hyperpolarized C-13 site (using [1,2-C-13(2)]choline) and H-1-decoupling was applied continuously throughout the hyperpolarized decay measurement. We found that H-1-decoupling did not lead to any significant changes in the C-13 polarization decay time but did result in the expected collapse of J-coupling and produced sharper signals. This result suggested that H-1-decoupling did not affect the decay rate of hyperpolarized sp(3 13)C sites.

608,"Non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis (NACE) has been developed as a powerful analytical method for a group of compounds having both a weak charge and high hydrophobicity, including pharmaceuticals. NACE is possible to apply a high voltage because of the low current value, compared to the commonly used aqueous system, which enables to shorten the analysis time. In addition, an improvement in the detection sensitivity can be attainable by sample stacking using an increased concentration of electrolytes. Hitherto, NACE has been limited to use as an alternative to aqueous capillary electrophoresis method, such as suppression of the current value, improving of the solubility of a hydrophobic compound, and adjusting the electroosmotic flow. In the process of searching for new analysis conditions for NACE, we found that the electroosmotic flow is reversed from the cathode to the anode by using boric acid/potassium borate with 1-propanol buffer solution.

Diluted HNO3 and H2SO4 were used as the mobile and striping phases, respectively. In these stages, concentrations of HNO3 and H2SO4 solutions for the uranium extraction yield were optimized. We found that 5 M HNO3 and 3 M H2SO4 were the best solutions for uranium separation. Effects of electrodeposition conditions on uranium deposition yield were considered. Results showed that current of 1.5 mA, deposition time of 75 min, pH 2 and electrode gap of 1.5 cm were optimal conditions for electrodeposition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
610,"The main objective of this work is to study the applicability of ensemble methods in the context of deep learning with limited amounts of labeled data. We exploit an ensemble of neural networks derived using Monte Carlo dropout, along with an ensemble of SVM classifiers which owes its effectiveness to the hand-crafted features used as inputs and to an active learning procedure. In order to leverage each classifier's respective strengths, we combine them in an evidential framework, which models specifically their imprecision and uncertainty. The application we consider in order to illustrate the interest of our Multiple Classifier System is pedestrian detection in high-density crowds, which is ideally suited for its difficulty, cost of labeling and intrinsic imprecision of annotation data. We show that the fusion resulting from the effective modeling of uncertainty allows for performance improvement, and at the same time, for a deeper interpretation of the result in terms of commitment of the decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
611,"Homogeneous and heterogeneous gas-phase static thermolysis of chlorothalonil (CT, 1) and four derivatives are presented. After thermal decomposition, many interesting products are formed. Chlorothalonil yielded principally carbonaceous residues and dehalogenated compounds, while all the derivatives also afforded a condensed dihydrophenazine (17). Relevant information from pyrolysis states that: CT is quantitatively decomposed when compared to its aromatic derivatives; in all cases some potential toxic compounds (which were detected with the help of NMR, GC-MS and IR) are produced; the best catalysts to perform the decomposition are the acidic zeolite H-Y and metallic Cu; the two zeolites used, (H-ZSM-11 and H-Y) are able to adsorb the substrates, but only H-Y is capable of decomposing CT in carbonaceous residues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
612,"Vibrations induced by flow, generally referred to as vortex induced vibrations, are of great importance in the design of marine risers. These flexible cylindrical risers undergo vibrations of very high amplitude when the vortex shedding frequency matches the natural frequency of the riser. Such vibrations are capable of putting the safety of crew working on offshore platforms in question. Hence the prediction of response of such structures is considered very important. Although a lot of numerical work has been done in this field treating the problem as a two-way fluid structure interaction, the fact that these works demand very high computational efforts has not made it pertinent where high end computing resources are not readily available. A quick prediction of the structural response of such slender structures needs to be handy to the engineers at times of need. This paper addresses a solution technique for such a problem through an economical method for quick and reliable prediction of riser response under vortex induced vibration utilizing minimum computational effort for moderate Reynolds number (Re <= 3 x 10(5)). Two dimensional flow simulations are carried out using RANSE based CFD followed by the uniform mapping of hydrodynamic forces on to the three dimensional riser. The grid used for the numerical simulation has been well validated against wind-tunnel experimental results for Re= 5.3 x 10(4). Hydrodynamic forces corresponding to the first three harmonics of natural frequency of the riser have been used as input solver to analyse the response using finite element method. Trajectories of the cylinder in the first three modes of vibration have been obtained, a typical eight figure pattern which is characteristic for lock-in vibration. It is found that the method is quite effective in the quick computation of flow induced vibration problems for low and moderate Reynolds numbers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
613,"The purpose of the work is to increase the chi-square test power by analyzing the spectrum of output states of this test discrete form. The refusal from a hypothesis of a spectrum continuity of a chi-square molecule output states allows you to observe 22 spectral lines of different probability amplitudes on a sample of 11 experiments. It is proposed to obtain a mode of support for the quantum superposition of the output states of the chi-square molecule through the random selection of 11 experiments from the general population of 21 experiments. This makes it possible to obtain about 200,000 different states of the molecule, which is quite sufficient to estimate the 8-level states of the probability amplitude of 22 output spectral lines. In the case of the histogram with 6 intervals, the hypothesis of a continuous spectrum of the chi-square test for a sample of 11 experiments does not allow us to distinguish between normal and uniform laws of data distribution with a confidence probability acceptable for practice. The situation changes dramatically if the spectrum discrete nature of the chi-square molecule states is taken into account. It is possible to obtain significantly different digital portraits of the normal and uniform data distribution. Their differences are about 40 bits as per the Hamming distance. The chi-square molecule can be interpreted as a certain square neuron with a Gammerstein structure. Simulation of Schrodinger equations on an ordinary computer has exponential computational complexity in relation to the number of electrons (degrees of freedom or experiments). For this reason, the reproduction of quantum computations on 22 qubits and more within the framework of quantum mechanics on an ordinary computer is technically difficult to perform. A completely different situation arises with the support of quantum superposition of the chi-square molecule. The support of quantum superposition of the chi-square molecule has linear computational complexity. As a consequence, it is possible to implement 22-qubit, 222-qubit, 2222-qubits, and higher quantum computations on an ordinary computer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

618,"The effects of influential fatigue testing factors, including loading schemes (e.g., traditional load shedding and staircase load increasing), morphology of crack starters, and precracking approaches on the near-threshold fatigue crack growth behaviors for a near lamellar gamma-TiAl alloy (Ti-45Al-2Mn-2Nb-1B) were investigated at room temperature and 650 degrees C. The results showed that the measured fatigue threshold values in lamellar gamma-TiAl alloys are very sensitive to the applied testing procedures. For example, the staircase load-increasing method yielded smaller threshold values. When such a load-increasing method was used, the threshold values were measured either from a notch machined by electro-discharge machining or prepared by a compression-compression fatigue loading. Moreover, some differences could be seen with respect to the morphologies of the crack starters. Most of the above influences are associated with the brittle nature of the material and the characteristics of the lamellar microstructures, and closure effects are primarily induced by crack wake roughness or unbroken ligaments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
619,"This paper investigates the secure transmission for buffer-aided relay networks in the Internet of Things (IoT) in the presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers. For security enhancement, we adopt the max-link relay selection policy and propose three secure transmission schemes: (1) non-jamming (NJ); (2) source cooperative jamming (SCJ); and (3) source cooperative jamming with optimal power allocation (SCJ-OPA). Moreover, to analyze the secrecy performance comprehensively, two eavesdropping scenarios, i.e., non-colluding eavesdroppers (NCE) and colluding eavesdroppers (CE) are considered. Based on this, by modeling the dynamic buffer state transition as a Markov chain, we derive the exact closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability, the average secrecy throughput, and the end-to-end delay for each schemes. The analytical analysis and simulation shows that the SCJ-OPA scheme achieves similar performance as the NJ scheme when the total transmit power is small. On the other hand, when the transmit power is high, the performance achieved by SCJ-OPA is similar to that of SCJ. Thereby, the SCJ-OPA scheme can achieve better performance across the entire total transmit power, which makes up the defects of NJ and SCJ exactly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

624,"Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) is a characteristic membrane-bound metalloenzyme of methane-oxidizing bacteria that can catalyze the bioconversion of methane to methanol. However, in order to achieve pMMO-based continuous methane-to-methanol bioconversion, the problems of reducing power in vitro regeneration and pMMO stability need to be overcome. Methanobactin (Mb) is a small copper-chelating molecule that functions not only as electron carrier for pMMO catalysis and pMMO protector against oxygen radicals, but also as an agent for copper acquisition and uptake. In order to improve the activity and stability of pMMO, methanobactin-Cu (Mb-Cu)-modified gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-pMMO nanobiohybrids were straightforwardly synthesized via in situ reduction of HAuCl4 to AuNPs in a membrane fraction before further association with Mb-Cu. Mb-Cu modification can greatly improve the activity and stability of pMMO in the AuNP-pMMO nanobiohybrids. It is shown that the Mb-Cu-modified AuNP-pMMO nanobiohybrids can persistently catalyze the conversion of methane to methanol with hydroquinone as electron donor. The artificial heterogeneous nanobiohybrids exhibited excellent reusability and reproducibility in three cycles of catalysis, and they provide a model for achieving hydroquinone-driven conversion of methane to methanol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
625,"The lattice dynamics of bismuth nanoislands induced by ultrafast laser excitation is studied by ultrafast electron diffraction. The decay times of the Bragg peak intensity depend on the diffraction order. For 5-nm flat nanoislands, the decay time of the (110) diffraction order is close to the A(1g) optical phonon decay time. When the thickness is increased to similar to 16 nm, the excitation energy is dissipated into low energy phonons, making energy transport diffusive, thus leading to a longer decay time. The temporal evolution of the (012) Bragg diffraction peak shows a two exponential decay with a second decay time of similar to 40 ps emerging when the nanoislands are 5 nm thick and the laser fluence is lower than 1.5 mJ/cm(2). This second decay may be attributed to a phonon bottleneck caused by size restriction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
626,"The application of metal nano-particles in laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry has been widely studied. Compared with tradition matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) methods, metal nano-particles have advantages, such as the suppression of fragment peaks, clear background of the mass spectrum, enhanced sensitivity and higher selectivity. Furthermore, some molecules that are difficult to be ionized with traditional MALDI can possibly be ionized by metal nano-particles. However, using metal nano-particles alone always achieves the aggregation of nano-particles, resulting in a low ionization efficiency. To overcome this drawback, our group developed a method involving combined metal nanoparticles with one kind of aluminosilicate, zeolite, which can prevent aggregation and make the ionization process more smooth. In this paper, we will introduce applications using this combination to detect low-molecular-weight compounds with MALDI mass spectrometry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, the effects of solution pH values and some coexisting interfering substances on OA detection using EuIII-dtpa-bis(adenine) as a fluorescent probe were investigated. The linear relationship of F-0/F and OA concentration in the range of 10-150 mu mol/L was obtained, where F-0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of Eu-III-dtpa-bis(adenine) at 320 nm in the absence and presence of OA, respectively.

There is a need for alternative treatments that can prevent mental and somatic stress manifestations during dental implantation in such patients. We investigated the therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of mesodiencephalic modulation (MDM) in patients with mild type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent dental implantation. This clinical randomized controlled study included 67 patients with mild type 2 diabetes mellitus and a dental pathology comprising a single defect in a dental arch. Group G-1 (n = 22) received dental implants and MDM therapy during the early post-implantation period. Group TG-2 (n = 22) received dental implants and MDM therapy during pre-implantation and early post-implantation periods. Group RG (n = 23) received dental implants without MDM therapy. Patients' blood glucose levels, heart rate, and emotional state in pre-and post-implantation periods were compared. In all groups, blood sugar levels and heart rate peaked at 5 minutes after dental procedure completion. An increase from 5 minutes before starting to 5 minutes after completing the dental procedures was significant in TG-1 and RG groups but not in the TG-2 group. Quality of life was significantly higher in both the treatment groups than in the RG group at 10 days after the procedure.

Via applying the centre manifold theorem and bifurcation theorems, the occurrence conditions for flip bifurcation and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation as well as Turing instability are determined. Numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and reveal many interesting dynamic behaviours. The flip bifurcation and the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation both induce routes to chaos, on which we find period-doubling cascades, invariant curves, chaotic attractors, sub-Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, sub-flip bifurcation, chaotic interior crisis, sub-period-doubling cascade, periodic windows, sub-periodic windows, and various periodic behaviours. Moreover, the food chain system exhibits various self-organized patterns, including regular and irregular patterns of stripes, labyrinth, and spiral waves, suggesting the populations can coexist in space as many spatiotemporal structures.

630,"Adsorption of Th(IV) on red soil and black soil was studied as a function of ionic strength, pH, solid-liquid ratio, contact time, temperature and initial concentration through batch static tests, and the soils were characterized by SEM, XRD and IR. The results showed that the adsorption reaction was rapidly and greatly affected by pH. The experimental data conformed to the Freudlich model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, reflecting nonlinear chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the intra-particle and liquid film diffusion occurred simultaneously during the Th(IV) adsorption on the soils, and adsorption reaction was controlled by cation exchange reactions. According to adsorption thermodynamics in this experiment, the adsorption of Th(IV) on these two soils was found to be a spontaneous and endothermic process.

For such a system, more driving motors and precise transmission mechanisms are necessary, which makes the control and fabrication complicated. This paper aims to present the design and construction of a novel holonomic mechanism to simplify the system. Air-based propulsion was applied to a land-based holonomic vehicle. A prototype with three roller balls was developed with a propeller for the propulsion of a triangular holonomic vehicle. Only two motors were applied, one for propeller rotation and the other for the adjustment of the angle of thrust. For the establishment of the methodology, the data, including propeller size, rotation per minute, velocity, thrust, efficiency, etc., were measured or calculated. The prototype can move at a velocity of approximate 0.558 m/s with an efficiency of 18.55%. Simulation results showed that with the increase of propulsion efficiency, the velocity can achieve more than 5 m/s if the efficiency is 70%. This study is the first attempt to apply air-based propulsion to a land-based holonomic vehicle. Further, the construction method is simple and can satisfy the accuracy requirement.

634,"The adsorption process is a highly efficient and widely applied fundamental technique in the field of Geo-environmental engineering. Most existing adsorption models are empirical or semi-empirical and lack a consistent and unified scientific theoretical basis. In this work, a new adsorption kinetic model with dispersion-type (D-type) has been proposed within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics for investigating the adsorption behavior of a single ionic species onto a solid adsorbent. Based on Ziegler's maximal rate of dissipation, an expression for mass exchange rate was determined after a detailed theoretical deviation by defining the thermodynamic force and thermodynamic flow; and by formulating two dispersion-type free energy functions and a dispersion-type dissipation rate density function. The mass exchange rate expression was introduced into the mass balance equation as further validation of the D-type adsorption kinetic model for a single system. Comparing the adsorption process predicted by the presented model with the tested adsorption processes of Pb2+ and Cd2+ onto beidellite and Pb2+ on bentonite, the results reveal good agreement with experimental data. The D-type adsorption kinetic model could provide a correct description of the kinetics of adsorption process for single ionic species onto solid adsorbent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

636,"The reaction between (F3C)(2)B=NMe2, 1, and acetonitrile at low temperature in pentane yields a bora-acetonitrile rather than the expected coordination complex. This appears to arise from the two undergoing an ene reaction followed by a rearrangement analogous to a ketenimine-nitrile rearrangement. Computational studies indicate that mechanistic steps suggested for the latter require energies too large for the reaction to take place under the experimental conditions. Instead, a mechanism in which the ene reaction product is attacked by a second molecule of 1, followed by hydrogen transfer and decomposition, exhibits barriers lower than that for the ene reaction. The mechanism implies that the fragment of 1 in the observed product is not the one that underwent the ene reaction. The ene reaction barrier is rate-determining, and it is low enough to conform to the experimental conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An additional layer with a fluorophore of naphthalene or methylnaphthalene was deposited, and the bilayer was optically pumped. Vapor-deposited naphthalene and methyl-substituted naphthalene molecules on the surface of Al2O3 are amorphously arranged and exhibit a characteristic excimeric fluorescence that is spectrally broad, featureless, and red-shifted relative to the monomer fluorescence. When the bilayer was heated in a temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment, the ordering in the alkylbenzene substrate caused the overlayer of naphthalenes to crystalize due to heteroepitaxy. Finally, the two layers mixed when the surface temperature was nearly at the desorption temperature and resonance energy transfer was observed from the alkylbenzene to naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes when the alkylbenzene percolated through the naphthalene and methylnaphthalene adlayers.

The laser longevity of pyrromethene dyes doped in PDMS matrices could exceed 1 x 10(5) pulses through a fast self-recovery on the laser output with the elapse of aging time. The efficient and stable laser output of the dopants and the flexibility of the PDMS host provided the feasibility of such gain media as mechanically tunable laser sources, which might be employed as cost-effective components on integrated bio-chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

644,"Poly[1,5-bis(N-pyrrolyl)pentane] (PBNPP) has been designed as a new addition to the modified polypyrrole family. This study entails the introduction of a pentane spacer between two pyrrole moieties and subsequently their oxidative polymerization under ambient conditions. The newly designed monomer and its polymer were fully characterized by FT-IR. The structural and optical behaviors were comparatively explored with reference to polypyrrole (Ppy), which was again prepared under same conditions. SEM was employed to visualize the morphology of PBNPP and Ppy comparatively. The data demonstrated the morphology of the PBNPP as spherical beads with a greater extent of surface porosity compared to Ppy, which possesses a compact granular form. The structural parameters were explored by XRD, where both possess crystallites of smaller size. Thermal behaviors were analyzed by TGA and DSC, where the newly designed polymer showed greater thermal stability and more plasticizing trend as compared to Ppy. Optical and HOMO-LUMO attributes have been characterized using UV-Vis spectrophotometer and diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The PBNPP demonstrated greater molar absorption and lesser HOMO-LUMO gap as compared to Ppy. The PBNPP was proposed as a suitable candidate for photoconductivity compared with the Ppy. Thus, the polymer produced from the modified pyrrole is thermally more stable, has high plasticizing character, reflects greater optically sensitivity, and possesses ease of electronic transition compared to its counterpart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
645,"Significant differences in the reactivity of isomeric heptafluoronaphthalenes and bromoheptafluoronaphthalenes towards organolithium and organomagnesium compounds were found. Metalation of polyfluorinated naphthalenes 2-C10F7X (X = H, Br) occurs easily under the action of bases (BuLi, t-BuLi, LDA) as well as EtMgBr (X = Br) in ether. This fact was proven by F-19 NMR spectroscopy and by trapping of 2-C10F7M (M = Li, MgBr, Mg(2-C10F7)) with electrophile ClSiMe3. The interaction of 1-C10F7Br with BuLi or EtMgBr proceeds in a similar way. In contrast to 2-C10F7H, isomeric 1-C10F7H is the less acidic substrate and undergoes only the nucleophilic alkyldefluorination when combined with BuLi or t-BuLi. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

646,"In this work, a new and simple method was developed for the synthesis of uncovered and high-selectivity spiramycin-based molecularly imprinted microspheres (SP-MIMs) by Pickering emulsion polymerization using spiramycin as templates. And surprisingly the solid particles were absent on the surface of imprinted microspheres, which can be ascribed to the Ganoderma lucidum spores (GLS): they were firstly selected to be the stabilizers for the Pickering emulsion in this new strategy. Through a series of adsorption experiments, the uncovered SP-MIMs were proven to possess more excellent selective recognition and removal ability for template SP in aqueous solution. And SP-MIMs could be reused for many times without significant loss of adsorption capacity, indicating the satisfactory regeneration performance. Therefore, SP-MIMs can be employed as a promising adsorbent for the selective removal of SP from aqueous media, and this strategy will contribute to overcoming the shortcomings of stabilizer particles on the surface of the as-prepared imprinting microspheres, because these solid particles lack the special selective recognition activity of template molecules, and may disturb the adsorption effect of imprinting microspheres.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further analysis of the chemical composition of the droplets from the device and in the soil after the experiment was reported to investigate the effects of the soil.

649,"Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs, 30 and 70 nm) and microparticles (SiMPs, 10 mu m) were functionalized with a PTP1B specific probe for label-free fluorescence detection of PTP1B. Intrinsic tryptophan residues of PTP1B serve as the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor and the functionalized silica particles as the FRET acceptor. When a mixture of the functionalized SiNP and PTP1B is excited at tryptophan excitation maximum (280 nm), significant sensitized fluorescence was detected at 450 nm as a result of FRET. The limit of detection of PTP1B was found to be 29 and 70 nM for the functionalized 30 and 70 nm SiNP, respectively. Using this approach, PTP1B could be detected in E. coli cell lysate in which PTP1B was induced. The functionalized SiNP probe (SiNP/NA) was selective toward PTP1B over BSA, and the nanoparticles are able to penetrate into cells.

The complex viscosity and its components - viscosity and elasticity, were determined over the entire range of changes in the circular frequency, including the section of destruction of the initial structure of the polymer system. It was established that almost until the destruction of the initial structure, the constancy of the complex viscosity is maintained, within which its viscous and elastic components change. It is shown that the cause of the destruction of the initial structure of the polymer system (entanglement network) is its transition from a viscoelastic state to a forced elastic one, when the complex viscosity is almost completely determined by its elastic component. When the ultimate strength of the polymer network is reached, the initial structure is destroyed, accompanied by a decrease in the complex viscosity and its elastic component with their subsequent increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

657,"The probability of terahertz transitions between Landau levels for various magnetic fields at 4.2 K is calculated at different positions of Fermi levels corresponding to different concentrations of electrons. A resonant type magnetic field dependence of light absorption at fixed Fermi energy is demonstrated. Besides the ideal case of well-defined Landau levels with small broadening, the effects of resonance degradation due to big broadenings and big fluctuations of Fermi energy along the sample are demonstrated. The maximum values of light absorption coefficients and their resonance positions in magnetic field scale B-max were studied in a wide range of Fermi energies from 0 up to 400 meV at frequency THz of the incident beam. The calculation shows that B-max increases when Fermi energy grows, but there are regions of plateaus resulting in semiladder type of this dependence. The peak values of light absorption manifest a periodic-like dependence on Fermi energy with a huge change in value (in several orders), although the increase in average of maximum value of absorption with Fermi energy is also observed. The possibility to observe photoconductivity response due to photoinduced charge carriers by terahertz transitions between Landau levels is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
658,"Effects of W solution (3 at.%) on the structure, elastic properties, and structural phase transition of Co under pressure were investigated in this paper by first principles calculations. The lattice constants of pure Co and Co-W alloy, both with fcc and hcp structure, gradually decrease with the increasing pressure. In general, the bulk modulus(B), shear modulus(G) and Young's modulus(E) of pure Co and Co-W alloy increase approximately linearly with the increasing pressure. W solution brings almost negligible impact on B of fcc and hcp Co, however, effect of W solution on G and E can not be neglected. It is worth to mention that B, G, and E for fcc Co and Co-W alloy are always higher than those for hcp Co and Co-W alloy at the same pressure. According to the calculated results, W solution can improve the ductility and thermodynamic stability of Co, and increase the hcp to fcc phase transition pressure from 102 GPa to 130 GPa.

After screening the reaction solvents, such as CH2Cl2, DMF, Et2O, C6H5CH3, THF, CH3CN, DMSO and CH3C(O)CH3, DMSO was chosen as the best reaction solvent, and within the solvent, the yield of unsymmetric 1,3-diynes could achieve the good value of 72%.

664,"The properties of luminescence centers in carbon nanodots synthesized in the pores of mesoporous silica are studied. The effects of annealing the nanodots in the reducing/oxidizing atmosphere on the nanodot luminescence are investigated. Analysis of the effects together with low-temperature luminescent spectroscopy of the nanodots indicates a significant contribution of oxygen atoms to the formation of luminescence centers in the carbon nanodots studied. The temperature dependence of the degree of the photoinduced linear polarization of the emission of colloidal solutions of carbon nanodots was investigated. Increasing temperature is found to result in the depolarization of nanodot emission. The thermal effect on the polarization degree is well described by the Levshin-Perrin equation, which proves the rotational mechanism of the nanodot emission depolarization. By comparing the experimental data and the theory, the size of the rotating elementary emitters was estimated. The size obtained (similar to 0.9 nm) is appreciably less than the diameter of carbon nanodots under study (similar to 3 nm), which indicates that the atomic groups responsible for the luminescence of carbon nanodots are nonrigidly connected with their cores and can rotate almost independently of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The morphologies of the etched silicon surfaces were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). For short etching duration of 1 to 2 h, few numbers of very large sized pores and inhomogeneous micro pores appeared on the etched silicon. By increasing the etching time to 3 h, relatively larger numbers of homogenous nanopores were formed. The addition of ethanol (surfactant) to the etching solution of V2O5 and HF led to the development of deep pores. Furthermore, routine change of the solution significantly increased the pore volume and pore depth of the sample, with large cubic pores appearing on the surface. Thus, the pore morphology of PSi is significantly influenced by the use of ethanol as a surfactant and the routine change of the etching solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is crucial to clarify the functioning of a mechanism, which can improve the impurity electroactivity.

676,"The effect of solvent on the solubility of sulfachloropyridazine was studied by making a correlation between the solubility values and solvent's descriptors for solvent-solute and solvent-solvent interactions with the help of linear solvation energy relationships concept. From analysis of the molecular structure of sulfachloropyridazine, the variation of solubility was well explained in terms of the change in hydrogen bond basicity of mixtures when the mole fraction of methanol (or ethanol or isopropanol) increased in all aqueous binary solvent mixtures. The preferential solvation analysis of sulfachloropyridazine in the three aqueous co-solvent solutions of isopropanol, ethanol and methanol was carried out from solubility values through the method of inverse Kirkwood-Buff integrals. In water-rich compositions of the aqueous co-solvent solutions, the delta x(1,3) values are negative, indicating that the sulfachloropyridazine was solvated preferentially by the solvent water. In intermediate and alcohol-rich compositions, sulfachloropyridazine was preferentially solvated by the isopropanol, ethanol or methanol. The magnitude of preferential solvation of sulfachloropyridazine is greater in isopropanol solutions than in the other two co-solvent solutions.

The electromagnetic surface waves are generated on the planar interface of two different materials. The hyperbolic materials constructed by making a dyadic negative in columnar thin films. Multiple electromagnetic surface waves were investigated by varying phase of rugate filter form 0 to 180 degrees and wavelength of incident light from 400 to 700 nm. Material's manufacturing fault is also introduced by adding 0.001 i in refractive index of hyperbolic medium.Propagation of multiple electromagnetic waves were observed on the planar interface of rugate filter and hyperbolic material.

678,"Electronic structure calculations representing the molecular orbitals (MOs) with contracted planewave basis functions (CPWBFs) have been reported recently. CPWBFs are Fourier-series representations of atom-centered basis functions. The mathematical features of CPWBFs permit the construction of matrix-vector products, FCo, involving the application of the Fock matrix, F, to the set of occupied MOs, C-o, without the explicit evaluation of F. This approach offers a theoretical speed-up of M/n over F-based methods, where M and n are the number of basis functions and occupied MOs, respectively. The present study reports methodological advances that permit FCo-based optimization of wavefunction formed from CPWBFs. In particular, a technique is reported for optimizing wavefunctions by combining pseudodiagonalization techniques based on an exact representation of FCo, approximate information regarding the virtual orbital energies, and direct inversion of the iterative subspace optimization schemes to guide the wavefunction to a converged solution. This method is found to speed-up wavefunction optimizations by factors of up to 6 - 8 over F-based optimization methods while providing identical results. Further, the computational cost of this technique is relatively insensitive to basis set size, thus providing further benefits in calculations using large CPWBF basis sets. The results of density functional theory calculations show that this method permits the use of hybrid exchange-correlation (XC) functionals with a small increase in effort over analogous calculations using generalized gradient approximation XC functionals.

680,"Shenfu bituminous coal (SFBC), Geting coal (GTC), Shengli lignite (SLL), and Holingola coal (HLGLC) were oxidized by UV light radiation with aqueous H2O2 over SFC/TiO2 in a closed suspension system (CSS) to understand structural characteristics of 4 typical Chinese coals. Raw and oxidized coals were dried and extracted with acetone thoroughly to ensure residue extraction. Meanwhile, the extracts were analyzed using a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. The results show that organic matters (OMs) in coals can be converted into a large number of oxygen-containing organic compounds (OCOCs), mainly containing ketones, esters, alcohols, etc. Oxidizing species such as hydroxyls, hydroperoxyl, and alkyl radicals are excited by light irradiation and substitute for hydrogen atoms of methyls and methylenes of acenes or branched-chain alkanes in coals. Acetic acid and acetaldehyde can be formed and dissolved in aqueous solution in the oxidation reaction.

Here, we explore the [M@Au-8(PPh3)(8)](n+) (M = Au, n = 3; Pd, Pt, n = 2) robust framework to gain an understanding of the nature of the inclusion of mercury atoms at Au-4 faces, leading to [M@Au8Hgx(PPh3)(8)](n+) (x = 1, 2). Our results show a weak interaction of about 25kcalmol(-1) per Hg atom, which is mainly of electrostatic character, followed by orbital and London dispersion-type interactions. This weak interaction can be understood as the formation of host-guest species, for which the inherent electronic and optical properties of the [M@Au-8(PPh3)(8)] cluster along the series do not vary to a large extent. This demonstrates that, in [M@Au8Hgx(PPh3)(8)], each Hg can be considered an inclusion atom rather than a dopant element, where the parent cluster is able to act as a Lewis acid host. Furthermore, the viable formation of such species can serve as useful examples to stimulate future experimental characterization of inclusion complexes involving related superatomic structures with available open faces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
685,"The spontaneous alignment of dipoles in patterns tangential or transversal to the interface of molecular clusters is studied by molecular dynamics simulations throughout the entire aggregation process. Tangential ordering (TANGO) is found to rely on dispersion forces driven by dipolar fluctuations. Transversal ordering (TRANSO) results from the interplay of two conditions: the broken translational invariance at the cluster interface and the interactions of multipoles of opposite parity. In this case, the orientational order parameter at the interface follows a universal scaling law behavior. In the limiting case of strongly interacting particles, a sharp structural transition from a disordered into an ordered state is observed at a critical distance inside the cluster and at a critical magnitude of the dipole moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heavy metal ions were successfully transferred from THF to the aqueous phase by the liquid-liquid extraction method during the pretreatment procedures. Then, enriched Cu2+, Mn2+, and Cr3+ were detected by three kinds of silver nanoparticles (4-MBA-AgNPs, 4-MBA-MA-AgNPs, and 4-NBT/4-MBA-AgNPs) using naked eyes and microplate reader, respectively. The visual detection limits of Cu2+, Mn2+, and Cr3+ were 1.0x10(-6) M, 1.0x10(-7) M, and 1.0x10(-6) M, while the detection limits of Cu2+, Mn2+, and Cr3+ were 2.5x10(-8) M, 5.0x10(-8) M, and 5.0x10(-8) M using microplate reader, respectively.

The fluoro derivative BIFOP-F however, ""switches"" the sense of enantioselectivity, yielding the (R)-enantiomer for 1,3-diphenylallyl acetate and the (S)-enantiomer for the cyclohexenyl acetate (up to 92% yield, 67% ee). Computational analyses of transition structures (M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVP//B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP) for these Pd-catalyzed allylic alkylations reproduce the experimental preference of BIFOP-H (and analogue BIFOP-X ligands) for (R)- or (S)-enantiomeric products of 1,3-diphenylallyl or cyclohexenyl acetate, respectively. The ""F-switch"" of the sense of enantioselectivity from BIFOP-H to BIFOP-F is also apparent computationally and is found (NBO-analyses) to originate from lp(Pd) -> sigma*(P-O) or lp(Pd) -> sigma*(P-F) hyperconjugations.

689,"The recently introduced saw tooth gradient protocol for high-resolution polymer HPLC was further improved and optimized in terms of total runtime and separation performance. As a result, increased flow rates enabled drastically reduced runtimes in combination with enhanced peak resolutions. Moreover, the saw tooth gradient profile was further investigated using a saw tooth gradient with a down-to-zero approach concerning the height of the negative backward gradient step. Modifying the mobile phase composition enabled two further gradient protocols: a ternary, and a multicomponent approach, respectively. Thereby, a ternary saw tooth gradient was realized by repeating the whole gradient elution with two adequate pairs of weak or rather non-solvents and desorption promoting solvents for mixtures containing diverse polymer components. A multicomponent saw tooth gradient was established by combining three different solvents in the gradient elution. In addition to mobile phase modifications, various stationary phases were compared and examined. Applying size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns for saw tooth gradient polymer elution chromatography enabled the exploitation of two completely different separation mechanisms (SEC and high-resolution polymer HPLC) on one stationary phase. Thus, two-dimensional, heart-cut coupling of SEC and high-resolution polymer HPLC with only one stationary phase could be achieved. The application of the above-mentioned concept and its highly attractive performance characteristics are demonstrated for a silicone oil with a viscosity of 350 mPa s by using a hybrid HPLC system coupled to a fraction collector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
690,"While exploring novel magnetic semiconductors, the new phase Cr0.65Al1.35Se3 was discovered and characterized by both structural and physical properties. Cr0.65Al1.35Se3 was found to crystallize into orthorhombic CrGeTe3-type structure with space group Pnma (no. 62). Vacancies and mixed occupancies were tested, and the results show that one of the 4c sites accommodates a mixture of Cr and Al atoms, while the other 4c site is fully occupied by Al atoms. Unique structural features include a T-shaped channel network created from the edge-sharing Cr/Al@Se-6 and Al@Se-4 polyhedra and a zipper effect of the puckered Se atoms inside the columnar channels. The round peak observed in the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility (chi(g)) plot at similar to 8(1) K corresponds to the antiferromagnetic-type transition in Cr0.65Al1.35Se3. However, the positive theta(CW) indicates an additional ferromagnetic interaction, which is highly likely due to the complex magnetic structure arising from the mixed Cr/Al occupancies on the 4c site. Electrical resistivity measurements confirm that Cr0.65Al1.35Se3 is a semimetal with a positive magnetoresistance.

691,"In the search for advanced materials active particles could offer unique structural and functional properties, with tunable time-dependent characteristics. We demonstrate here that the direction of self-propulsion, relative to the particle orientation, may be as influential for the phase behavior as the pair interactions are for passive particles, and enable dynamic properties that are not available to passive systems. We perform simulations on ensembles of self-propelled squares, and find that squares that self-propel in the direction perpendicular to a side rapidly reach a steady state with a characteristic cluster distribution, positional order, and well-defined diffusion constant. After tuning the direction towards a corner, the particles form large and dense clusters that show a transient collective motion, and display remarkable fluctuations over long time scales, with a distinct periodicity. Clusters of these particles appear unstable beyond a critical size, and susceptible to a catastrophic disintegration. Directionality is found to effect equally sharp transitions in the mixing properties of active squares and passive squares, and the behavior of the passive ensemble. We relate directionality to the collision dynamics and the resulting reaction network of clusters, evolved by a Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, to correlate propulsion direction to the observed phase behavior. Understanding this behavior could offer new design rules for programmable materials, and grant further insights in the dynamic processes that nature employs for self-assembly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
692,"Regarding the importance of drinking water in the health of the people, its treatment is a critical research field. The aim of this study is investigating the effectiveness of coated multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with amine agent (NH2CH2-MWCNT) and non-coated MWCNT with ferric chloride in comparison to ferric chloride in the removal of turbidity from the water surface. For the first time, the newest type of coagulant is synthesised with different Fe3+/NH2CH2-MWCNT molar ratios. The effect of the Fe3+/MWCNT molar ratios on the morphology and removal rate of turbidity is consistently investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Three types of experiments are performed from coagulant containing ferric chloride, ferric chloride/MWCNT and ferric chloride/NH2CH2-MWCNT for removal turbidity from the water surface, and all experiments are repeated three times. The optimum pH, ferric chloride doses and NH2CH2-MWCNT are determined experimentally as 8, 30 and 5 mg L-?1, respectively. The turbidity removal efficiency for ferric chloride is obtained 88.41% but the efficiency of the removal percentage for ferric chloride/MWCNT is obtained 56.89, while the turbidity removal for ferric chloride/NH2CH2-MWCNT increases up to 93.46%. For ferric chloride/MWCNT it seems that the ferric chloride is trapping by MWCNT and therefore its performance is reduced. But, for ferric chloride/NH2CH2-MWCNT, the effective interaction between ferric chloride and NH2CH2-MWCNT and increasing in effective surface of the particles cause the efficiency of removing turbidity increases by up to 93.46%, which can be easily understood by the water quality obtained after the test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UV excitation of iodide ions produced fully solvated electrons, as well as transient (I, e(-)) and (counterion, e(-)) pairs, the overall concentration of which was monitored by NIR absorption with subpicosecond time resolution. After the UV pulse, the solution absorbance decays almost completely in a few hundreds of picoseconds due to geminate electron-iodine atom recombination and a competitive annihilation channel involving the scavenger. Recombination of transient (I, e(-)) pairs follows the well-known kinetic model, while the electron-nitromethane reaction proceeds by two distinct mechanisms: static scavenging (interpreted in terms of the encounter complex model), with a characteristic time shorter than the temporal resolution of the apparatus, or via a diffusion-limited bimolecular reaction, with a rate constant of 1.1 x 10(11) M-1 s(-1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical relationships. The results show that there are significant effects of the length on the temperature, the enthalpy and the entropy of structural transition of octahedral nanoparticles, and phase transition temperature and thermodynamic properties decrease with the length decreasing. Besides, within the length range of the experimental study, there exist linear relationships of phase transition temperature and thermodynamic properties with the reciprocal of the length, respectively.

In the present work, we report our investigation of the electrochemistry of these asymmetric QSHDs. In addition to the short wavelength and photochromic long-wavelength isomers, we have found that a second, distinct long-wavelength isomer is produced electrochemically. This different long-wavelength isomer arises from a difference in the regiochemistry of spirocyclic ring-opening. The structures of both long-wavelength isomers were ascertained by cyclic voltammetry and H-1 NMR analyses, in concert with computational modeling. These results are compared to those for the symmetric parent PSHD, which due to symmetry possesses only a single possible regioisomer upon either electrochemical or photochemical ring-opening.

To understand these similar ICD effects of the conformers, the geometrical asymmetry of the PhOH moiety bound to (-)BOH and the coupling strength of the electric transition dipole moments between PhOH and (-)BOH are estimated.

Moreover, the effects of ligand substitutions at the active metal center and the effects due to various spin states are also explored, and can serve as a great tool for the rational design of NiFe catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

713,"In this report, novel azobenzene self-assembled complexes (azo-Cn, n = 8, 12, 16) were used as an electrode material for pseudo-capacitors. The as-prepared azo-Cn exhibited a good reversible redox process and possessed a specific capacitance as high as 221.0 F g(-1) at 10 mV s(-1). However, with the value n increased from 8 to 16, the specific capacitances of azo-Cn electrode materials decreased. In order to study the reasons, the effect of surface amphiphilic property of azobenzene self-assembled electrode materials on the properties of supercapacitors was studied and the results showed that the capacitive behaviors of azo-Cn could be greatly improved by better surface hydrophilic properties and azo-C8 with good supercapacitive characteristics could be the potential ideal electrode materials for low-cost and high-efficiency electrochemical supercapacitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
714,"Autofluorescence of the bone extracellular matrix (ECM) has not been widely explored although the ECM plays a very important role in bone development. In our research we focused on examining the bone matrix of very young animals due to the intense growth process during the first month of life. Structure images and fluorescence spectra of the bone surface were carried out using confocal fluorescence microscope Eclipse Ti-S inverted CLSM (NIKON, Japan) for compact tibia of healthy 7-, 14- and 28-day-old rat newborns after prenatal zidovudine administration in comparison with control. Spectral features of ECM autofluorescence were analyzed statistically by taking into consideration p < 0.05. The CLSM technique allows for simultaneous examination of the structure and autofluorescence from selected areas of the bone surface. Excessive autofluorescence of ECM after prenatal zidovudine administration influences bone growth incommensurably to the newborns' age. Therefore the possibility of an additional non-enzymatic mechanism of collagen cross-linking in the first two weeks of life of newborn rats prenatally treated with zidovudine has been considered. Our results suggest that ECM autofluorescence can be an indicator of bone development in the normal and pathological state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

718,"Circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA), the main item of liquid biopsy, is DNA fragments from tumor genome that carries certain characteristics (including single nucleotide variation, deletion, insertion, rearrangement, copy number variation, and methylation) in the human blood circulation system. It mainly originates from apoptotic or necrotic tumor cells. The detection and analysis of ctDNA can provide genomic information in tumors, such as copy number variation, single nucleotide mutation, and methylation enrichment across the genome. It has a certain correlation with tumor size and development and considered as an emerging and promising tumor biomarker for cancer progression, reoccurrence, and routine monitoring after surgery. Compared with other tumor markers, the isolation method is relatively simple due to the stability of ctDNA. However, the extremely low abundance of ctDNA, the high content of background cell free DNA(cfDNA), the large difference between individuals, and the need of predicted detection sites in advance make it necessary to analyze ctDNA in a comprehensive way. Herein, we summarize the recent progress on ctDNA detection from digital PCR to next generation sequencing, including some commercialized apparatuses and certain methods that have recently been developed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

720,"It is of long-standing interest to probe protein primary structures by their codes alone with minimal assumptions and model parameters. Approaches over decades have looked to the mathematics of digital information, most prominently alignment and database search algorithms. We follow an alternative line of inquiry by directing the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) to archetypal sequences and sets. The motivation overlaps with bioinformatics and pharmaceutical chemistry: to better comprehend protein structure information with applications to drug and antibody targets. The approach, however, does not concentrate on sequences per se, but rather their information-conserved transforms. We demonstrate how such transforms enable obscure primary structure correlations to rise to the surface. The methodology further leverages the assembly information in sequences to provide class databases for comparisons. The databases illuminate additional correlations that are nuanced and characteristic. We illustrate the workings of BWT followed by data for archetypal drug and antibody targets. Our purpose is to establish new metrics and signatures for screening targets that complement ones from bioinformatics and protein structure modeling. The programming and analysis are straightforward and well-accessible to data researchers. Further, the software is freely available from the authors on request.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
721,"In the current work, in order to model a free electron solvated in water, we have implemented a method to represent the molecular charge distribution as a set of Slater-type functions within the framework of a QM/MM method called QMSTAT. Also, it has been introduced in this method a new approach to calculate the intermolecular induction energy in the presence of very strong electric fields. Unlike most previous potentials, our method uses the ab initio energies of the electron-water complex as reference to obtain the few fitted parameters that the model needs, instead of the ab initio potential of the electron. A Metropolis-Monte Carlo simulation of 15 million steps has been carried out in a system that consists of an electron solvated in 200 water molecules explicitly described. The obtained results predict a vertical electron detachment energy of 3.30 eV and a radius of gyration of 2.38 angstrom, which are in very good agreement with the experimental data of 3.27+0.10 eV and 2.45 angstrom, respectively. We have also obtained the absorption spectrum of the hydrated electron from our simulation. The maximum of the spectrum agrees very well with the experimental result and the experimental width at half-maximum is only 0.11 eV wider than the calculated curve. The calculations predict the same blue tail as the experimental result but with a less smooth shape. Also, our results indicate that the transfer of intensity from the transition arriving to the highest of the three p states to transitions arriving to higher-lying states contributes to the intensity enhancement of the blue tail of the spectrum. Regarding the solvated structure of the free electron, we have found that if the basis center is used as the electron site to calculate the correlation functions, the results predict a structure where the electron places itself on top of a central water molecule surrounded by the remaining water molecules in a very organized and stable arrangement. However, if the maximum of the electron density is used as electron site the obtained picture shows an electron located in a very fluctuating cavity that collapses and reforms continuously.

The electrical characterization demonstrates the tunability in the resistivity of Al2O3/Gr devices by applying V-g. Al2O3 deposition introduced n-doping in graphene and is affirmed by shifting of charge neutrality point towards negative V-g.

There is a special kind of stacking interactions at each temperature (i.e., Model A at 293 K, Model B at 200 K and Model C at 100 K). The variable-temperature magnetic moments indicate that there is a strong anti-ferromagnetic interaction between the adjacent pi-pi stacking mononuclear mononuclear radical anionic complexes and especially the anti-ferromagnetic coupling strength is close to the diamagnetism at 100 K. The theoretical calculations reveal for the first time that the spin densities between the short contact atoms are beta state and the anti-ferromagnetic coupling property of this crystal may be related to the beta state spin densities between the short contact atoms. The theoretical calculations further confirm that the strong anti-ferromagnetic coupling strength should be relevant to the larger spin densities on the short contact atoms and the larger overlap integrals between the short contact atoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

728,"The growth of oxide scales on CeO2-coated Ni polycrystals, in the temperature range 800-1200 degrees C, is analyzed taking into account both the transport properties of Ce-doped Ni1-xO single crystals, under non-equilibrium conditions, and a formal analysis of transport properties of cation deficient p-type semi conducting oxides in presence of an external driving force. It was shown that a key feature of the beneficial influence of CeO2-coatings on the layer growth is the kinetic demixing of cations, leading to an enrichment of cerium in the inner oxidation scale. It follows a higher cationic vacancy concentration near the metal/oxide interface, leading to a lower vacancy concentration gradient across the layer and a decrease of the driving force of diffusion controlling the oxidation kinetics. Further, the lower cation mobility in the outer layer due to the depletion of Ce4+, leads to a blocking effect of the outward diffusion of cations. It follows a local excess of Ni2+ and the formation of new oxide units which also contribute to a decrease of the oxidation rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
729,"We have developed a simple method for depositing high quality platinum (Pt) metal contacts without the necessity of placing the substrate in vacuum or heating it above 180 degrees C. This method is particularly beneficial for hydrated oxide ceramics, as it prevents water loss and subsequent conductivity degradation. A mixture of two organic solvents was used: ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EEE) and acetone. By dispersing the precursor PtCl4 in this mixed non-volatile/volatile solvent, homogeneous drying patterns were achieved. EEE was used as the reducing agent, providing a relatively slow rate of Pt deposition, and thereby avoiding formation and subsequent coagulation of Pt clusters. Drop casting of the solution (25 mu L/cm(2)) on mirror-polished surfaces was performed at 25 degrees C followed by 5 min partial solvent evaporation. The substrate was then heated to 180 degrees C for similar to 30 s, resulting in the formation of a metallic Pt layer. The method was successfully tested on 5 mol % Y doped BaZrO3 and 10 mol% Gd doped ceria ceramic pellets, alumina plates, and Kapton (R) polymer sheets. The in-plane sheet resistance was 30-110 Omega at room temperature after a single deposition cycle. Because of its versatility and low cost per deposition, the proposed method is very promising for a variety of substrates where high quality electrical contacts prepared at low temperature are required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
730,"Akar kuning (Arcangelisia flava) is known to have a variety of active metabolites which can be extracted with polar solvents including ethanol. The process of extracting various metabolites from the akar kuning needs to be maximized by optimizing various conditions that affect the extraction process, including exposure to light. One method for assessing the success of the extraction process is to assess the UV-Vis spectrum profile. This study aims to determine how the exposure of light from akar kuning stem ethanol extract affects the UV-Vis spectrum profile. Extraction is done by maceration with ethanol solvent, using the UV-Vis spectrophotometry method to analyze the resulting extract. The experimental conditions were divided into three groups, consisting of samples that were extracted by exposure to sunlight, exposed to incandescent light bulbs, and not exposed to light at all. The results obtained showed that the extracted akar kuning sample in a condition not exposed to light at all produced the UV-Vis profile with the highest absorbance, almost double that of other conditions. This indicates that the extracted metabolite has the most quantity compared to other conditions. Conversely, the UV-Vis profile in samples exposed to sunlight has a peak profile that is different from other conditions, indicating that UV exposure to sunlight affects the type of metabolites extracted. These results confirm that the most optimal condition for obtaining as many metabolites as possible from akar kuning is in conditions not at all exposed to light.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our calculations show that the Herzberg-Teller effect and the Duschinsky mixing play key role in simulating correctly the weak or forbidden transition like the S-1 <-> S-0 bands of 7,8-benzoquinoline, especially the former. Based on the present theoretical results, we tentatively assigned a few bands which were not unambiguously marked in the experimental spectra. Comparing the vibrationally resolved electronic spectra of 7,8-benzoquinoline with that of phenanthrene simulated in the previous study, the increased vibronic activity of 7,8-benzoquinoline is due to the symmetry break, which is caused by the introduction of N-heteroatom into the aromatic ring of phenanthrene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reproducibly fabricate metal nanoparticles monolayers with a diameter of similar to 1 mm for the detection of acetate, butyrate, and glucose by a glass capillary tube. Metal nanoparticles monolayers are not only uniform in terms of average interparticle distance but also structurally stable under dynamic fluidic conditions. The monolayers resistant to fluid shear stress with surface-enhanced Raman scattering are able to reversibly monitor the concentration of acetate and sensitively detect acetate and glucose at levels as low as 10 mu M, which is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration range of typical biological gas conversion.

741,"In this study, pure polyaniline (PANI0) and polyaniline/titanium dioxide composites, including 15 wt.% TiO2 (PANI15) and 25 wt.% TiO2 (PANI25), respectively, were synthesised using an in-situ polymerisation technique in the absence and in the presence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, respectively. The solid-phase photocatalytic degradation of polyaniline/titanium dioxide (TiO2) composites was compared with that of the pure polyaniline with the aid of weight loss measurements. The structural and morphological properties of the prepared samples were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and X?ray diffraction analysis. The loading of TiO2 nanoparticles in polyaniline enhanced the solid-phase photocatalytic degradation of the pure polymer both under UVA light and under UVC light, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy illustrated that Pani was synthesised successfully in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles. Field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed homogeneous TiO2 dispersion within Pani matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis supported the idea that the thermal property of the pure polymer was improved with the photocatalyst contribution. The crystalline structure of TiO2 did not change with Pani.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

743,"We investigate the discrete diffraction phenomenon in a Polymer-Liquid Crystal-Polymer Slices (POLICRYPS) overlaying a random distribution of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, plasmonic elements). We study the propagation of a CW green laser beam through the waveguide structure as a function of beam polarization, laser intensity and sample temperature. It turns out that the plasmonic field created at the interface between AuNPs and POLICRYPS waveguides enables and stabilizes the optical field propagation within the responsive nematic liquid crystal channels. The active role of the liquid crystal is pointed out by a polarization, temperature and beam divergence experimental analysis and evidenced by a peculiar trumpet-shaped discrete diffraction pattern. Theoretical simulations confirm that the observed optical behavior is governed by the interaction of the nematic liquid crystal with optical and plasmonic fields.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
744,"Calculations have been performed at the MP2 and DFT levels for investigating the reasons for the difficulties in synthesizing bis(isocyanide)gold(I) halide complexes. Three-coordinated gold(I) complexes of the type (R3P)(2)(AuX)-X-I (1) can be synthesized, whereas the analogous isocyanide complexes (RNC)(2)(AuX)-X-I (2) are not experimentally known. The molecular structures of (R3P)(2)(AuX)-X-I (X = Cl, Br, and I) and (RNC)(2)(AuX)-X-I with X = halide, cyanide, nitrite, methylthiolate, and thiocyanate are compared and structural differences are discussed. Calculations of molecular properties elucidate which factors determine the strength of the gold-ligand interactions in (RNC)(2)(AuX)-X-I. The linear bonding mode of RNC favors a T-shaped geometry instead of the planar Y-shaped trigonal structure of (R3P)(2)(AuX)-X-I complexes that have been synthesized. An increased polarity of the Au-X bond in 2 leads to destabilization of the Y-shaped structure. Chalcogen-containing ligands or cyanide appear to be good X-ligand candidates for synthesis of (RNC)(2)(AuX)-X-I complexes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

746,"In present study, illite flotation behavior with Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Chloride (CTAC) as the collector has been studied to investigate the effects of its residual concentration on froth stability and flotation. Results showed that, with increasing conditioning time, the residual concentration (frother concentration) and froth height decreased simultaneously, while the adsorbed amount (particle hydrophobicity) increased. Increasing CTAC conditioning time decreased the residual concentration in solutions, resulting in poor froth stability and flotation recovery at high pH; the adsorption rate of CTAC on illite surface was relatively high at higher pH due to strong electrostatic mechanism, making CTAC residual concentration decrease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
747,"As transthyretin (TTR) can prevent A? aggregation, a key protein in Alzheimer disease (AD), we developed a novel nanovector based on single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) functionalized by TTR. The retention factors (k) of the binding of grafted TTR on SWCNT (abbreviated gTTR) to HSPG were determined using an immobilized HSPG stationary phase. The negative values of the thermodynamic data demonstrated that van der Waals and hydrogen bonds played a major role in the binding at all pHs value. This binding was maximal at acidic conditions due to ionic interactions between the protonated His of gTTR with the negatively charged sulfate groups of HSPG. The weaker binding to HSPG for gTTR (k?=?3.70 at pH = 4.00 and 37??C) than free TTR (abbreviated fTTR) (k?=?11.80 at pH = 4.00 and 37??C) observed at acidic pHs was explained by the least facility of the His residue to be protonated when TTR was grafted on carbon nanotube. The nanovectorization of TTR with SWCNT thus stabilized the TTR tetramer structure and decreased the amyloid formation of TTR. Fibril formation of fTTR and gTTR studied by turbidity confirmed the fact that immobilization of TTR on SWCNTs decreased the extent and rate of amyloid fibril formation relative to free TTR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A theoretical analysis is performed and referred to compute the optimum dimensions of the atomizer and a detailed numerical and experimental investigation is presented. Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to model and simulate the flow of solvent through the atomizers in order to determine the most important parameters like the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of the droplets, Turbulent Dissipation Rate, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and the exit velocity through the atomizer. Ultrafine RDX explosive is recrystallized with a mean particle size of 4.99 mu m and a standard deviation of 1.35 mu m. The experimental process performed using the fabricated atomizer is a laboratory scale table-top pilot plant which is simple, cost-effective, and safe.

749,"Joule-heated electrodes have been used to enhance electrochemical analysis. Due to such direct heating, a steep temperature gradient is created near the electrode surface. The heating device that provides the high-frequency AC (50 kHz or more) has to be calibrated, in order to apply the desired temperature during analysis. The applied temperature of the working electrode influences both its electrical resistance and the electrochemical potential of a redox couple. Open circuit potentiometric (OCP) measurements were performed automatically with screen-printed gold loop electrodes (Au-LE), while applying 50 kHz AC heating pulses of increasing intensity provided by a ThermaLab (R) AC generator. Potentiometric temperature calibrations were performed using 5 mM equimolar ferri/ferrocyanide in 0.1 M of potassium chloride at 20 degrees C bulk temperature. Potential differences produced during each heat pulse were used to automatically calculate the electrode temperature using the temperature coefficient of this redox couple (-1.6 mV/K). The electrode resistance values at each heating pulse were obtained by measuring the heating voltage and heating current. The automatic temperature calibration experiments with five AuLEs were shown to be highly reproducible and precise, with an RSD for the temperature of 0.24% and 4% for resistance. The average margin error of OCP temperatures were +/- 0.66 K at a 95% confidence level. The temperature coefficient (alpha) of electrical resistivity of the screen-printed gold layers was found to be 0.0025 degrees C-1, which is 27% lower than the theoretical value for gold metal. These findings were confirmed by DC resistance measurements using a potentiostat. Comparing the OCP temperature with the resistivity method, the temperature difference was about 0.94 degrees C (2.8%). Both methods enable quick, reproducible and accurate temperature calibration for disposable Au-LE, which were also used for trace mercury detection in lake water samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Accuracy of the detector was assessed by comparing temperature measurements to those obtained from thermocouples connected to battery-operated data loggers. The temperature detector was then installed on a pre-analytic laboratory automation system to assess specimen temperature before and after processing on an integrated thawing and mixing (T/M) robotic workcell. The IR temperature detector was able to accurately record temperature of closed, moving specimens on a pre-analytic automation system. The effectiveness of the T/M workcell was independently verified using the temperature detector.

767,"Depurination occurs via hydrolysis of the purine-deoxyribose glycosyl bond and causes nucleic acid damage. In particular, the DNA sequences that can undergo a self-catalyzed depurination (SCD) will cause a great uncertainty in duplicating, separating, purifying, and storing the DNA samples. Therefore, there is a great demand to develop a rapid detection method for SCD events. Herein, the use of a convenient fluorescence method to follow the site-specific SCD was demonstrated. We found that the resultant apurine site (AP site) from depurination can be selectively recognized by a fluorescent probe of palmatine (PAL) with a turn-on fluorescence response. The dependence of SCD on the bases of the depurination site, pH, metal ions, and time shows that our method can be used to rapidly evaluate the depurination process. Furthermore, the depurination process can be photo-switched using a photoacid as an external initiator.

OH-radial-mediated BNA oxidation was studied by considering OH addition to carbon atoms (C1 to C6) of BNA and H-atom abstraction at the -NH2 group and carbon atoms (C3 and C5) of BNA by OH radicals.

The straight guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-tubulin cap at the filament tip and the intrinsic curvature of guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-tubulins are known to be the key thermodynamic factors that determine MT catastrophe, while the hydrolysis of this GTP-cap acts as the kinetic control of the process. Although several theoretical models have been developed, assuming the catastrophe occurs when the GTP-cap shrinks to a minimal stabilizing size, the structural effect of the GTP-cap and GDP-curvature is not explicitly included; thus, their influence on catastrophe kinetics remains less understood. To investigate this structural effect, we apply a single-protofilament model with one GTP-cap while assuming a random hydrolysis mechanism and take the occurrence of a crack in the lateral bonds between neighboring protofilaments as the onset of the catastrophe. Therein, we find the effective potential of the tip along the peel-off direction and formulate the catastrophe kinetics as a mean first-passage time problem, subject to thermal fluctuations. We consider cases with and without a compressive force on the MT tip, both of which give a quadratic effective potential, making MT catastrophe an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in our formalism. In the free-standing case, the mean catastrophe time has a sensitive tubulin-concentration dependence, similar to a double-exponential function, and agrees well with the experiment. For a compressed MT, we find a modified exponential function of force that shortens the catastrophe time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
770,"In the present study, we designed tetrahedral tetraarylborate pentads which were synthesized by a typical click reaction, copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cyclization. The synthesis of the borate pentads was confirmed by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopies, and NMR measurements indicated a rapid exchange of bound and unbound counter cations. The obtained borate pentads exhibited a representative behavior of weak electrolytes, and thus a decrease of their concentration caused a rapid increase of their molar conductivity, especially at the limit of dilution. Additionally, the observed association constant did not correspond to the theoretical association constant, probably because of the multivalent ionic dissociation dependent on the dielectric constant of the media.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
771,"The correlation between P-glycoprotein (Pgp) overexpression and multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer is well-established. Recently, we identified (2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-quinolinyl) (2-piperidinyl)methanol (5) (NSC23925) as the most selective and potent MDR inhibitor. NSC23925 binds to Pgp, thus inhibiting its transporter function and reversing MDR in cancer cells. In order to further characterize the chemical properties and Pgp binding mode of the NSC23925 compound, we grew four NSC23925 crystal isomers (NSC23925a, NSC23925b, NSC23925c, and NSC23925d). These crystal isomers were first generated using a vapor diffusion growth technique before their precise structures were analyzed using X-ray crystal-lography. Functionally, the NSC23925a and NSC23925b isomers share a similar stabilization interaction of Cl- mediated hydrogen bonding. In contrast, in isomer NSC23925c, two Cl- are involved in the stabilization of adjacent molecules. In summary, these solved crystal structures may reveal the different activities of the four NSC23925 stereoisomers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
772,"Density-functional theory was applied to the investigation of the structural and electronic properties of C-24 fullerene derivatives. Transition metals (TMs) from groups 11 and 12, in various oxidation and spin-states, are inserted at either endohedral (TM@C-24) or exohedral (TM-C-24) sites and their subsequent energetic stabilities are assessed. With the exception of Ag@C-24, all derivatives are predicted to occupy a minimum on the potential energy surface. The optimized exohedral TM-C-24 geometries yield TM-C bond lengths that are consistent with comparable carbon-metal bond lengths, and the overwhelming majority of the derivatives result in a slight deformation of the C-24 cage as the bonding carbon takes on more sp(3) character. All of the TM@C-24 equilibrium structures maintain the integrity of the cage structure with a moderate increase in the diameter. All neutral exohedral and endohedral complexes favor the low spin-state; conversely, all of the charged exohedral complexes prefer the high spin-state, with the exception of Cu-C-24(1+) molecular ion. The Group 12 charged endohedral derivatives prefer the low spin-state, whereas the Group 11 molecular ions do not necessarily exhibit a definitive trend. Analysis of the energetic data predicts that of the lowest energy endohedral molecular species only four are predicted to be energetically favorable in terms of insertion energy and an advantageous HOMO-LUMO gap: Cu@C-24(2+), Ag@C-24(1+), Au@C-24(3+), and Zn@C-24(2+).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
773,"For the first time, the synthesis of 9-(pyrid-2-yl)indolizine-1 -one from dipyridylpropargyl alcohol together with its molecular structure is reported. As the racemate was used for crystallization, the asymmetric unit contains both enantiomers. The molecular conformation of the pyridyl indolizinone scaffold of the title compound is similar to the one found for the respective chlorophenyl substituted derivative. Furthermore, we report here on the synthesis and X-ray structures of two alkylated dipyridyl methanols, which have been recovered in connection with the synthesis of the indolizinone. Both prochiral alcohols show conformational chirality in the solid state. In both compounds, intramolecular O-H center dot center dot center dot center dot N-pyridine hydrogen bonds stabilizing their molecular conformation are typical. As a common packing motif, we found a O-H center dot center dot center dot N bonding system featuring the graph set descriptor R-2(2)(10).

774,"Lipid domains have been obtained using Langmuir-Blodgett films (LBs) and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Three membranes compositions were chosen, the canonical DOPC: DOPS (3:2)/SM/CHOL (1:1:1), the more physiological one: DOPC: DOPS (3:2)/SM/CHOL (2:1:1) and another one with more phospholipid content: DOPC: DOPS (3:2)/SM/CHOL (3:1:1). All systems were well characterized by pi-A isotherms. As the (SM/CHOL (1:1:1)) concentration increases, the membrane fluidity decreases as demonstrated by the compressibility modulus and area per molecule values. Lipid domains morphology was examined by confocal microscopy. Images corroborated the presence of two liquid immiscible phases: a phospholipid-enriched L-d phase and a sphingomyelin enriched L-o phase. GBV-C peptide membrane interaction was examined using P6-2VIR576 peptide and tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence spectroscopy.

A generalisation of the classical bulk (3D) double layer theory is made by introducing of a surface (2D) dielectric susceptibility. The solution of the formulated non-trivial 3D-2D-1D problem is carried out by methods related to the linear theory of transmission boundary problems.

776,"Woven fabrics commonly referred to as ?aerocotton? and ?aerolinen? are frequently used in the conservation of books and manuscripts and are valued for their strength and flexibility. Although textiles have a long history in the production and repair of books, aerocottons and aerolinens are relatively recent materials adopted from early aircraft production. In 2007, the main supplier of these woven fabrics to the UK conservation community ceased production, and new producers started supplying a range of woven fabrics under the labels of ?aerocotton? and ?aerolinen?. Understanding the strength, composition, and longevity of repair materials is central to conservation practice and this investigation tested two linens and two cottons alongside the discontinued cotton to quantify the relative strengths of the fabrics. Each fabric was tested before and after laundering, and in three directions (warp, weft, and bias). The tests conducted measured mass per unit area, thickness, sett, tensile strength, folding endurance, and dimensional change. In tensile strength tests the bias-cut fabrics were weakest but extended the most, whilst those cut in the weft direction were strongest. The cottons lasted longest in terms of folding endurance and the samples cut on the bias were the fastest to break. The dimensional change tests showed that washing affected the linens more than the cottons and that across all fabrics there was a greater amount of shrinkage in the warp direction. It is hoped that these results will provide concrete information to guide conservators in the preparation and use of aerocottons and aerolinens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, using simple and fast methods, a series of chiral amide derivatives (24 compounds) of ricinoleic and 3-hydroxynonanoic acid was obtained with 31-95% yields. Then, the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity against 13 microorganisms representing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and molds was performed. The obtained compounds showed antimold potential; however, the tested species of molds were more susceptible to derivatives of 3-hydroxynonanoic acid than to amides obtained from ricinoleic acid (RA). Interestingly, hydroxamic acids derived from RA exhibited the best activity against Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. On the other hand, hydroxamic acids derived from 3-hydroxynonanoic acid showed the best antimicrobial potential against the remaining tested microorganisms, especially against Pseudomonas cedrina. The obtained derivatives can be considered compounds of potential pharmacological significance, which is important due to the increasing problem of microbial resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
779,"The paper presents the risk assessment methodology for the critical group members (infants and adults) as a result of the radioactive effluents releasing, during VVR-S nuclear research reactor decommissioning process. The derived emission limits of the effluents were established using the transport model in the environment in order to comply with dose constraints assigned by the regulatory body for public members. Doses were estimated taking into account the age, weight, metabolism and nutrition habits of an individual, based on the dose constraint of 50 mu Sv/year. The gaseous effluents activities were much lower than the liquids effluents activities. Consequently, for dose calculation a dose constraint of 10 mu Sv/year were assigned for gaseous and 40 mu Sv/year for liquid. Doses received are consistent with the dose constraint for gaseous effluents. On the contrary, the dose received are non-consistent for liquid effluents. For both cases the most restrictive dose values were for the adults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
780,"The incorporation of a nitrate ion into silver-water aqueous clusters has been examined using PBEO density functional theory with the solvent model density (SMD) solvation model. The Gibbs free energy of solvation and other thermodynamic variables are calculated using the harmonic/rigid rotor/ideal gas model at 298.15 K for aqueous solutes including the effects of solute relaxation in water and with London dispersive forces at the D3 level. Free energies of solvation for Ag+ and NO3- were found to agree well with experimental values of -118.2 and -60.1 kcal/mol, respectively, calculated using cluster-continuum models with six to eight water molecules and including solute relaxation and London D3 dispersive interactions. An analysis of data of varying cluster size upon calculated free energy is presented. A direct procedure is applied to aqueous clusters such as Ag-n(z)(NO3-)(H2O)(5), Ag-n(z)(H2O)(5), and (NO3-)(H2O)(6) n = 1-4; z = 0, +1 in the SMD solvent representation to calculate equilibrium constants for nitrate association with silver clusters in solution that includes fully relaxed solutes. The equilibrium structures of the nitrate-containing clusters involve one or more bonds from nitrate oxygen to positive silver clusters. Water molecules interact with nitrate through H atoms, and overall, the structure represents a silver nitrate cluster with water ligands having similarity to a close ion pair in many aspects. The neutral silver atom is attached to nitrate through H-bonded water molecules. The ratio of nitrate-containing silver clusters to nitrate-free clusters using a calculated equilibrium constant of 0.51 L/mol for Ag+ is small in the range of many experiments. Similar values are found for positive silver clusters up to four atoms in size. The resulting procedures were applied to aqueous clusters of Ag-n(NO3)(m)(+(n-m)) that have been previously experimentally studied for silver reduction in aqueous solution. A chain-like structure with collinear and bidentate oxygen bonds to silver was found, and the equilibrium constants for clustering were determined. A simplified model calculation for the reduction of Ag(H2O)(6) (+) clusters in the presence of silver clusters in aqueous media was studied to understand catalytic effects observed in these systems. The reduction potentials vary with silver cluster size indicating a more favorable reduction caused by the presence of larger silver clusters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

783,"During the nineteenth century, chemists became increasingly engaged in the conservation treatment of polychrome surfaces. While collaborations between chemists and museum workers in charge of easel painting collections were mostly oriented towards the improvement of conservation practices, the involvement of chemists in the nascent field of archaeology was oriented towards material characterization, such as pigment analysis of polychrome surfaces. Since this type of analysis is destructive and damages the artwork, it could, therefore, be assumed that chemists were in these cases less concerned with the conservation of objects with an archaeological and historical provenance. On the contrary, my new reading of nineteenth-century English primary sources reporting pigment analysis shows that chemists also had ethical concerns about the physical integrity of archaeological objects and their conservation. This is apparent in the process in which paint samples were taken from the artworks for their subsequent analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
784,"The anharmonic frequencies of O-H, C-H, and N-H stretching modes of hydrogen-bonded glycine-H2O complexes are calculated using ab initio classical separable potential approximation. In this approach, ab initio molecular 3 dynamic simulations are used to determine an effective classical potential for each of the normal modes of the system. The frequencies are calculated by solving the time-independent Schrodinger equation for each mode using time-averaged potentials. Three complex structures are studied, which differ in the location of the water molecule on the amino acid. Significant differences are found between the spectra of the three structures, and signatures of individual complexes are established. It is demonstrated that anharmonic effects are essential in the discrimination between different structures, while frequency differences at the harmonic level are much smaller. Intensities are also computed and found to carry information on differences between structures, but the role of anharmonicity in this is small.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
785,"Soot is an important anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosol that forms atmospheric smog. The atmospheric presence of smog raises great concerns to human health. Soot also absorbs visible light from solar radiation, likely contributing to the climate change. This study focused on the optical and thermal effects of soot via a numerical simulation approach and included regular biomass, diesel, acetylene, and propane soot and three carbon surrogates for soot. To make the simulation more similar to real soot aerosols, two major submodels were integrated, which involved their core-shell structures and their fractal agglomerate structures. Four kinds of shell materials, including nonabsorbing (water, sulfuric acid, salt) and weak-absorbing (brown carbon) materials, were studied in their different shell thicknesses. The effects of the shell on the absorption enhancement of the bare soot particles and the dependence of absorption on the light wavelength were revealed. The brown carbon shell was found to exhibit greater absorption enhancement, and its absorption was doubled at 360 nm compared to that at 800 nm. Among the three soot aggregates from the different aging processes, the most stable embedding-type soot aggregate was found to have the maximum absorption of the incident light, resulting in an increase in the surrounding temperature by 0.35 K.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
786,"Two high nuclearity uranyl cages were crystallized in high yield under mild solvothermal conditions using rigid aryl phosphonate ligands. These compounds are prepared either through an in situ phosphonate ligand condensation reaction or via serendipitous assembly with a bulky phosphonate ligand.

Secondly, the formation of bent pyrophosphonate ligands through temperature and solvent-driven in situ ligand synthesis is crucial for the assembly of UPhPO3. Thirdly, the serendipitous assembly of UPh2CPO3 is favored by the use of sterically hindered bulky phosphonate ligands.

787,"The subaperture processing is one of the essential strategies for low frequency ultrawideband synthetic aperture radar (LF UWB SAR) imaging, especially for the real-time LF UWB SAR imaging because it can improve the parallelization of the imaging algorithm. However, due to the longer synthetic aperture of LF UWB SAR, the traditional subaperture imaging encounters an azimuth ambiguities problem, which severely degrades the focused quality of the imaging results. In this paper, the reason for the presence of azimuth ambiguities in the LF UWB SAR subaperture imaging and its influence on image quality is first analyzed in theory. Then, an extended subaperture imaging method based on the extension of subaperture length before Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) was proposed. By lengthening the subaperture length, the azimuth ambiguities are effectively eliminated. Finally, the extended part of subaperture is wiped off before the azimuth compression (AC), and the LF UWB SAR image of high focused quality is obtained. The correctness of the theory analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method have been validated through simulated and real LF UWB SAR data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
788,"This paper proposes a novel architecture of a wearable Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based platform to dynamically monitor Muscle Fiber ConductionVelocity (MFCV). The system uses a set of wireless sensors for the detection of muscular activation: four surface electromyography electrodes (EMGs) and two footswitches. The beginning of movement (trigger) is set by sensors (footswitches) detecting the feet position. The MFCV value extraction exploits an iterative algorithm, which compares two 1-bit digitized EMG signals. The EMG electrode positioning is ensured by a dedicated procedure. The architecture is implemented on FPGA board (Altera Cyclone V), which manages an external Bluetooth module for data transmission. The time spent for data elaboration is 63.5 ms +/- 0.25 ms, matching real-time requirements. The FPGA-based MFCV estimator has been validated during regular walking and in the fatigue monitoring context. Six healthy subjects contributed to experimental validation. In the gait analysis, the subjects showed MFCV evaluation of about 7.6 m/s +/- 0.36 m/s, i.e., <0.1 m/s, a typical value for healthy subjects.

Based on this methodology, a number of unsymmetrically substituted p-terphenyl compounds were synthesized in excellent overall yields. This approach provides a convenient route to this class of compounds, and is suited for the generation of targeted chemical libraries, or the synthesis of precursors of biologically active natural product analogues that contain the p-terphenyl core.

One way to improve accuracy is to incorporate network and control strategies in the same simulation and to use a systematic procedure to assess how different techniques perform.

792,"Linear porphyrin oligomers have found various applications as synthetic molecular wires in the context of light harvesting, solar energy conversion and molecular electronics. In many of these applications a partial ordering of the molecules helps to improve the reaction efficiency or device performance. In this work we study the orientational properties of the building blocks of such porphyrin-based molecular wires, namely a porphyrin monomer and the corresponding butadiyne-bridged dimer. The porphyrins have been embedded in the nematic liquid crystal solvent 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) and the anisotropic properties of their photogenerated triplet states were characterised by transient electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. When aligned in strong magnetic fields, the liquid crystal molecules impose their orientational anisotropy onto the solute guest molecules whose orientation-dependent magnetic properties can then be explored. The line shape analysis of the porphyrin triplet state EPR spectra - highly sensitive to small conformational changes - confirms the orientation of the zero-field-splitting (ZFS) tensors previously determined for these molecules by magnetophotoselection experiments. A biaxial distribution function is shown to be necessary to simulate the experimental EPR data. The biaxial behaviour, in conjunction with symmetry considerations, allows an unambiguous assignment of the three ZFS tensor axes to the molecular axes. From the determined orientational distributions of the porphyrins in 5CB, the biaxial order parameters for both molecules were calculated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used real data gathered and streamed by urban sensors from three cities in Finland, chosen during a continuous time interval: Helsinki, Tuusula, and Lohja. The results showed greater efficiency for the online method of detection of outliers when compared to the offline approach, in terms of accuracy between a range of 8.5% to 10% gain.

794,"Although cable-based seismic sensing systems have provided reliable data in the past several decades, they become a bottleneck for large-area monitoring and critical environmental (volcanic eruptions) sensing because of their cost, difficulty in deploying and expanding, and lack of accurate three-dimensional geographic information. In this paper, a new wireless sensing system is designed consisting of a portable satellite device, a self-sustaining power source, a low-cost computational core, and a high-precision sensor. The emphasis of this paper is to implement in low-cost hardware without requirements of highly specialized and expensive data acquisition instruments. Meanwhile, a computational-core-embedded algorithm based on compressive sensing (CS) is also developed to compress data size for transmission and encrypt the measured data preventing information loss. Seismic data captured by the accelerometer sensor are coded into compressive data packages and then transferred via satellite communication to a cloud-based server for storage. Acceleration and GPS information is decrypted by the `1-norm minimization optimization algorithm for further processing. In this research, the feasibility of the proposed sensing system for the acquisition of seismic testing is investigated in an outdoor field surface wave testing.

N-acetyl tryptophan was analyzed using a reversed-phase gradient elution after treatment under acidic, basic, oxidative, hydrolytic and thermal stress conditions. Linearity in the calibration curve was obtained at a concentration range of 10-100 mu gmL(-1) (R-2 = 0.9916). The lower limits of detection and quantification were 3.53 and 10.69 mu gmL(-1). The degradation of NAT was observed maximum under oxidation stress (52.84%) and minimum under thermal stress (10.22%). Three major degradation products were formed under acidic and basic stress conditions, of which tryptophan was the major one. Thermal stress yielded a single major impurity at m/z 230. Water hydrolysis could form dihydroxy-N acetyl tryptophan at m/z 279. Oxidation stress led to the formation of seven major degradation products. The most effective stress condition was found to be oxidative which leads to 52.84% degradation of the drug followed by acidic stress (34.64%) and basic stress (15.66%). The present study showed an accurate, precise and sensitive LC-MS-MS method for the systematic investigation of NAT and its impurities in formulations. Graphic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large numbers of resonances observed in the solution NMR spectra reflects establishment of equilibria involving multiple diastereoisomers with different nitrogen atom configurations. Support for this explanation was provided by the N-15 HSQC spectrum of the Zn complex, and by variable temperature H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra of each of the three metal complexes.

The role of synthesis route on the physico-chemical characteristics of synthesized materials was investigated using elemental analysis, powder x-ray diffraction, Raman spectral analysis, SEM, TEM, nitrogen-physisorption, MAS NMR and CO2-temperature programed desorption techniques. It was observed that K-LTL-org material composed of highly dispersed LTL nanocrystals, in contrast K-LTL-inorg sample showed highly agglomerated nanosized LTL particles because of high alkaline nature of Si, Al and K precursors used in the inorganic route. Additionally, material synthesized by organic route possessed large specific surface area with broad pore size (radius of 225 angstrom), and also high density of strong basic sites. Due to these properties, K-LTL-org sample showed superior performance in catalytic transesterification of glyceryl tributyrate compared to K-LTL -inorg sample. Also, the K-LTL-org catalyst showed excellent stability under applied reaction conditions and exhibited outstanding recyclability for (five cycles) without considerable loss of activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

802,"Under nitrogen starvation, Ustilago maydis forms lipid droplets (LDs). Although the dynamics of these organelles are known in the literature, the identity of the lipases implicated in their degradation is unknown. We determined lipase activity and identified the intracellular lipases expressed during growth under nitrogen starvation and YPD media by zymograms. The results showed that cytosolic extracts exhibited higher lipase activity when cells were grown in YPD. Under nitrogen starvation, lipase activity was not detected after 24 h of culture, resulting in lipid accumulation in LDs. This suggests that these lipases could be implicated in LD degradation. In the zymogram, two bands, one of 25 and the other of 37 kDa, presented lipase activity.

AbstractJatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceaefamily) is a multipurpose plant with considerable potential in biodiesel production, and in cosmetic and medicinal uses. The part of J. curcas usually used is the oil obtained from its seeds, whereas the leaves generally represent the waste material. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and to preliminary investigate the biological activity of J. curcas leaves obtained from plants by a breeding program. To describe genomic structure, molecular markers were applied. For biological study, two genotypes (JA and JB) that are genetically divergent were selected by cluster analysis. A phytochemical analysis was carried out to characterize the chemical composition of the extracts, which resulted rich in biologically active compounds, whereas toxic phorbol esters were absent. Biological assays showed an antiproliferative effect on the Buffalo normal rat liver cell line (BRL-3A), with genotype B being more potent than that of the counterpart (JA). The purified compounds isolated did not show antiproliferative activity, suggesting that the effect observed was due to the phytocomplex and should involve several secondary metabolites.

814,"A binuclear phenoxo-bridged azido adduct of manganese(III) Schiff base complex has been synthesized. Structure analysis reveals that two units of the tetradentate Schiff base forms the equatorial plane around manganese(III) center in this complex. One of the axial positions is occupied by a terminal azide, while the remaining axial position of the octahedron is connected to a phenoxo group of the neighboring monomeric unit which forms the bridge in the dimer. The benzene rings attached to the two adjacent Mn atoms through O are slightly opened up at their rear ends. The distance between the benzene rings facing each other gradually increase outward. This opens up the possibility of interaction with guest molecules which thereby results in sensing of the analyte molecules. The synthesized binuclear complex was evidently found to have dual actions in sensing and catalysis. Interesting spectral features of the compound allow it to act as a sensor towards an aromatic hydrocarbon, benzene down to similar to 0.06 mM (4.37 ppm) concentration range. A promising catalytic phenoxazinone synthase activity was also observed in the same compound due to the oxidation of o-aminophenol (OAPH).

Their structural and electronic properties were investigated through intramolecular interactions, electron affinities (EA), reduction potentials (E degrees) and complexation of compounds with magnesium and guanidinium cations (ionic and hydrogen bond interactions) using quantum mechanical calculations in the gas phase and solution. For both series of complexes, the most and least stable ones correspond to damirone A and batzelline D, respectively. The energy data, geometrical parameters, and the minima of electrostatic potentials (Vmin) are in good correlation with the results of population analyses. The localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analyses (LMO-EDA) demonstrate that the electrostatic interaction is the most important stabilizing component. The EA values are positive in the gas phase and solution, and are evaluated with the increase in the dielectric constant of solvent. Increase in the EA values and decrease in the E degrees values are observed after complexation with guanidinium and magnesium cations. Those changes are higher for electron-rich compounds compared to electron-deficient ones, containing halogen substituents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
816,"The regioselectivity in Pd(II)-catalyzed C-H direct functionalization of C2-substituted naphthalenes has been a long-term issue in synthetic organic chemistry due to its existence of competitive reaction sites, including C1-, C3- and even C4-sites. Our recent achievement in Pd(II)-catalyzed C1-dearomatization of 2-naphthyl ureas encouraged us to find out the key factors for determining the C1- and C3- regioselectivity of 2-naphthyl ureas based on density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we identified a plausible reaction pathway, which led to the experimental C1-functionalized product with a reasonable energy profile. A homologous pathway giving C3-spirocycle was also calculated to investigate the nature of C1-regioselectivity in this reaction. According to the calculated results, we found that in our reaction C-H cleavage was the regioselectivity-determining step, and that C1 was the kinetically favorable site in this step due to electronic effect which makes C1 a more vulnerable site to electrophiles compared to C3, as reflected by the condensed Fukui function and its larger proportion of the highest occupied molecular orbital. Energy decomposition analyses and electronic structure analyses were further performed, which were in good accordance with our conclusion yet indicated C1 was a more sterically hindered site. This result provided us with the inspiration that steric hindrance may play an important role in frequently reported transition metal-catalyzed C3-arylation in the literature. We then selected a recently reported reaction Pd-catalyzed C3-arylation of 2-naphthyl aniline to study the regioselectivity. The result was in line with our assumption that in C3-arylation of 2-naphthyl aniline the preferential functionalization of C3-site is due to its less steric hindrance than C1-site. This work is thus instructive for understanding the regioselectivity in Pd(II)-catalyzed C-H direct functionalization of C2-substituted naphthalenes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The technique has been widely used in the clinical diagnosis and basic researches on neurological/psychiatry diseases. In this study, the concentrations of five cerebral metabolites, namely N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), taurine (Tau) and glutathione (GSH) in two brain regions (i.e., striatum and medial prefrontal cortex) of 12-months old mice were measured by in vivo H-1-MRS using water signal as the internal standard. The detection results were then compared with those obtained by liquid. state H-1-NMR and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The results demonstrated that the NAA, Glu and Tau concentrations measured by the three techniques had no statistically significant differences among each other, suggesting that the results of in vivo H-1-MRS analyses were at least as reliably and accurate as those obtained by H-1-NMR and UHPLC-MS/MS. The absolute concentrations of Gln and GSH measured by UHPLC-MS/MS were significantly higher or lower, relative to those measured with magnetic resonance techniques. Such discrepancies might have originated from the systematic errors presented in the UHPLC-MS/MS measurements of Gln and GSH.

The proposed 1T-DRAM is made up of a silicon germanium storage region surrounding a silicon fin. When the two materials form a heterojunction, a potential well is formed by the band discontinuity which carriers can be stored. During the program operation, band-to-band tunneling and gate-induced drain leakage occur simultaneously due to the gate and drain bias. Because of these phenomena, the electron-hole pair occurs, and generated holes are stored in the storage region by potential well. The holes formed are positively charged within the storage region, which mitigates the depletion of the channel and improves the operating current. The proposed device realizes the memory operation by the difference of the operating current depending on the presence or absence of the stored holes.

826,"Optimal user experience or flow is a theory with great impact on user experience. Promoting flow has become a competitive advantage for interactive systems, including rehabilitation.

We further claim that balanced mental and motor skills demanded by the task improve flow and task performance. This paper presents an experiment supporting these claims. For this, we built two movement-interaction rehabilitation systems called SIBMER and Macoli (arm in Nahuatl). Both systems have two versions, one with a balanced load of mental and motor skills, and the other with an unbalanced one.

828,"Among human supernumerary marker chromosomes, the occurrence of isodicentric form of 15 origin is relatively well known due to its high frequency, both in terms of gene content and associated clinical symptoms. The associated epilepsy and autism are typically more severe than in cases with interstitial 15q duplication, despite copy number gain of approximately the same genomic region. Other mechanisms besides segmental aneuploidy and epigenetic changes may also cause this difference. Among the factors influencing the expression of members of the GABA(A) gene cluster, the imprinting effect and copy number differences has been debated. Limited numbers of studies investigate factors influencing the interaction of GABA(A) cluster homologues.

Relations between the structure and the heterogeneous clinical picture are discussed, raising the possibility that the structure of the isodicentric (15), which has an asymmetric breakpoint and consequently a lower copy number segment, would be the basis of the imbalance of the GABA(A) homologues.

These materials were evaluated towards the ethanol electrooxidation in acidic electrolyte in presence of three ethanol concentrations using cyclic voltammetry, while the species produced during the reaction were monitored by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results show that IrRh binary electrocatalysts are selective to the production of CO2 from ethanol, but the catalytic activity is poor. This finding is interpreted in terms of a slow adsorption of ethanol that is assumed to be the rate determining step during the electrooxidation of the alcohol. Ternary catalysts, in turn, present higher electrooxidation currents and anticipate the production of CO2. However, the selectivity towards the CO2 pathway is lost and the higher catalityc activity is justified by a growing production of acetic acid, illustrating the influence of Sn on the eletrooxidation of ethanol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basic test circuits were built on the films, and the sensing properties were investigated in external magnetic fields with different intensities and relative angles to the films surface. The results showed that the carbon-based sensing devices were capable to work in the temperature region of 250-400 K. The minimum field intensity and angle change to which the device can respond were 1 mT and 2 degrees. By substrate-introduced enhancement, the maximum changing-rate of the film resistance could reach to 1100%/T. This research pointed out a practical and simple way to build magnetic sensors with PVD carbon films.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
833,"Dihydrogen bonds (DHBs) play a fundamental role in catalytic processes, organometallic reaction mechanisms, and potential hydrogen storage materials. In this work, we analyzed the interactions of transition metal (TM) hydrides CpM(PMe3)(L)(2)H (M=Cr, Mo, W; L=PMe3, CO) with poor, moderate, and strong proton donors HX (NH3, H2O, and HF), and focus on the DHBs in these complexes. All important factors that can affect the DHBs have been considered: transition metal, proton donor, and substituent group. Electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis, topological (atoms in molecules) analysis and noncovalent interactions index (NCI) analysis of the electron density, energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and the effect of electric field were applied to better understand the nature of the DHBs (MH delta-center dot center dot center dot H delta+X) in CpM(PMe3)(L)(2)H center dot center dot center dot HX (M=Cr, Mo, W; L=PMe3, CO; X=F, OH, NH2). The calculated results showed that both the MH delta-center dot center dot center dot H delta+X bonds and M center dot center dot center dot H delta+X bonds can form in CpM(PMe3)(L)(2)H center dot center dot center dot HX complexes. Electron-rich 5d metal (W in this case) hydrides have a greater chance of forming M center dot center dot center dot H delta+X bonds rather than MH delta-center dot center dot center dot H delta+X bonds. Cr is more likely to form DHBs than Mo and W. This is a very inspiring finding because this may indicate that the first-row transition metal, which shows low cost, low toxicity, and exceptional synthetic versatility, is more suitable for catalytic hydrogenation. The type of proton donor and the substituting of PMe3 by CO can alter the strength of DHBs. The stronger proton donor involves the stronger DHBs form. The substitution of CO decreases the strength of the dihydrogen bond. Both the electrostatic interaction and the orbital interaction play important roles in DHBs, R (H delta-center dot center dot center dot H delta+) = 1.6 angstrom seems to be the boundary between these two kinds of interactions. The addition of electric field is conducive to H-2 formation for strong DHB complexes, while it has no effect on the weak DHB complexes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
834,"Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) increases the risk cardiovascular events regardless of the presence of previous cardiovascular disease. As both OSAS and coronary heart disease (CHD) have same risk factors it's often difficult to quantify the proportion of each risk factor in developing cardiac events. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 10-year risk of developing a coronary heart disease (CHD) event or stroke in newly diagnosed OSAS patients. 65 patients diagnosed with OSAS over a period of four months in Oradea Sleep Laboratory were included. Demographic characteristics, anthropometric parameters, clinical and biochemical data, sleep disorder and daytime sleepiness assessment, results of polysomnography were collected in all patients. In 55 selected patients by age range from 34 to 74 years old, cardiovascular risk was assessed using Framingham score calculator. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-PC version 7.5 and Stata 10. The estimated 10-years risk of a CHD event was 18.97% (+/- 9.67) in all cases. It was higher in men (22.17% +/- 9.24) compare to women (12.39% +/- 6.92) and it was not significantly different by stages of OSAS severity (20.58% +/- 9.41 in patients with severe OSAS versus 15.4% in mild OSAS), suggesting that apnea hypopnea index is not a major confounding factor. Desaturation of oxygen is a better outcome to define the relation between OSAS and cardiovascular diseases. OSAS and cardiovascular risk factors increased risk for future adverse cardiovascular events related to the severity of oxygen desaturation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

837,"Pharmaceuticals, especially antibiotics, have received increasing global concern, due to their intensive use in the environment and potential harm to ecological system as well as human health. Among various antibiotics, fluoroquinolones are of extreme interest, since they are broad-spectrum antibacterials with agrowing demand in hospitals, households, and veterinary applications. Wastewater discharge from conventional wastewater treatment plants isthe main source of fluoroquinolone in the aquatic environment. Removal of fluoroquinolone residue from aquatic environment is, therefore, considered as a priority and serves as an important study. For the degradation of FQs in aqueous solution, interesting remedy processes are required such as oxidation-degradation process in which formed intermediates mineralized into CO2, water, and mineral species. The electron transfer reactions and their mechanisms are of much importance in understanding various types of biochemical, pharmaceutical and industrial reactions. Kinetics has played a significant role in understanding the intricacies' of such reactions. Nanosized colloidal manganese dioxide, hexacyanoferrate(III), diperiodatocuprate(III), potassium permanganate etc. used as effective oxidants for oxidative degradation of different fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents in aqueous acidic/alkaline system. In this regard, we investigated a kinetic study of oxidation of moxifloxacin (MF) by diperiodatocuprate(III) (DPC) in aqueous alkaline medium. The reaction was first order with respect to [DPC] and less than unity order with [MF]. The pseudo first order rate constant (k(obs)) changes differently under different concentration of alkali. The results indicates at higher hydroxyl ion concentration DPC complex exist in CuL whereas at lower hydroxyl ion concentration in form of Cu(HL)(2). The thermodynamic parameters associated with the oxidation reaction have been evaluated and discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

839,"In order to improve the mechanical compatibility and cytocompatibility of titanium implants, tantalum coatings were prepared using plasma spraying technology. Tantalum coatings have been deposited via atmospheric plasama spraying (APS) and vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) methods, and then their morphologies, porosities, bonding strengths and elastic modulous were investigated. In vitro cytocompatibility of the two coatings was evaluated via human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs). The results show that oxidation phenomenon was observed for the APS tantalum coatings, while less oxidation was found in the VPS tantalum coatings. Compared with APS tantalum coatings, the VPS tantalum coatings have a more compact microstructure and less impurity content, resulting in a better bonding with the titanium substrate. VPS tantalum coatings were measured to have a lower elastic modulus and a higher hardness than APS Tantalum coatings. Electrochemical corrosion of the coatings were examined and the VPS tantalum coating showed improved chemical stability. Besides, bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) adhere to and spread well on the surface of both VPS and APS tantalum coatings without significant difference. The proliferation rate of BMSCs is higher on VPS tantalum coating surface than on APS tantalum coatings. Our results suggest that VPS tantalum coatings are more suitable for the application of surface modification of titanium implant due to their lower elastic modulus and better chemical stability for higher mechanical compatibility and cytocompatibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
840,"Nano-crystalline CrB2 and Cr-B-O-N films with various nitrogen flow ratios were deposited using a pulsed direct current (PDC) magnetron sputtering technique. By means of electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and atomic force microscopy, the influences of the nitrogen flow ratio on the phase constituents and microstructures of CrB2/Cr-B-O-N films were systematically investigated. Mechanical properties including the hardness and elastic modulus were explored by a nano-indentation tester. On increasing the nitrogen flow ratio, the N and O contents in films increased linearly and tended to become saturated, whereas the Cr and B contents decreased. With an increasing nitrogen flow ratio, the microstructure changed from a dense columnar structure to a bulky columnar structure, and then to a fine and stacked dense structure. Meanwhile, the deposition rate also changed with increasing nitrogen flow ratio, owing to the changes in structure. Crystalline phases were observed by the XRD and HRTEM analyses, consisting of several nanometer-size crystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix. The dramatically decreased hardness was attributed to the large fractional volume of the softer amorphous phase BN in films.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nitrogen doped mesoporous PFR were synthesized in the same way with another additional raw material HMTA. Two series of carbon materials PCs and PCNs were obtained after calcinating PFR at 700, 800, 900 degrees C. N-2 adsorption analysis indicates that both the two kind of carbon materials have relatively large specific surface area (325-619 cm(2)/g for PCs and 431-580 cm(2)/g for PCNs). TEM and XRD analyses prove highly ordered mesoporous structure of the samples. Both the elemental analysis and IR results suggest a high carbon content and the abundant fused-ring structure of the test materials.

845,"Methane oxidation was carried out in presence of synthetized Pt/Al2O3-CeO2 catalysts with ceria contents between 1 and 37 mol%, at 823 K, 52,000 h(-1) of GHSV, by varying the oxygen concentration from a deficient concentration respect to methane (1 mol:1 mol) up until a 100% excess over the stoichiometric (4 mol:1 mol). The catalysts were characterized by TGA, N-2 sorption, XRD, TPR, UV-Vis, TPD-NH3, and ICP for elemental composition, while methane conversion was followed by gas chromatography. It was found that the optimum concentration of oxygen is the stoichiometric one, and, depending on the concentration of ceria in the catalyst, the operation window with defect and excess of oxygen is different. Particularly, at the highest concentration of ceria in the catalyst, the conversion of methane is greater than using other catalytic materials, and this behavior was attributed to the higher concentration of surface ceria, greater oxygen mobility as well as the synergistic ceria-alumina-platinum effect toward hydrocarbon oxidation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
846,"An air-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction method using of an extraction solvent (less dense than water) has been proposed for simultaneous derivatization and extraction of some p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters (parabens) in different samples before their determination with gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. The analytes are derivatized by a fast reaction occurring between parabens and pivaloyl chloride (as a derivatization agent) and extracted into toluene (as an extraction solvent) under mild conditions in a test tube. After performing the microextraction procedure, a home-made device (an inverse funnel having a capillary tube) is placed into the tube. A thin film of the extractant accumulated on the surface of the aqueous phase is transferred into the capillary part of the device. A fraction of the organic phase is removed by a microsyringe and injected into the separation system for analysis. Under optimum conditions, detection and quantification limits were between 0.60 and 1.0; and 1.7 and 3.1 ng mL(-1) in solution; and 6.0 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-5); and 1.7 x 10(-5) and 3.1 x 10(-5) g kg(-1) in solid, respectively.

847,"The isomeric structures formed by the interaction of PF5 and PCl5 with up to four water molecules were theoretically examined by employing the MP2 method and the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. The additional effects of surrounding water molecules were approximated by employing the polarized continuum solvation model (PCM) within a self-consistent reaction field treatment. The calculations indicate that the global minimum resulting from the interaction of PF5 and one H2O molecule corresponds to the PF5-H2O adduct and remains the most stable isomer after addition of second and third H2O, whereas the presence of fourth H2O molecule renders the PF5OH-/H3O+/2H(2)O structure the most stable. On the contrary, the interaction of PCl5 and a single H2O molecule leads to the global minimum structure corresponding to the PCl3=O phosphoryl chloride with two HCl moieties attached. The lowest energy isomers resulting from the interaction of PCl5 with two, three, and four H2O molecules indicate the tendency of PCl3=O to subsequent replacement of the Cl ligands with OH groups resulting in formation of H3PO4 (with five surrounding HCl fragments) when the number of available H2O molecules is sufficient. The presence of the competitive isomers containing H3O+ fragments in the case of the PCl5 interacting with water molecules is also predicted and discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The complexes [M-2(mu-ox)(2)(9Meade)(3)](n) [M(II) = Zn (1), Cu (2); where ox = oxalato and 9Meade = 9-methyladenine] are composed of infinite corrugated one-dimensional chains in which two types of metal(11) centres are sequentially bridged by asymmetric bis-bidentate oxalato ligands and their coordination polyhedra are filled by N7-coordinated 9-methyladenine molecules giving rise to two different chromophores: an octahedral N2O4 donor set with the nucleobase moieties in trans-arrangement, and square based pyramidal NO4 coordination polyhedra. The cohesiveness of their supramolecular 3D architectures is achieved by means of an extensive network of non-covalent interactions including a short contact between the minor groove N3 site of the model 9-methyladenine and the oxalato bridging ligand from a neighbouring chain. This unconventional interaction between the lone pair of the pyrimidinic nitrogen atom of the nucleobase and the pi-system of the oxalate anion has been analysed and discussed in the light of available structural data for analogous systems. The compounds {[M(mu-ox)(H2O)(3Meade)]center dot H2O)}(n) [M(II) = Zn (3), Co (4) and Mn (5); where 3Meade = 3-methyladenine], and {[Cu(mu-ox) (3Meade)(2)]center dot 4H(2)O}(n) (6) are comprised of zig-zag metal-oxalato chains, with the oxalato adopting a symmetric bis-bidentate coordination mode. The octahedral environment of the metals is completed in a cis-arrangement by one water molecule and the imidazole N7 donor site of a 3-methyladenine ligand for 3-5, and by two N7-coordinated nucleobases for 6. The crystal packing of the chains leads to the presence of channels with dimensions of 5 x 10 angstrom for 6, and 4 x 6 angstrom for 3-5 which are occupied by crystallization water molecules.

856,"Iron oxidic species supported on silica SBA-15 were synthesized with various iron loadings using two different Fe-III precursors. The effect of varying powder layer thickness during calcination on structural and solid-state kinetic properties of FexOy/SBA-15 samples was investigated. Calcination was conducted in thin (0.3 cm) or thick (1.3 cm) powder layer. Structural characterization of resulting FexOy/SBA-15 samples was performed by nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, and DR-UV/Vis spectroscopy. Thick powder layer during calcination induced an increased species size independent of the precursor. However, a significantly more pronounced influence of calcination mode on species size was observed for the Fe-III nitrate precursor compared to the Fe-III citrate precursor. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments revealed distinct differences in reducibility and reduction mechanism dependent on calcination mode. Thick layer calcination of the samples obtained from Fe-III nitrate precursor resulted in more pronounced changes in TPR profiles compared to samples obtained from Fe-III citrate precursor.

Two different tri block co polymers (P-123 and F-127) have been used as delivering system of this poor water soluble drug molecule AP and ANHP which are the main investigation of this work. To find out which one is the better delivering systems of AP and ANHP, spectroscopic studies have been carried out in P-123 and F-127 polymeric media. From the interactions of AP and ANHP with P-123 and F-127 polymers individually, binding constant values have been determined. The drug delivering efficiency of block co polymers has been investigated by using different spectroscopic techniques like absorbance, fluorescence, DLS and time resolved fluorescence measurements. All these experimental results indicate that P-123 is the better AP and ANHP delivering system than F-127 polymer.

858,"The education sector is a major generator, consumer, and depositary of educational content. Thanks to technological advances, today's educators and learners have ubiquitous and on-demand access to information. Technology has made it possible for us to communicate and share information effortlessly from anywhere in the world. However, the availability of vast amounts of heterogeneous educational content will not be useful unless we search, retrieve and integrate it, creating interoperable educational environments. The current challenges to integrating educational content arise from its distribution over several repositories. This research proposes AIREH (architecture for intelligent retrieval of educational content from heterogeneous environments), for the retrieval of digital content through agent-based virtual organizations. This flexible architecture facilitates the search for and integration of heterogeneous content through an information retrieval model that involves both case-based reasoning and federated search.

Employing wheat thylakoid ACP as the model enzyme, it has been demonstrated that peroxoniobium derivatives serve as active inhibitors of phosphatase (IC50 values 2-9 mu M). Enzyme kinetics data revealed that compounds exert mixed type of inhibition on ACP activity (K-ii > K-i). Calcineurin inhibitors represent a valuable tool for elucidating CN dependent cellular processes.

860,"Vascular calcification is the process of calcium salt precipitation in vessel walls. In-depth understanding of the mechanisms of crystallization of calcifications in blood vessels is crucial for developing effective protective therapy. Calcification processes reduce the life span of implanted heart valves. The purpose of this paper is a comprehensive study of calcification processes. We calculated the solubility diagrams of the basic poorly soluble compounds formed in the prototype human plasma, performed laboratory modeling of crystallization of calcification mineral phases under conditions typical of human blood plasma solution (ionic composition, pH), and verified the obtained theoretical and experimental modeling results for adequacy to pathogenic phase formation from human blood plasma solution. The paper presents the results of the thermodynamic calculation of the formation of calcification mineral phases and experimental results of phase formation under conditions typical of the human blood plasma prototype. The laboratory tests showed that dopants of the biological solution (magnesium ions and glutamic acid) affect phase composition and solubility of the samples. The bioactivity of synthetic samples was studied in solutions of different composition and in Verapamil. The results indicate that the model studies of the crystallization of pathogenic formations in the cardiovascular system performed to identify the mechanisms that control their genesis are significant and will provide timely diagnosis of calcification and development of new approaches in cardiology aimed to reduce the incidence of these diseases. Statement of significance: The processes of crystallization of organo-mineral associations (OMA) that are part of the physiogenetic (bone, teeth) and pathogenic minerals (urinary, dental, calcifications etc.) are currently one of the crucial study areas. These studies are of essential interest since pathogenic OMA are primarily considered to be human diseases, for example, arteriosclerosis, which is associated with precipitation of calcium salts in blood vessels. It is the second most common disease after atherosclerosis among all lesions of arterial vessels. It should be noted that the percentage of calcification in blood vessels, heart valves and operating stents has increased in recent years. Vascular calcification is a complex process that involves a number of mechanisms responsible for the precipitation of calcium salts in vessel walls. As a result, arterial stiffness and pulse wave velocity increase, which in turn increases the rate of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. The study and in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of calcification crystallization in blood vessels can be crucial for developing effective protective therapy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

861,"The determination of gamma activities of radionuclides in the environment is of great interest and good accuracy is required in the results of these measurements. However, one of the main sources of error in this technology is the difference in the densities of the samples, because the effects of self-absorption, within the samples, become significant. We have produced Monte Carlo simulations for samples with different densities and for photons with energies in the range of interest, obtaining the peak efficiency as a function of density and energy. We fitted it to obtain a two-dimensional mathematical representation of this function, so we can use this fitted function saving the time of Monte Carlo simulation. To verify the validity of our proposal, the natural radioactivity of soil samples were determined using a GeHP solid state detector and very good results were obtained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
862,"Starting from the Breit-Wigner model, we present a generalized approach for calculating the electrical conductance of a one-atom metallic constriction with electrochemical-potential control. In addition, the corresponding current intensity is determined. On the one hand, the nanoconstriction is conceived as a dilute (degenerate) Fermi gas (relatively low electron concentrations are considered) and, on the other hand, non-dilute gas is considered. Under these conditions, the Fermi energy-level into the Breit-Wigner formula is replaced by the corresponding chemical-potential energy. We emphasize the role of the optical potential as significant ingredient of the chemical potential.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

865,"A novel family of four 1-bromo-2,6-bis{[(lambda(5)-phosphanylidene)imino]methyl}-benzene ligands has been synthesized and characterized. The phosphiniminomethyl substituents are decorated with either three phenyl groups, two phenyl and one cyclohexyl group, one phenyl and two cyclohexyl groups, or three cyclohexyl groups. Each ligand was metallated using zero-valent nickel through an oxidative addition to form a family of organonickel(II) complexes, namely (2,6-bis{[(triphenyl-lambda(5)-phosphanylidene)imino]methyl}phenyl-kappa N-3,C-1,N')bromido-nickel(II) dichloromethane hemisolvate, [NiBr(C44H37N2P2)]center dot 0.5CH(2)Cl(2), (2,6-bis{[(cyclohexyldiphenyl-lambda(5)-phosphanylidene)imino]methyl}phenyl-kappa N-3,C-1,N')-bromidonickel(II) diethyl ether hemisolvate, [NiBr(C44H49N2P2)]center dot 0.5C(4)H(10)O, (2,6-bis{[(dicyclohexylphenyl-lambda(5)-phosphanylidene)imino]methyl}phenyl-kappa N-3,C-1,N')bromidonickel(II), [NiBr(C44H61N2P2)], and (2,6-bis{[(tricyclohexyl-lambda(5)-phosphanylidene)imino]methyl}phenyl-kappa N-3,C-1,N')bromidonickel(II), [NiBr(C44H73N2P2)].

866,"Cr3+ ion-doped and -undoped cerium sulfide nanocrystals are synthesized by sol-gel method and subjected to UV-visible, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy studies. The prepared nanocrystals were used for solid-state batteries. The electrical conductivity measurements were performed at different temperature from 306 to 603 K. These nanocrystals are found to be essentially ionic conductors. The conductivity of doped nanocrystals increases largely with increasing concentration of Cr3+ ion dopants. The solid-state batteries using these undoped and doped nanocrystals are as electrolytes with the cell configuration Ag | [(H2O)(OH)Ce(S)(2)Ce(OH)(H2O)] | C + I-2 and Ag| [(H2O)(OH) Ce (SH)(2)Cr (OH)(H2O)](2+) | C + I-2 have been fabricated and their open circuit voltage were measured, which suggests that Cr3+ ion-doped cerium sulfide nanocrystals are higher open circuit voltage values than those of undoped cerium sulfide nanocrystals.

The mesoporous MSNs-AH with the Schiff-base ligand were used for the adsorption of metal ions from artificial wastewater and artificial seawater. The adsorption characteristics of the functionalized adsorbents for various metal ions were tested for different adsorption times (1 similar to 48 h) in artificial wastewater and artificial seawater. In the case of artificial wastewater, the functionalized adsorbents had no preferential selectivity for metal ions except for Na+ ions, even though the MSNs-AH adsorbent adsorbed most of the metal ions investigated in this work, including Li+, Co2+, Ca2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Zn2+, and Ni2+.

868,"The structural change of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase (Ba alpha-amylase) induced by chloride ion was studied by fluorescence spectra, Fourier-transformation infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. It was found that when chloride ion concentration was below 20.0 mM, the Ba alpha-amylase was activated by increasing chloride ion concentration; when chloride ion concentration was over 20.0 mM, the biological activity of Ba alpha-amylase was inhibited by increasing chloride ion concentration. The spectroscopic analyses illustrated that the change in Ba alpha-amylase biological activity was caused by the alteration in secondary structure of Ba alpha-amylase. When chloride ion showed activation effect to Ba alpha-amylase, part of the random coils in Ba alpha-amylase gradually transformed to alpha-helix and beta-sheet with increasing chloride ion concentration and the Ba alpha-amylase transited from relatively disordered conformation to relatively ordered one. Whereas when chloride ion showed inhibition effect on the biological activity of Ba alpha-amylase, part of alpha-helix and beta-sheet in Ba alpha-amylase gradually transformed to random coil with increasing chloride ion concentration and the Ba alpha-amylase went back from the relatively ordered conformation to the relatively disordered one. This work shows the dependency of change in biological activity to alteration in secondary structure of protein molecule, which may provide some useful information in the actual application and exploration on action mechanism of proteins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
869,"Liquid marbles with polyacrylamide as skeleton and eosin Y as core and hydrophobic silica as shell have been prepared to study the sustained release of eosin Y. The influences of the amount of crosslinker, the sustained-release medium, the volume of liquid marbles, the temperature, the adhesive powder and the addition of sodium bicarbonate on the sustained-release properties of eosin Y have been studied in detail. The results showed that with the increase of volume, the amount of eosin Y release increased but the release rate deereased. The release amount of eosin Y decreases as the amount of cross linking agent increase. The prepared liquid marbles have been hardly released in acidic conditions, but the release amount of eosin Y has been improved with the increase of pH. The amount of eosin Y release increased with the increase of temperature. The use of liquid marbles as a medium to preparation sustained-release hydrogel for dye release can not only control the dye loading by accurately controlling the volume of liquid marbles, but also the release rate of dyes can be controlled by tuning the sustained-release medium and other conditions. This method provides a new method for dye release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
870,"Strong nonlinearity and the relevance of time-varying dynamic parameters in the maneuverable process of water-jet propulsion were major problems encountered in the prediction of variable acceleration dynamics characteristics. The relationships between the thrust and rotation speed of a screw mixed-flow pump, drag and submerged speed of water-jet propulsion were obtained from flume experiments and numerical calculations, based on which a dynamic model of pump-jet propulsion was established in this paper. As an initial condition, the numerical solution of the submerged speed with respect to time was inputted to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for unsteady calculation based on a user-defined function (UDF). Thus, the relationships between the acceleration, drag, net thrust, propulsion torque and efficiency with respect to time were revealed. The results indicate that the relationship between the thrust and rotational speed of a water-jet propeller is a quadratic function, which agrees well with the experimental values. The variation of submerged speed with respect to time satisfies a hyperbolic tangent function distribution. The acceleration increases sharply at the beginning and then decreases gradually to zero, especially at high rotation speeds of the water-jet pump. The variations in drag and propulsion efficiency with respect to time coincide with the step response of a second-order system with critical damping. The method and results of this study can give a better understanding of the changes in dynamic parameters such as velocity, acceleration, thrust, and drag during the acceleration of a pump-jet submersible and helped to estimate the effects of pump performance on water-jet propulsion kinetic parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
871,"Metal alloys exhibit functionalities unlike those of single metals. Such alloying has drawn considerable research interest, particularly for nanoscale particles (metal clusters/nanoparticles), from the viewpoint of creating new functional nanomaterials. Although studying the precise alloy clusters is indispensable to understand the correlation between the structures and physical/chemical properties of alloy clusters, there are still many alloy clusters that cannot be synthesized with atomic precision, as represented by gold-silver alloy clusters. In this study, we established a method to separate phenylethanethiolate-protected 38-atom gold-silver alloy clusters ([Au38-xAgx(SC2H4Ph)(24)](0)) according to their chemical composition. This method revealed how the electronic structure of ([Au38-xAgx(SC2H4Ph)(24)](0)) varies depending on the number of the substituted Ag atoms at atomic precision.

873,"This paper presents an algorithm for an automatic transformation (= routing) of time-ordered topologies of Goldstone diagrams (i.e., Wick contractions) into graphical representations of these topologies. Since there is no hard criterion for an optimal routing, the proposed algorithm minimizes an empirically chosen cost function over a set of parameters. Some of the latter are naturally of discrete type (e.g., interchange of particle/hole lines due to antisymmetry) while others (e.g., x, y-position of nodes) are naturally continuous. In order to arrive at a manageable optimization problem, the position space is artificially discretized. In terms of the (1) cost function, (2) the discrete vertex placement, (3) the interchange of particle/hole lines the routing problem is now well defined and fully discrete. However, it shows an exponential complexity with the number of vertices suggesting to apply a genetic algorithm for its solution. The presented algorithm is capable of routing non-trivial (several loops and crossings) Goldstone diagrams from given topologies. The resulting diagrams are qualitatively fully equivalent to manually routed ones. The proposed algorithm is successfully applied to several coupled cluster approaches and a perturbative (fixpoint iterative) CCSD expansion with repeated diagram substitution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
874,"In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Total Diet Study (TDS) began updating the digestion/extraction and the determinative methods for nutrient and toxic elements. The analytical methods for iodine, manganese, and selenium were all updated to inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) from colorimetric determination, inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission mass spectrometry (ICP-AES), and hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS), respectively. With updates in digestion/extraction and determinative methods, new limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) were determined. The changes in methods for iodine, manganese, and selenium analysis were evaluated by determining the proportion of results above the LOQ, below the LOD (non-detects or NDs), and between the LOD and LOQ (trace values), in data generated before and after the changes. Selenium showed little change in the proportion of NDs, higher proportions of trace values, and lower proportions of results above the LOQ. Iodine and manganese had lower proportions of NDs and trace values and higher proportions of results above the LOQ. Updating methods can have various effects on data and potentially how data are utilized. These results indicate that these new methods are an improvement on the old methods and validate the changes made to the methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to these calculations, tautomeric and conformeric preferences, intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB) and pi-electron delocalization were investigated. Generally, DAI/DTAI tautomers have extra stability with respect to the AI/TAI ones. Also, among the AI/TAI series, the AI-11/TAI-13 conformer with/without IMHB is the most stable tautomer. Moreover, our computation results reveal that the formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bond is accepted as the origin of conformational preferences. The results of hydrogen bond descriptors, such as HB energy, geometrical, topological, spectroscopic and molecular orbital parameters are in agreement with the related energy values and show that the strength of intramolecular hydrogen bond in DFA is more than DTFA ones. On the other hands, pi-electron delocalization of chelated rings was measured using various indices, such as q, lambda', lambda, and HOMA index. Finally, the orders of hydrogen bond strength and pi-electron delocalization, obtained by some of the indices, support the resonance assisted hydrogen bond theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
876,"A rapid and low-cost method of diagnosis is becoming important for detecting fetal inherited diseases, including single-gene disorders and chromosomal abnormalities. Here, we demonstrated an innovation that use paper-dried cord blood (PCB) as the starting material for PCR and whole genome amplification without any DNA extraction step at a very low cost. A novel PCR buffer named ""DDB buffer"" containing ammonium sulfate and glycerol were used instead of the conventional 10x PCR buffer. The amplicons were directly analyzed through microchip electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing. Inhibitory substances in filter paper were effectively inactivated using DDB buffer. Direct PCR amplification of DNA fragments ranging from 100 to 900 bp using filter paper spotted with 0.5 to 5 mu L of cord blood and various anticoagulants was successful. We were able to determine fetal single-gene disorders and chromosomal diseases in all 46 chromosomes using PCB samples successfully. Compared with prenatal diagnosis using purified DNA, the proposed method is simple, fast, less prone to cross-contamination at minimal cost. Researchers and clinical and healthcare workers may employ this method for genetic diagnosis using cord blood samples with minimum laboratory resources. This method is very promising for a variety of genetic diagnosis applications in underserved communities at the point of need in developing areas. Graphical abstract",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of temperature, moisture content and germination index of seeds in the aerobic composting were analyzed. Besides, the effects of sugarcane leaves in different ratios were investigated in the aerobic composting of the biogas residue. The results showed that the maintenance of the high temperature for the fermentation of biogas residue was relatively stable with the addition of sugarcane leaves to biogas residue ratio of 1:5. A period of 24 days was required for the decrease in the composting temperature to reach the stage of stabilization. A lowest moisture ratio of 30.2% was obtained in the composting product. The ratio of addition sugarcane leaves to biogas residue ratio of 1:5 exhibited 90% germination index of seeds of, which was the highest. Furthermore, the maturity degree of the composting was the best in the added 1: 5 ratio. Overall, the addition of sugarcane leaves was beneficial for the decomposition during the composting, thus providing a scientific evidence for the resource utilization of the biogas residue and the quality enhancement of composting products of biogas residue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
878,"We report on a novel control technique for the transport of microparticles in a microchannel for microchip analysis using electromagnetophoresis combined with a conductive/nonconductive aqueous two phase (ATP) flow. A double Y-shaped microchip (20 mm length, 160 p.m width) with two inlets and two outlets was used to form a conductive/non-conductive ATP flow. When a 1.16 mol L-1 KCI aqueous solution and a 20 % dextran (Dex) aqueous solution were used as a conductive fluid and a non-conductive fluid, respectively, a conductive/non-conductive ATP flow could be formed in the micro-channel. In this conductive/non-conductive ATP flow, polystyrene (PS) particles with 3, 6 and 10 gm diameters dispersed in the conductive fluid could be focused on the ATP flow interface when electromagnetophoresis was applied on the particles toward the ATP flow interface. On the other hand, carboxylate PS (cPS) particles with 10 gm diameter were transferred into a Dex solution in the same situation. Moreover, by applying staggered-electromagnetophoresis, PS particles were redistributed in the conductive fluid although cPS particles stayed in the non-conductive fluid. Consequently, PS particles and cPS particles could be eluted at different outlets, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
879,"Salt intake is one of the important predictors of hypertension, a widespread chronic disease among adults. Much remains to be known about its causes, especially in the Romanian context, where there is a scarcity of analyses on this particular topic. Its predictors are relevant for public policy in order to evaluate what strategy should be adopted given actual levels of salt intake and the way people think about their levels of salt intake. Our analyses focus on actual and perceived salt intake. Data for this analysis come from the SEPHAR project, gathered in 2016 (wave 3), a nationally representative sample of Romanians. After noting a major discrepancy between perceived and actual levels of salt intake, we used two regressions with actual and perceived salt intake as dependent variables and three types of factors as independent variables: socio-demographic (age, gender, region, type of locality, education), lifestyle (fat diet, alcohol consumption, active lifestyle, and smoking) and related diseases (obesity and diabetes). Results show Romanians have similar levels of salt intake perceptions independently of the characteristics considered, except fat diet and diabetes, and similar levels of actual salt intake except age and gender, even though previous research shows that there are differences between individuals across these characteristics when it comes to considering hypertension as a dependent variable. We conclude by noting policy interventions regarding salt intake based on the results of this research, especially the need to update the current Romanian TV campaign to reduce salt intake or similar campaigns from other countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

882,"A batch study (also called a five-batch analysis) is a requirement for registering a new crop protection active ingredient (AI). A batch study defines the commercial specification of the technical-grade AI, including the minimum assay for the AI, the profile of impurities, and the maximum limit allowed for each impurity. One expectation of the regulatory guidance is that the specification is representative of product produced at commercial scale. However, predicting product purity and the level of impurities is challenging for a new crop protection AI when commercial-scale manufacture may not occur for several years. The registration dossier, which must include the batch study, is submitted often several years before commercial manufacture begins. Recognizing this challenge, many regulatory authorities propose a volume or quantity of material to be produced for the batch study, often referring to ""pilot plant"" samples, under the pretense that a ""larger"" scale will better represent the commercial production facility. We propose that the ability to model accurately the processing conditions and variability anticipated at commercial scale, not sample volume or quantity, is most critical to the predictive quality of the batch study. Herein we discuss the limitation of traditional ""pilot plants"" and introduce the concept of ""predictive engineering systems"" as a more advanced approach for preparing the samples used in the batch study for new crop protection active ingredient registration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
883,"Hetero-aromatic N-base ligand like 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) assisted chromic acid oxidation of malic acid in aqueous sulfuric acid media have been studied under the experimental conditions, [malic acid](T) >> [Cr(VI)(T)] at different temperatures. Under the kinetic conditions, HCrO4- has been found kinetically active in the absence of phen catalyst while in the phen catalyzed path Cr(VI)-phen complex has been suggested in the active oxidant. In the catalysed path, Cr(VI)-phen complex receives a nucleophilic attack by the substrate to form a ternary complex which subsequently experiences a two-electron transfer redox decomposition leading to Cr(IV)-phen complex. Then Cr(IV)-phen complex participates further in the oxidation of malic acid and ultimately is converted into Cr(III)-phen complex. Both the paths show first-order dependence on [malic acid](T) and [Cr(VI)](T). The phen catalyzed path is first -order in [phen](T). These observations remain unaltered in the presence of externally added surfactants. Effect of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic surfactant N-cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) on the phen-catalysed path has been studied.

885,"Losartan potassium (LOS), used in the treatment of hypertension, is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450. This study investigates the effect of quercetin (QU), a CYP3A4 inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of LOS in rats. A rapid, sensitive high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was developed and validated for the bioanalysis of losartan using olmesartan as internal standard (IS). The salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) employing acetonitrile and MgCl2 gave high recovery of LOS (>90%). HPTLC separation, achieved on silica gel 60 F-254 plates employing toluene-ethyl acetate-acetone-formic acid (4:4:1:0.5 V/V) as the mobile phase, with densitometric analysis at 240 nm, gave good linearity (50-1200 ng mL(-1)) with high intra-day and inter-day precision. LOS in plasma samples was stable when stored under different stability conditions. The pharmacokinetics of LOS was found to be significantly altered when co-administered with QU: C-max = 809.8 +/- 4.1 at 40 min (t(max)) to C-max = 1124.8 +/- 86.6 ng mL(-1) at 120 min (t(max)). This study indicates the chances of herb-drug interaction when LOS is co-administered with QU, leading to its increased bioavailability, potentiating its side effect/toxic manifestation. As QU is abundantly present in herbs and dietary food, patients of LOS therapy need to be cautious while concurrently consuming herbal preparations containing QU.

889,"The surface colour of exposed concrete is one of the most obvious characteristics of quality because it is the first one to be seen. However, efflorescence generally changes the colour impression of the material surface and of the concrete facade as a whole. This study investigated the efflorescence of carbon aminosilica black (CASB) mortar and the effect of redispersible polymer powder (RPP) on the physical properties of CASB mortar. For this purpose, a flow test and colour evaluation was carried out on white Portland cement paste and mortar mixed with CASB by changing the proportion of RPP. RPP modifies the mechanical properties of the mortar by forming a polymer film in the cementitious matrix. The film prevents the transport of soluble calcium towards the surface and decreases efflorescence. As a result, the colour appearance of CASB mortar improved with increasing RPP content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have confirmed that I-off and SS are degraded by the interface traps. Further, it can be shown that I-on is mainly affected by the acceptor-like traps and ambipolar behavior is affected by the donor-like traps. All the effects increase as E-t becomes closer to the midgap.

The conventional bisulfite sequencing faces with the tremendous challenge in the discrimination of DNA methylation. Therefore, the improved and modification bisulfite sequencing has been conducted to raise the reaction selectivity. The key mechanism for these bisulfite sequencing is the reaction of nucleic acids with HSO3- under acidic conditions. The C5C6 bonds of 5-methylcytosine (5-MeCyt) and cytosine (Cyt) have been modified to improve the difference of activation free energies in bisulfite conditions. Because of this, the hydrolytic deamination of DHCytN3(+) (paths A and B) and 5-DHMeCytN3(+) isomers (equatorial and axial conformers, paths C and D) has been explored in the presence of the HSO3- group. The activation free energies (Delta G(s not equal)) of DHCytN3(+) and 5-DHMeCytN3(+) equatorial conformer paths exhibit no obvious difference, which increases difficulties in differentiating cytosine from 5-methylcytosine under bisulfite conditions. Meanwhile, the difference of Delta G(s not equal) between the 5-DHMeCytN3(+) axial conformer and DHCytN3(+) is consistent with the experimental results, where the calculated deamination rate is lower for 5,6-dihydro-5-methylcytosine than for 5,6-dihydrocytosine. And by extrapolation, the differentiating Cyt from 5-MeCyt may have a greater possibility by bisulfite treatment. These results have high expectations for the experimental scientists to explore new methods to avoid the formation of the 5-DHMeCytN3(+) equatorial conformer. Furthermore, the rate constant with Wigner tunneling correction for paths A, C, and D are in good agreement with uncorrected results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
894,"Leather is a natural material which is used widely in different industries. It is prone to lose moisture due to environmental conditions. Consequently, leather becomes hard and fragile, which leads to poor durability. A novel mixed system of Poly (ethylene glycol), Hydroxyapatite, plus Silica nanoparticles enhanced the mechanical, thermal, optical, and aging properties of the natural leather properties. This system also enabled the retention of moisture in leather. Thanks to the reinforcing properties of hydroxyapatite/silica nanoparticles, and the lubricating effect of poly (ethylene glycol), these modifying agents enhanced the mechanical and thermal properties of leather and preserved the leather's natural color and gloss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
895,"The serving size declaration has been an important feature of the Nutrition Facts label since its establishment in 1993, helping consumers compare nutrient values among similar products. Serving sizes must be presented in household measurements based on the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed (RACCs) per eating occasion for about 140 product categories. RACCs reflect consumption amounts by three age groups in the U.S. population, infants 0 to 12 months, young children 1 through 3 years of age, and individuals aged 4 years and older. Since 1993, these consumption amounts have shown changes. We examined the changes in consumption patterns based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2008, to determine if the 1993 RACCs needed to be amended. Three steps were used in this evaluation process: (1) we determined whether there was an adequate sample size to estimate a current reliable median consumption amount for the product; (2) we determined if the current reliable median consumption amount was significantly different from the 1993 RACCs (at least a 25% difference based on 95% confidence intervals); and (3) we then considered additional factors in a systematic approach. Generally, comparable products, when available, should have similar RACCs, for consumers to compare nutrient values among these products. Twenty RACCs of 45 foods were amended using this methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The obtained results suggested that the carboxymethyl group decomposed at relatively low temperature (150 degrees C - 300 degrees C); the peak areas at m/z 45 and 59 in TG-DTA/PI-QMS and m/z 58, 70, and 72 in DIP/IA-QMS significantly increased with increasing carboxymethylation rate.

897,"The effect of hydration of anatase (0 0 1), and rutile (0 0 1), (1 01) and (1 1 0) surfaces of TiO2 on the rate of electron capture from an adsorbed graphene sheet is elucidated by means of computation at a level of tight-binding density functional theory. Initially, the clean surfaces are allowed to interact with bulk water. Following an equilibration period, the first solvation shell is exposed to vacuum at 300 K for a sufficiently long period of time to allow any weakly bound water molecules to evaporate or be displaced from the surface. The resultant hydroxylated and originally clean surfaces are used for studying the interaction with a graphene sheet. Comparison of the calculated surface-graphene interaction energies and electron transfer probabilities of a cold electron to clean and hydroxylated surfaces shows that the water-sourced OH layer of these surfaces acts as an insulator in interfacial charge transport of the cold electron.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hydroxido ligand was introduced into an iridium complex having a nonprotic amine chelate derived from N-mesyl-N',N'-dimethylethylenediamine by substitution of the chloride ligand using KOH. The resulting hydroxidoiridium complex was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray crystallography. The hydroxido complex was able to deprotonate benzamide and acetonitrile, and showed an ability to accept a hydride from 2-propanol to generate the corresponding hydrido complex quantitatively. In the reaction with mandelonitrile, a cyanide anion was transferred to the iridium center in preference to the hydride transfer.

900,"Most objects and structures exposed to a marine environment for more than a month undergo biofouling of the surface. Biofouling is a phenomenon in which micro-organisms attach to marine structures and may result in deterioration of the structure or breakage of the structure due to weight gain. In this study, glass, which can inhibit biofouling of marine structures, was prepared and its germicidal properties were analyzed. For this purpose, Ag ions were implanted into soda-lime-silicate glass by the ion-exchange method. For the glass immersed in seawater, the bactericidal effect of the glass specimen was than evaluated by inoculating the strain and counting the number of viable cells after 12 or 24 h. Experimental variables were ion exchange conditions, time immersed in seawater, and time spent inoculating the strain. In particular, the surface state of the ion exchange glass before and after immersion in seawater was observed at the nanometer level, and the elution amount of Ag ions with time was measured by the ICP mass analysis method. As the ion exchange time increased, the amount of ion exchange increased. The amount of ions was consistent with Fick's first law, which is proportional to the square root of time. When ion-exchanged specimens were immersed in seawater, the amount of Ag ions eluted was on the order of ppm. Si and Na ions were also eluted from the glass. As the ion exchange time increased, crystals of 60 similar to 80 nm, which are presumed to be Na2CO3 phase, formed densely on the surface of the specimen. However, when the glass specimens were immersed in seawater, crystals formed on the surface dissolved and disappeared. Cracks subsequently formed on the surface and finally the surface collapsed. After 30 days, a fresh glass surface appeared again. This is a very interesting result because it shows that the reaction between glass and seawater is very similar to that between aqueous solutions. When the glass implanted with Ag ions is immersed in seawater, the surface dissolves and the glass-network-structure collapses, resulting in considerable Ag ion elution, which enhances bactericidal action in seawater. For example, when a specimen immersed in seawater for 30 days was inoculated with the strain for 24 hours, the number of strains decreased from 2.1x10(6) cells/ml to 0 cell/ml, indicating 100% disinfection ability. In this study, soda-lime-silicate glass with Ag ion implantation by the Na/Ag ion exchange method showed an excellent germicidal effect when in contact with sea water. From this result, it can be expected that long-term marine biological pollution can be suppressed by applying the glass developed in this research to marine structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tetraoxazocane ring adopts a boat-chair conformation in the crystalline state, which is due to intramolecular interactions. Conformational analysis of the tetraoxazocane fragment performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, 2p) level of theory showed that there are three minima on the potential energy surface, one of which corresponds to the conformation realized in the solid state, but not to a global minimum. Analysis of the geometry and the topological parameters of the electron density at the (3,-1) bond critical points (BCPs), and the charge transfer in the tetraoxazocane ring indicated that there are stereoelectronic effects in the O-C-O and N-C-O fragments. There is a two-cross hyperconjugation in the N-C-O fragment between the lone electron pair of the N atom (lpN) and the antibonding orbital of a C-O bond (sigma*(C-O)) and vice versa between lpO and sigma*(C-N). The oxazole substituent has a considerable effect on the geometry and the topological parameters of the electron density at the (3,-1) BCPs of the tetraoxazocane ring.

910,"In most hyperspectral super-resolution (HSR) methods, which are techniques used to improve the resolution of hyperspectral images (HSIs), the HSI and the target RGB image are assumed to have identical fields of view. However, because implementing these identical fields of view is difficult in practical applications, in this paper, we propose a HSR method that is applicable when an HSI and a target RGB image have different spatial information. The proposed HSR method first creates a low-resolution RGB image from a given HSI. Next, a histogram matching is performed on a high-resolution RGB image and a low-resolution RGB image obtained from an HSI. Finally, the proposed method optimizes endmember abundance of the high-resolution HSI towards the histogram-matched high-resolution RGB image. The entire procedure is evaluated using an open HSI dataset, the Harvard dataset, by adding spatial mismatch to the dataset. The spatial mismatch is implemented by shear transformation and cutting off the upper and left sides of the target RGB image. The proposed method achieved a lower error rate across the entire dataset, confirming its capability for super-resolution using images that have different fields of view.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, as a new method of applying powders, we tried to evaluate the potential of a chamber method for the development of latent fingerprint using fans in a closed chamber with a fixed capacity that can prevent the powders from being blown outside and exposed to the users, by comparing with the development results of the conventional brush method. Fingerprints on glass and plastic (PET) were extracted with black powder and green fluorescent powder, and the sharpness and minutiae of the developed fingerprints were compared for each method. The results of the black powder showed similar results, but the effect of the chamber method was slightly decreased when the green fluorescent powder was used. In order to improve the development with the green fluorescent powder, the mixture (50 : 50) of the fluorescent powder with the silica gel was tested and the results were similar to those of the brush method.

The NP-FETs for 3.5 nm node had better gate controllability due to smaller channel thickness and therefore showed an advantage in subthreshold swing (S.S.). However, parasitic resistance and capacitance, and low bias condition of scaled device lowered on-current level. These problems of smaller device were also related to limitation of RC-delay performance. Accordingly, the scaled device with optimized physical parameters showed similar to 1% decrease in delay performance compared to 5 nm node device. In order to improve RC-delay performance, trenched contact method and channel strain engineering method were separately applied for the same device.

913,"As the size of semiconductors becomes smaller, it is necessary to perform high precision polishing of nanoscale. Ceria, which is generally used as an abrasive, is widely used because of its uniform quality, but its stability is not high because it has a high molecular weight and causes agglomeration and rapid precipitation. Such agglomeration and precipitation causes scratches in the polishing process. Therefore, it is important to accurately analyze the size distribution of ceria particles. In this study, a study was conducted to select dispersants useful for preventing coagulation and sedimentation of ceria. First, a dispersant was synthesized and a ceria slurry was prepared. The defoamer selection experiment was performed in order to remove the air bubbles which may occur in the production of ceria slurry. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF) were used to determine the size distribution of ceria particles in the slurry. AsFlFFF is a technique for separating nanoparticles based on sequential elution of samples as in chromatography, and is a useful technique for determining the particle size distribution of nanoparticle samples. AsFlFFF was able to confirm the presence of a little quantities of large particles in the vicinity of 300 nm, which DLS can not detect, besides the main distribution in the range of 60-80 nm.

914,"Human endothelial-overexpressed lipopolysaccharide-associated factor 1 (EOLA1) has been suggested to regulate inflammatory responses in endothelial cells by controlling expression of proteins, interleukin-6 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and by preventing apoptosis. To elucidate the structural basis of the EOLA1 function, we determined its crystal structure at 1.71 angstrom resolution and found that EOLA1 is structurally similar to an activating signal cointegrator-1 homology (ASCH) domain with a characteristic beta -barrel fold surrounded by alpha -helices. Despite its low sequence identity with other ASCH domains, EOLA1 retains a conserved 'GxKxxExR' motif in its cavity structure. The cavity harbors aromatic and polar residues, which are speculated to accommodate nucleotide molecules as do YT521-B homology (YTH) proteins. Additionally, EOLA1 exhibits a positively charged cleft, similar to those observed in YTH proteins and the ASCH protein from Zymomonasmobilis that exerts ribonuclease activity. This implies that the positively charged cleft in EOLA1 could stabilize the binding of RNA molecules. Taken together, we suggest that EOLA1 controls protein expression through RNA binding to play protective roles against endothelial cell injuries resulting from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation responses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

916,"In this paper, the dependency of low frequency noise as a function of the gate voltage was examined for tunneling field effect transistors (TFETs). When the level of gate voltage is low, the tunneling width of the TFETs is large. Thus, electrons move via the trap instead of tunneling directly. On the other hand, when the level of gate voltage is high, the tunneling width of the TFETs becomes narrow. Thus, when the gate voltage is low, the noise level of TFETs is high because electrons pass through the trap. However, when the gate voltage is high, electrons pass directly from valence band of source to conduction band of drain, so the noise level is low. Finding the voltage suitable for this TFET is important to determine the optimum conditions for generating BTBT when measuring TFETs and to reduce noise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

918,"Pure sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is chemically inert, non-flammable, non-toxic and thermally stable, and it has excellent dielectric strength and arc-quenching and control properties. The switching-off process of SF6 arc discharges occurs at the region between the contacts during the opening sequence to interrupt the flow of excessive current in a faulty network. The arc is tolerated in a controlled manner until a natural current zero when the arc discharge is rapidly quenched to restrict the thermal and dielectric reignition to the interruption. An SF6 self-blast switching chamber combines two advantages of blowing by heat expansion of the SF6 and arc rotation by electromagnetic effect of coil to improve the switching performance on thermal and dielectric reignition. The thermal and aerodynamic behaviors of an SF6 rotating switching arc in the chamber physically are complex and difficult to understand only by measurement due to their three-dimensional effects. Since the late nineteen-eighties, significant progress has been made in the method of computational fluid dynamics describing the physical processes occurring in the switching arc. The final goal of computer simulation technology on the arc switching is to predict the switching phenomena on the thermal and dielectric reignition from an engineering point of view. In this paper, we have conducted quasi-three dimensional computations to predict the thermal and dielectric reignition of SF6 rotating arcs occurring after a current zero in the self-blast switching chamber. Through the complete work, the microscopic thermal and aerodynamic behaviors of the remnant arc column after a current zero should be good criteria to predict the thermal and dielectric reignition of the rotating switching arc in the chamber.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to conventional lateral FET devices, VFETs can increase the gate area effectively while minimizing the loss of layout area due to their structural characteristics. Considering VFET devices below 5 nm node, an expansion of the gate area of the device reduces the influence of WFV. However, the effect of GV is exacerbated by weakening gate controllability. In order to analyze the exact variability issues, it is necessary to consider not only the influence by the WFV but also the influence by the GV. Therefore, we propose accurate guideline by analyzing the integrated variability issues in a various VFET device structures in a single device and a 6-T SRAM bit cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structural refinement was performed taking into account rovibrational corrections to the thermal-average internuclear distances calculated with harmonic and anharmonic (cubic) MP2/cc-pVTZ force constants in terms of static and dynamic models. It was shown that both models fitted the GED data equally well. The results of the GED refinement revealed that in the equilibrium structure, the thioamide group is twisted by about 30 degrees with respect to the phenol ring plane. This is the result of an interatomic repulsion of hydrogen atom in the amide group from the closest hydrogen atom of the benzene ring, which overcomes the energy gain from the pi-pi conjugation of the thioamide group and the aromatic system of thiosalicylamide. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and comparison of the thiosalicylamide molecular structure with those of related compounds revealed hydrogen-bonded fragment between the hydroxyl and thiocarbonyl groups. The structure of thiosalicylamide in the gas phase was found to be markedly different from that in the solid phase due to the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the crystal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
923,"An electrochemical cell with a specifically designed X-ray window was fabricated in order to evaluate the structural evolution of the cathode material under the operating condition. It enabled us to obtain strong signals from a positive electrode material without a significant loss of the battery function. With use of this system, the structure evolution during the charge-discharge process of a layered cathode material Li[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O-2 and a high voltage spinel cathode LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 was studied. It was found from the experimental results that the Li [Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O-2 cathode exhibited a single-phase reaction, where the lattice parameters continuously changed. In the case of LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 cathode, the charge-discharge reaction proceeded in two continuous two-phase reactions. Especially for the latter, the phase evolution was reversible in the low- current density reaction. On the other hand, in the high current density charge-discharge reaction, asymmetric behavior was observed. This means that the kinetic limitation of the battery reaction is observable even in this laboratory X-ray diffraction system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the effect of the Br element as an impurity among the trace elements by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) analysis. The SR-XRF analysis was performed at SPring-8 BL16XU (sunbeam). The minimum detection limit of Br was about 0.03 mass ppm using standard samples. The adsorbed Br increased with decreasing temperature when soldering from model sample analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
925,"The mixed random processes of the first order autoregressive process (AR(1)) and white noise have been proved to provide a good approximation of baseline noise in a variety of analytical instruments, and may therefore be useful for estimating precision profiles. This study aims to examine a recently proposed autocorrelation method for estimating three noise parameters involved in the mixed processes (two for AR(1) and one for white noise) of HPLC, which can then be used to calculate the precision profile. This chemometric method was applied to repeatability evaluations of estriol determination using HPLC with UV detection (HPLC-UV). The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of peak area measurements for 5.0 mg/L estriol were observed to be 1.42% for the autocorrelation method and 1.63% for actual repeated measurements of real samples (n = 6). The theoretical RSDs of the autocorrelation method fell within the 95% confidence intervals of the repeated measurements. It is found that the noise parameters are obtained from real chromatographic baseline via the autocorrelation method. Moreover, the instrumental detection limit of estriol based on ISO 11843 was obtained from the precision profile (plot of RSD of measurements against concentration). This is the first paper to describe the autocorrelation method is a practically useful technique for evaluating the precision profile of HPLC-UV analyses without recourse to the repeated measurements of real samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the results from describing the GLCM of aqueous alcoholic solutions, separating (immiscible) water/organic systems with low mutual solubility, and solutions of macromolecules, it is concluded that the model can describe the properties of solutions with pronounced deviations from ideality. It is shown that the relatively high flexibility of the model allows the joint description of such data as vapor-liquid, liquid-liquid, and solid-liquid equilibria, the activities of components, and the heats of mixing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
927,"The core idea behind this study was the utilization of the principal components (PCs) as a substitute of the original dataset of molecular descriptors for the derivatization products of amino acid analogues with n-propyl chloroformate. The derivatives were described through principal component analysis (PCA) with a total of over 1200 different molecular descriptors, split into groups according to their prime chemical characteristic. The form of the chemical space was modeled by PCA and optimized through a supervised procedure; whose quality was tested employing an internal cross-validation leave-more-out methodology supplying the Q(2)X metric (> 0.90 on most sets). The independent ""spaces"" formed contributed a total set of 63 variables (their PCs), the potential of which was evaluated through their application in two independent tests and more specifically in the formation of quantitative structure-retention relationships for two different chromatography systems (gas and liquid), based on published experimental data on those systems. The first model was developed through projection to latent structures methodology, while the second on multilinear regression (MLR). In both cases, the new derivatives' descriptor set formed models of good quality (Q(2)Y >= 0.9), validated through both internal and external test set validation procedures. Their ability to be used along with other variables in simpler modelling methods, like MLR, attests to their potential to be used in models of multivariate system calibration without blowing the dataset out of proportion. Regardless of the selected modelling method, data support their use for the composition of predictive models for analytical purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

929,"Surgical indication of joint preserving alternative procedures, remain extremely rare worldwide in comparison to total hip arthroplasty. The aim of our study was to map the femoral head in regard to quality of the articular surface using confocal microscopy, and to bring more arguments that would encourage orthopedic surgeons to take into consideration procedures that preserve the femoral head and joint in young patients, as opposed to direct total arthroplasty of the hip. Furthermore we believe that new procedures could be described in order to reach these two main goals: sparing the femoral head and, of course, better function of the hip. Our results show that while the superior pole of the femoral head presents completely deteriorated cartilage and contact surface, other areas of the femoral head present relatively good quality cartilage, whereas the inferior pole of the femoral head which is non-weightbearing has unaltered surface anatomy. In conclusion, we do encourage for further research in the direction of femoral head sparing procedures of the hip, in order to improve function and delay total hip arthroplasty in carefully selected patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
930,"The supersonic gas jets are proposed as a tool for researching conformational transitions of polymer chain molecules in untraditional (supercritical) fluids. The working fluid of the jet and the solvent for polymers in this case are supercritical fluids. This method is used for the microencapsulation of TiO2 nanoparticles in poly(ethylene oxide) (Mv = 8,000,000). The suspension of TiO2 nanoparticles in the polymer solution in supercritical carbon dioxide is expanded into vacuum or background gas. The substrate of the jet resulting from rapid expansion was investigated by SEM. Along the axis of the jet, zones of coil-globule coil transitions were found. The position and extent of these zones can be controlled by varying the conditions in the reactor (pressure, temperature, co-solvent concentration) and background gas pressure in the nozzle chamber.

931,"We propose tapered long-range surface plasmon polariton (LR-SPP) waveguides with a gap (tapered G-SPPWs) for improved tunneling efficiency in G-SPPWs. The optical characteristics of the fabricated tapered G-SPPWs were experimentally measured and compared with simulation results. The proposed tapered structure can improve tunneling efficiency by reducing insertion loss of the tapered G-SPPWs. The insertion losses of the straight G-SPPW with an 8-mu m gap length and a 2-mu m SPPW width and the tapered G-SPPW with an 8-mu m gap length, a 2-mu m SPPW width, a 6-mu m taper width, and a 3-mu m taper length were measured to be similar to 1.03 and similar to 0.74 dB, respectively.

932,"In this paper, a post-annealing process that uses microwaves to remove the back-interface thermal damage at the interface between the top silicon layer and the buried oxide layer of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) device caused during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) was studied. RTA, which is widely used in highly integrated short-channel silicon device manufacturing processes, deteriorates the electrical characteristics of SOI pseudo metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOS-FET) by affecting the interfacial properties between the top silicon and buried oxide layers. In order to replenish these interfacial properties, microwave annealing (MWA) was performed on the device under various conditions. Because MWA utilizes the direct energy transfer (DET) method, the RTA-induced thermal damage on the back interface was effectively removed despite a short processing time. The improvement was comparable to that of conventional thermal annealing at a higher temperature for a long period of time. Therefore, MWA is expected to be a very effective post-RTA heat-treatment technology for fabricating ultrathin-body SOI MOSFETs because of its low thermal budget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
933,The encapsulation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with aliphatic thiol compounds with a relatively small amount of ionization energy achieves n-type doping of SWNTs. Thiol compounds encapsulated inside nanotubes in vacuum drastically change the electric properties of SWNTs by a charge transfer between the two species. The simplicity of the synthetic process offers a viable route for large-scale production of SWNTs with controlled doping states by using mat-type SWNTs. Optical characterization (Raman and near-infrared spectrum) and electric property (conductivity) reveals that a charge transfer between the SWNTs and compounds occurs through the difference in the ionization energy and electron affinity. We confirm an electron density change in SWNTs through optical spectroscopy and conductivity measurement in vacuum. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also reveals that the compounds are predominantly encapsulated inside SWNTs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
934,"In this paper, we propose a new type of nonvolatile memory (NVM) device based on a tunnel field-effect transistor (TFETs) with Ferroelectric HfO2 sidewall. By simply utilizing the ferroelectricity of orthorhombic HfO2 and conventional sidewall spacer technique, TFET can operate as a NVM device. The polarized charges in the ferroelectric HfO2 spacer induced by program/erase pulse modulate the tunneling barrier between the source and channel; thus, change the threshold voltage (V-t) of TFET. The proposed NVM TFET has lower subthreshold swing (SS) and higher on/off ratio than conventional NVM TFETs while maintaining equivalent program/erase efficiency. Furthermore, we also investigate the optimal HfO2 sidewall formation conditions to achieve higher NVM performances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
935,"We present how to optimize efficiently the performance of micro-bolometer array with design parameters such as active area and channel length, and minimize simultaneously the channel resistance of bolometer array with a minimum channel area and length in a given technology and technology window. The results demonstrate that the serpentine is very efficient pattern to minimize the channel since it provides a large area or path through which electron or holes conducts as easy as possible, as well as it maintains a relatively large absorption area in a given pixel area. On the other hand, these approach have also much large effects on the flicker noise reduction because amorphous Si active layer has about 20 M ohm/square which causing an insufficient current level in an array circuits, however, any dopants does not need to reduce resistance of micro-bolometer channel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed device has an intrinsic polysilicon layer located in the overlap region between the source and the gate, which can increase the tunneling area and overcome the low ON-current drawback of the conventional TFET. The advantages of the proposed device are proven by using technology computeraided design (TCAD) simulation. It exhibits more than 50 higher on-current (I-ON) of 0.13 mu A/mu m and lower subthreshold swing (SS) of 53 mV/dec than a conventional planar TFET.

937,"In the development of a new compound in chemistry and molecular biology, especially a new medicine in pharmaceutical industry, we often need to find candidate(s), a molecule or molecules, with the best desired property (e.g., binding affinity in medicine) from a large set of molecules with the same scaffold but m distinct functional substitutes at each of its n different sites. The total number N-lib of molecules in this library is m(n). In some cases, N-lib can be a very large number (e.g., millions). This is a challenging task because it is costly and often infeasible to synthesize and test all of these molecules. A new algorithm referred to as optimal sequential search is developed to overcome this difficulty. Especially, this algorithm is chemically intuitive which only uses the information of molecule composition, and accessible to practical chemists. The algorithm can be applied to small, medium and large size molecule libraries. With syntheses and property measurements for a limited number of molecules, the top best candidate molecules can be effectively captured from the whole library. Three examples with library size 64, 160,000 and 1,048,576, respectively, are used for illustration. For the first small library, syntheses and property measurements of 17 molecules are sufficient to capture the top 7 best candidate molecules; for the two medium and large libraries, syntheses and property measurements of about one thousand molecules can capture most or a large part of the top 500, especially the top 100 best candidate molecules. However, the algorithm needs to perform multiple (e.g., hundreds of) iterative syntheses and property measurements. The time cost may not be acceptable if the algorithm is performed manually. To make the algorithm practical, automation of the sequential searching process is the following task.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

939,"1Cr13MoS is a kind of material with excellent corrosion resistance and good mechanical properties. Meanwhile, it also has good self-lubricating properties due to the presence of molybdenum disulfide phase inside the material and can be used as friction pair material in the pump. In this paper, the hardness, microstructure, distribution of the self-lubricating phase, friction and wear properties of 1Cr13MoS after heat treatment were studied. After quenching at 1000 degrees C and tempering at 520 degrees C, the hardness of 1Cr13MoS prepared by pyrometallurgy is higher than that of HB 350. The tempering sorbite structure is evenly distributed, and the self-lubricating phase MoS2 is discretely distributed on the substrate with the average size is about 6 mu m, which leads to good friction and wear properties.

941,"This paper mainly compares the electroreduction of p-nitrophenol by different surfactant-modified chemical electrodes. Four surfactants were prepared to modify the glassy carbon electrode, including a cationic surfactant (CTAB), an anionic surfactant (SDBS) and two nonionic surfactants (Tween 80, OP-10). Each modified electrode was applied to detect the p-nitrophenol in sodium acetate buffer solution, and the reduction peak current and reduction peak potential of p-nitrophenol were measured by linear sweep voltammetry under different concentrations of each surfactant. The results show that the cationic surfactant reduced the peak current, reaching the optimal effect at the concentration of 2.95 x10-4 mol/L; the anionic surfactant and nonionic surfactants reduced the peak current, and the reduction effect depends on the micelle effect of the surfactants and other factors; the cationic surfactant suppressed the reduction peak potential at concentrations of 0 similar to 2 x10-4 mol/L, while the other three surfactants cannot reduce the reduction peak potential; the CTAB was proved as the most sensitive material for detecting p-nitrophenol on electrode surface. This research provides a valuable reference for the design of p-nitrophenol sensors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

949,"During the 2011 to 2018 food microbiology proficiency testing (PT) schemes organized by REQUASUD, a systematic analytical issue was detected. For the enumeration of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), laboratories carrying out the same analytical method (ISO 15214) yielded completely incoherent results while analysing naturally contaminated samples (raw milk, smoked salmon and ham sausage), leading to an atypically large distribution of the PT results. A comprehensive study of these atypical PT results provided insight into the source of systematic errors affecting the LAB enumeration. The main sources of analytical variability turned out to be linked to the ISO 15214:1998 standard. To better harmonize the analytical results, practical improvements can be proposed for the revision of this standard, mainly: the addition of precise criteria for the colony count, a restriction of the allowed incubation conditions and the use of a more selective culture medium (e.g. supplemented with sorbate) to limit the growth of interfering colonies. PT is a privileged observation post to highlight such analytical issues, which would otherwise remain unnoticed. Whenever an unusual distribution of PT results is observed (e.g. high dispersion or non-normal distribution of the values), it is the responsibility of the PT provider to try to identify the causes of non-normality, in a perspective of method improvement. The statistical analysis of atypical PT results requires specific attention: ignoring the non-normality of PT results when it occurs can lead to set an erroneous assigned value, unfairly penalizing participants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

955,"In this study, non-foamed and foamed geopolymers based on IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) slag were prepared and their water resistance properties were examined in an immersion test in order to assess their suitability for water applications such as bridge pier, seawall, tetrapod. Particularly, the immersion characteristics were investigated according to the aging time at room temperature during the production process of the geopolymer. The pH changes of the immersion liquid were analyzed considering the immersion time, and the microstructural changes on the nanometer level of the surface of the geopolymer were observed before and after the immersion. Various shapes of crystals of the zeolite phase formed in the geopolymers prepared in this study, such as needle-like crystals with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 40 nm and lengths of 200 to 300 nm, and plate-shaped crystals overlapped with each other, which is thought to be due to the uneven composition of the slag used as a raw material or to local compositional changes of the alkali activator. By measuring the pH of immersion liquid, the following facts can be seen: foamed geopolymers synthesized from IGCC slag require a room-temperature curing period of at least 7 days, whereas non-foamed specimens require a room-temperature curing period of at least 28 days to consume alkaline activators. This is due to the increase in the specific surface area of the foamed specimen as the specimen is expanded, which thereby increases the contact area between the alkali activator and the slag. The foamed specimens, however, produced larger cracks and pores when immersed in water, while a smaller cracks and pores occurred in the non-foamed specimens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
956,"The effects of Cu opening size on the mechanical properties of epoxy-contained Sn-58Bi solder joints were investigated by a low-speed shear test. Eight sample types were fabricated with various Cu opening sizes and solder pastes. The Cu opening sizes of the component and substrate were 200 mu m or 380 mu m, respectively, and the component formed a Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) solder bump which was placed on the Sn-58Bi solder paste or epoxy Sn-58Bi solder paste printed on the substrate and then reflowed. The microstructures of the solder joints were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the chemical compositions were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron probe X-ray micro-analyzer (EPMA). Epoxy was formed around the solder joints after the reflow process, improving the bonding strength of the epoxy-contained solder joints. Specifically, the bonding strength of the epoxy Sn-58Bi solder joints increased about 2.9 times in the 200 mu m (opening size of component)/380 mu m (opening size of substrate) sample. When the opening size of the component and substrate differed, a fracture occurred at the smaller opening size. On the other hand, a fracture occurred at the substrate side for the SAC305 (solder paste of component)/Sn-58Bi (solder paste of substrate) solder joints, while a fracture occurred at the interface between SAC305 and Sn-58Bi at the SAC305/epoxy Sn-58Bi solder joints for samples with the same opening size between the component and substrate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
957,"The aim of this work is to describe the change of physical properties of the callus material with the use of the proposed mathematical model for callus remodeling. Callus tissue can be considered as a biomaterial where it's properties change over time due to the stimulated healing process. The proposed model is based on the mechanical stimulus theory. It is used to estimate the stress-stimulated change in the callus, Young's modulus, and the density in the case of a mandible fracture. Three healing loading programs are discussed and compared: optimal, intermittent, and intermittent with residual load. Here, the optimal loading program is understood as the in-time change of stimulating loads, which results in the shortest necessary healing time and, simultaneously, in the most uniform distribution of material density in the analyzed domain. The necessary healing time is a period after which the callus density (and hence the Young's modulus) reaches the desired value. The results of the study suggest a significant difference in the value of the callus maximal density between all three analyzed loading programs for a given healing time interval.

958,"Two RP-HPLC methods were developed, optimized, and validated for the determination of two different anti-hypertensive combinations in the presence of their degradation products or impurities and in their pharmaceutical formulations. The first mixture is Ramipril (RAM) in combination with Amlodipine besylate (AML) [mixture I], while the second one is a combination of Ramipril (RAM), Atorvastatin (ATV), and Aspirin (ASP) [mixture II].The proposed combinations were successfully separated on X-bridge C(18)column (250x4.6mm i.d, 5 mu m p.s.), using a mobile phase of 0.05M phosphate buffer-acetonitrile-THF (60:40:0.1% by volume) pH 2.5 and an isocratic mobile phase formed of acetonitrile-0.05M phosphate buffer-THF (60:40:0.1% by volume) pH 2.5 for mixture (I) and (II) at a flow rate of 1mL/min and 1.2mL/min, respectively. The compromising components of the mixtures were detected at 218nm. For the best separation of the mentioned components different parameters were examined and optimized. The two suggested methods were validated in compliance with the ICH guidelines and were successfully applied for the quantification of the cited components in presence of their obtained degradation products as well as in their commercial pharmaceutical formulations.

959,"Observation of relevant phenomena related with dynamical redox process in a plasmonic heterogeneous-photocatalyst system composed by silver nanoparticles (NPs) around and in contact with amorphous silver chloride NPs are reported by in situ transmission electron microscopy. During this process, nanobubbles are initially produced inside the silver chloride NPs, which immediately begin to move within the amorphous phase. Besides, silver atoms inside the silver chloride NPs start to migrate out the occupied volume leaving a space behind, which is filled by crystalline regions of silver chloride located between the pre-existing silver NPs. During the observation time, fast-nucleation, movement, growth, and fast-dissolution of silver NPs take place. Specific space correlation with silver mass loss (or gain) when a new NP is formed (or dissolved), was detected in different regions during the reaction. This mass loss (or gain) takes place on certain places of pre-existing silver NPs. All these phenomena were observed for a configuration comprising at least two silver NPs separated few nanometers apart by a silver chloride NP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we explore the colour-naming behavior of bilinguals in spontaneous speech scenarios. The native language of these bilinguals holds complex colour labels for most of the colours, for which the second language holds only basic colour terms. For this purpose, a story narration task was developed where eight stories were designed with elementary and mixed colour conditions. Two groups of participants took part in the study: (a) 44 monolingual speakers and (b) 32 Malayalam-English bilinguals. Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that there were clear colour label differences between the basic colour terms in English and Malayalam and those labeled by bilingual speakers. Bilingual speakers use translation equivalents of Malayalam colour terms for English colours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Al has attracted attention as a reflector for high efficiency UV emitters because of its high reflectance in the UV region. To improve the efficiency of UV emitter, we generated periodic microhole arrays on the p-AlGaN layer, which serve as a scattering center in the flip chip structure and enhance the light extraction efficiency. The light output power of the fabricated flip chip-based UV emitter with ITO nano grains/Al reflector and microhole arrays on the p-AlGaN layer is significantly improved by 72% and 45% at an injection current of 20 mA, compared to that of UV emitter with only Al reflector and ITO nano grains/Al reflector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
965,"The impact of sucrose and systemic cortisone treatment on the response of dentin was examined in an experimental rat model. After 2 months of a modified diet and/or medication period, the areas of dentin formation and dentinal caries were quantified in the mandibular molars of growing animals. The 60% sucrose diet significantly reduced dentin formation and increased dentinal caries progression. The presence of glucocorticoid medication alone reduced dentin formation. Cortisone medication in combination with sucrose diet further decreased dentin apposition. Rats receiving the control diet positively responded to the dentinal caries by increasing dentin formation to prevent pulpal exposure. The rate of dentine formation was lower in rats with high sucrose diet and predentin area was wider compared to the control group fed normal diet. The enlargement of the predentin region in sucrose diet rats reflects changes in the functionality of the odontoblasts, such as reduction of matrix synthesis and alteration of the mineralization process. These results indicate that the functional alterations in the pulpo-dentinal complex might contribute to dentinal caries progression through systemic mechanism irrespective of the causative factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, the free energy difference of the SPC/E-water and the TIP4P-water between two subsequent systems will be calculated using the thermodynamic integration (TI) and the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) methods. We compare the accuracy and efficiency of the two methods by calculating the free energy difference at three different temperatures, namely, T = 220, 240, 260, 280 and 300 K.

968,"Lanthanoids (Ln) are used in batteries, magnets and various industrial materials. Due to wide applications and few resources, efficient methods for the recovery of Lns are required. In this study, the soluble states of Ln in aqueous and organic phases were directly observed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). We used La(NO3)(3), Pr(NO3)(3), and Tb(NO3)(3) as representatives of Ln in our studies. When La(NO3)(3), and Tb(NO3)(3) was dissolved in water at pH 4.7, [La-2(NO3)(3)(H2O)(n)](3+) (n = 0, 3) or [La-2(NO3)(OH)(2)(H2O)(m)](+) (m = 9, 10), were observed. When La(NO3)(3). Pr(NO3)(3), and Tb(NO3)(3) were dissolved at pH 1.8, [La-2(NO3)(3)(H2O)(n)](3+) (n = 0, 3, 6, 9), [Pr-2(NO3)(OH)(2)(H2O)(7)](3+), [Tb-2(NO3)(OH)(2)(H2O)(n)](3+) (n = 6, 9,12, 15, 18) were mainly observed. Particularly, in the Pr and Tb solutions, monomers generated were identified. By fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), monomer of Ln was not observed but dimer with glycerin was observed. This indicated that monomer was sufficiently hydrated to be ionized by FAB-MS. But dimer with glycerin was ionized due to less hydration by FAB-MS. On the other hand, when La, Pr, and Tb were extracted with TOPO in hexane solution at pH 1.8, [Ln(NO3)(2)-3TOPO](+), [Ln(NO3)(2)-4TOPO](+), and the monomers and dimers of TOPO (Ln = La, Pr, and Tb) were observed.

969,"Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) coated with anisotropic gold nanoplates (aAuNPs) was used for the study of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.5 M sulfuric acid instead of bulk gold electrodes. The electrode cleaning/activation procedure lead to the removal of any charged and uncharged residues on the gold nanoplates, leaving the nanostructured surface highly active towards oxygen reduction. The advantages: much lower overpotential and larger current densities of oxygen reduction are ascribed to the unique nanostructures present on the carbon electrode surface-the gold nanoplates. They are rich in edges providing a large population of Au (100) sites with unsaturated coordination exposed to the solution, and catalytically active. Measurements performed using a rotating disc electrode, modified with the gold nanoplates, confirmed that ORR proceeds via two separate steps: oxygen is reduced to hydrogen peroxide, and the peroxide is further reduced in a two-electron reduction to water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
970,"This study presents a misalignment light-guiding module to increase the effectiveness of absorbing light. For a general fixed-type photovoltaic (PV) panel, the misalignment light decreases the efficiency of the system. A solar tracking system was installed for obtaining higher power generation. However, the cost of the PV system and maintenance was 5-10 times higher than the general type. In this study, this module is composed of an array of misalignment light-guiding units that consist of a non-axisymmetric compound parabolic curve (NACPC) and a freeform surface collimator. The NACPC efficiently collects the misalignment light within +/- 30 degrees and guides the light to the collimator. The light has a better uniformity and smaller angle at the exit aperture. The simulation results show that the optical efficiency of the unit was above 70% when the misalignment angle was smaller than 20 degrees. The experimental results show that the power generation of the light-guiding unit was 1.8 times higher than the naked PV panel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
971,"Applied pyrolysis is used in this work as a treatment technique for hydrocarbon fraction recovery of used lubricating oils (ULO) with the aim of its further energetic valorisation. Applied pyrolysis bring also the advantage of a better management of metallic compounds that will be concentrated in the solid residue. In this work, technical parameters have been evaluated to establish their influence on the process evolution with the aim of identifying the adequate parameters for obtaining the maximum liquid fraction. It was found that, for an equilibrated energy balance, the final pyrolysis temperature should not exceed 460 degrees C and the main parameter that affect the pyrolysis oil yield and its physical-chemical properties is the heating rate in the thermal range of decomposition. Activated Zeolites (HZSM-5 type) and Na2CO3 were used as catalysts. The catalysed pyrolysis tests were performed using direct contact between ULO and catalyst, the materials being mixed before processing. Experimental results showed that in non-catalysed pyrolysis an increasing heating rate is slightly reducing the yield of liquid fraction. On the other hand, by using catalysts, the liquid fraction is decreasing. Thus, the highest liquid ratio (81 wt. %) was obtained when the Na2O3 is used and the process is run under a heating rate of 3-5 degrees C/min. But then, the zeolite HZSM-5 is leading to the highest overall conversion, 95 wt. % at 15-17 degrees C/min, and is positively influence the formation of gas fractions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
972,"The optimal conditions including the aeration rate and agitation speed of bioreactors for the production of carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) by a recombinant Escherichia coli KACC 91335P, expressing CMCase gene of B. velezensis A-68, were different from those for its cell growth. The enhanced production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P with the conventional multistage process needs at least two bioreactors. Shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of the bioreactor from the cell growth of E. coli KACC 91335P to those for its production of CMCase were investigated for development of the simple and economic process with the high productivity and low cost. The production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P with shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed from the cell growth to its production of CMCase in a 100 L pilot-scale bioreactor was 1.36 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for the production of CMCase and it was even 1.54 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for cell growth. The best time for the shift in the optimal conditions was found to be the mid-log phase of cell growth. Owing to the mixed-growth-associated production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P, shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of bioreactors from the cell growth to its production of CMCase seemed to result in relatively more cells for the participation in its production of CMCase, which in turn enhanced its production of CMCase. The process with a simple control for shifts in the aeration rate and agitation speed of a bioreactor for the enhanced production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P on the pilot-scale can be directly applied to the industrial-scaled production of cellulase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

974,"Exploration of the bioinspired silicification of artificial scaffolds is crucial to understanding and engineering the hierarchically complex and elaborate three-dimensional (3D) frustules of diatoms, which have high porosity and mechanical stability with related gas diffusion and storage properties. Herein, we report on the bioinspired silicification of the nanostructured surfaces of hexagonally close-packed silica bead (hc-SB) arrays using a liquid-phase deposition (LPD) method. This process, governed by the kinetics of silicification, was controlled using the concentration of the reactants and the reaction temperature and monitored in real time using a quartz-crystal microbalance, which allowed the investigation of the silicification on the surface during the LPD reaction. These heterogeneous LPD reactions on hc-SB arrays were optimized to mimic natural 3D hierarchical structures. Anisotropic silicification of the nanostructures occurred owing to differences in the energy and local concentration of silicic acid on the nanostructured surface. A 3D hierarchical pore network was realized via a heterogeneous LPD reaction by controlling the size, location, and arrangement of the SBs. We believe that our silicification process on nanostructured surfaces can lead to great improvements in the bioinspired morphogenesis-based engineering of 3D hierarchical structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
975,"In case of the conventional SiCOH films, a post-deposition process was used to make pores by vaporization of porogen (e.g., hydrocarbon) for decreasing the dielectric constant. However, the authors intended the deposition of the SiCOH films, which does not need the post-deposition process to form the pores by using the dual precursors having different structures. The octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) have different structures which were of the ring shape and the linear shape, respectively. The OMCTS and TEOS were used to fabricate the plasma polymerized low dielectric constant SiCOH film by using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system in this work. A ratio of OMCTS and TEOS was adjusted by controlling flow rates of precursor carrier gases into the process chamber. The SiCOH films, which were deposited with dual precursors, showed the very low dielectric constants (relative dielectric constant k similar to 2.06 and 2.09) at plasma power of 10 W. All the fabricated SiCOH films showed the proper leakage current densities below 10(-6) A/cm(-2) at 1 MV/cm as the intermetallic dielectric material. The SiCOH films were investigated to study the relations between dielectric constants and chemical structures by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

977,"A simple, specific, and quantitative high-performance thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method has been developed for the quantitative determination of lupeol in 2 marketed formulations, namely, Manasamitra vatakam and Amree plus capsule. Chromatographic development was performed by using a pre-coated silica gel 60 F-254 aluminum-backed plate, and the development was carried out using toluene-ethyl acetate (9.48:0.52, V/V) as the optimized mobile phase. The developed TLC plates were derivatized by using anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent. The detection of lupeol was carried out at 600 nm. Box-Behnken design was applied for optimization of the chromatographic conditions, and combinations of factors, such as mobile phase composition (volume of ethyl acetate) (A), chamber saturation time (B), and migration distance (C) likely to affect R-F, were identified from preliminary trials and further optimized using a response surface design. Among 3 factors, the significant factor found was the volume of ethyl acetate that resulted in higher change in the R-F value and can be considered as a critical method parameter. Full factorial design was applied for optimization of extraction efficiency. The factors selected for the optimization process were volume of methanol (A) and duration of extraction (B) with percentage yield of extract as response. The linear ranges were found to be 500-3000 ng per band. The accuracy and precision measured were less than 2% relative standard deviation for lupeol. The sensitivity of the method in terms of the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was measured. The proposed method was found to be accurate, precise, reproducible, robust, and specific and can be applicable for the determination of lupeol in the quality-control testing of extract and polyherbal formulations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
978,"The aim of the study is to quantify ventricular interactions by comparing tissue and spectral systolic echocardiographic parameters to allow the early identification of ventricular dysfunction. Clinical, paraclinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evaluations were performed. Right ventricular hypertrophy was diagnosed in the M mode subcostal echocardiographic section. RV hypertrophy was defined by a right ventricular free wall thickness of > 5 mm in diastole. We assessed the following RV and LV tissue and spectral systolic indices: apical systolic excursion of the lateral mitral ring (MAPSE), apical systolic excursion of the lateral tricuspid ring (TAPSE), left (Svs) and right (Svd) ventricular tissue systolic velocities, and RV and LV ejection times. We calculated the following to assess systolic ventricular interdependence: MAPSE/TAPSE, the normal value of which was considered as 0.66 +/- 0.14, and Svs/Svd, the normal value of which was considered as 0.76 +/- 0.21. The study group was compared to a control group with the same clinical features but without ventricular hypertrophy. Twenty-one patients were included in the study: 13 men (62%) and eight women (38%) with a mean age of 56 +/- 3.8 years. We compared the values between the study group and control group, with the following results: TAPSE = 20.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 24.1 +/- 0.76 and MAPSE/TAPSE = 0.74 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.75 +/- 0.04. MAPSE was comparable between the groups. Svs was comparable between the groups (0.09 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.12 +/- 0.02), whereas Svd was different between the groups (0.11 +/- 0.03 vs 0.16 +/- 0.03).

Changes in TAPSE and MAPSE/TAPSE, in addition to Svd and Svs/Svd, are related to right ventricular dysfunction and suggest pathological changes in the interdependence mechanism of the ventricles in patients with RV hypertrophy. In addition, RV free wall thickness was strongly correlated with ventricular interdependence parameters, with the exception of MAPSE. Assessing these parameters and proportions in clinical practice will facilitate the early detection and appropriate treatment of right ventricular dysfunction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

984,"It is often assumed that solvent-basedI sealers give better performance than water-based formulations on concrete because the solvent-based sealers are thought to better penetrate into the concrete matrix. In practice, it can be difficult to measure actual penetration of a sealer into concrete, as dyes and colorants used to highlight the sealer may show different migration properties than the polymeric binder. Con focal Raman spectroscopy mapping has been used to map the depth of penetration of solvent-based, 100% solids, and water-based sealers that employ acrylic and epoxy binders. This mapping shows that neither solvent-based nor water-based formulations showed any significant penetration into the concrete substrate beyond the first few microns of the open surface. A study has also been carried out using a model waterborne acrylic sealer formulation to determine whether additives might influence the penetration of the sealer into the concrete or other factors that could affect the performance of the waterborne coating.

The catalysts were characterized by XPS, HR-TEM, EDS, XRD and N-2 physisorption isotherm. The physical chemical properties of the materials were correlated with the catalytic results obtained in the asymmetric hydrogenation of 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione. In 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione hydrogenation the best results using chiral catalysts allowed 98% conversion and enantiomeric excess of 67% to (R)-1-hydroxy-1-phenyl-propan-2-one and 59% for (R)-2-hydroxy-1-phenylpropan-1-one. Catalyst recycling studies revealed that chiral nanoparticles immobilized on SiO2 are stable. These catalysts do not need extra amount of chiral modifier or inducer added in situ and could be reused without loss of enantioselectivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
990,"In molecular nutrition and sensory analysis, food chemists investigate the interaction of molecularly defined food components with targets in the human organism. Here, we describe how food components can interact with the GABA(A) receptor, potentially leading to calming effects, and how biotransformation processes may modulate the activity of the naturally present compounds. Furthermore, we demonstrate which food components may be able to modify the brain activity pattern and the human behavioral response in a way that compulsive food intake is induced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
991,"Aromaticity to explain unique properties of benzene derivatives has long played an important role in chemistry. To expand the aromatic world, replacement of skeletal carbon atoms in the aromatic compounds by silicon and germanium atoms was performed and aromaticity of the resulting silicon- and germanium-bearing compounds has been established. Based on the background, we decided to undertake investigation on whether or not introduction of tin and lead atoms into the aromatic skeletons would retain the aromaticity. We herein summarize our recent project on the synthesis of tin- and lead-bearing aromatic compounds, dilithiostannoles and a dilithioplumbole. Application of the dianionic aromatic compounds as ligands for transition-metal complexes is also demonstrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
992,"Labetalol (Lab) and nebivolol (Neb) are beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents that are employed for control of hypertension alone or co-administered with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as a potent diuretic for synergistic antihypertensive effect. Advanced, accurate and simple spectrophotometric methods with minor manipulation of zero-order spectra were suggested for simultaneous quantitation of Lab or Neb in mixture with HCTZ for quality control purpose in pure form and pharmaceutical formulations. These methods include (a) constant center method, (b) advanced absorbance subtraction method for Lab and HCTZ, (c) absorption factor method (AFM) and (d) the ratio subtraction method. The established methods were successfully applied over concentration ranges 10-100 mu g/mL, 10-75 mu g/mL and 2.5-25 mu g/mL of Lab, Neb and HCTZ, respectively. Results were compared statistically to those of official and reported methods revealing no remarkable difference. Validation of methods followed international conference of harmonization guidelines. Suggested methods require minor processing of zero-order spectra with accurate results that facilitate the quantitative estimation of studied mixtures in quality control laboratories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
993,"Emergence of superheavy nuclei and hypernuclei, two fields of intense research in nuclear physics, has made a big impact on the nuclear chart; while the discovery of the superheavy oganesson has completed the seven full rows of the periodic table, discovery of several exotic hypernuclei have added a third dimension, called strangeness, to the existing nuclear chart. Highlights of some recent developments in these two fields are presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
994,"Densities and viscosities of glycine and L-alanine solutions in aqueous solutions of tributylmethylphosphonium methylsulfate were measured at 303-333 K under atmospheric pressure. These data were used to calculate apparent molar volume , standard partial molar volume , standard isobaric partial molar expansibility and its temperature dependence, the viscosity B-coefficient and solvation number . Viscosity B-coefficients were used to calculate the free energies of activation of viscous flow. The results were discussed in terms of solute-solute and solute-solvent interactions on the basis of cosphere overlap model and transition state theory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

996,"We developed a molecular level mixing process for fabricating various types of carbon nanotube (CNT)/nickel (Ni) nanocomposite powders by a polyol process. A CNT/Ni nanocomposite was fabricated by two steps, dehydration of polyol and oxidation of acetaldehyde with the formation of diacetyl. Oxygen functionalized CNTs offer direct nucleation sites for Ni particles and strong chemical bonding between CNT and Ni particles. By controlling nucleation sites and nuclear growth, we successfully fabricated three different types of nanocomposite powders, CNT implanted Ni, Ni coated CNTs, and Ni decorated CNTs. Each type of powder was developed for various applications. During the sintering process, the implanted type retained CNT's crystal structure. As a conductive filler to other matrix, the coated and decorated type offered homogeneous dispersion and an enhanced conductive network. Various types of CNT/Ni nanocomposite powders show potential for remarkable development of bulk scale fabrication where exceptionally high strength and electric conductivity is necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

998,"Nanoscale dimples and periodic corrugations are observed on the fracture surface of Zr-based bulk metallic glass composite (BMGC). The nanoscale periodic corrugations display a curved shape, which is different from that observed in previous works. In addition, the crystallization behavior of Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 BMG was investigated. The second crystallization event of Zr-Cu-Ni-Al BMG can be controlled by annealing or tuning cooling rate.

999,"Cyclic polyarylene is a series of compounds, where the cyclic structure is constructed by a number of phenylene and/or heteroarylene moieties. Cyclic polyarylenes consisting of more than three arylene moieties are non-planar, and introduction of substituent(s) induces axial chirality. We comprehensively studied catalytic and enantioselective synthesis of various cyclic polyphenylenes by consecutive inter- and intramolecular cycloadditions of triynes, where 1,6-diyne and alkyne moieties were tethered by phenylene moiety. We further used this strategy for the construction of cyclic heteroarylenes using thiophene-tethered triynes. Next, we focused on the enantioselective construction of sulfur-containing benzo-fused medium ring systems. For examples, intermolecular cycloaddition of 1,8-diynes tethered by sulfur and two ortho-phenylene moieties with an alkyne gave axially chiral poly-substituted tribenzothiepins possessing a seven-membered ring core. We succeeded in the enantioselective synthesis of seven to eleven-membered benzo-fused compounds by intramolecular reaction of triynes consisting of sulfur-tethered 1,6-diyne and 1, n-diyne moieties (n = 8-11).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1000,"Due to relative ease, high accuracy, high sensitivity, appropriate response, and other properties of ionization chambers, they are usually employed as reference instruments in dosimetry and quality assurance programs. Therefore, any improvement and optimization in the structure of these dosimeters can lead to accurate measurements of the absorbed dose. In the present study, the structure of a specific cylindrical ionization chamber (PTW, model 23361, Freiburg, Germany) was improved and optimized. After the design and construction of the new cylindrical ionization chamber, the performance of this dosimeter was investigated by saturation, ion collection efficiency, polarization, leakage current, stability, and linearity of response tests. The findings of performance tests showed that the response of the introduced dosimeter agrees with the recommended standards. The new design and construction of the guard electrode, both in length and arrangement of the dosimeter structure, can improve the electric field and decrease the leakage current. Moreover, the use of pure graphite in the chamber's wall can result to improve in the electric field of the chamber's sensitive volume, thereby improving the performance of the dosimeter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
