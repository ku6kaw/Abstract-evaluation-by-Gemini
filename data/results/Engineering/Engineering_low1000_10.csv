0,"Two-dimensional (2D) linear frequency diverse array (FDA) concept is extended to scan a 2D wide angular sector. This is achieved by highly unequal frequency increments in orthogonal 2D directions of the array. The radar operates as a pulsed FDA in the transmission (TX) mode, while it operates as a pulsed phase array (PA) in the receiving (RX) mode. The low energy of the TX FDA waveform is compensated by the rapid 2D angular scanning together with the use of the cumulative probability of detection scheme.",no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
1,"This paper presents electrolytic capacitorless AC/DC LED driver. It adopts Boost-Buck topology, through modulation of the conduction time Ton and the change of input current reference, to reduce the instantaneous input and output power difference, so a smaller film capacitor can be used instead of the electrolytic capacitor. Therefore, LED driver power life has been effectively improved. The Buck converter operates in the inductor current discontinuous conduction mode to achieve constant output current by controlling the peak current. The control IC is fabricated in TSMC 0.35-mu m 5-V/650-V CMOS/LDMOS process, and verified in a 72-V/150-mA circuit prototype. The test results show that when the range of input voltage is 175-264 Vac, the effciency of the system is 83%, the voltage linear regulation is +/- 1%, the load regulation is +/- 0.5%, and the electrolytic capacitor is replaced by 470-nF CBB capacitor under the condition that the power factor is above 0.7.

2,"Effective treatment of external pollution inputs is highly important for the protection of receiving waters. In this study, three tidal flow (flooded/drained time ratio of 16/8 h) biofilters with combined substrates of ceramsite/volcanics and fibrous carrier were used to remediate heavily polluted river water. Good removal performance for NH4+-N, COD and P was achieved, with mean efficiencies of 77.8%-97.4%, 80.0%-81.0% and 62.3%-94.9%, respectively. But TN removal was inefficient (30.5%-36.5%) primarily because nitrate removal was restricted mainly by deficiency of organic carbon in the influent. Thus wood pieces were added to the biofilters as exogenous carbon source for heterotrophic denitrification. TN removal was largely enhanced with mean removal efficiency of 65.7%-70.5% during the initial 20 operation days because of decreased effluent nitrate concentration, despite of the gradual decrease of TN removal efficiency and release of pollutants from the wood during the first several operation days. The biofilter with combined substrates and additional plant biomass as carbon source is a promising eco-technology for the remediation of polluted surface water with high nitrate content and low C/N ratio.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes
3,"In this study, the problems, which simultaneously extract and direct positioning of multiple transmitters, are considered. Without assuming a priori knowledge of the source number, the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is applied after using the Akaike information theoretic criteria for model order determination, while the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) algorithm can be directly used to localise multiple sources that transmit unknown signals. Two methods, which combine MUSIC and MVDR with the image expansion (IE) algorithm, are proposed. The IE algorithm used in actual scenarios is based on the constant-false-alarm rate.

4,"This study investigates short channel (length <20 mu m) p-type organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices which exhibit off-state leakage in their ID-VG characteristics. This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that when a lower positive gate voltage is applied, gate voltage cannot control the back channel, causing back channel leakage. The behavior of back channel leakage is confirmed by the OTFT saturated-regime drain-current formula multiplied by channel length. For dual gate OTFT devices, a top gate voltage sweep and fixed different bottom gate voltages are applied, which indicates that the conduction path is distributed throughout the entire organic semiconductor (OSC) layer, and the back channel leakage can be suppressed by a positive bottom gate voltage. Finally, using dual gate sweeping for a dual gate OTFT device allows the top and bottom gate voltage to simultaneously control the front and back channels, causing a suppression of the back channel leakage, an improvement in subthreshold swing (SS) from 420 to 200 (mV/decade) and an on current increase from 7.8x10(-8) to 3.3x10(-7) A at V-G-Vsub-threshold = -8 V for the W/L = 50/20 mu m device.",yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes
5,"This paper presents a charge accumulation-free voltage-controlled (VC) bi-phasic sinusoidal functional electrical stimulator (FES) for bioelectronic application. Traditionally, constant current (CC) pulse-shaped FESs with active or passive charge balancers are used to compensate for accumulated charges arise from process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variation as a result of long-term stimulation. Unlike the CC pulse-shaped FES, the VC sinusoidal-shaped FES is adopted here to avoid charge accumulation over time. The charge balancer is not required, substantially reducing system complexity and the chip area of the FES. To demonstrate the feasibility of concept, in this paper, four channels of VC bi-phasic sinusoidal-shaped FESs are integrated with the bio-potential recording circuit to compare with four channels of CC bi-phasic pulse-shaped FESs that are integrated with the same neural recording system for comparison. Measurements indicate an absence of charge accumulation as a result of the VC FESs. In addition, here we adopt the sinusoidal stimulation to reduce transient effects on tissue in comparison to a pulse-shaped method. The bio-potential activities of a cockroach leg that is stimulated for 50 s by the proposed bi-phasic sinusoidal stimulation are recorded. The measured bio-potential activities of a cockroach leg show that no stimulation-evoked leg movement occurs under stimulation by the sinusoidal waveform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"In this article, we discuss the models of the 747 test, in particular, the 747 test taken over a range of linear densities. In a comparison study, we fit the 747 curves at three conditions, as well as different upper limits of the track pitch. Based on the comparison result, we present a general model for the 747 curves as a function of linear density. The new proposed model not only improves the accuracy but also extends the applicable scope of the fitting. With the model, we also demonstrate the optimal combinations of track density and linear density for maximizing the off-track-capability (OTC) and squeeze-to-death (S2D), as well as their maximums as a function of areal density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Various phenomena, such as quantum noise and scattering, existing in the industrial X-ray imaging process, and structural complexity of the measured workpiece resulted in low-contrast and blurry industrial X-ray images, which caused interference to the X-ray image analysis. This study proposed an improved adaptive sharpening algorithm to enhance the contrast and quality of X-ray images. Image pixels and the neighborhood established a non-local feature relationship through non-local filtering model on the basis of the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) model. The structural similarity of block-based pixels within the search window area was calculated. The improved weight was combined with image sharpening with high-enhancement results. The edge-preserving ability of the algorithm was verified through image tests. Finally, the proposed algorithm contributed to improving the quality of the contrast of industrial X-ray images through simulation experiments. Results demonstrate that features in the neighborhood based on non-local differences reflect rich details of images. The X-ray images sharpened with the proposed algorithm are characterized with excellent visual effects and rich details, with information entropy (IE) values of 2.1464, 4.2453, and 3.7283 and structural similarities of 0.9521, 0.9238, and 0.9534. The weights calculated by SSIM indicate that a high similarity in structure exists between the sharpened image and the original one. Images processed by the sharpening algorithm based on non-local differences present prominent details while effectively maintaining the objective parameter values. This study provides references to improve the quality of low-contrast images.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The trajectory linearization control (TLC) was applied to design an autonomous nonlinear trajectory tracking controller for a novel rehabilitation exoskeleton shoulder joint in this paper. TLC is a relatively new control method which was applied in aircraft and mobile robot, which had good performance on real-time trajectory tracking, anti-jamming and universality. As a new application in the exoskeleton shoulder joint controller design, the controller in this research contained two loops that separately based on the inverse kinematics and pseudoinverse dynamics models of the exoskeleton shoulder. Two PI controllers as the error regulator can reduce the tracking error. The position and angular velocity error feedback were employed to constitute the closed-loops. Since the controller was based on model and linearization, it can adapt to both linear and nonlinear control processes. The simulation of three different trajectories for single degree of freedom movement of shoulder joint (shoulder flexion and extension, abduction and extension), and the movement of both the two degrees were given. The simulation results showed that the TLC controller can follow the exoskeleton shoulder trajectory steadily and accurately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"The iron and manganese modified mesoporous carbon (MC-Fe, MC-Mn and MC-Fe/Mn) was prepared from waste biomass with nitrogen-doping assistance. The modified MCs were characterized by BET, XRD, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. It was found that the introduction of nitrogen on MCs restrained the pore plugging caused by metals doping, and its BET surface area and total pores volume were around 1,200 m(2)/g and 1.00 cm(3)/g, respectively, because nitrogen could facilitate the dispersion of metals on MC evenly. The introduction of Fe might promote the formation of -O-CH3 while Mn might contribute to the formation of the C=O functional group on the surface of MCs. The adsorption results show that the adsorption capacities of modified MCs toward methylene blue (MB) were enhanced evidently by the introduction of Fe and/ or Mn, which was increased from 911 to 1,030 mg/g. The higher adsorption capacity of MB could be attributed to the unchanged porous structure, metal active adsorption sites and modified surface chemistry on modified MCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"We reported an acousto-optic mode-locked Tm:LuAG laser pumped by a 786 nm laser diode and realized continuous-wave mode-locked operation. At the pump power of 8.2 W, the output average power was 335 mW with the wavelength of 2023.2 nm. The pulse width was 240 ps at the pulse repetition frequency of 81.60 MHz, and the beam quality factor M-2 was 1.04. The output wavelength was tuned from 2022.6 to 2025.3 nm, corresponding to the output average power of 310 to 353 mW. In addition, the self-mode-locking phenomenon was found.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"The precise point positioning real-time kinematic (PPP-RTK) technique enables a single receiver to achieve high-precision and real-time positioning services, mainly relying on integer ambiguity resolution based on satellite phase bias (SPB) information. For the PPP-RTK technique based on uncombined observations, the SPBs of basic frequencies are available only at low precision because of high correlation and therefore need to be updated frequently. Thus, the most appropriate linear combinations of BeiDou triple-frequency SPBs with low update rates for transmission to users must be identified. To acquire combinations of BeiDou triple-frequency SPBs, we use the Z-transformation to process the covariance matrixes corresponding to SPB estimates to generate decorrelated SPB combinations. To meet different circumstances, geometry-free, geometry-fixed and geometry-plus-satellite-clock-fixed variants of PPP-RTK are applied to process data from the regional network. The computed results indicate that the primary stable, secondary and tertiary stable SPB combinations of B1, B2 and B3 frequencies are (0, -1, 1), (1, 2, -3), and (-33, -129, 163) for the geometry-free variant, (0, -1, 1), (1, 2, -3), and (-21, -95, 117) for the geometry-fixed variant, and (0, -1, 1), (1, 3, -4), and (-18, -84, 103) for the geometry-plus-satellite-clock-fixed variant. Furthermore, the statistical results of the SPB series provide stable periods of the primary stable combinations of longer than 7 d. For the secondary and tertiary stable combinations, the stable periods for the geometry-free variant are 12 h and 5 h, for the geometry-fixed variant 12 h and 8 h, and for geometry-plus-satellite-clock-offset variant 12 h and 10 h. These stable periods suggest how often the SPB information should be updated and provide meaningful insight for the allocation of the computing resources of the PPP-RTK server.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"This study presents a novel super-resolution directions of arrival (DOA) estimation method for mechanical scanning radar by using the advanced compressive sensing algorithm. This method is implemented by constructing a signal model of the mechanical scanning radar through imitating the array radar signal model. Also then it established the compression relationship between the transmitted and received echo signals of the reader by sparsification technique of sending signals. Finally, the DOA estimation can be solved by employing advanced compressive sensing algorithm including basic pursuit (BP), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), regularised orthogonal matching pursuit algorithms and so on. Compared with the conventional super-resolution DOA estimation method such as multiple signal classification, the proposed method can distinguish two or more targets within one beamwidth more precisely. Compared with the earlier super-resolution DOA estimation method such as maximum likelihood, the proposed method can obtain more accurate and robust angle difference estimation and do not need to previously know the source number. Both simulated and experimental results show that the overall performance of the proposed DOA estimation is better than that of other methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"The range profile of the plasma sheath target is always found to be distorted when using the linear frequency modulation signal as the radar detection signal. As a result, the detection and tracking of the target became hard, or even failure. Here, three possible reasons of the range profile distortion is investigated in detail: (i) The broadening of the particles in the radial direction of the radar detection when the plasma sheath is produced; (ii) The scatterers in one range gate have different radial velocities that the range profile is dispersion due to the range-Doppler coupling effect; (iii) The amplitude and frequency of the echo signal are modulated by the time-varying plasma sheath. Here, the influence of the above three mechanisms on the range profile is simulated. In addition, for the accurate detection and tracking of these targets, the reason of the distortion should be distinguished. Therefore, several methods are proposed to distinguish the different mechanisms for the range profile distortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"In this study, by using the electromagnetic field analysis, the design of brushless DC generator with a novel construction and controller, appropriate for variable speed applications, is proposed. In the proposed machine, unlike the conventional structure, an assisted DC field coil is employed instead of permanent magnet excitation to provide a regulated voltage. Results of the electromagnetic field analysis show that including the DC field coil increases the controllability of the flux in different machine parts which provide a regulated terminal voltage in a wide speed range appropriate for variable speed applications. Moreover, the maximum power point tracking is achieved by controlling the DC field current along with producing optimal turn-on and turn-off angles for stator winding using the electromagnetic analysis based on optimal finite element analysis. Also, an appropriate controller is designed to control the DC field coil current. To verify the actual performance of the proposed configuration, a 1.5 Kw machine is manufactured and tested followed by the discussion on results. The obtained experimental results are in good agreement with the results of the electromagnetic analysis which confirm the maximum power trackability and robust output voltage regulation of the proposed conversion system under different shaft speeds and load conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"The aim of this study was to propose a new method for optimizing the touch-screen installation position in order to minimize the physical workload and increase screen visibility. Ten students participated in this study. The participants utilized a touch screen at different installation heights (50, 65, and 80% of stature), tilt angles (0, 45, and 90 from the horizontal plane), and having different button sizes (a square with a side of 10, 20, and 30 mm). The joint angles, when using a touch screen, were measured to calculate the joint torque ratios (JTRs). Subjective screen visibility were also determined. The optimal installation position was determined by solving a bi-objective optimization problem consisting of two objective functions. The Pareto optimal solutions for the two objectives showed a range of 1124-1251 mm and 44.4-67.9 degrees. The proposed method determined the optimal installation position of the touch screens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"A supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO(2)) power cycle generates electric power by driving turbogenerator similar to a steam cycle. However, the working fluid is not steam but CO2. In particular, because sCO(2) with a relatively high density flows throughout the entire cycle, it contains a small-scale turbomachinery and heat exchangers. In addition, the sCO(2) power cycle has a higher cycle efficiency than the steam Rankine cycle owing to the small compression load. It can also be used in areas where water is scarce because the cooling temperature is above 31V . In this work, a kWe-class transcritical sCO(2) test loop with a maximum temperature of 500V is designed and its preliminary test is introduced. From the test results, the operating procedure and characteristics of the sCO(2) power cycle will be investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"Objective: The purpose of this paper is to increase the accuracy of human cardiac diffusion tensor (DT) estimation in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) with a few diffusion gradient directions. Methods: A structure prior constrained (SPC) method is proposed. The method consists in introducing two regularizers in the conventional nonlinear least squares estimator. The two regularizers penalize the dissimilarity between neighboring DTs and the difference between estimated and prior fiber orientations, respectively. A novel numerical solution is presented to ensure the positive definite estimation. Results: Experiments on ex vivo human cardiac data show that the SPC method is able to well estimate DTs at most voxels, and is superior to state-of-the-art methods in terms of the mean errors of principal eigenvector, second eigenvector, helix angle, transverse angle, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity. Conclusion: The SPC method is a practical and reliable alternative to current denoising- or regularization-based methods for the estimation of human cardiac DT. Significance: The SPC method is able to accurately estimate human cardiac DTs in dMRI with a few diffusion gradient directions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"In this article, a series of analysis were performed on a two-dimensional structure of steel and rubber-covered rollers. First, a hyperelastic-viscoelastic composite constitutive model based on a dynamic mechanical experiment of rubber was formulated to accurately describe rubber properties. Meanwhile, a hyperelastic constitutive model not considering viscoelasticity was set as the control group. The material used in this article was the nitrile rubber with the Shore hardness of 40. Then, the effects of viscoelasticity on the von Mises stress were analyzed by comparing results of two models. The influences of working conditions (roller speeds/compression displacement) on the von Mises stress and the area of hysteresis loop were also studied. Next, the contact characteristics under different working conditions and constitutive models were analyzed combining viscoelasticity. A verification experiment of contact width was carried out, and the theoretical and simulated values were calculated and compared. Finally, the relation of ""low peak"" phenomenon with viscoelasticity was studied, and the effects of working conditions and rubber viscoelasticity on contact feature of rollers were summarized. The conclusions of the article can help engineers to better optimize dynamic working conditions and judge the working state of the structure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"In this article we present LLSR, an R package for the characterization of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS). The scope of existing mathematical descriptions is ported to R and expanded with the implementation of a database of phase diagram parameters. The package applies nonlinear regression analysis to calculate the fitting parameters of well-known empirical equations-such as the ones described by Merchuk and Murugesan-using data obtained from articles published in high quality journals. The database is based on empirical data obtained from published manuscripts and provides a software package with the potential to reduce experimental effort and save resources throughout the development of an ATPS-based process or product. The package requires only minimal knowledge of R and can be installed directly from its console, and the results are easily exported for subsequent analyses. Detailed examples of usage and descriptions of the package capabilities, including built-in database search functions, are demonstrated by characterizing a poly(ethylene glycol) 2000/ammonium sulfate ATPS, the data of which is provided with the package. Additional online resources for the package are also described, including the procedure to allow users to contribute to LLSR in order to expand its database and capabilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Waste is a complex societal problem: municipal solid waste should be considered a resource, but the methods for capturing, treating and utilising this resource are varied and often dependent on geopolitical factors. Previous research has, on the one hand, explored the need for a more comprehensive waste composition specification to manage municipal waste better, and on the other, focused on a problematic waste stream and the options available for dealing with it. This work considers the use of multi-criteria decision making to assess the relative merits of different treatment options. A complex and problematic waste stream, wood, has been selected as a case study. For the purpose of the study, the work considers the options available to Surrey County Council in the UK. Currently, for the conditions selected, energy from waste was considered to be the best option available for the treatment of wood with no discernible value for upcycling or reuse, but not contaminated with hazardous chemicals. When considering a different location with different circumstances, a different solution might be found.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"A novel dynamic penetration testing method for the investigation of cohesionless soils based on the principles of vibratory driving has been developed. During the so-called vibro-penetration test (VPT), a vertical harmonic excitation force drives a rod with a conical tip into the ground. The penetration resistance is defined as the number of excitation cycles N(z10 )required for 0.10 m penetration with a reference driving energy. In order to evaluate N-z10, the tip and shaft resistance, the tip acceleration and the depth of the penetrometer tip are recorded during driving and the data are evaluated according to a proposed vibro-penetration model. Experimental and numerical investigations are carried out to investigate the soil response, validate the mechanical model and evaluate the influence of the density, the effective stresses and the machine parameters on the vibro-penetration resistance. The results show that the N-z10 - values are reproducible, correlate unambiguously with the state variables but depend on the machine parameters to some extent. In comparison with the CPT, the VPT shows similar sounding records. However, the required equipment is much lighter, the execution faster and in-situ investigations of medium dense to dense cohesionless soils at large depths are feasible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"We present a novel design of a parameterization image stitching algorithm for ultrashort throw laser MEMS projectors. The resultant method allows the use of projectors with short or even long throw ratios to achieve ultrashort throw projection through a parameterized algorithm to stitch multiple images into one single frame, alleviating the trade-off between the resolution and frame rate in conventional laser MEMS displays. To evaluate the effectiveness, we construct a test system that consists of three off-the-shelf projectors with a throw ratio of 1.3 and three planar reflective mirrors. Using our method, the integrated system yields an ultrashort throw ratio of 0.26, greatly reducing the projection distance from 12 to 2.6 ft for the 120-in. screen in diagonal. Moreover, our algorithm can be fine-tuned to correct for image distortion, intensity variation, and edge mismatch induced by two-axis light beam steering, thereby further improving the image quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

24,"This study investigates the optimum location of drainage galleries of concrete gravity dams under usual, unusual, and extreme loading conditions. The uplift and the stress distributions were computed using the gravity method and the beam theory, whereas the leakage rate into the gallery was determined by the finite-element method. The results show that the presence of a drainage gallery can reduce the uplift by over 60 percent compared to a non-drained case. The suitable gallery location shifts toward the upstream if the drain diameter increases and the spacing decreases. This is consistent with previous research. As the gallery is moved toward the downstream, the crack length decreases; however, this increases the uplift. The most effective solution is found to be placing the gallery 10 percent of the base width away from the heel and at the downstream water level or below and adding post-tension cables on the downstream side. This option also yields lower pumping costs by reducing the pump head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"Using heat shield, especially in throat area has a significant effect on combustion chamber pressure and thermal efficiency of solid fuel engines. Precise prediction of the regression of throat area for different pressures, will lead to optimal design of the motors, specifically for those of long burnout times. In this work, erosion of graphite nozzles employed in solid propellant motors with a specific composite propellant and variable pressures, is investigated. The numerical model utilized includes the Naiver-Stokes equations, chamber gas thermodynamic equations and thermochemical and heat conduction equations for the nozzle surface. In order to validate the numerical results, a cartridge type solid propellant motor with a graphite nozzle is experimentally tested. Using a 3D scanner in the experimental setup, the amount of inner surface regression for variable pressures (60, 90, 120 and 200 bars) is measured. Numerical and experimental results are in a proper conformity with each other. There is a direct relationship between convection heat transfer coefficient and the pressure. The overall erosion is the same for all four engine pressures. The erosion rate increases with increasing pressure. This rate for the fuel is about 0.21 mm/s for every 100 times the pressure up to 300 times. For a pressure higher than 300 times, a significant leakage occurs at the corrosion rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"The dc-link voltage stability for a hybrid five-phase open-end winding (OeW) drive operating under carrier-based pulse-width modulation is studied. The drive consists of a five-phase induction machine, supplied using one three-level and one two-level voltage source inverter. This configuration is analysed for the case of isolated dc-link rails, while the dc-link voltage ratio is considered as an additional degree of freedom. It is demonstrated that different dc-link voltage ratios lead to the different overall number of voltage levels across stator windings. Modulation strategies are investigated and their performances are analysed from the dc-link voltages stability point of view. An analytical method for dc-link voltage stability analysis is presented. Results show that the four-level configuration always leads to stable dc-link voltages, regardless of the modulation strategy. On the other hand, if the six-level configuration is combined with modulation strategies that lead to optimal harmonic performance, not all dc-link capacitor voltages will be in the balance depending on the operating conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"An effort has been made to numerically study the interactions between the vapor films generating from multiple heated cylinders placed in a saturated water pool with a view to understand the influence of neighboring interface on growth of vapor films. Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been used for domain discretization and interface reconstruction. Unconstrained growth of vapor film around a cylinder is simulated first and the nature of vapor dynamics has been taken as a base case for the study of interaction patterns. Vapor growth has been understood through temporal phase contours, azimuthal thickness variation, and trajectory of the centroid of the vapor mass. It has been shown that the presence of cylinder in vertical neighborhood results in suppression of vapor film generating from the bottom cylinder, whereas, the vapor films generating from two cylinders placed in horizontal neighborhood experience a horizontal shift. Studies have also been made to observe multidirectional interactions of vapor films with heated cylinders placed in an inline array, vertically staggered and horizontally staggered arrangements. It has been found that the highest deviation from unconstrained growth occurs in case of the center cylinder in a horizontally staggered arrangement as compared to others. Mutual interaction coefficient and indices are proposed to judge the best possible arrangement in case of a requirement for placement of stacked cylinders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"Many years of research on the RC4 stream cipher proves it to be strong enough, but there are claims that its swap function is responsible for essential biases in the output. There are suggestions to discard some initial bytes from the key-stream, to get rid of this, before the actual encryption starts, though no optimum value has been defined. In this paper, by analysing different variants of RC4, the authors have attempted to find out whether this cipher becomes more secure by discarding initial bytes and, if so, what is its optimum limit. Also, multiple S-boxes generated by different logics and a unique key-mixing procedure have been implemented, which made k RC4 more robust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,"The authors investigate and physically analyse the effects of the angle of grooving (theta) on various analogues and RF parameters of InAs-channel quantum well MOSFETs with raised source/drain architecture at a 14-nm gate length. Moreover, harmonic distortion analysis is performed to examine the linearity and distortion of common source amplifiers built with such transistors. The findings reveal that the device with theta = 20 degrees exhibits significant improvement in transconductance efficiency (g(m)/I-DS), output resistance (r(d)), and voltage gain (A(v)) while showing degradation in transconductance (g(m)) compared to the corresponding parameter with theta = 90 degrees. Furthermore, the obtained results manifest that the total harmonic distortion drops to -47 dB for an amplifier built with the device having theta = 90 degrees compared to -22 dB obtained with theta = 20 degrees. Notably, as the angle of grooving increases from 20 degrees to 90 degrees, the gain bandwidth of the amplifier improves by 232% while the peak gain falls by 40%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

31,"The main goals of an engineering test are reproducing a real scenario in a controlled environment and monitoring a device under validation when exposed to such condition. In this context, some recent studies have indicated misalignments between the waveforms suggested by the Radiated Immunity standards and the real telecommunication signals. Reproducing an actual signal in an electromagnetic compatibility laboratory might, however, be an expensive task, since it demands more sophisticated hardware. In this study, a simple solution for this problem is proposed based on adjustments applied to the standardised pulse modulated waveform. The objective is to develop an alternative to the traditional procedures, in an attempt to provide the manufacturers a more realistic test environment for their products. Mathematical manipulations indicate that a good agreement between the adjusted waveforms and a digital television signal cannot be simultaneously achieved in both time and frequency domains. Multiple trade-off solutions are then generated and analysed through electromagnetic simulations.

34,"Beams with elastic constraints are widely used in dynamic systems in engineering. A general explicit solution is presented here for the vibration of simple span beam with transverse, rotational and axial elastic boundary constraints due to an arbitrary moving load. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is adopted, in which the boundary constraints are treated as multi-directional boundary springs. After the modal analyses, the explicit closed-form solutions of transverse and axial vibration of the beam under a constant, sinusoidal and cosinoidal moving loads are obtained, respectively. And the vibration of a beam subjected to an arbitrary moving load is derived by the superposition of Fourier series. The current analytical solution is exact and can be applied in multiple engineering fields to obtain accurate structural vibrations. In numerical examples, the effects of the boundary springs on the natural frequencies, modes, deflection, bending moment and boundary reaction of the beam are studied in details. The effects of the number of terms in Fourier series of arbitrary moving load are also discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this method, the optical power of an intraocular lens (IOL) can be remarkably improved, thereby enhancing the visual acuity of patients. In terms of the optical power of an IOL obtained by the clinical study, the maximum level is around 3.50 Diopters (D), 3 months later.

37,"With the rapid increase of optical remote sensing (RS) images, on-orbit specific target detection has been facing more and more challenges: limited processing environment, wireless bandwidth, space, power and storage. To resolve this issue, visual characteristics in the compressed domain are exploited to represent and recognise specific objects. In this study, a new saliency method and an airfield detection framework in the JPEG2000 compressed domain is proposed. First, the authors exploit the header information in raw JPEG2000 code streams to generate structural saliency map, and a great deal of non-structural regions in RS images are eliminated. Second, airfield candidates are extracted from low frequency wavelet sub-bands using line segment detection and the parallel density model. Finally, the geometrical properties of airfield candidates are represented by the speed-up robust features descriptor, and the support vector machine classifier is utilised to gain the final detection results. The proposed framework is evaluated on self-made dataset. Compared with the existing relevant state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method reduces the processing time by 60% while guaranteeing the detection rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"A new damage identification method with a fusion index to locate the damage position and identify the damage extent of beam structures is presented by integrating the modal strain energy and natural frequency sensitivity. The modal strain energy, which is with the limitation on obtaining the damage extent, is adopted to locate the damage position with avoiding the interference of structure itself. The natural frequency sensitivity, which is with false detection and interference happening when solely used, is adopted for identifying the damage extent. In order to further improve the precision of the damage quantification, additional masses are added on the beam structure to obtain more information about the natural frequency sensitivity. Then, the fusion index for damage identification is established through combining the modal strain energy and the natural frequency sensitivity before and after adding masses on beam structures. The results obtained by finite element analysis and experimental tests show that the presented method can locate and quantify damages on beam structures in an accurate and convenient way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"A new type of catanionic surfactant phosphonium benzene sulfonate was synthesized by quaternization of triphenyl phosphine with dimethyl carbonate and followed by anion exchange with alkyl benzene sulfonic acid. The molecular structure was characterized by FT-IR, H-1-NMR, and P-31-NMR. The thermal stability of phosphonium benzene sulfonate was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Its surface properties were studied systematically through equilibrium surface tension, electrical conductivity, and dynamic surface tension measurements. The wettability, foam properties, and emulsification of phosphonium benzene sulfonate were estimated in this paper. TGA results revealed that it has an excellent thermostability and could be used below 350 degrees C. Equilibrium surface tension results indicated that it has a low critical micelle concentration (CMC, about 0.10 mmol/L), lower than that of ammonium benzene sulfonate and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate. Furthermore, the micellization of phosphonium benzene sulfonate in aqueous solution is an entropy-driven spontaneous process. The adsorption process of phosphonium benzenesulfonate at the air-liquid interface is controlled by hybrid kinetic adsorption. Moreover, it has excellent wetting and emulsifying properties and low foam properties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"This article presents an experimental study on the dynamic behaviour of granular material that forms the bed of a curved fluid flow passage. The secondary vortex structures induced by the passage curvature profoundly influence the stability of the granular material and determine the varying bed profiles subjected to the processes of erosion and sedimentation in the flow passage. For examining the characteristics of the bed profile, the current study develops a non-intrusive measurement method whereby transient changes occurring at the granular bed interface are captured for a range of flow operating conditions. The test results indicate three distinct regimes of onset, transition and quasi-stable erosion-sedimentation in the curved passage over the experimental test range. Each stage is analysed and discussed for the observed intricacies of the flow structures and the bed reshaping behaviour, with respect to the timescale of these occurrences, influences of the flow rate and granular particle size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that sense hierarchical optimization procedure was carried out which enables application of different criteria, i.e. it was possible to set different goal functions. Special attention was put on the CO2 emissions. In order to quantify the social impact of different generation plants, CO2 emission cost was analysed in different scenarios. Moreover, economic analysis was based not only on operation expenditures but also on the capital investments. Different technologies were analysed, biomass-based cogenerations (wastewater sludge), fossil fuel-based cogenerations (in combination with gas engine and gas turbine), heat pumps, electric boilers and fossil fuel boilers. In order to determine optimal generation set-up simulation was carried out for a case of the City of Zagreb, Croatia. The simulation period was one year. It is shown that it is yet possible to achieve significant benefits with appropriate selection of generation mix, particularly in the context of CO2 reduction.

42,"This study explores using probabilistic and deterministic approaches for evaluating the quality of groundwater resources. The proposed methodology first used the probabilistic approach, which included multivariate statistical analysis, to classify the groundwater's physiochemical characteristics. Then, building on the obtained results, the deterministic approach, which included hydrochemistry analyses, was applied for comprehensive assessment of groundwater quality for different applications. To present this multidisciplinary approach, a basin located in an arid region was studied. Considering the results from correlation and principal component analyses, along with hierarchical Q-mode cluster analysis, chloride salts dissolution was identified within the aquifer. Further application of the deterministic approach revealed degradation of groundwater quality throughout the basin, possibly due to the saltwater intrusion. By developing the water quality index and a multi-hazard risk assessment methodology, the suitability of groundwater for human consumption and irrigation purposes was assessed. The obtained results were compared with two other studies conducted on aquifers under similar arid climate conditions. This comparison indicated that quality of groundwater resources within arid regions is prone to degradation from salinization. The combined consideration of probabilistic and deterministic approaches provided an effective means for comprehensive evaluation of groundwater quality across different aquifers or within one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"One of the key performance targets on the European Commission's Digital Agenda is to provide at least 30-Mbit/s broadband coverage to all European households by 2020. The deployment of existing terrestrial technologies will not be able to satisfy the requirements in the most difficult-to-serve locations, either due to a lack of coverage in areas where the revenue potential for terrestrial service providers is too low or due to technological limitations that diminish the available throughput in rural environments. In this paper, we investigate a hybrid broadband system combining satellite and terrestrial access networks. The system design and the key building blocks of the intelligent routing entities (referred to as intelligent gateways) are presented. To justify the hybrid broadband system's performance subjectively, lab trials have been performed with an integrated multiple access network emulator and a variety of typical multimedia applications that have varying requirements. The results of the lab trials suggest that the quality of experience is consistently improved thanks to the utilisation of intelligent gateway devices, when compared with using a single access network at a time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"The paper deals with an extension of a German advisory leaflet, which deals with static calculations for the rehabilitation of drains and sewers using lining and assembly procedures. Such procedures include, for example, pipe-lining technologies. For the structural analysis of new pipes, the advisory leaflet uses coefficients for the determination of internal forces and deformations. The coefficients were obtained based on certain assumptions and with the aid of nonlinear calculations. These assumptions place limitations on the practical design process in some cases. This especially concerns the use of different materials for new pipes, as well as geometrical imperfections in new and old pipes. Therefore, new coefficients were determined that are suitable for use in the practical design of new pipes made of polyethylene. Nonlinear analyses were performed using the finite-element method (FEM). In addition, a comparison of the German advisory leaflet and an American standard was performed.

45,"Shear strength of carbon-reinforced concrete members without shear reinforcement - Experimental investigations of the influence of the reinforcement ratio on load-bearing behaviour Fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) as reinforcement for concrete members in structural engineering are becoming increasingly important. Compared to conventional steel reinforcement, FRP reinforcement is different in terms of modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and bond behaviour. If concrete compression failure can be excluded, members with the same mechanical ratio of longitudinal reinforcement have the same bending load bearing capacity. The high tensile strengths of FRP reinforcement can lead to a reduced required reinforcement area and thus geometric ratio of longitudinal reinforcement. This effect leads to a reduced shear strength and increased crack widths and spacings. This article presents and evaluates experimental investigations on the shear strength of concrete members without shear reinforcement. Two different member types were analysed: slabs with textile carbon reinforcement and beams with carbon bars. For a direct comparison with conventionally reinforced members, reference tests with steel reinforcement and comparable mechanical reinforcement ratio were carried out. In addition to a detailed description of the specific properties of the used materials and a comparison of the load-bearing and deformation behaviour of the members, a precise evaluation of the cracking behaviour is shown. Finally, the influence of the reinforcement ratio on the shear strength is presented and the resulting conclusions are summarised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"The use of renewable energy sources is a clear commitment in the process of developing alternatives to reduce the high energy consumption in buildings. Although with intermittent production, renewable energies are unlimited and have a demonstrated potential to be integrated within buildings. The facade is a key element in a strategic position for harnessing renewable solar energy by means of the Active Solar Facade concept. Through a CFD model, a parametric study has been developed to evaluate different alternatives in the design of an Active Solar Facade, composed by a sandwich panel as unglazed solar collector. The high influence of the conductivity together with the absorptivity has been demonstrated. Directly linked to the material selection for solving the absorber and the hydraulic circuit, the advantage of metals compared with plastics, has been verified. The minor effect of the insulation has also been analyzed, although the necessity of a minimum quantity has been stated looking to avoid significant heat losses. Additionally, the performance of the system has been evaluated in order to determine the potentially achievable energy. The result of the extensive campaign monitored in KUBIK (R) and developed in different days in a period of 12 months, has resulted in an average daily production of 320Wh/m(2).

48,"South Africa faced challenges related to potable water quality that has periodically deteriorated, coupled with inconsistent supply of tap water (TW) to households. These challenges are a primary exasperation in the arid O'Kiep region, where the community has few alternatives regarding drinkable water sources. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of drinking TW supplied to the O'Kiep community, focusing on health risks associated with the ingestion of such water. The study included both the quantitative assessment of water quality parameters and a qualitative assessment of adverse human health outcomes experienced by the residents. Furthermore, disease patterns which were associated with ingestion of supplied water were also identified and subjected to appropriate statistical data analyses. Due to the inadequate drinking water supply and shortages in O'Kiep, households often are dependent on water tankers and commercially bottled water, amongst other potential sources of drinkable water. Water samples (n = 53) from O'Kiep' drinking water supply system (DWSS), that is, n = 3 were collected from source and (n = 50) point-of-use (TW) while the questionnaires were simultaneously administered in households. None of the statistical models suggested physicochemical properties as predictors of any of the health symptoms. Approximately, 88% of community members indicated that the water supplied is often turbid, while a high number of people with teeth discolouration (72%) are living in the area and experience diarrhoea-like symptoms, which are likely to be associated with the ingestion of toxin-contaminated water. This was confirmed by some physiochemical parameters quantified, that is, low dissolved oxygen of 2.0 mg/L, a high electrical conductivity of 595 mg/L, and SO42- and chlorine concentrations of 557 and 47.1 mg/L, respectively, which were not within the range prescribed for drinking water guidelines. Furthermore, a positive confirmatory test indicated the presence of toxins in the water. Therefore, regular monitoring and evaluation of DWSS is essential for this vulnerable community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"Narrow-band waveguide filters are widely employed in the output multiplexer (OMUX) for satellite payloads. Among different available filter technologies for realization of an OMUX, dual-mode waveguide technology is the best choice in terms of compact dimensions. In this paper, three structure of these filters are presented for a design example of a narrow-band filter used for OMUX. The first structure is the conventional dual-mode architecture based on circular waveguide by exploiting two degenerate TE modes with orthogonal polarizations. The second structure is based on the TM dual-mode cavity, such a cavity employs both resonant and nonresonanting modes. Finally, the third structure is a new dual-mode architecture based on the circular cavity with rotated slots, where the cavity exploits TE and TM resonant modes. In this manner, the single cavity provides two poles and single transmission zeros, and is at the same time very compact in the longitudinal direction. Simulation and experimental results of a two-cavity filter with four poles and two transmission zeros demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,"Pre-disaster programs, especially for seismic hazards, are necessary to quickly recover the services of a lifeline network. In the case of a multi-source (or multi-root) water lifeline network, an efficient repair schedule must be implemented immediately after an earthquake to assist in post-disaster activities as well as to minimize the subsequent health problems caused by the lack of potable water supply. As such water lifeline operators must establish restoration strategies especially if the supply of water comes from different sources and spatially distributed. For a single-source water network, Horn's algorithm can be used to determine an optimal restoration strategy. However, a variation of this algorithm is necessary in order to allow simultaneous repairs at any given time for a multiple-source lifeline water network. In this research, the authors employ a constrained spanning forest (CSF) algorithm to decompose the network into trees rooted at each source. After the decomposition, Horn's algorithm is used to determine the optimal restoration strategy for each tree in the network with the objective of minimizing a penalty value. Restoration of each node in the spanning forest is carried in sequence according to availability of the crew and allows simultaneous jobs to be done on consecutive arcs in the sequence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"Slope stability is one of the greatest issues of concern in geotechnical engineering. In slope stability analyses, the residual strength of slip zones is the most important parameter for evaluating slope stability and for understanding the reactivation mechanisms. However, it is time-consuming and costly to obtain the residual frictional angle through shear tests. This paper presents the results of a laboratory study designed to evaluate the correlations between the residual frictional angle and the Atterberg limits, which include the liquid limit, the plastic limit and the plasticity index, using eight kinds of reservoir embankment soil samples. The residual frictional angle was measured by the Bromhead ring shear apparatus using remolded samples. Based on the laboratory study, significant correlations between the residual frictional angle and the different indexes were proposed for the reservoir embankment soil, especially in terms of the particle size of the soil, which was less than 0.425 mm. Processing the data on the shear tests led to the discovery that the quantity of eight tests was sufficient for obtaining relevant accuracy in determining the residual frictional angle. Based on the results of the tests, the relationships between the residual frictional angle and all the indexes were found. Compared with the other indexes, the liquid limit had a better correlation with the residual frictional angle. Formulas were predicted in this study that can provide a convenient and highly accurate means for calculating the residual frictional angle value for application to worldwide geotechnical engineering projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"The power amplifier is an important device in the communication system, and its non-linear characteristics will lead to serious distortion of the output signal, reducing the performance of the communication system. In order to solve the problem of non-linearity in a power amplifier, this study proposes an adaptive learning algorithm based on a digital pre-distortion structure, which combines direct learning and indirect learning structure. It improves the accuracy of pre-distorter parameter and has the faster convergence speed. The pre-distortion device parameters are constantly modified to achieve a good linear effect by using the recursive least square adaptive algorithm. The simulation results show that this structure effectively compensates the output signal distortion of the power amplifier, improves the linearisation degree of the power amplifier and reduces the in-band distortion and adjacent channel leakage ratio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

54,"In this paper, we propose an energy efficient Sparse Beamforming Strategy (SBS) in Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN) to achieve an optimimum energy efficiency. The stochastic geometry method is used to derive some expressions for ergodic rate and coverage probability in downlink transmission. In this system model, Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) are coordinated by a Baseband Unit to transmit data toward users. We assume using RRH clusters where each cluster includes one or two RRHs. To investigate this system, we have used Gauss-Poisson process (GPP). The GPP well describes this clustering scenarios. Considering the intra-cell interference power control, we propose SBS to gain the best performance subject to the energy efficiency (EE) metric. SBS which is based on sparse selections of RRHs, is characterized by introducing analytical expressions and simulation of a C-RAN scenario which the allocation of the RRHs follows the GPP distribution. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed SBS method improves the overall EE of C-RAN scenario up to 15% with respect to full RRHs coordination, at the high intra-cell interference conditions, and about 30% with respect to no coordination state between RRHs in low intra-cell interference regime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

57,"Starting initial field production is a unique opportunity to acquire reservoir-surveillance information that can impact future reservoir performance. When a field is perturbed by first production, there is the potential to reduce uncertainty in reservoir properties by monitoring the pressure changes at nonproducing wells with downhole pressure gauges and comparing the observed signal with a range of simulation-model results. The Wheatstone Field, located offshore of Northwest Australia, recently began production startup to supply gas to the Wheatstone liquefied-natural-gas (LNG) facility. The operational guidelines required each development well to start with a single-well-cleanup flow to the Wheatstone platform. The initial single-well-cleanup flows of the Wheatstone field provided scope for selecting a well flow sequence with observation at nonproducing wells. The recommended sequence of initial cleanup flows was designed with a focus on reducing reservoir uncertainties by means of ensemble variance analysis (EVA). EVA is a statistical correlation technique that compares the covariance between two sets of output data with the same set of inputs. For the Wheatstone Field well-cleanup flow sequence selection, the EVA workflow compared the fullfield design of experiments (DoE) study of field depletion and a series of short early-production reservoir-simulation DoE studies of the gas field. The covariance between the two DoE studies was evaluated. The objective of the EVA approach was to determine the startup sequence that would allow for the best opportunity to reduce subsurface uncertainty. This objective was met by ranking multiple cleanup flow sequence scenarios. The key factors considered for sequence selection ranking were the impact on business objectives, such as future-drilling-campaign timing and location of infill wells, and insights on reservoir connectivity, gas initially in place (GIIP), and permeability. The recommended sequence of well-cleanup flows uses a superpositioned pressure signal to boost response at observation wells, which improves measurement resolvability. The selected sequence preserves key observation wells for each manifold and reservoir section for as long as possible before those wells are required to be flowed to meet operational requirements. Operational constraints and variations of the startup plan were considered part of the evaluation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,"Probable maximum precipitation (PMP) is the basis for the estimation of the probable maximum flood, with which large hydraulic works are dimensioned and hydrologically revised. There are two groups of methods to estimate PMP: meteorological and statistical. Meteorological methods are the most reliable, but require a lot of data that is usually not available. Statistical methods are much simpler and only use annual maximum daily precipitation (PMD) values. The classic method of this group is the David M. Hershfield method, published in 1961. Subsequently, in England (NERC, 1975) another statistical method was developed based on the prediction of duration 24 hours and return period (Tr) 5 years, designated M5; this approach allows predictions with various Tr. Jonas Eliasson (Eliasson, 1997; Eliasson, 2000) generalized the M5 method, in a regional technique that only requires two statistical parameters: the M5 and the coefficient of variation ( Cv). In this study, the results of the generalized M5 method (MM5G) are compared with those of the Hershfield method, previously calculated based on the PMD data for 81 localities in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. The MM5G was applied using the available values of M5 and Cv. Results allow the recommendation of the use of MM5G to estimate predictions of PMD with Tr less than 100 years, in no-data sites in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. It is also recommended for estimations of PMP of 24 hours duration, remembering that such method underestimates less than 16.4%, with respect to the result of the Hershfield method, when the Cv is less than 0.251 and overestimates, of the order of 38.0% when the Cv exceeds 0.386.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shear stress transport k-omega turbulence model and structured grids are employed to assure the accuracy of the simulation, and the computational method is verified by the available experimental data. The influences of blow ratio, hole diameter, and the spacing between holes in each row are analyzed. The formation mechanism of backflow is discussed to prevent it from happening or relieve the degree of backflow, thereby to improve the cooling efficiency. The results showed that backflow can be avoided by adjusting the structure and the layout of film cooling holes. With increase in blow ratio, the cooling film becomes more obvious at first and then fades gradually for departing from the blade surface. The jet flow is influenced by the total pressure ratio between coolant cavity and surface of blade leading edge. Smaller film hole diameter and larger hole spacing makes it easier to eject coolant and form continuous film by slowing down the pressure in the cavity. Increasing ratio of hole spacing to hole diameter (p/d) can effectively prevent backflow, whereas larger p/d also makes the film coverage area smaller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"With the increase of radar signal bandwidth and the application of RF directing sampling technology, wideband radars are facing greater pressures for data transmission, storage, and processing. Based on the relationship between linear frequency modulation (LFM for short) signal and LFM-stepped signal, synthesis method of high-resolution range profile (HRRP for short) for LFM step signal can be applied to LFM signal. Combining the synthesis method of HRRP for LFM signal with compressed sensing theory, this study proposes a new compression method for wideband radar echo with LFM signal style based on random segment selection and analyses the constraint conditions of the proposed data compression method. Finally, the validity and practicability of the proposed data compression method are verified from two aspects: simulation experiment and actual data processing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"A flow-focusing microfluidic chip based on assembled capillary method is developed and the solid-core encapsulation behaviors of double emulsion in a flow-focusing microchannel are visually observed via high-speed microscopic imaging system. The experimental results identify the encapsulation of single, double and triple cores in a flow-focusing microchannel arising from the competition among the inertial force of inner phase, the shear force of outer phase fluid, and the interfacial tension. In addition, the solid-core encapsulation of double emulsion in flow-focusing microchannel is either in the stable state or in the transition state, depending on the flow rates of inner and outer phase fluid. The stable microencapsulation includes the stable single-core, double-cores and triple-cores encapsulation states, while the transition microencapsulation includes the single-double-cores and double-triple-cores transition encapsulation state. Irrespective of encapsulation state, the solid-core encapsulation process can be classified into four stages, including entering, neck stretch, neck shrinking and breakup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"The convection heat transfer of transient flow usually involves transient temperature and transient heat flux at the flow-wall interface. For experimental studies on this type of convection heat transfer problems, it is difficult to take measurement at the flow-wall interface, particularly for liquid flow. A substrate with small thickness can be used. One surface is exposed to the flow, while, on the free surface, there is a thin-skin heat source providing a constant and uniform heat flux, and the temperature at the free surface is measured using infrared thermography. Then the heat transfer coefficient of the transient flow can be obtained based on the temperature measured on the free surface. Two experimental tests of water droplets impacting a water film flow are conducted using this method. We solve a 1-D transient conduction problem, and the derived solution is used to calculate the heat transfer coefficient for the two experiments. Additionally, the lumped capacitance method (LCM) and the present analytical method are compared for calculating convection heat transfer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"The paper is devoted to an experimental investigation of nozzle vane heating in the last stage of a wet steam turbine. The investigation was performed at a steam-dynamic test facility whose circuit was connected to an operating cogeneration power station (TETs). The working fluid was steam from a heat extraction assembly of a steam turbine. To prepare a polydisperse wet steam flow specific for the last stages of steam turbines, a three-stage wetting system based on feedwater injection into the flow was used. The object of investigation is a flat vane cascade consisting of hollow vanes. The vane cavities are fed with superheated steam to provide heating. Experimental data are presented demonstrating that it is advisable to heat nozzle vanes: first, the economic characteristics are improved, and, second, erosion of the blades in the last stages decreases. This method can be used as an alternative to the internal moisture separation from the steam path. The experimental investigation yielded the effect of the temperature difference between the main flow and the heating steam on the amount of heat transferred to the main flow and on the steam conditions at the outlet from the heating chamber. It was found that condensation in the heating chamber decreased its outlet pressure. This should be considered in designing a similar active system to control erosion of rotor blades. The measured profile losses of kinetic energy downstream of the vane cascade for different temperature difference values are presented. The kinematic characteristics of the liquid phase downstream of the vane trailing edge are determined. Large temperature differences are found to have a negative effect on droplets and can reduce the erosion resistance of the blades as compared with profiles without any active erosion control methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"In many spatial cooperative vehicle networks, omni-directional communication is preferred due to its flexibility for networking. In the recent studies, space time code was shown to be an effective approach for improving the performance of the omni-directional communication between space vehicles. This paper studies the unified scheme for the orthogonal space time block code-based transmission between two space vehicles equipped with different numbers of antennas. It is obtained that at most six passive antennas and four RF chains are enough for the typical use. In the proposed scheme, the receiver can perform a unified detection procedure regardless of the actual number of the transmit antennas, which facilitates the practical application. Simulation results validate the proposed scheme in terms of the cumulative distribution function of the received signal-to-noise ratios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combined effects of bifurcation and stratification may lead to a substantially greater rise in temperature than the rise expected in case of unrestricted receiving body of water. In this study, the behavior of heated effluents discharged into bays with a restricted access to a large body of water is scrutinized experimentally by the help of a scaled physical model. Dimensional analysis leads to a new dimensionless parameter A(r), area restriction parameter, on which the difference between the excess temperatures at the inlet of the strait for restricted and free receiving mediums, Delta(Delta T/Delta T-0) is shown to be strongly dependent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"This work presents the evaluation of the downlink (DL) performance of a dual-layer cellular networks by using energy efficiency (EE) metric, where femto base stations (FBSs), macro base stations (MBSs) and users (FUs) form independent spatial Poisson point processes (PPPs). The proposed network model is developed by considering number of antennas at each BS alongside a single antenna at each user with the use of the conventional spectrum re-utilization approach. Then, Coverage probability and EE expressions for the dual-layer cellular networks are exclusively derived analytically. It is also demonstrated that simulation results are almost inline with the analytical one in the PPP-based model. While coverage probability deteriorates with less margin in the lower FBS density region compared to the scheme presented in Xu and Qiu [""Energy efficiency optimization for MIMO broadcast channels,"" IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., Vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 690-701, Feb. 2013.] signalled not much turnaround of the network performance, EE in the lower and the upper FBS density regions are likely to remain between to Bits/Joule and to Bits/Joule, respectively. Proposed scheme tells us that it is firmly on course to match up with Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANET) applications without incurring high cost as EE, low latency, coverage probability and low power adaptability are back on good growth path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,"Studies have shown that doping carbonates with silica destabilizes the liquid phase by reducing the temperature window over which the mixture resides in a molten state. This work demonstrates that liquid-phase disruption is caused by silicate formation in the melt due to reactions between carbonate and silica. These results were verified using differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis, all of which pointed to the same conclusion. The exact amount of silica produced was measured using DTA, which precisely matched the theoretical yield. These results are particularly relevant to the direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) when carbonate is used as an electrolyte and coal char is used as a fuel, given that silica is an abundant mineral in high-rank coals. In this situation, liquid-phase disruption would destabilize the carbonate electrolyte, thus having a deleterious impact on the DCFC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

78,"The first working telegraphs were built by several individuals in the 1830s and they began to be adopted into practical use in the 1840s prior to the laying of the first undersea telegraphic cable across the English Channel, before attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean. A string of subsequent failures on undersea cables led to an acceptance of a need to measure, accurately, the resistance of both the wire and insulation. Prior to 1860, there was no widely accepted system of electrical units or standards. This article gives an overview of the historical development of the Ohm as a unit. In Section I, we discuss the telegraphic communication. Section II considers electrical resistance, Section III reports on the work of the British Association (BA) Committee, and Sections IV and V discuss the recognition and subsequent developments.

79,"In this letter, we investigate a design of efficient antenna allocation at the full duplex receiver (FDR) in a multi-input multi-output multi-eavesdropper (MIMOME) wiretap channel for physical layer security improvement. Specifically, we propose the allocation which are feasible for the practical scenario with self-interference (SI) taken into account, because the jamming signals from FDR not only confuse the eavesdropper but also inevitably cause SI at the FDR. Due to the nolinear and coupling of the antenna allocation optimization problem, we transform the original problem into an integer programming problem. Then, we derive the optimal solution and the corresponding beamforming matrices in closed-form by means of combining spatial alignment and null-space projection method. Furthermore, we present the feasibility condition and full-protection condition, which offer insight into principles that enable more efficient and effective use of FDR in the wiretap channel for security improvement. From the simulation results, we validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed antennas allocation at FDR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,The soil is modeled as coupled elastoplastic to account for the elastic stiffness degradation during plastic yielding. In such model the irreversible strain rate results from a combination of a plastic part and a coupled part of strain rates. The former arises from plastic yielding and the latter is generated by the variation in the elastic stiffness. This leads to non associated and coupled flow rules in which the outward direction of the irreversible strain rate do not coincides neither with the outward normal to the yield surface nor the outward normal to the plastic potential. In this paper an extension of the static shakedown theorem to soil is proposed in the framework of the coupled elastoplasticity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,"The structural vibrations of a flat plate induced by fluctuating wall pressures within wall-bounded transonic jet flow downstream of a high-aspect ratio rectangular nozzle are simulated. The wall pressures are calculate using Hybrid RANS/LES CFD, where LES models the large-scale turbulence in the shear layers downstream of the nozzle. The structural vibrations are computed using modes from a finite element model and a time-domain forced response calculation methodology. At low flow speeds, the convecting turbulence in the shear layers loads the plate in a manner similar to that of turbulent boundary layer flow. However, at high nozzle pressure ratio discharge conditions the flow over the panel becomes transonic, and the shear layer turbulence scatters from shock cells just downstream of the nozzle, generating backward traveling low frequency surface pressure loads that also drive the plate. The structural mode shapes and subsonic and transonic surface pressure fields are transformed to wavenumber space to better understand the nature of the loading distributions and individual modal responses. Modes with wavenumber distributions which align well with those of the pressure field respond strongly. Negative wavenumber loading components are clearly visible in the transforms of the supersonic flow wall pressures near the nozzle, indicating backward propagating pressure fields. In those cases the modal joint acceptances include significant contributions from negative wavenumber terms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"This study considers censoring outliers in a radar scenario with limited sample support. The problem is formulated as obtaining the regularised maximum likelihood (RML) estimate of the outlier index set. Since the RML estimate involves solving a combinatorial optimisation problem, a reduced complexity but approximate RML (ARML) procedure is also devised. As to the selection of the regularisation parameter, the cross-validation technique is exploited. At the analysis stage, the performance of the RML/ARML procedure is evaluated based both on simulated and challenging knowledge-aided sensor signal processing and expert reasoning data, also in comparison with some other outlier excision methods available in the open literature. The numerical results highlight that the RML/ARML algorithm achieves a satisfactory performance level in the presence of limited as well as sufficient sample supports whereas the other counterparts often experience a certain performance degradation for the insufficient training volume.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"The article presents the influence of using REACH and LCA systems on the properties and functional parameters of a group of hazardous substances - explosive materials. The most commonly used explosives include dynamite and emulsion explosive materials. Dynamites are generally viewed as dangerous due to the content of nitroglycerin and nitroglycol, whereas emulsion explosive materials are considered safe in environmental terms. However, they have worse functional parameters related to the energy efficiency of the detonation process compared to dynamites. Undoubtedly, the application of REACH regulation will lead to reducing the use of environmentally hazardous substances. On the basis of this principle, an alternative composition of an explosive material consisting of a mixture of emulsion matrix and penthrite with the energy efficiency parameters comparable to those of dynamites was developed. The analysis of research results allows concluding that the criteria for substance qualification specified in REACH regulation are insufficient to thoroughly evaluate the safety of its use, and should be supplemented with LCA analysis elements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, metal tube testing for the detection of foreign objects requires a long testing time and considerable effort. Therefore, we proposed an original inspection method of a single metallic tube using electromagnetic wave reflection in the tube. However, for branched tubes, it is difficult to estimate the position of the clog by electromagnetic wave reflection. To evaluate the position of clog in the branched tubes, we proposed a new detection method using the group delay time in electromagnetic waves. The group delay time in electromagnetic waves is slightly affected by the bifurcation area. To verify the new method, the group delay time characteristics were measured in the branched tubes. The position of clog could be easily detected by the proposed method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

87,"Scaling down the size of transistor in the nanoscale reduces the power supply voltage, as a result, the design of high-performance nano-circuit at low voltage has been considered. Most of digital circuits are composed of different components which determine the performance of the entire digital circuits. With the improvement of these components, the digital circuits can be optimized. One of these components is full adder for which various structures have been proposed to improve its performance, among them the two novel full adder structures are based on Gate-Diffusion Input (GDI) structure and half-classical XOR/XNOR logic (SEMI XOR/XNOR) modules. In this paper, Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNTFET)-based low power full adders by using SEMI XOR logic style and GDI structure are presented. Due to the incomparable thermal and mechanical properties of the CNTFET, it can be the first alternative to substitute the metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFET). The digital circuits have the better performance based on CNTFET. Therefore, the three proposed full adders in this paper are designed based on CNTFET technology with many merits, such as low power dissipation, less energy delay product (EDP), and high speed at various supply voltages, frequencies, temperatures, load capacitors, and the number of tubes. Moreover, these proposed full adders occupy the minimum area consumption and have better performance in comparison with previous standard full adders. All simulations are done by using the Synopsys HSPICE simulator in 32 nm-CNTFET technology and layout of all full adder circuits are presented on Electric.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

91,"If a change of use for industrial land is proposed in the UK, there is usually a requirement to demonstrate that the change of use will not result in the land becoming Contaminated Land, as defined under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Under certain circumstances, this demonstration can be made by showing that the mean concentration of contaminants of potential concern is below a suitable assessment level appropriate to the proposed new use. How much sampling effort is required for this purpose? Using a relatively large dataset for arsenic in soil, a developed approach is presented to determining the number of measurements required for a clearance investigation to demonstrate absence of contamination based on minimising expectation of financial loss, taking into account both the actual cost of investigation and the possible cost of incorrectly determining that contamination is still present and undertaking unnecessary remediation, Abstract probabilities are discussed in terms of money spent and money potentially saved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earthquakes like Northridge 1994 showed that skewed angle in the bridge could lead to the failure of abutment and column because of the intensified demand for deck rotation around the vertical axis, especially in the near-fault zone. The present study attempted to examine how the skewed angle change affects the seismic response of curved and skewed bridges. To this end, a software model of two curved and skewed bridges verified through a field test was obtained. The results showed that the skewed angle change in far-fault zones has no significant effect on the seismic responses of these bridges, while in near-fault zones its effect is remarkable. In ramp bridges, the torsional force increases in the columns next to the abutment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One serious problem of datagram based traffic, however, is that highly restrictive firewalls prevent their traversal making Real Time Communication not possible. The alternative of transporting RTP on top of the Transport Control Protocol , while reliable, it is not effective as ever-present network packet loss introduces latency that degrades media quality and negatively affects user experience. In this paper, a scheme that relies on multiplexing media frames over multiple streams is proposed.

For this reason, formalised standards such as the 'ideal clinic' and 'national core standards' dictate expected service levels for clinics.

Service quality plays a huge role in the level of patient satisfaction, and emphasis is placed on the features of quality that are of importance to the patient.

96,"Design research projects are often more complex than initially perceived due to a requirement for novelty, the creativity inherent in the design process, and the limited experience of novice researchers. Also, expectations from institutions and external funding stakeholders must be met. Therefore, a framework was needed to support the research effort in the form of quality research management. The focus of this framework is primarily to align stakeholders. To this end, engineering management methods were consulted to define a quality research management framework that provides review baselines, requirements traceability, and a general process model. The framework is based on the well-known 'house of quality' principle that provides requirements traceability. A series of matrices was developed, with a research validation matrix resulting from the combination of traceability matrices. This matrix allows the allocation of research challenges to a need, concept solutions to research challenges, and specific research solutions to concept solutions. Also, information sources are allocated to challenges and solutions to verify their authenticity. It is thus possible to visualise clearly a summary of the research project. Additional benefits include improved communication, visualisastion of progress, traceability of requirements, and verification and validation, which illustrates the value of quality research management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the k-nearest neighbour algorithm is used to detect the birth of bird targets from measurements which is necessary to construct the birth intensity function. Second, the clustering algorithm is introduced into the probability hypothesis density filter framework to extract the bird targets' tracks from the filtering results. Third, an algorithm is added to detect the death of bird targets for better tracking. The Gaussian mixture implementation of the algorithm denoted as BT_GM_PHD (Bird Tracking GM_PHD) is presented.
