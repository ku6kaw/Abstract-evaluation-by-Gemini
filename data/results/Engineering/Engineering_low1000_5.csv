J,"Li, L; Ma, SY; Li, ZQ; Ruan, XG",Finite element analysis of the effects of additional load phase and amplitude on fretting wear,"Fretting wear is a major form of fretting damage involving various factors, such as material properties, surface roughness, surface topography, lubrication conditions, environment temperature, type of loading, and loading phase difference. In this study, ABAQUS is used to establish three models to simulate the variation of wear depth with the amplitude of additional load. The influence of the phase difference between additional load and original load is considered. Four phase difference angles are involved, i.e. 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. Results indicate that the rule of the variation of wear depth with the additional load amplitude increasing varies under different phase differences. It is observed that for the 0 degrees phase difference, the wear depth firstly decreases then increases with the increase of the additional load. However, the wear depth increases monotonously in the case of the 180 degrees phase difference. The variation of wear depth with additional load amplitude for 90 degrees phase difference is similar to that of the 270 degrees phase difference. The depth of wear is firstly kept at a relatively low level and then increases sharply, with the increase of the additional load. It is found that the distribution of shear stress and relative slip at the contact interface is also affected by the phase difference.",10.1177/1350650119851886,0,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no
J,"Li, X; Yang, L; Zhao, JW; Liu, Y; Sun, FZ",A bottom-feed omni-directional circularly polarized antenna array,"A bottom-feed omni-directional CP (circularly polarized) antenna array is proposed in this letter. The antenna array is composed of four elements (two printed ZPS (zero-phase-shift) line loops and two half-wavelength dipoles). The four elements are fed with the same phase and amplitude. The ZPS line loops provide the horizontal polarization while the dipoles provide the vertical polarization. Therefore, omni-directional circular polarization is formed in the far field. The feeding network consists of a 1-4 T-shaped power divider formed by parallel strip lines. In order to balance the amplitude of the feeding coaxial cable, the structure is used in the bottom to transfer parallel strip line to micro-strip line. Besides, the loops and the dipoles are placed on the different side of the network to guarantee the omni-directional radiation property. The measured impedance bandwidth of the fabricated antenna is 0.13 GHz (2.40-2.53 GHz) and the measured maximum CP gain at 2.45 GHz is 4.8 dBic.",10.1017/S1759078719000825,1,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Li, XH; Gao, R; Shen, T",Analysis of material motion characteristics of vertical nonlinear synchronous vibration dryer,"The nonlinear characteristics of a vertical dryer prototype under the synchronous excitation of vibration motors were analyzed. The vibration synchronization conditions of the two excitation motors of the vertical dryer were pursued. The analysis of motion characteristics of the material granules on the vertical dryer was conducted. The relationship between the structure parameters of the vertical dryer powered by two excitation motors and the motion characteristics of the material granules were discussed. Experimental results and discussion were used to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. This research demonstrated that the displacement of the material granules in the moving direction increased as the installment angle of the two excitation motors increased. This can improve the production efficiency; however, too large an installment angle destabilized the response of the dryer, no longer satisfying the design and use requirements. The research methods and conclusions presented in this paper can provide theoretical support and experimental basis for future development of a vibration dryer powered by two excitation motors.",10.1139/tcsme-2018-0247,2,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes

Here the phase diagram of the quaternary system Na+, K+/Cl-, CO32--H2O was experimentally studied at 298.15 K via the method of isothermal evaporation, and the results corrected the previous diagram reported by Blasdale (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1923, 45, 2935-2946). The type of salts appeared and their solubility during the evaporation, and the density vs composition diagram and the pH values were plotted based on the experimental data. It was found that there were six invariant points, seven univariant curves, and five crystallization fields in the equilibrium phase diagram. To extract single-salt of potassium, certain areas in the Na+, K+//C1-, C032 --H2O diagram were chosen to be acidified by the compressed CO2, and potassium in the form of KHCO3 was precipitated from the mother solution. The compressed CO2 was able to avoid formation of NaKCO3.6H2O during evaporation of the original system Na+, K+//C1-, CO32--H2O. Based on experiment data, the region area for potassium salt extraction was determined, and this area was suitable for extracting K+ salts from brines with a [Na+/ICl ratio even lower than 0.44.

We design in-vitro and in-vivo experiments to analyze the effect of genistein, quercetin and catechin on cell proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis of breast cancer cells. Methods: In cell proliferation experiment, MCF-7 cells, SKBR-3 cells, and HUVEC cells were treated with genistein and other flavonoids (catechin and/or quercetin) for 48 h to assess the influence on cell growth of normal and breast cancer cells. In cell motility test, we analyze the effect of isoflavone and flavonoids on migration ability of MCF-7 cells by 16 h and SKBR-3 cells by 24 h in two different concentrations (1.25 mu g/ml and 2.5 mu g/ml). In the in-vivo experiment, SKBR-3 cells mixed with PBS and catechin, respectively, were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, then we investigated the effect of catechin on cell growth by observing subcutaneous tumor size changes after 15 days. Results: The results suggest that genistein and quercetin can significantly inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells, and their inhibitory effects are independent of estrogen receptor. In cell motility tests, all of the three phytochemicals were effective in the inhibition of cell migration on two breast cancer cell lines, except for quercetin on cell migration of SKBR-3 cell line. In the in vitro experiment, catechin showed stimulatory effect on cell proliferation of HUVEC cell line, which may consider positive effect on angiogenesis, rather than inhibitory effect. However, in the in vivo experiment, it showed no significant change in tumor size between the groups of with and without catechin treatment. Conclusions: According to our study, the results suggest that isoflavone and flavonoids tend to inhibit cell growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Our in vivo experiment does not reach a significant result, and it may be due to lower catechin concentration. Under in vivo environment, we should also consider the possible metabolic forms of catechin that cause different result from the in vitro study.",10.4015/S1016237219500455,5,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

The light-weight steel frames are used to bear the vertical loads. The single-row-reinforced recycled concrete wall-boards are used as lateral members to resist most of the horizontal earthquake loads. The wall-board, EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) insulation modules, and fly ash blocks form the thermally insulated wall. Four fabricated lightweight steel frame-composite light wall structures and one light-weight steel frame (FRA) structure were tested under the low cyclic loads. The influence of wall reinforcement spacing and structural form (be it fly ash block or not) on the seismic performance of this new structure was analysed and the damage process of the specimen was simulated using the ABAQUS (R) software. The results show that the light steel frames and the single-row-reinforced recycled concrete wall-board can work well together. Furthermore, the structure has two clear seismic lines. Due to the use of EPS insulation modules and fly ash blocks, the structure has good anti-seismic and thermal insulation abilities. Reducing the spacing of bars or compositing fly ash blocks can significantly improve the seismic performance of the structure.

J,"Liu, Y; Zhou, A; Yuan, LB",High sensitivity directional torsion sensor based on cascaded multimode and Mach-Zehnder interferometers with spiral structure,"An ultra-high sensitivity directional torsion sensor by hybrid cascaded configuration is proposed. The cascaded structure are composed of a multimode interference (MMI) employing multimode fiber (MMF) and a Mach-Zehnder interference (MZI) employing triangular four core fiber (TFCF) with a spiral structure. Under the condition of continuous arc discharge, the spiral structure is realized by torquing TFCF. The spiral structure assisted the MZI has the ability to sense torsion and identify the direction. The ultra-high torsion sensitivity is due to the modified Vernier-effect, which is generated due to the spatial frequency difference between the MMI and MZI. The MMI acts as the reference interferometer, and the MZI with spiral structure act as the sensing interferometer. We used the Gaussian function to filter out the envelope frequency component. The inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is used to recover the envelope spectrum. The values of sensitivity magnification can be tuned by changing the length of the TFCF. The proposed configuration are applied for high-sensitive directional twisted sensor with a sensitivity of 0.8916 nm rad(-1) m(-1) over the range of -20.94 rad m(-1) to 13.96 rad m(-1). Moreover, the proposed sensor exhibits a low temperature cross-sensitivity is 0.166 (rad/m)/degrees C in the range of 40 degrees C-140 degrees C.",10.1088/2631-8695/ab5833,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Liu, ZY; Zhang, WP; Cui, F; Gu, LT",Micro-manufacturing technology of a three-dimensional curved surface diamond structure for gyroscope applications,"A novel three-dimensional (3D) micro-manufacturing technology of a curved surface diamond structure used for a micro birdbath resonator gyroscope (mu-BRG) with integrated curved electrodes is presented. The integrated curved electrodes with the same curvature as the birdbath shell are embedded using a self-aligned process, which avoids the extra assembly process, ensures the symmetry and improves the driving capacity of the mu-BRG. The capacitive gap is defined by the sacrificial layer, and a uniform and small gap distance (2 mu m) between the curved electrodes and the birdbath shell is obtained. The mu-BRGs with a diameter of 1.2 mm and a thickness of 2 mu m have been demonstrated by employing boron-doped microcrystalline diamond films deposited using hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD). In this paper, the device structure and basic working principle of the gyroscope are described. The key steps in the fabrication process, such as isotropic wet etching of the bulk silicon for a birdbath mold, photoresist spray-coating for patterning the curved electrodes, and deposition and etching of diamond films, are considered in detail and well solved. The radial deviation of the etched birdbath mold is about 0.31% for the similar to 560 mu m radius shell and the surface roughness of the birdbath mold is favorable (Rq = 4.933 nm, Ra = 3.945 nm).

The model uses the Lattice-Boltzmann method to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for hydrodynamics and the finite volume method to solve the convection-diffusion equation for solute particles. Concentration polarisation is modelled for micro-particles by having the diffusion coefficient defined as a function of particle concentration and shear rate.

J,"Loktionov, AP",Numerical Differentiation in the Measurement Model,"The problems of increasing the accuracy of numerical differentiation in the measurement model are investigated. We consider the measurements of target characteristics of an object that are not directly measurable, and also the reduction of measurements using the example of determining derivatives and initial parameters in the Cauchy problem. We clarify the relationship between the initial parameters of the differential dependencies and particular solutions of the differential equation of the Cauchy problem at the measurement points of the input quantities of the measurement model. Using the example of determining the derivatives in the Cauchy problem, we note the efficiency of the Lagrangian approximation of the functions of the input and output quantities of the measurement model. It is shown that the maximum accuracy of the approximation of the studied characteristics of the object is attainable using the theory of inverse problems. The following scientific results were obtained: assuming the form of the differential equation for the Cauchy problem, particular solutions of the equation are found; using a polynomial approximation, we compute the function of the measurement model input parameters measured by the sensors; we derive formulas for computing the derivatives of the function of input quantities; by the method of measurement reduction, an approximation grid is determined that minimizes the influence of sensor error. We propose a criterion for estimating the efficiency of solving the measurement reduction problem. Formulas are obtained for estimating the level of error in the derivatives of the function of the input quantities, taking into account the given sensor error. It was shown that the experimental results are consistent with the theoretical ones.

The electrolysis analysis on the presence of several media would minimize the preparation steps on wastewater utilization for generating hydrogen as renewable energy. The research looks at the potential of wastewater as the raw material for the electrolysis process. In this research, stainless steel cyclic voltammograms were studied on water electrolysis.

J,"Luo, LL; Guo, DK; Xu, J; Luo, XS",Graph Filter: Enabling Efficient Topology Calibration,"The topology of a network may change inevitably, due to dynamic behaviors of nodes and links, and failures of hardware and software. Many protocols and applications must be aware of the up-to-date topology of the underlying network. This triggers the <italic>topology calibration</italic> problem, which means to deduce those different nodes and links between two topologies. The Bloom filter and its variants are efficient to represent and calibrate two general sets. They, however, fail to represent all links and nodes in a topology simultaneously, and thus remain inapplicable to the <italic>topology calibration</italic> problem. In this paper, we design the graph filter, a novel space-efficient data structure to record not only the node set but also the link set of any given topology. Accordingly, given two topologies we aim to represent them via two respective graph filters, and thereafter deduce those different links in an invertible manner. To this end, we design three essential operations for graph filter, i.e., encoding, subtracting and decoding. Although such operations are sufficient to solve the topology calibration problem, two challenging issues still remain open. First, the <italic>XOR traps</italic> which occur with low probability at the encoding stage may result in a few miscalculations at the decoding stage. Thus, we propose another augmented decoding algorithm to lessen the impact of <italic>XOR traps</italic> via terminating illegal decodings. Second, several different links may form cycles in the worst case; hence, we further design a cycle destruction algorithm to make such different links decodable. We implement the graph filter and the associated topology calibration method.

Usually the decision maker seeks technical advice and has to consider the resources available. A literature review showed great limitations in the tools that are today in use. This paper presents the implementation of a decision support methodology to prioritize repairs in rubble-mound breakwaters using MACBETH. Models for the benefits of repairing breakwaters, which are based on visual inspection data only, were created, and an expert meeting was held-the decision conference-following MACBETH. As outputs, the criteria, the value functions, and the weights to obtain scores were generated. Yet, using the condition indices set for the different levels of analysis of the breakwater, the decision maker will decide whether and how to intervene. The analysis uses MACBETH for calculating the scores and considers the benefits of the interventions in the armor layer for a breakwater divided into reaches. Costs and benefits are used afterward to prioritize the interventions. The common issue of the limited budget available is solved by applying portfolio-set of interventions-creation methods. The Ericeira rubble-mound breakwater (Portugal), which shows some signs of deterioration, was selected as a case study to illustrate the methodology. Interesting enough, the use of this new methodology shows what are the reaches that must be repaired in the very first place, which was not evident when using conventional analysis.

J,"McManus, TN; Haddad, A",Ventilation Induced in an Isolated Subsurface Structure by Natural Forces: Method Development and Application,"It is believed that isolated subsurface structures of an infrastructure do not ventilate through opening(s) in manhole covers. The literature has almost no information on this topic. This study reports on considerations involved in the development and utilization of a method to study this question. Carbon monoxide (CO) is readily obtainable in engine exhaust, easily detectable at very low concentration, and is relatively safe to handle, which makes it ideal for use as a tracer gas. Transfer into the airspace of the structure was carried out using metal tubing. This study examined the engine operating time and the number of openings in a manhole cover. CO was measured using four instruments in the vertical profile. It was found to generally decrease in a narrow band, initially linearly through a curvilinear region and a linear tail.

To achieve this, the equivalence ratio was fixed at 0.73, while the CO2 mole fraction was varied from 0 to 10%. The wall interaction model was used based on the Mundo-Sommerfeld model. In addition, the results of peak cylinder pressure, ignition delay, IMEP, NO distributions, and soot distributions were compared. The ignition delay was longer and the peak cylinder pressure was decreased with the increasing CO2 mole fraction because the evaporation of the injected fuel deteriorated. Moreover, when the CO2 mole fraction was increased to 5%, the ISNO values decreased to 55% owing to the high specific heat of CO2. Furthermore, the ISSoot values increased by 10% because the oxidation of soot does not occur well by low temperatures.",10.3795/KSME-B.2019.43.12.839,21,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no

The combination of active and inactive base stations (BS) that allows for maximizing EE is identified as a combinatorial learning problem and requires high computational complexity as well as a large signaling overhead. This paper aims at presenting a learning policy that dynamically switches a BS to ON or OFF status in order to follow the traffic load variation during the day. The network traffic load is represented as a Markov decision process, and we propose a modified upper confidence bound algorithm based on restless Markov multi-armed bandit framework for the BS switching operation. Moreover, to cope with initial reward loss and to speed up the convergence of the learning algorithm, the transfer learning concept is adapted to our algorithm in order to benefit from the transferred knowledge observed in historical periods from the same region. Based on our previous work, a convergence theorem is provided for the proposed policy. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms follow the traffic load variation during the day and contribute to a performance jump-start in EE improvement under various practical traffic load profiles. It also demonstrates that proposed schemes can significantly reduce the total energy consumption of cellular network, e.g., up to 70% potential energy savings based on a real traffic profile.",10.1186/s13634-019-0637-1,24,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

It involves third party to do the data analysis that endangers the privacy of the data. Hence, along with efficient real time analysis of data, privacy of the data also needs a careful attention. In this paper, we discuss the problem of linking attack in the data releases. We show the attack due to the linking of social media data with relational sensitive database discloses the sensitive information about a social entity. Though the data releases don't contain Identifiers (IDs) information like Name, Social Security Number (SSN), etc., linking attack is still possible through the combination of background knowledge with Quasi-Identifiers (QIDs) information like age, sex, etc. The solution encourages the release of anonymized relational sensitive database that obstruct the linking with other databases like social media data. Anonymization is a way to transform the original data to an anonymized version, such that the linkage between the sensitive information of an entity is dissociated from his/her identity. Most of the anonymity models are based on the concept of k-anonymity and l-diversity. In this paper, we present an extensive study on Greedy based heuristics.

J,"Mollaei, M; Ghassemi, H",Numerical investigation of cold flow over regular and wavy V-gutters,"In this paper, the numerical study of cold flow over two types of regular and wavy V-gutter flame holders has been presented. The edges of the V-gutter, which are smooth in the regular case, are shaped in a sinusoidal form with different phase angles on upper and lower edges. The three-dimensional numerical analysis has been performed using the finite volume method and the renormalization group k-e model has been used for turbulence modeling. The results were compared and validated by an existing experimental work based on the particle image velocimetry method. This study provided the fluid flow structure behind the V-gutter, the dimensions of the recirculation region, the behavior of vortex shedding phenomenon, and the static pressure distribution in the wake area. According to the results, the recirculation length for the sinusoidal case with 90 degrees of the phase difference is the largest compared with the other cases, which increases the mass flow rate of the fresh unburnt mixture into the recirculation region and improves flame stability. The results also show that the 90 degrees wavy V-gutter case has the lowest pressure drop in the wake region, which reduces the drag coefficient against the main flow. The values of the Strouhal number are approximately the same and equal to 0.27 for both cases (the regular and the 90 degrees cases). Therefore, it is concluded that the 90 degrees wavy V-gutter shows better performance than the regular V-gutter in flame stabilization.",10.1177/0954410019852560,28,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no

Therefore, in this work, a theoretical-experimental hybrid method for calculating the natural frequencies and the mode shapes, at rest and non-supported conditions, of a turbocharger rotor is proposed. Firstly, a discrete model of low number of degrees of freedom is considered, and from an oversampled modal approach (OSMA) based on the axial oversampling, sectioning and coupling of the rotor, it is possible to use the oversampled mode shapes to increase the degrees of freedom of the system without major complications in the model. This spatial oversampling criterion is based on the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, and it is used to reduce the error in the estimates of the natural frequencies and to get a first approximation of the mode shapes.

J,"Newton, MAH; Riahi, V; Sattar, A",Makespan preserving flowshop reengineering via blocking constraints,"Blocking constraints are ubiquitous in machine scheduling. In a flowshop scenario, a machine might get blocked by a job that has just been processed by the same machine. This happens when there is no buffer where the job can temporarily go before the next machine is available to process it. This also happens when two successive machines depend on a mutually exclusive resource to process the same job. In this paper, we show that under certain conditions, two successive machines operating under blocking constraints involving mutually exclusive resources can virtually be treated as a joint machine. Before performing search, we then use this makespan preserving property in reengineering a permutation flowshop. The reengineered flowshop model can actually be used by any arbitrary search algorithm to improve efficiency. We show an example of machine conjoining in the waste treatment industry. We also empirically show that such reengineering helps state-of-the-art flowshop search algorithms obtain significantly better makespan values than when the original model is used. Flowshop reengineering is appealing particularly because it helps obtain a higher abstraction level and any search algorithm can use it as a preprocessing step.

First of all, it is illustrated by a case without the installation of a trip wire that small disturbance developed in the accelerating phase of pulsation, which was well explained by the inflection-point instability mechanism Subsequently, one of the cases studied with the installation of a trip wire indicates that the inflection-point instability mechanism still played the key role, but the instability was promoted further upstream. On the other hand, there were cases of which the flow instability development was rather due to the viscous effect mainly which was decaying in a certain downstream region, followed by a renewal growth with irregular fluctuations.",10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2019.109869,45,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no
J,"Nicholson, AW","2016 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Chemistry presented to Nadrian Charles Seeman, Ph.D.","The ability to design and build complex structures at the nanoscale level with programmable functions is revolutionizing the fields of biomedicine, bioengineering, and materials sciences. DNA, the genetic material of life, has long been known to carry the instructions for the structures and assembly of the biomolecules of cells and organisms. DNA also undergoes accurate replication in conjunction with the creation of new cells. The genetic instructions in the linear strands of DNA are in the form of specific sequences, comprised of the four nucleic acid bases: A, T, G, and C. Two DNA strands can spontaneously associate to form a double-helical structure that is stabilized by the pairing of A with T, and G with C in the interacting strands. Nadrian Seeman had an original vision that regarded DNA not as just the genetic information carrier, but as material for the creation of complex functional architectures at the nanoscale level. He did so by exploiting the ability of DNA strands to spontaneously associate, forming specific stable structures, according to the nucleic acid base sequences and pairing rules. Starting with short synthetic DNA molecules, Dr. Seeman was able to construct relatively simple geometric objects, including a cube and a truncated octahedron. He then developed small DNA structures (""tiles"") that exhibited enhanced rigidity and could act as stable building blocks that could interact in a programmed manner to form large, regular, two-dimensional arrays. These studies inspired the creation of more complicated DNA building blocks that could self-assemble to create three-dimensional ordered DNA structures, akin to regular crystals. Seeman's pioneering investigations attracted other investigators within and outside the field of biochemistry, including physicists and computer scientists, resulting in many collaborations that demonstrated the computational capacity and programmed mechanical action of DNA nanostructures. DNA nanostructures are now being employed as devices to deliver drugs, detect disease biomarkers, probe cell function, and even as ""molecular foundries"" for the construction of hitherto inaccessible assemblages of atoms and molecules with potential practical applications.",10.1016/j.jfranklin.2019.11.023,46,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,
J,"Niknam, A; Farhang, K",Friction-Induced Vibration in a Bi-Stable Compliant Mechanism,"This paper investigates friction-induced self-excited vibration in a bi-stable compliant mechanism. A single-degree-of-freedom oscillator, hanged vertically, vibrates on a belt moving horizontally with a constant velocity. The oscillator is excited through the frictional input provided by the belt. The friction coefficient is defined as an exponentially decaying function of the sliding velocity. Due to the specific configuration of spring and damper, the normal contact force is variable. Therefore, the friction force is a function of the system states, namely, slider velocity and position. Employing eigenvalue analysis gives an overview of the local stability of the linearized system in the vicinity of each equilibrium point. It is shown that the normal force, spring pre-compression and belt velocity are bifurcation parameters. Since the system is highly nonlinear, a local analysis does not provide enough information about the steady-state response. Therefore, the oscillating system is studied numerically to attain a global qualitative picture of the steady-state response. The possibility of the mass-belt detachment and overshoot are studied. It is shown that one equilibrium point is always dominant. In addition, three main questions, i.e., possible mass-belt separation, location of stick-slip transition and overshoot are answered. It is proven that the occurrence of overshoot is impossible.",10.3390/vibration2040018,47,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no
J,"Nocetti, D; Crimi, M; Rossner, A",Sampling strategies in the assessment of long-term exposures to toxic substances in air,"The decision to mitigate exposures from vapor intrusion (VI) is typically based on limited data from 24-hour air samples. It is well documented that these data do not accurately represent long-term average exposures linked to adverse health effects. Limited decision guidance is currently available to determine the most appropriate sampling strategy, considering the cost of sampling alternatives along with the economic consequences of exposure-related health effects. We present a decision model that introduces economic and statistical considerations in evaluating alternative VI sampling methods. The model characterizes the best sampling method by factoring economic and health consequences of exposure, the variability of exposure, the cost of sampling and mitigation, and the likelihood of false-negatives and false-positives. Decision-makers can use results to select the sample size that maximizes net benefit. Conceptual and mathematical models are presented linking biological, statistical, and economic considerations to assess the cost and effectiveness of different sampling strategies. The model relates an average exposure concentration, determined statistically, to abatement costs and to the monetary value of health deterioration. The value of the information provided by different strategies is calculated and used to select the optimum sampling method. Simulations show that longer-term sampling methods tend to be more accurate and cost-effective than short-term samples. The ideal sampling strategy shows significant seasonal variation (it is typically optimal to use longer samples in the winter) and also varies significantly with the stringency of regulatory standards. Longer-term sample collection provides a more accurate representation of average VI exposure and reduces the likelihood of type I and type II errors. This reduces expected costs of mitigation and exposure (e.g., health consequences, legal and regulatory penalties), which in some cases can be quite significant. The model herein shows how these savings are balanced against the additional costs of longer-term sampling.",10.1002/rem.21633,48,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

The implementation of modern control schemes for this nonlinear system has been subject of scientific publications for years. In contrast, state of the art for serial operation is a relatively simple gain-scheduling structure based on PID controllers and stationary feedforward control. This paper presents a concept for controlling boost pressure which is suitable for series production and its experimental evaluation on a test bench. The applied control structure corresponds largely to the state of the art, though the feedforward control was significantly simplified and an anti-windup concept for systematic consideration of manipulated variable saturations was supplemented. The systematic model-based procedure used for H-infinity-optimal design of structured operating point controllers should be noted. Using H-infinity-optimal controllers enables a priori inclusion of quantitative requirements for the behavior of the resulting local control loops during the design process. The underlying controller design procedure allows linear controllers of any structure. Thereby H-infinity-optimal parameterization of control structures being in use and accepted by application-oriented engineers becomes possible. The calculation of controller parameters is done reliably by solving non-convex and non-smooth optimization problems using published methods. The mathematical system descriptions required for the model-based controller design are obtained by identifying linear time-invariant setpoint systems. Experimental results clearly show the performance of the proposed control concept in comparison to a conventionally parameterized boost pressure control. In contrast to the conventional procedure for parameterization based on expert knowledge and road tests, the design process presented is characterized by a structured, methodical and theoretically sound procedure. The resulting design process is largely automated and significantly reduces resource and time requirements.",10.1007/s10010-019-00340-x,49,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

A concave curved boundary was designed, which allowed the spatial descent moving of cells and the change in spatial distributions of co-cultured cells. We utilized the difference in cell motility between myoblast cells (C2C12) and neuronal cells (PC12) to demonstrate the feasibility of spontaneous change in spatial cell density. Without the curved boundaries, high motility cells (C2C12) did not migrate to the adjacent area, which resulted in a slight temporal change (< 15%) in the spatial cell distribution. In contrast, with the curved boundaries, the cell density of the high motility cells in the groove to those cells on the ridge showed an increase exceeding 45%. On the other hand, the temporal change in the spatial cell distribution of low motility cells (PC12) was below 15% with or without the curved boundaries. In addition, as groove width increased, both cells displayed more initially gathering in groove. Importantly, these cell-type dependent results were also maintained under co-culture conditions.

The accuracy of the marginals depends crucially on the quality of the submodular extension. To identify accurate extensions for different classes of energy functions, we establish a relationship between the submodular extensions of the energy and linear programming (LP) relaxations for the corresponding MAP estimation problem. This allows us to (i) establish the worst-case optimality of the submodular extension for Potts model used in the literature; (ii) identify the worst-case optimal submodular extension for the more general class of metric labeling; (iii) efficiently compute the marginals for the widely used dense CRF model with the help of a recently proposed Gaussian filtering method; and (iv) propose an accurate submodular extension based on an LP relaxation for a higher-order diversity model. Using synthetic and real data, we show that our approach provides comparable upper bounds on the log-partition function to those obtained using tree-reweighted message passing (TRW) in cases where the latter is computationally feasible.

J,"Paris-Garcia, F; Ruiz-Zafra, A; Noguera, M; Barroso-Caro, A",FLEXOR: A support tool for efficient and seamless experiment data processing to evaluate musculo-articular stiffness,"Background and objective: The evaluation of musculo-articular stiffness (MAS) is an increasingly demanded procedure with applications in different fields, such as sports performance and lower limbs injury prevention. However, this task is non-automated, time-consuming and error-prone due to manual handling of data streams and files across several software applications. Despite the fact that process automation of validated procedures helps to prevent errors, there is still a lack of easy-to-use tools for analysis, management and visualization of MAS trials. Methods: In the present work a tool called FLEXOR has been developed which applies mathematical methods and novel algorithms to automatically adjust curves of data streams for MAS analysis decreasing substantially time employed and errors. This tool permits to define different adjustment parameters, detect curve peaks and valleys, and display the results on the fly. FLEXOR has been implemented through a component-based software development (CBSD) process. All physiological fundamentals for the biomechanical measurement have been included in the tool developed. To describe the integration of all required components a 4 + 1 view model architecture has been used. The installation guide, the FLEXOR software and some data samples can be found on its GitHub repository (https://github.com/FlexorSoftware/flexor). Results: A multiplatform software tool to simplify traditional complex and manual procedures for MAS analysis is obtained. The tool turns them into a simple all-in-one procedure, reducing processing times from hours to a few minutes. The methodology was tested on multiple datasets generated by previous tools in former procedures as well as on real-time trials in the laboratory, showing identical results. Conclusion: The results show that the developed tool can accomplish an unfilled essential task in the analysis, management and visualization of MAS measurement. The presented software tool empowers analysts to handle the different studies, investigate different parameters related to each experiment and even test with different output parameters in each experiment, enabling real-time trials and shared studies between different analysts.

The sensitivity of these instruments varies with time; thus, periodic standard absolute calibrations are required. However, standard calibrations may be insufficient to characterize the short-term variations of channels sensitivity. Therefore, results from standard calibrations have to be combined with the information derived from frequent relative calibrations, leading to a stable irradiance scale. This paper focuses on the long-term application of three calibration methods, hereinafter referred to as CC, CC2, and CC2(phi), as applied to the NILU-UV 119 multifilter radiometer. Here a generalization is proposed, consisting of using empirical functions in order to guarantee the accurate calibration of multifilter instruments over long time periods. These function-based methods need to be updated regularly to account for changes on instrument sensitivity. The changes in sensitivity of the NILU-UV 119 were found to be channel dependent. The detected drifts range from 23% to 42% for a 4-yr period of study. Time series of calibrated irradiance are obtained by applying the proposed methods. Results suggest that calibration methods using empirical functions perform better than classic calibration approaches that use constant calibration factors.

Some of them include additional analog circuits, while the others are based on different numerical procedures. One commonly used software solution is Progressive Polynomial Approximation. This method for sensor transfer function linearization shows strong dependence on the order of selected nodes in the linearization vector. There are several modifications of this method which enhance its effectiveness but require extensive computational time. This paper proposes the methodology that shows improvement over Progressive Polynomial Approximation without additional increase of complexity. It concerns the order of linearization nodes in linearization vector. The optimal order of nodes is determined on the basis of sensor transfer function concavity.

An investigation of areas susceptible to landslides is necessary in order to institute policies to reduce the impact of landslide and to ensure the safety of tourists. In this study, two-dimensional electrical resistivity imaging (2D-ERI) was applied and slope stability modelling was conducted to investigate the sliding surface and the thickness of the sliding mass in a study area which is prone to landslide during intense and prolonged rainfall. The result of the 2D-ERI was used to validate the result of a simulation of the slope stability to determine the landslide sliding surface and the thickness of the sliding mass based on rising piezometric head due to rainfall. Further, the model geometry of the slope stability was reconstructed using the 2D-ERI data, and the simulation was repeated. The result for the factor of safety (FS) when the piezometric head was rising was found to have been overestimated in the original simulation Therefore, the reconstruction of the model geometry is essential to avoid the over-estimation of the FS in slope stability modelling in conditions of rising piezometric head.",,67,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

J,"Rahman, MM; Islam, MK",Determination of Virgin Compression Destructuring Line Parameters for Natural Clays,"Based on the destructuring framework proposed by Liu et al. (2015) preceded by the work by Liu and Carter (1999, 2000), the virgin compression destructuring behavior of fifteen natural soil published in various literature over the last seven decades in several locations around the globe have been studied. Two methods (i.e., graphical and two reference point approach) to determine the parameters used in the equation of compression destructuring line (CDL) are proposed and examined by simulating the experimental data. Also, a systematic approach to find the yield pressure is suggested. The study concluded that CDL parameters obtained from graphical approach successfully predicted the compression behaviors of structured soil for most of the soil samples. Nonconformity occurs in case of two reference point approach in some cases. The two reference point approach is very helpful for a quick approximation of the CDL parameters because of its simplicity. Theoretically, two reference point method should be independent of the selection of the two point sets and always yield the same parameters but due to the uncertainty of the precision of experimental data, it varied. The author used and suggested a universal by taking furthest two points on the destructuring compression data as references. Also, the analytical approach to locate the yield pressure point is found very helpful.

J,"Raj, A; Kant, D; Bandyopadhyay, AK; Joshi, LM",Optimization of grooved klystron collector design for efficient heat transfer,"Klystron microwave amplifiers play a vital role in addressing the increasing demands of high-average microwave power for strategic applications such as linear accelerators, active denial technologies, radar, and so forth. Typically, klystrons have an efficiency of 50%-60% that demands an efficient thermal design for dissipating the unused DC power in the form of spent electron beam in collector. Hence, thermal modeling of the collector for efficient heat dissipation is highly critical in design of high average power klystrons. Of several types of design, grooved collector design is widely employed so as to increase the surface area between the collector and coolant and thereby enhance heat transfer. In this article, a mathematical model and design strategy have been demonstrated to obtain the optimum dimensions, that is, height, depth, and width of fins based on film coefficient and Reynolds number. For validation, the dimensions are then simulated in a computational fluid dynamics software (ANSYS-Fluent) demonstrating excellent agreement with the mathematical modeling. In addition, the optimum choice of grooving method (longitudinal or crossed) for the given power level has also been provided. The demonstrated strategy can also potentially be employed to other devices, which uses groove based design with water as coolant medium such as gyrotrons, plasma devices, and so forth.",10.1002/mmce.21950,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Ranawaka, P; Ekpanyapong, M; Tavares, A; Dailey, M; Athikulwongse, K; Silva, V",High Performance Application Specific Stream Architecture for Hardware Acceleration of HOG-SVM on FPGA,"Conventional sequential processing on software with a general purpose CPU has become significantly insufficient for certain heavy computations due to the high demand of processing power to deliver adequate throughput and performance. Due to many reasons a high degree of interest could be noted for high performance real time video processing on embedded systems. However, embedded processing platforms with limited performance could least cater the processing demand of several such intensive computations in computer vision domain. Therefore, hardware acceleration could be noted as an ideal solution where process intensive computations could be accelerated using application specific hardware integrated with a general purpose CPU. In this research we have focused on building a parallelized high performance application specific architecture for such a hardware accelerator for HOG-SVM computation implemented on Zynq 7000 FPGA. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) technique combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier is versatile and extremely popular in computer vision domain in contrast to high demand for processing power. Due to the popularity and versatility, various previous research have attempted on obtaining adequate throughput on HOG-SVM. This research with a high throughput of 240 FPS on single scale on VGA frames of size 640x480 out performs the best case performance on a single scale of previous research by approximately a factor of 3-4. Further it's an approximately 15x speed up over the GPU accelerated software version with the same accuracy. This research has explored the possibility of using a novel architecture based on deep pipelining, parallel processing and BRAM structures for achieving high performance on the HOG-SVM computation. Further the above developed (video processing unit) VPU which acts as a hardware accelerator will be integrated as a co-processing peripheral to a host CPU using a novel custom accelerator structure with on chip buses in a System-On-Chip (SoC) fashion. This could be used to offload the heavy video stream processing redundant computations to the VPU whereas the processing power of the CPU could be preserved for running light weight applications.

S-Ge/Si semiconductor (as known as low tensile strained Ge grown on Si substrate) has a higher carrier mobility when compared with unstrained-Ge or Si material, so that s-Ge/Si is appropriate for the production of high-speed circuit. At the same time, transformation from indirect bandgap semiconductor Ge into Pseudo-Direct bandgap semiconductor (which is also called PD-Ge) will be happen after s-Ge/Si is heavy doped, which makes LED produced of PD-Ge material perform a higher luminous efficiency because the radiative recombining probability of carriers in PD-Ge material is greatly improved compared with unstrained one. Taking the advantages referred of s-Ge/Si into account, s-Ge/Si has the potential to PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration. Carrier mobility of the semiconductor is one of the key physical parameters during the design and simulation of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integrated system. While as far as the authors are aware, carrier mobility model of s-Ge/Si is still rarely reported to date. In view of that all above, based on the E-k relation in both conduction band and valence band of s-Ge/Si material, the analytical models of physical parameters in energy band are established, and the models are verified by experiments. Then the s-Ge/Si carrier models are further established based on our band structure model, and the Monte Carlo method is used to verify our s-Ge/Si carrier mobility model. The quantificational results of our paper will help understand s-Ge/Si material physics and provide an important theoretical basis for the design of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration.",10.1166/jno.2019.2685,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experimental set-up consists of a three-phase induction machine, used as a transient a.c. dynamometer, and non-regenerative frequency inverter connected to an internal combustion engine. Coupling the engine to the dynamometer is by a low stiffness PA-6 nylon shaft with magnetic pickups at its ends. The sensors phase are zero when torque in PA-6 nylon shaft is null, adjusted in static conditions and engine/dynamometer turned off. Contactless torque measurement occurs by magnetic pickup phase difference during PA-6 nylon shaft torsion promoted by engine in operation. Engine speed is measurement by frequency of magnetic pickup signal. PA-6 nylon shaft torsion promotes a misalignment between sensors phase, proportional to torque application in both direction.The electronic capture unit using pulse train rising edge detection measures this phase change (time shift) in pulses. An embedded microcontroller development kit acquires the time-shifted pulses. This board has circuits for A/D signal conditioning, pulse width modulate channels, and a specific circuit for magnetic pickups signals conditioning, which can measure less then 0.09 Nm resolution, taking 96 time-shifts values. The design and implementation of all embedded electronics and data acquisition system follows electromagnetic compatibility premises, which have resulted in an adequate signal-to-noise ratio so that common and differential mode noises have not edges with amplitude approximately equal to the output magnetic sensors signals.

J,"Shemtov-Yona, K; Özcan, M; Godinger, A; de Basso, N; Rittel, D",Random spectrum fatigue of zirconia oral implants in air and saline solution,"Zirconia oral implants are increasingly considered as an alternative to metallic (titanium) ones, mostly for their aesthetic properties and their metal free composition that enables soft tissue integration. We report a systematic comparison of the fatigue performance of oral implants of identical geometry, made of partially stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) and titanium as a reference group, using random spectrum fatigue testing in both air and saline solution. The spectrum data clearly points unequivocally to the operation of a fatigue (damage accumulation) failure mechanism in the zirconia implants. Saline solution reduces the quasi-static fracture strength. It also causes a marked degradation of their spectrum fatigue longevity, but it does not affect their spectrum fatigue fracture strength. Given that the quasi-static fracture strength of the tested implants is smaller in saline solution than in air, the results suggest that the maximum admissible design loads for spectrum loaded zirconia oral implants are of the order of 0.8 times their wet (saline) quasi-static fracture strength.",10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.104160,90,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Shen, Y; Viehmann, A; Rinderknecht, S",Investigation of the power losses of the hybrid transmission DE-REX based on modeling and measurement,"Electric and hybrid powertrains are developed to reduce the energy and fuel consumption of vehicles. Recently, multi-speed transmission systems were discussed for further reduction of the energy consumption of electric vehicles. Therefore, analyzing the power losses of such transmissions is of interest. In this paper, the novel powertrain concept DE-REX (Two-Drive-Transmission with Range-Extender) and the experimental investigation of its overall power losses is first introduced. A method is then developed to model and analyze the power losses of this hybrid transmission based on experimental data. After the validation of the method, the overall power loss model is eventually applied to estimate the power losses of the transmission at other driving modes, which were not measured on the test rig. The method is used to understand the characteristics of power losses inside the transmission in a hybrid powertrain and to optimize powertrain power losses in future.",10.1177/0954407019829655,91,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes

To achieve high strength and drop weight tearing test properties for heavy wall X70 spiral linepipes, the microstructure refinement of bainitic ferrite is essential in hot-rolled steel coils. Niobium addition is very effective to have precipitation strengthening and bainitic ferrite grain refinement through the increase of controlled rolling ratio in austenite non-recrystallization region. Laboratory rolling test results indicated that low-carbon, high-niobium steel had excellent strength-toughness balance by increasing the amount of finer NbC precipitates by 20 nm or less in a fine bainitic ferrite microstructure. From laboratory welding joint test results, low-carbon, high-niobium steel showed good heat-affected zone toughness with a relatively finer prior austenite grain size in spite of a higher martensite-austenite volume fraction.",10.17736/ijope.2019.hj30,92,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no

The purpose of this is to ensure a minimum quality of service, making the project easy for occupants to navigate, use, and exit. These considerations generally lead to rule-of-thumb calculations for design purposes [1], ensuring that the project is deemed fit for purpose.

J,"Shokri, H; Kayhani, MH; Norouzi, M",Nonlinear Simulation of Viscoelastic Fingering Instability in Miscible Displacement through Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Porous Media,"The miscible displacement of a Newtonian fluid pushed by a nonlinear viscoelastic fluid (viscous fingering instability) has been investigated via a pseudospectral method and Hartley transform. The results of the present study could be useful for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) using chemical flooding technique. Here, the Giesekus model is applied as the constitutive equation of viscoelastic fluid. In addition to the homogeneous media, the simulations are performed for a horizontal layered heterogeneous medium and the results are presented as concentration contours, transversely averaged concentration profiles, mixing length, and sweep efficiency. It is concluded that the heterogeneity of the medium has a great effect on the flow structure. The channeling regime is observed in these media. Higher layers in the heterogeneous medium reduces the intensity of instability while permeability variance acts on the contrary. This is the first attempt in simulation of the viscoelastic-Newtonian displacement (polymer flooding) in heterogeneous media.

The proposed controller has appropriate dynamic response, so it increases damping in transient state in unhealthy conditions. Different generators have been used in three areas. Area 1 includes thermal non-reheat generator and two thermal reheat generators; area 2 includes hydro and thermal non-reheat generators, and area 3 includes hydro and thermal reheat generators. In order to evaluate the performance of the controller, Sim/Matlab software is used. Simulation results show that the controller designed using DE algorithm is not affected by load changes, disturbance, or system parameters changes. Comparing the results of proposed algorithm with other load frequency control algorithms, such as PSO and GA, it has been found that this method has a more appropriate response and satisfactory performance.",10.31803/tg-20181110091820,97,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes

In this work, the dynamic behaviour of circular plate in contact with fluid and resting on Winkler and Pasternak foundations is investigated. The coupled differential equation of the system is analysed using differential transformation method. Good agreements are established when the results of the analytical solutions are compared to the results of the experimental investigation as reported in literature. The analytical solutions obtained are used to investigate the effects of elastic foundation parameters on natural frequency, combine foundation parameters on natural frequency, plate in contact with fluid and that of radial and circumferential stress on mode shapes. From the results, it is observed that, increases in elastic foundation parameter increases the natural frequency in all cases. Presence of fluid reduces the natural frequency of the plate. Also, it is established that mode shapes are not altered by the presence of fluid. However, mode shape displacement occurs due to presence of radial and circumferential stresses. Since the study provides a physical insight into the vibration mode of the structure, it is expected that the study will enhance better understanding on the dynamic behaviour of a circular plate in contact with fluid and resting on two-parameters elastic foundation.",10.5829/ije.2019.32.12c.13,99,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no
