J,"Zhao, B; Song, Q; Liu, WH; Sun, YD",Overview of Dual-Active-Bridge Isolated Bidirectional DC-DC Converter for High-Frequency-Link Power-Conversion System,"High-frequency-link (HFL) power conversion systems (PCSs) are attracting more and more attentions in academia and industry for high power density, reduced weight, and low noise without compromising efficiency, cost, and reliability. In HFL PCSs, dual-active-bridge (DAB) isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter (IBDC) serves as the core circuit. This paper gives an overview of DAB-IBDC for HFL PCSs. First, the research necessity and development history are introduced. Second, the research subjects about basic characterization, control strategy, soft-switching solution and variant, as well as hardware design and optimization are reviewed and analyzed. On this basis, several typical application schemes of DAB-IBDC for HPL PCSs are presented in a worldwide scope. Finally, design recommendations and future trends are presented. As the core circuit of HFL PCSs, DAB-IBDC has wide prospects. The large-scale practical application of DAB-IBDC for HFL PCSs is expected with the recent advances in solid-state semiconductors, magnetic and capacitive materials, and microelectronic technologies.",10.1109/TPEL.2013.2289913,0,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Maddah-Ali, MA; Niesen, U",Fundamental Limits of Caching,"Caching is a technique to reduce peak traffic rates by prefetching popular content into memories at the end users. Conventionally, these memories are used to deliver requested content in part from a locally cached copy rather than through the network. The gain offered by this approach, which we term local caching gain, depends on the local cache size (i.e., the memory available at each individual user). In this paper, we introduce and exploit a second, global, caching gain not utilized by conventional caching schemes. This gain depends on the aggregate global cache size (i.e., the cumulative memory available at all users), even though there is no cooperation among the users. To evaluate and isolate these two gains, we introduce an information-theoretic formulation of the caching problem focusing on its basic structure. For this setting, we propose a novel coded caching scheme that exploits both local and global caching gains, leading to a multiplicative improvement in the peak rate compared with previously known schemes. In particular, the improvement can be on the order of the number of users in the network. In addition, we argue that the performance of the proposed scheme is within a constant factor of the information-theoretic optimum for all values of the problem parameters.",10.1109/TIT.2014.2306938,1,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

A close relationship between correntropy and M-estimation is established. Connections and differences between correntropy and kernel methods are presented.

J,"Mao, YY; Zhang, J; Letaief, KB",Dynamic Computation Offloading for Mobile-Edge Computing With Energy Harvesting Devices,"Mobile-edge computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm to meet the ever-increasing computation demands from mobile applications. By offloading the computationally intensive workloads to the MEC server, the quality of computation experience, e.g., the execution latency, could be greatly improved. Nevertheless, as the on-device battery capacities are limited, computation would be interrupted when the battery energy runs out. To provide satisfactory computation performance as well as achieving green computing, it is of significant importance to seek renewable energy sources to power mobile devices via energy harvesting (EH) technologies. In this paper, we will investigate a green MEC system with EH devices and develop an effective computation offloading strategy. The execution cost, which addresses both the execution latency and task failure, is adopted as the performance metric. A low-complexity online algorithm is proposed, namely, the Lyapunov optimization-based dynamic computation offloading algorithm, which jointly decides the offloading decision, the CPU-cycle frequencies for mobile execution, and the transmit power for computation offloading. A unique advantage of this algorithm is that the decisions depend only on the current system state without requiring distribution information of the computation task request, wireless channel, and EH processes. The implementation of the algorithm only requires to solve a deterministic problem in each time slot, for which the optimal solution can be obtained either in closed form or by bisection search. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown to be asymptotically optimal via rigorous analysis. Sample simulation results shall be presented to corroborate the theoretical analysis as well as validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",10.1109/JSAC.2016.2611964,3,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,,
J,"Vaidyanathan, PP; Pal, P",Sparse Sensing With Co-Pprime Samplers and Arrays,"This paper considers the sampling of temporal or spatial wide sense stationary (WSS) signals using a co-prime pair of sparse samplers. Several properties and applications of co-prime samplers are developed. First, for uniform spatial sampling with and sensors where and are co-prime with appropriate interelement spacings, the difference co-array has O(MN) freedoms which can be exploited in beamforming and in direction of arrival estimation. An M-point DFT filter bank and an N-point DFT filter bank can be used at the outputs of the two sensor arrays and their outputs combined in such a way that there are effectively MN bands (i.e., MN narrow beams with beamwidths proportional to 1/MN), a result following from co-primality. The ideas are applicable to both active and passive sensing, though the details and tradeoffs are different. Time domain sparse co-prime samplers also generate a time domain co-array with O(MN) freedoms, which can be used to estimate the autocorrelation at much finer lags than the sample spacings. This allows estimation of power spectrum of an arbitrary signal with a frequency resolution proportional to 2 pi/(MNT) even though the pairs of sampled sequences x(c)(NTn) and x(c)(MTn) in the time domain can be arbitrarily sparse - in fact from the sparse set of samples x(c)(NTn) and x(c)(MTn) one can estimate O(MN) frequencies in the range vertical bar omega vertical bar < pi/T. It will be shown that the co-array based method for estimating sinusoids in noise offers many advantages over methods based on the use of Chinese remainder theorem and its extensions. Examples are presented throughout to illustrate the various concepts.",10.1109/TSP.2010.2089682,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Kasprzyk-Hordern, B; Dinsdale, RM; Guwy, AJ","The removal of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptors and illicit drugs during wastewater treatment and its impact on the quality of receiving waters","A 5-month monitoring program was undertaken in South Wales in the UK to determine the fate of SS pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptors and illicit drugs (PPCPs) in two contrasting wastewater plants utilising two different wastewater treatment technologies: activated sludge and trickling filter beds. The impact of treated wastewater effluent on the quality of receiving waters was also assessed. PPCPs were found to be present at high loads reaching 10 kg day(-1) in the raw sewage. Concentrations of PPCPs in raw sewage were found to correlate with their usage/consumption patterns in Wales and their metabolism. The efficiency of the removal of PPCPs was found to be strongly dependent on the technology implemented in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In general, the WWTP utilising trickling filter beds resulted in, on average, less than 70% removal of all 55 PPCPs studied, while the WWTP utilising activated sludge treatment gave a much higher removal efficiency of over 85%. The monitoring programme revealed that treated wastewater effluents were the main contributors to PPCPs concentrations (up to 3 kg of PPCPs day(-1)) in the rivers studied. Bearing in mind that in the cases examined here the WWTP effluents were also major contributors to rivers' flows (dilution factor for the studied rivers did not exceed 23 times) the effect of WWTP effluent on the quality of river water is significant and cannot be underestimated.

J,"Adams, LK; Lyon, DY; Alvarez, PJJ","Comparative eco-toxicity of nanoscale TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and ZnO water suspensions","The potential eco-toxicity of nanosized titanium dioxide (TiO2), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and zinc oxide (ZnO) water suspensions was investigated using Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli as test organisms. These three photosensitive nanomaterials were harmful to varying degrees, with antibacterial activity increasing with particle concentration. Antibacterial activity generally increased from SiO2 to TiO2 to ZnO, and B. subtilis was most susceptible to their effects. Advertised nanoparticle size did not correspond to true particle size. Apparently, aggregation produced similarly sized particles that had similar antibacterial activity at a given concentration. The presence of light was a significant factor under most conditions tested, presumably due to its role in promoting generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, bacterial growth inhibition was also observed under dark conditions, indicating that undetermined mechanisms additional to photocatalytic ROS production were responsible for toxicity. These results highlight the need for caution during the use and disposal of such manufactured nanomaterials to prevent unintended environmental impacts, as well as the importance of further research on the mechanisms and factors that increase toxicity to enhance risk management.

J,"Samarati, P",Protecting respondents' identities in microdata release,"Today's globally networked society places great demand on the dissemination and sharing of information. While in the past released information was mostly in tabular and statistical form, many situations call today for the release of specific data (microdata). In order to protect the anonymity of the, entities (called respondents) to which information refers, data holders often remove or encrypt explicit identifiers such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. Deidentifying data, however, provides no guarantee of anonymity. Released information often contains other data, such as race, birth date, sex, and ZIP code, that can be linked to publicly available information to reidentify respondents and inferring information that was not intended for disclosure. In this paper we address the problem of releasing microdata while safeguarding the anonymity of the respondents to which the data refer. The approach is based on the definition of k-anonymity. A table provides k-anonymity if attempts to link explicitly identifying information to its content map the information to at least k entities. We illustrate how k-anonymity can be provided without compromising the Integrity (or truthfulness) of the information released by using generalization and suppression techniques. We introduce the concept of minimal generalization that captures the property of the release process not to distort the data more than needed to achieve k-anonymity, and present an algorithm for the computation of such a generalization. We also discuss possible preference policies to choose among different minimal generalizations.",10.1109/69.971193,7,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,
J,"Jindal, N",MIMO broadcast channels with finite-rate feedback,"Mlultiple transmit antennas in a downlink channel can provide tremendous capacity (i.e., multiplexing) gains, even when receivers have only single antennas. However, receiver and transmitter channel state information is generally required. In this correspondence, a system where each receiver has perfect channel knowledge, but the transmitter only receive-s quantized information regarding the channel instantiation is analyzed. The well-known zero-forcing transmission technique is considered, and simple expressions for the throughput degradation due to finite-rate feedback are derived. A key finding is that the feedback rate per mobile must be increased linearly with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (in decibels) in order to achieve the full multiplexing gain. This is in sharp contrast to point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which it is not necessary to increase the feedback rate as a function of the SNR.",10.1109/TIT.2006.883550,8,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,

We have examined the short-term toxicity of AgNP and ionic silver (Ag+) to photosynthesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using fluorometry. AgNP ranged in size from 10 to 200 nm with most particles around 25 nm. As determined by DGT (diffusive gradients in thin films), byion-selective electrode, and by centrifugal ultrafiltration, about 1% of the AgNP was present as Ag+ ions. Based on total Ag concentration, toxicity was 18 times higher for AgNO3 than for AgNP (in terms of EC50). However, when compared as a function of the Ag+ concentration, toxicity of AgNP appeared to be much higher than that of AgNO3. The ionic Ag+ measured in the AgNP suspensions could not fully explain the observed toxicity. Cysteine, a strong Ag+ ligand, abolished the inhibitory effects on photosynthesis of both AgNP and Ag+. Together, the results indicate that the interaction of these particles with algae influences the toxicity of AgNP, which is mediated by Ag+. Particles contributed to the toxicity as a source of Ag+ which is formed in presence of algae.",10.1021/es801785m,9,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,,
J,"Ren, W; AtkinS, E",Distributed multi-vehicle coordinated control <i>via</i> local information exchange,"This paper describes it distributed coordination scheme with local information exchange for multiple vehicle systems. We introduce second-order consensus protocols that take into account motions of the information states and their derivatives, extending first-order protocols from the literature. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which consensus can be reached in the context of unidirectional information exchange topologies. This work takes into account the general case where information flow may be unidirectional due to sensors with limited fields of view or vehicles with directed, power-constrained communication links. Unlike the first-order case, we show that having a (directed) spanning tree is a necessary rather than a sufficient condition for consensus seeking with second-order dynamics. This work focuses on a formal analysis of information exchange topologies that permit second-order consensus. Given its importance to the stability of the coordinated system, an analysis of the consensus term control gains is also presented, specifically the strength of the information states relative to their derivatives. As an illustrative example, consensus protocols are applied to coordinate the movements of multiple mobile robots.

J,"Dimakis, AG; Godfrey, PB; Wu, YN; Wainwright, MJ; Ramchandran, K",Network Coding for Distributed Storage Systems,"Distributed storage systems provide reliable access to data through redundancy spread over individually unreliable nodes. Application scenarios include data centers, peer-to-peer storage systems, and storage in wireless networks. Storing data using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes, requires less redundancy than simple replication for the same level of reliability. However, since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes fail, a key question is how to generate encoded fragments in a distributed way while transferring as little data as possible across the network. For an erasure coded system, a common practice to repair from a single node failure is for a new node to reconstruct the whole encoded data object to generate just one encoded block. We show that this procedure is sub-optimal. We introduce the notion of regenerating codes, which allow a new node to communicate functions of the stored data from the surviving nodes. We show that regenerating codes can significantly reduce the repair bandwidth. Further, we show that there is a fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth which we theoretically characterize using flow arguments on an appropriately constructed graph. By invoking constructive results in network coding, we introduce regenerating codes that can achieve any point in this optimal tradeoff.",10.1109/TIT.2010.2054295,11,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The optimization problem is numerically difficult to solve when the problem does not have a convexity structure. This paper makes progress toward solving optimization problems of this type by showing that under a certain condition called the time-sharing condition, the duality gap of the optimization problem is always zero, regardless of the convexity of the objective function. Further, we show that the time-sharing condition is satisfied for practical multiuser spectrum optimization. problems in multicarrier systems in the limit as the number of carriers goes to infinity. This result leads to efficient numerical algorithms that solve the nonconvex problem in the dual domain. We show that the recently proposed optimal spectrum balancing algorithm for digital subscriber lines can be interpreted as a dual algorithm. This new interpretation gives rise to more efficient dual update methods. It also suggests ways in which the dual objective may be evaluated approximately, further improving the numerical efficiency of the algorithm.

J,"Paerl, HW; Paul, VJ",Climate change: Links to global expansion of harmful cyanobacteria,"Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest (similar to 3.5 bya) oxygen evolving organisms, and they have had major impacts on shaping our modern-day biosphere. Conversely, biospheric environmental perturbations, including nutrient enrichment and climatic changes (e.g. global warming, hydrologic changes, increased frequencies and intensities of tropical cyclones, more intense and persistent droughts), strongly affect cyanobacterial growth and bloom potentials in freshwater and marine ecosystems. We examined human and climatic controls on harmful (toxic, hypoxia-generating, food web disrupting) bloom-forming cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs) along the freshwater to marine continuum. These changes may act synergistically to promote cyanobacterial dominance and persistence. This synergy is a formidable challenge to water quality, water supply and fisheries managers, because bloom potentials and controls may be altered in response to contemporaneous changes in thermal and hydrologic regimes. In inland waters, hydrologic modifications, including enhanced vertical mixing and, if water supplies permit, increased flushing (reducing residence time) will likely be needed in systems where nutrient input reductions are neither feasible nor possible. Successful control of CyanoHABs by grazers is unlikely except in specific cases. Overall, stricter nutrient management will likely be the most feasible and practical approach to long-term CyanoHAB control in a warmer, stormier and more extreme world. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To mitigate the impact of these issues, cooperative spectrum sensing has been shown to be an effective method to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial diversity. While cooperative gain such as improved detection performance and relaxed sensitivity requirement can be obtained, cooperative sensing can incur cooperation overhead. The overhead refers to any extra sensing time, delay, energy, and operations devoted to cooperative sensing and any performance degradation caused by cooperative sensing.

Among all the substances considered, significant concentrations in the influent were only found for the two musks (galaxolide and tonalide), two anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen and naproxen), two natural estrogens (estrone, 17beta-estradiol), one antibiotic (sulfaniethoxazole) and the X-ray contrast medium (iopromide), where the other compounds studied were below the limit of quantification. In the primary treatment, only the fragrances (30-50%) and 17beta-estradiol (20%) were partially removed. On the other hand, the aerobic treatment (activated sludges) caused an important reduction in all compounds detected, between 351/4 and 75%, with the exception of iopromide, which remained in the aqueous phase. The overall removal efficiencies within the STP ranged between 70-90% for the fragrances, 40-65% for the anti-inflammatories, around 65% for 17beta-estradiol and 60% for sulfamethoxazole. However, the concentration of estrone increased along the treatment due to the partial oxidation of 17beta-estradiol in the aeration tank. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Hu, Y; Loizou, PC",Evaluation of objective quality measures for speech enhancement,"In this paper, we evaluate the performance of several objective measures in terms of predicting the quality of noisy speech enhanced by noise suppression algorithms. The objective measures considered a wide range of distortions introduced by four types of real-world noise at two signal-to-noise ratio levels by four classes of speech enhancement algorithms: spectral subtractive, subspace, statistical-model based, and Wiener algorithms. The subjective quality ratings were obtained using the ITU-T P.835 methodology designed to evaluate the quality of enhanced speech along three dimensions: signal distortion, noise distortion, and overall quality. This paper reports on the evaluation of correlations of several objective measures with these three subjective rating scales. Several new composite objective measures are also proposed by combining the individual objective measures using nonparametric and parametric regression analysis techniques.",10.1109/TASL.2007.911054,23,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,

This would particularly be true if magnesium alloys with controlled in vivo corrosion rates could be developed. Since the magnesium corrosion process depends on its corrosive environment, the corrosion rates of magnesium alloys under standard in vitro environmental conditions were compared to corrosion rates in an in vivo animal model. Two gravity-cast magnesium alloys (AZ91D, LAE442) were used in these investigations. Standardized immersion and electrochemical tests according to ASTM norms were performed. The in vivo corrosion tests were carried out by intramedullar implantation of sample rods of the magnesium alloys in guinea pig femura. The reduction in implant volume was determined by synchrotron-radiation-based microtomography. We found that in vivo corrosion was about four orders of magnitude lower than in vitro corrosion of the tested alloys. Furthermore, the tendency of the corrosion rates obtained from in vitro corrosion tests were in the opposite direction as those obtained from the in vivo study. The results of this study suggest, that the conclusions drawn from current ASTM standard in vitro corrosion tests cannot be used to predict in vivo corrosion rates of magnesium alloys.

J,"Smith, MC",Synthesis of mechanical networks: The inerter,"This paper is concerned with the problem of synthesis of (passive) mechanical one-port networks. One of the main contributions of this paper is the introduction of a device, which will be called the inerter, which is the true network dual of the spring. This contrasts with the mass element which, by definition, always has one terminal connected to ground. The inerter allows electrical circuits to be translated over to mechanical ones in a completely analogous way. The inerter need not have large mass. This allows any arbitrary positive-real impedance to be synthesized mechanically using physical components which may be assumed to have small mass compared to other structures to which they may be attached. The possible application of the inerter is considered to a vibration absorption problem, a suspension strut design, and as a simulated mass.",10.1109/TAC.2002.803532,25,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Mahony, R; Hamel, T; Pflimlin, JM",Nonlinear complementary filters on the special orthogonal group,"This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.",10.1109/TAC.2008.923738,26,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,,

State of the art solutions as well as the most illustrative results from the extensive electro- and photoelectrocatalytic literature are given. The research strategies currently employed in the field are outlined and future challenges pointed out. We suggest that the key to optimising the HER activity of MoS2 is divided into (1) increasing the catalytic activity of the active site, (2) increasing the number of active sites of the catalyst, and (3) improving the electrical contact to these sites. These postulations are substantiated by examples from the existing literature and some new results. To demonstrate the electrocatalytic properties of a highly conductive MoS2 hybrid material, we present the HER activity data for multi-wall MoS2 nanotubes on multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWMoS2@MWCNTs). This exemplifies the typical data collected for the electrochemical HER. In addition, it demonstrates that the origin of the activity is closely related to the amount of edges in the layered MoS2. The photoelectrocatalytic HER is also discussed, based on examples from literature, with an emphasis on the use of MoSx as either (1) the co-catalyst providing the HER activity for a semiconductor, e. g. Mo3S4+ on Si or (2) MoS2 as the semiconductor with an intrinsic HER activity.

In most real-world problems, the error cannot be exactly calculated and it must be estimated. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate estimator of the error. This paper analyzes the statistical properties, bias and variance, of the k-fold cross-validation classification error estimator (k-cv). Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the k-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of k. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation.

During the process the powder particles are completely molten by the laser beam. The resulting high density allows avoiding lengthy post-processing as required with selective laser sintering (SLS) of metal powders. Unlike SLS, SLM is more difficult to control. Because of the large energy input of the laser beam and the complete melting of particles problems like balling, residual stresses and deformation occur. This paper will describe SLM applied to a mixture of different types of particles (Fe, Ni, Cu and Fe3P) specially developed for SLM. The different appearing phenomenons are discussed and the process optimization is described. The latter includes an appropriate process parameter adjustment and the application of special scanning strategies.

J,"Hutmacher, DW; Schantz, T; Zein, I; Ng, KW; Teoh, SH; Tan, KC",Mechanical properties and cell cultural response of polycaprolactone scaffolds designed and fabricated via fused deposition modeling,"A number of different processing techniques have been developed to design and fabricate three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for tissue-engineering applications. The imperfection of the current techniques has encouraged the use of a rapid prototyping technology known as fused deposition modeling (FDM). Our results show that FDM allows the design and fabrication of highly reproducible bioresorbable 3D scaffolds with a fully interconnected pore network. The mechanical properties and in vitro biocompatibility of polycaprolactone scaffolds with a porosity of 61 +/- 1% and two matrix architectures were studied. The honeycomblike pores had a size falling within the range of 360 x 430 x 620 mum. The scaffolds with a 0/60/120 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in air of 41.9 +/- 3.5 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degreesC) of 29.4 +/- 4.0 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. In comparison, the scaffolds with a 0/72/144/36/108 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in air of 20.2 +/- 1.7 and 2.4 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degreesC) of 21.5 +/- 2.9 and 2.0 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed that the five-angle scaffolds had significantly lower stiffness and 1% offset yield strengths under compression loading than those with a three-angle pattern under both testing conditions (p less than or equal to 0.05). The obtained stress-strain curves for both scaffold architectures demonstrate the typical behavior of a honeycomb structure undergoing deformation. In vitro studies were conducted with primary human fibroblasts and periosteal cells. Light, environmental scanning electron, and confocal laser microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry showed cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production on the polycaprolactone surface in the Ist culturing week. Over a period of 3-4 weeks in a culture, the fully interconnected scaffold architecture was completely 3D-filled by cellular tissue. Our cell culture study shows that fibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells can proliferate, differentiate, and produce a cellular tissue in an entirely interconnected 3D polycaprolactone matrix.

J,"Hu, M; Mi, BX",Enabling Graphene Oxide Nanosheets as Water Separation Membranes,"We report a novel procedure to synthesize a new type of water separation membrane using graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets such that water can flow through the nanochannels between GO layers while unwanted solutes are rejected by size exclusion and charge effects. The GO membrane was made via layer-by-layer deposition of GO nanosheets, which were cross-linked by 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl trichloride, on a polydopamine-coated polysulfone support. The cross-linking not only provided the stacked GO nanosheets with the necessary stability to overcome their inherent dispensability in water environment but also fine-tuned the charges, functionality, and spacing of the GO nanosheets. We then tested the membranes synthesized with different numbers of GO layers to demonstrate their interesting water separation performance. It was found that the GO membrane flux ranged between 80 and 276 LMH/MPa, roughly 4-10 times higher than that of most commercial nanofiltration membranes. Although the GO membrane in the present development stage had a relatively low rejection (6-46%) of monovalent and divalent salts, it exhibited a moderate rejection (46-66%) of Methylene blue and a high rejection (93-95%) of Rhodamine-WT. We conclude the paper by emphasizing that the facile synthesis of a GO membrane exploiting the ideal properties of inexpensive GO materials offers a myriad of opportunities to modify its physicochemical properties, potentially making the GO membrane a next-generation, cost-effective, and sustainable alternative to the long-existing thin-film composite polyamide membranes for water separation applications.",10.1021/es400571g,33,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,,

In this work, porous PCL scaffolds were computationally designed and then fabricated via selective laser sintering (SLS), a rapid prototyping technique. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated scaffolds were assessed and compared to the designed porous architectures and computationally predicted properties. Scaffolds were then seeded with bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) transduced fibroblasts and implanted subcutaneously to evaluate biological properties and to demonstrate tissue in-growth. The work done illustrates the ability to design and fabricate PCL scaffolds with porous architecture that have sufficient mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering applications using SLS. Compressive modulus and yield strength values ranged from 52 to 67 MPa and 2.0 to 3.2 Mpa, respectively, lying within the lower range of properties reported for human trabecular bone. Finite element analysis (FEA) results showed that mechanical properties of scaffold designs and of fabricated scaffolds can be computationally predicted. Histological evaluation and micro-computed tomography (mu CT) analysis of implanted scaffolds showed that bone can be generated in vivo. Finally, to demonstrate the clinical application of this technology, we designed and fabricated a prototype mandibular condyle scaffold based on an actual pig condyle. The integration of scaffold computational design and free-form fabrication techniques presented here could prove highly useful for the construction of scaffolds that have anatomy specific exterior architecture derived from patient CT or MRI data and an interior porous architecture derived from computational design optimization.

Suitable piezoelectric material for vibration energy harvesting is characterized by the large magnitude of product of the piezoelectric voltage constant (g) and the piezoelectric strain constant (d) given as (d . g). The condition for obtaining large magnitude of d.g has been shown to be as vertical bar d vertical bar = epsilon(n), where E is the permittivity of the material and n is a material parameter having, lower limit of 0.5.

In this article, after briefly reviewing the existing major technology options, we propose a novel, spectrum-efficient, and scalable optical transport network architecture called SLICE. The SLICE architecture enables sub-wavelength, super-wavelength, and multiple-rate data traffic accommodation in a highly spectrum-efficient manner, thereby providing a fractional bandwidth service. Dynamic bandwidth variation of elastic optical paths provides network operators with new business opportunities offering cost-effective and highly available connectivity services through time-dependent bandwidth sharing, energy-efficient network operation, and highly survivable restoration with bandwidth squeezing. We also discuss an optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based flexible-rate transponder and a bandwidth-variable wavelength cross-connect as the enabling technologies of SLICE concept.

The AMSR-E instrument provides a potentially improved soil moisture sensing capability over previous spaceborne radiometers such as the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager due to its combination of low frequency and higher spatial resolution (approximately 60 km at 6.9 GHz). The AMSR-E soil moisture retrieval approach and its implementation are described in this paper. A postlaunch validation program is in progress that will provide evaluations of the retrieved soil moisture and enable improved hydrologic applications of the data. Key aspects of the validation program include assessments of the effects on retrieved soil moisture of variability in vegetation water content, surface temperature, and spatial heterogeneity. Examples of AMSR-E brightness temperature observations over land are shown from the first few months of instrument operation, indicating general features of global vegetation and soil moisture variability. The AMSR-E sensor calibration and extent of radio frequency interference are currently being assessed, to be followed by quantitative assessments of the soil moisture retrievals.

The basic model's several shortcomings, most notably its inherent assumption of independence from irrelevant alternatives have motivated researchers to develop a variety of alternative formulations. The mixed logit model stands as one of the most significant of these extensions. This paper proposes a semi-parametric extension of the MNL, based on the latent class formulation, which resembles the mixed logit model but which relaxes its requirement that the analyst makes specific assumptions about the distributions of parameters across individuals.

Atomic oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios characterize the oxidation state of OA, and O/C from ambient urban OA ranges from 0.2 to 0.8 with a diurnal cycle that decreases with primary emissions and increases because of photochemical processing and secondary OA (SOA) production. Regional O/C approaches similar to 0.9. The hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C, 1.4-1.9) urban diurnal profile increases with primary CIA (POA) as does the nitrogen-to-carbon WC, similar to 0.02). Ambient organic-mass-to-organic-carbon ratios (OM/OC) are directly quantified and correlate well with O/C (R-2 = 0.997) for ambient OA because of low N/C. Ambient O/C and OWN have values consistent with those recently reported from other techniques. Positive matrix factorization applied to ambient OA identifies factors with distinct O/C and OM/OC trends. The highest O/C and OM/OC (1.0 and 2.5, respectively) are observed for aged ambient oxygenated OA, significantly exceeding values for traditional chamber SOA, while laboratory-produced primary biomass burning OA (BBOA) is similar to ambient BBOA, O/C of 0.3-0.4.

The elemental sulfur exists as a highly dispersed state inside the micropores of carbon spheres with a large surface area and a narrow pore distribution, based on the analyses of the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetry (TG) and local element line-scanning. It is demonstrated from galvanostatic discharge-charge process, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) that the sulfur-carbon sphere composite has a large reversible capacity and an excellent high rate discharge capability as cathode materials. In particular, the sulfur-carbon sphere composite with 42 wt% sulfur presents a long electrochemical stability up to 500 cycles, based on the constrained electrochemical reaction inside the narrow micropores of carbon spheres due to strong adsorption. Therefore, the electrochemical reaction constrained inside the micropores proposed here would be the dominant factor for the enhanced long stability of the sulfur cathode.

Compounds were detected by LC/MS/MS or GC/MS/MS. These test waters were subjected to bench-scale experimentation to simulate individual treatment processes in a water treatment plant (WTP). Aluminum sulfate and ferric chloride coagulants or chemical lime softening removed some polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) but removed < 25% of most other EDC/ PPCPs. Addition of 5 mg/L of powder activated carbon (PAC) with a 4-h contact time removed 50% to > 98% of GC/ MS/MS compounds (more volatile) and 10% to > 95% of LC/ MS/MS compounds (more polar); higher PAC dosages improved EDC/PPCP removal. EDC/PPCP percentage removal was independent of the initial compound concentration. Octanol-water partition coefficients served as a reasonable indicator of compound removal under controlled PAC test conditions, except for EDC/PPCPs that were protonated or deprotonated at the test pH and some that contained heterocyclic or aromatic nitrogen. Separate chlorine or ozone experiments decreased the EDC/PPCP initial concentration by < 10% to > 90%; EDC/PPCPs were likely transformed to oxidation byproducts. Ozone oxidized steroids containing phenolic moieties (estradiol, ethynylestradiol, or estrone) more efficiently than those without aromatic or phenolic moieties (androstenedione, progesterone, and testosterone). EDC/PPCP reactivity with oxidants were separated into three general groups: (1) compounds easily oxidized (> 80% reacted) by chlorine are always oxidized at least as efficiently by ozone; (2) 6 of the similar to 60 compounds (TCEP, BHC, chlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, musk ketone) were poorly oxidized (< 20% reacted) by chlorine or ozone; (3) compounds (24 of 60) reacting preferentially (higher removals) with ozone rather than chlorine. Conventional treatment (coagulation plus chlorination) would have low removal of many EDC/PPCPs, while addition of PAC and/or ozone could substantially improve their removals. Existing strategies that predict relative removals of herbicides, pesticides, and other organic pollutants by activated carbon or oxidation can be directly applied for the removal of many EDC/PPCPs, but these strategies need to be modified to account for charged (protonated bases or deprotonated acids) and aliphatic species. Some compounds (e.g., DEET, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil) had low removals unless ozonation was used. Other compounds had low removals by all the WTP processes considered (atrazine, iopromide, meprobarnate, TCEP), and removal processes capable of removing these types of compounds should be investigated.",10.1021/es0484799,61,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The complex data matrix (17,790 observations) was treated with different multivariate techniques such as cluster analysis, factor analysis/principal component analysis (FA/PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA). Cluster analysis (CA) showed good results rendering three different groups of similarity between the sampling sites reflecting the different water-quality parameters of the river system. FA/PCA identified six factors, which are responsible for the data structure explaining 71% of the total variance of the data set and allowed to group the selected parameters according to common features as well as to evaluate the incidence of each group on the overall variation in water quality. However, significant data reduction was not achieved, as it needed 14 parameters to explain 71% of both the temporal and spatial changes in water quality. Discriminant analysis showed the best results for data reduction and pattern recognition during both temporal and spatial analysis. Discriminant analysis showed five parameters (pH, temperature, conductivity, total alkalinity and magnesium) affording more than 88% right assignations in temporal analysis, while nine parameters (pH, temperature, alkalinity, Ca-hardness, DO, BOD, chloride, sulfate and TKN) to afford 91% right assignations in spatial analysis of three different regions in the basin. Thus, DA allowed reduction in dimensionality of the large data set, delineating a few indicator parameters responsible for large variations in water quality. This study presents necessity and usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques for evaluation and interpretation of large complex data sets with a view to get better information about the water quality and design of monitoring network for effective management of water resources.

J,"Zhu, XM; Kahn, JM",Free-space optical communication through atmospheric turbulence channels,"In free-space optical communication links, atmospheric turbulence causes fluctuations in both the intensity and the phase of the received light signal, impairing link performance. In this paper, we describe several communication techniques to mitigate turbulence-induced intensity fluctuations, i.e., signal fading. These techniques are applicable in the regime in which the receiver aperture is smaller than the correlation length of fading and the observation interval is-shorter than the correlation time of fading. We assume that the receiver has no knowledge of the instantaneous fading state. When the receiver knows only the marginal statistics of the fading, a symbol-by-symbol NIL detector can be used to improve detection performance. If the receiver has knowledge of the joint temporal statistics of the fading, maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) can be employed, yielding a further performance improvement, but at the cost of very high complexity. Spatial diversity reception with multiple receivers can also be used to overcome turbulence-induced fading. We describe the use of NIL detection in spatial diversity reception to reduce the diversity gain penalty caused by correlation between the fading at different receivers. In a companion paper, we describe two reduced-complexity implementations of the MLSD, which make use of a single-step Markov chain model for the fading correlation in conjunction with per-survivor processing.",10.1109/TCOMM.2002.800829,65,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Antoni, J",Fast computation of the kurtogram for the detection of transient faults,"The kurtogram is a fourth-order spectral analysis toot recently introduced for detecting and characterising nonstationarities in a signal. The paradigm relies on the assertion that each type of transient is associated with an optimal (frequency/frequency resolution) dyad {f,Delta f} which maximises its kurtosis, and hence its detection. However, the complete exploration of the whole plane (f, Delta f) is a formidable task hardly amenable to on-line industrial applications. In this communication we describe a fast algorithm for computing the kurtograin over a grid that finely samples the (f, Delta f) plane. Its complexity is on the order of N log N, similarly to the FFT. The efficiency of the algorithm is then illustrated on several industrial cases concerned with the detection of incipient transient faults. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although excellent current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and record high output power densities at microwave frequencies have been achieved, the origin of the 2DEG and the factors limiting the output power and reliability of the devices under high power operation remain uncertain. Drain current collapse has been the major obstacle in the development of reliable high power devices, We show that the cause of current collapse is a charging up of a second virtual gate, physically located in the gate drain access region. Due to the large bias voltages present on the device during a microwave power measurement, surface states in the vicinity of the gate trap electrons, thus acting as a negatively charged virtual gate. The maximum current available from a device during a microwave power measurement is limited by the discharging of this virtual gate. Passivated devices located adjacent to unpassivated devices on the same wafer show almost no current collapse, thus demonstrating that proper surface passivation prevents the formation of the virtual gate. The possible mechanisms by which a surface passivant reduces current collapse and the factors affecting reliability and stability of such a passivant are discussed.",10.1109/16.906451,69,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Khawaji, AD; Kutubkhanah, IK; Wie, JM",Advances in seawater desalination technologies,"A number of seawater desalination technologies have been developed during the last several decades to augment the supply of water in and regions of the world. Due to the constraints of high desalination costs, many countries are unable to afford these technologies as a fresh water resource. However, the steady increasing usage of seawater desalination has demonstrated that seawater desalination is a feasible water resource free from the variations in rainfall. A seawater desalination process separates saline seawater into two streams: a fresh water stream containing a low concentration of dissolved salts and a concentrated brine stream. The process requires some form of energy to desalinate, and utilizes several different technologies for separation. Two of the most commercially important technologies are based on the multi-stage flash (MSF) distillation and reverse osmosis (RO) processes. Although the desalination technologies are mature enough to be a reliable source for fresh water from the sea, a significant amount of research and development (R&D) has been carried out in order to constantly improve the technologies and reduce the cost of desalination. This paper reviews the current status, practices, and advances that have been made in the realm of seawater desalination technologies. Additionally, this paper provides an overview of R&D activities and outlines future prospects for the state-of-the-art seawater desalination technologies. Overall, the present review is made with special emphasis on the MSF and RO desalination technologies because they are the most successful processes for the commercial production of large quantities of fresh water from seawater.",10.1016/j.desal.2007.01.067,70,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,

The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of methylene blue dye on such carbon were then examined at 30 degrees C. Adsorption isotherm of the methylene blue (MB) on the activated carbon was determined and correlated with common isotherm equations.

J,"Liu, H; Ramnarayanan, R; Logan, BE",Production of electricity during wastewater treatment using a single chamber microbial fuel cell,"Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been used to produce electricity from different compounds, including acetate, lactate, and glucose. We demonstrate here that it is also possible to produce electricity in a MFC from domestic wastewater, while at the same time accomplishing biological wastewater treatment (removal of chemical oxygen demand; COD). Tests were conducted using a single chamber microbial fuel cell (SCMFC) containing eight graphite electrodes (anodes) and a single air cathode. The system was operated under continuous flow conditions with primary clarifier effluent obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant. The prototype SCMFC reactor generated electrical power (maximum of 26 MW m(-2)) while removing up to 80% of the COD of the wastewater. Power output was proportional to the hydraulic retention time over a range of 3-33 h and to the influent wastewater strength over a range of 50-220 mg/L of COD. Current generation was controlled primarily by the efficiency of the cathode. Optimal cathode performance was obtained by allowing passive air flow rather than forced air flow (4.5-5.5 L/min). The Coulombic efficiency of the system, based on COD removal and current generation, was < 12% indicating a substantial fraction of the organic matter was lost without current generation. Bioreactors based on power generation in MFCs may represent a completely new approach to wastewater treatment. If power generation in these systems can be increased, MFC technology may provide a new method to offset wastewater treatment plant operating costs, making advanced wastewater treatment more affordable for both developing and industrialized nations.",10.1021/es034923g,72,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,

J,"Seaborn, K; Fels, DI",Gamification in theory and action: A survey,"Gamification has drawn the attention of academics, practitioners and business professionals in domains as diverse as education, information studies, human-computer interaction, and health. As yet, the term remains mired in diverse meanings and contradictory uses, while the concept faces division on its academic worth, underdeveloped theoretical foundations, and a dearth of standardized guidelines for application. Despite widespread commentary on its merits and shortcomings, little empirical work has sought to validate gamification as a meaningful concept and provide evidence of its effectiveness as a tool for motivating and engaging users in non-entertainment contexts. Moreover, no work to date has surveyed gamification as a field of study from a human-computer studies perspective. In this paper, we present a systematic survey on the use of gamification in published theoretical reviews and research papers involving interactive systems and human participants. We outline current theoretical understandings of gamification and draw comparisons to related approaches, including alternate reality games (ARGs), games with a purpose (GWAPs), and gameful design. We present a multidisciplinary review of gamification in action, focusing on empirical findings related to purpose and context, design of systems, approaches and techniques, and user impact. Findings from the survey show that a standard conceptualization of gamification is emerging against a growing backdrop of empirical participants-based research. However, definitional subjectivity, diverse or unstated theoretical foundations, incongruities among empirical findings, and inadequate experimental design remain matters of concern. We discuss how gamification may to be more usefully presented as a subset of a larger effort to improve the user experience of interactive systems through gameful design. We end by suggesting points of departure for continued empirical investigations of gamified practice and its effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce a simple encoding algorithm that achieves near-capacity at sum rates of tens of bits/channel use. The algorithm is a variation on channel inversion that regularizes the inverse and uses a ""sphere encoder"" to perturb the data to reduce the power of the transmitted signal. This paper is comprised of two parts. In this first part, we show that while the sum capacity grows linearly with the minimum of the number of antennas and users, the sum rate of channel inversion does not. This poor performance is due to the large spread in the singular values of the channel matrix. We introduce regularization to improve the condition of the inverse and maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the receivers.

A transient hot-wire apparatus with an integrated correlation model is used to measure the thermal conductivities of these nanofluids more conveniently. The pH value and viscosity of the nanofluids are also characterized. The experimental results show that the thermal conductivity increases with an increase of particle volume fraction. The particle size and shape also have effects on this enhancement of thermal conductivity. For TiO2 particles of circle divide 10 nm x 40 nm and circle divide 15 nm dimensions with maximum 5% volume fraction, the enhancement is observed to be nearly 33% and close to 30%, respectively over the base fluid. For 5% volumetric loading of rod-shape TiO2 nanoparticles of circle divide 10 nm x 40 nm in deionized water, this enhancement is found to be 12% higher than that predicted by the Hamilton-Crosser model [I & EC Fundamentals 1 (1962) 187].

In this work, the characteristic curves based on this model were plotted with various initial adsorption factors (R-i). Four zones of the initial adsorption according to Ri value from 0 to 1 were classified: that is, approaching completely initial adsorption (zone 4), strongly initial adsorption (zone 3), intermediately initial adsorption (zone 2), and weakly initial adsorption (zone 1). Activated carbons with micropore volume fraction of 0.537 and 0.686 were prepared from oil-palm shells by steam activation. Based on the standard deviations, the kinetics of the adsorption of tannic acid (TA), methylene blue (MB), phenol, and 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) on activated carbons could be best described by intraparticle diffusion model. The initial adsorption of TA and MB belonged to zone 2, and that of phenol and 4-CP mostly belonged to zone 3. Nearly 80% of the 86 adsorption systems surveyed belonged to zones 2 and 3, indicating that the R-i value was smaller when the carbon with smaller particle and steam-activated carbon was used.

From a computer vision perspective, this task is extremely challenging because it is massively ill-posed - at each pixel we must estimate the foreground and the background colors, as well as the foreground opacity(""alpha matte"") from a single color measurement. Current approaches either restrict the estimation to a small part of the image, estimating foreground and background colors based on nearby pixels where they are known, or perform iterative nonlinear estimation by alternating foreground and background color estimation with alpha estimation. In this paper, we present a closed-form solution to natural image matting. We derive a cost function from local smoothness assumptions on foreground and background colors and show that in the resulting expression, it is possible to analytically eliminate the foreground and background colors to obtain a quadratic cost function in alpha. This allows us to find the globally optimal alpha matte by solving a sparse linear system of equations. Furthermore, the closed-form formula allows us to predict the properties of the solution by analyzing the eigenvectors of a sparse matrix, closely related to matrices used in spectral image segmentation algorithms.

J,"Ju, H; Zhang, R",Throughput Maximization in Wireless Powered Communication Networks,"This paper studies the newly emerging wireless powered communication network in which one hybrid access point (H-AP) with constant power supply coordinates the wireless energy/information transmissions to/from a set of distributed users that do not have other energy sources. A ""harvest-then-transmit"" protocol is proposed where all users first harvest the wireless energy broadcast by the H-AP in the downlink (DL) and then send their independent information to the H-AP in the uplink (UL) by time-division-multiple-access (TDMA). First, we study the sum-throughput maximization of all users by jointly optimizing the time allocation for the DL wireless power transfer versus the users' UL information transmissions given a total time constraint based on the users' DL and UL channels as well as their average harvested energy values. By applying convex optimization techniques, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the optimal time allocations to maximize the sum-throughput. Our solution reveals an interesting ""doubly near-far"" phenomenon due to both the DL and UL distance-dependent signal attenuation, where a far user from the H-AP, which receives less wireless energy than a nearer user in the DL, has to transmit with more power in the UL for reliable information transmission. As a result, the maximum sum-throughput is shown to be achieved by allocating substantially more time to the near users than the far users, thus resulting in unfair rate allocation among different users. To overcome this problem, we furthermore propose a new performance metric so-called common-throughput with the additional constraint that all users should be allocated with an equal rate regardless of their distances to the H-AP. We present an efficient algorithm to solve the common-throughput maximization problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the common-throughput approach for solving the new doubly near-far problem in wireless powered communication networks.",10.1109/TWC.2013.112513.130760,83,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,

In many parts of Europe groundwater quantity, and in particular quality, have come under sever degradation and water levels have decreased resulting in negative environmental impacts. Rapid improvements in the economy of the eastern European block of countries and uncertainties with regard to freshwater availability create challenges for water managers. At the same time, climate change adds a new level of uncertainty with regard to freshwater supplies. In this research we build and calibrate an integrated hydrological model of Europe using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) program. Different components of water resources are simulated and crop yield and water quality are considered at the Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) level. The water resources are quantified at subbasin level with monthly time intervals. Leaching of nitrate into groundwater is also simulated at a finer spatial level (HRU). The use of large-scale, high-resolution water resources models enables consistent and comprehensive examination of integrated system behavior through physically-based, data-driven simulation. In this article we discuss issues with data availability, calibration of large-scale distributed models, and outline procedures for model calibration and uncertainty analysis. The calibrated model and results provide information support to the European Water Framework Directive and lay the basis for further assessment of the impact of climate change on water availability and quality.

J,"Wang, K; Li, Q; Liu, BS; Cheng, B; Ho, WK; Yu, JG",Sulfur-doped g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> with enhanced photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction performance,"Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is the most stable phase of all carbon nitride allotropes under ambient conditions. In this study, sulfur-doped g-C3N4 was fabricated by simply calcinating thiourea at 520 degrees C. Sulfur-doped g-C3N4 (TCN) was found to absorb light up to 475 nm corresponding to a band gap of 2.63 eV, which was narrower than that of un-doped g-C3N4 (MCN) with a band gap of 2.7 eV. First-principle calculations based on spin-polarized density functional theory were utilized to investigate the theoretical partial density of states of the TCN and MCN, indicating that the band gaps of TCN and MCN were the same, but impurities existed in the TCN sample. Consequently, photogenerated electrons could easily jump from the impurity state to the conduction band or from the valence band to the impurity state. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction was further used to evaluate the photoactivity of samples, and the CH3OH yield using TCN and MCN were 1.12 and 0.81 mu mol g(-1), respectively. PL spectrum analysis and transient photocurrent responses were also carried out to verify the suggested photocatalysis mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Furman, OS; Teel, AL; Watts, RJ",Mechanism of Base Activation of Persulfate,"Base is the most commonly used activator of persulfate for the treatment of contaminated groundwater by in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) A mechanism for the base activation of persulfate is proposed involving the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of persulfate to hydroperoxide anion and sulfate followed by the reduction of another persulfate molecule by hydroperoxide. Reduction by hydroperoxide decomposes persulfate into sulfate radical and sulfate anion, and hydroperoxide is oxidized to superoxide The base-catalyzed hydrolysis of persulfate was supported by kinetic analyses of persulfate decomposition at various base persulfate molar ratios and an increased rate of persulfate decomposition in D2O vs H2O. Stoichiometric analyses confirmed that hydroperoxide reacts with persulfate in a 1.1 molar ratio Addition of hydroperoxide to basic persulfate systems resulted in rapid decomposition of the hydroperoxide and persulfate and decomposition of the superoxide probe hexachloroethane. The presence of superoxide was confirmed with scavenging by Cu(II) Electron spin resonance spectroscopy confirmed the generation of sulfate radical, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide. The results of this research are consistent with the widespread reactivity reported for base-activated persulfate when it is used for ISCO",10.1021/es1013714,87,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Candès, EJ; Plan, Y",Matrix Completion With Noise,"On the heels of compressed sensing, a new field has very recently emerged. This field addresses a broad range of problems of significant practical interest, namely, the recovery of a data matrix from what appears to be incomplete, and perhaps even corrupted, information. In its simplest form, the problem is to recover a matrix from a small sample of its entries. It comes up in many areas of science and engineering, including collaborative filtering, machine learning, control, remote sensing, and computer vision, to name a few. This paper surveys the novel literature on matrix completion, which shows that under some suitable conditions, one can recover an unknown low-rank matrix from a nearly minimal set of entries by solving a simple convex optimization problem, namely, nuclear-norm minimization subject to data constraints. Further, this paper introduces novel results showing that matrix completion is provably accurate even when the few observed entries are corrupted with a small amount of noise. A typical result is that one can recover an unknown n x n matrix of low rank r from just about nr log(2)n noisy samples with an error that is proportional to the noise level. We present numerical results that complement our quantitative analysis and show that, in practice, nuclear-norm minimization accurately fills in the many missing entries of large low-rank matrices from just a few noisy samples. Some analogies between matrix completion and compressed sensing are discussed throughout.",10.1109/JPROC.2009.2035722,88,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Profound cytotoxicity of SWNTs was observed in alveolar macrophage (AM) after a 6-h exposure in vitro. The cytotoxicity increases by as high as similar to35% when the dosage of SWNTs was increased by 11.30 mug/cm(2). No significant toxicity was observed for C60 up to a dose of 226.00 mug/CM2. The cytotoxicity apparently follows a sequence order on a mass basis: SWNTs > MWNT10 > quartz > C-60. SWNTs significantly impaired phagocytosis of AM at the low dose of 0.38 mug/cm(2), whereas MWNT10 and C60 induced injury only at the high dose of 3.06 mug/cm(2). The macrophages exposed to SWNTs or MWNT10 of 3.06 mug/cm(2) showed characteristic features of necrosis and degeneration. A sign of apoptotic cell death likely existed.

J,"Webster, TJ; Ergun, C; Doremus, RH; Siegel, RW; Bizios, R",Enhanced functions of osteoblasts on nanophase ceramics,"Select functions of osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) on nanophase (materials with grain sizes less than 100 nm) alumina, titania, and hydroxyapatite (HA) were investigated using in vitro cellular models. Compared to conventional ceramics, surface occupancy of osteoblast colonies was significantly less on all nanophase ceramics tested in the present study after 4 and 6 days of culture. Osteoblast proliferation was significantly greater on nanophase alumina, titania, and HA than on conventional formulations of the same ceramic after 3 and 5 days. More importantly, compared to conventional ceramics, synthesis of alkaline phosphatase and deposition of calcium-containing mineral was significantly greater by osteoblasts cultured on nanophase than on conventional ceramics after 21 and 28 days. The results of the present study provided the first evidence of enhanced long-term ton the order of days to weeks) functions of osteoblasts cultured on nanophase ceramics; in this manner, nanophase ceramics clearly represent a unique and promising class of orthopaedic/dental implant formulations with improved osseointegrative properties.

J,"Xue, WF; Zhang, L; Mou, XQ; Bovik, AC",Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation: A Highly Efficient Perceptual Image Quality Index,"It is an important task to faithfully evaluate the perceptual quality of output images in many applications, such as image compression, image restoration, and multimedia streaming. A good image quality assessment (IQA) model should not only deliver high quality prediction accuracy, but also be computationally efficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is becoming particularly important due to the increasing proliferation of high-volume visual data in high-speed networks. We present a new effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to image distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image suffer different degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of global variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality prediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS) between the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling strategy-the standard deviation of the GMS map-can predict accurately perceptual image quality. The resulting GMSD algorithm is much faster than most state-of-the-art IQA methods, and delivers highly competitive prediction accuracy.

The equations were derived from a global database with M 3.0-7.9 events. We derived equations for the primary M- and distance-dependence of the IMs after fixing the V-S30-based nonlinear site term from a parallel NGA-West2 study. We then evaluated additional effects using mixed effects residuals analysis, which revealed no trends with source depth over the M range of interest, indistinct Class 1 and 2 event IMs, and basin depth effects that increase and decrease long-period IMs for depths larger and smaller, respectively, than means from regional V-S30-depth relations.

J,"von Moos, N; Burkhardt-Holm, P; Köhler, A",Uptake and Effects of Microplastics on Cells and Tissue of the Blue Mussel <i>Mytilus edulis</i> L. after an Experimental Exposure,"In this study, we investigated if industrial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) particles, a model microplastic free of additives, ranging > 0-80 mu m are ingested and taken up into the cells and tissue of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis L. The effects of exposure (up to 96 h) and plastic ingestion were observed at the cellular and subcellular level. Microplastic uptake into the gills and digestive gland was analyzed by a new method using polarized light microscopy. Mussel health status was investigated incorporating histological assessment and cytochemical biomarkers of toxic effects and early warning. In addition to being drawn into the gills, HDPE particles were taken up into the stomach and transported into the digestive gland where they accumulated in the lysosomal system after 3 h of exposure. Our results show notable histological changes upon uptake and a strong inflammatory response demonstrated by the formation of granulocytomas after 6 h and lysosomal membrane destabilization, which significantly increased with longer exposure times. We provide proof of principle that microplastics are taken up into cells and cause significant effects on the tissue and cellular level, which can be assessed with standard cytochemical biomarkers and polarized light microscopy for microplastic tracking in tissue.",10.1021/es302332w,93,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Mohamed, AR; Dahl, GE; Hinton, G",Acoustic Modeling Using Deep Belief Networks,"Gaussian mixture models are currently the dominant technique for modeling the emission distribution of hidden Markov models for speech recognition. We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters. These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models.",10.1109/TASL.2011.2109382,94,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,
J,"Lowry, PB; Gaskin, J",Partial Least Squares (PLS) Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for Building and Testing Behavioral Causal Theory: When to Choose It and How to Use It,"Problem: Partial least squares (PLS), a form of structural equation modeling (SEM), can provide much value for causal inquiry in communication-related and behavioral research fields. Despite the wide availability of technical information on PLS, many behavioral and communication researchers often do not use PLS in situations in which it could provide unique theoretical insights. Moreover, complex models comprising formative (causal) and reflective (consequent) constructs are now common in behavioral research, but they are often misspecified in statistical models, resulting in erroneous tests. Key concepts: First-generation (1G) techniques, such as correlations, regressions, or difference of means tests (such as ANOVA or t-tests), offer limited modeling capabilities, particularly in terms of causal modeling. In contrast, second-generation techniques (such as covariance-based SEM or PLS) offer extensive, scalable, and flexible causal-modeling capabilities. Second-generation (2G) techniques do not invalidate the need for 1G techniques however. The key point of 2G techniques is that they are superior for the complex causal modeling that dominates recent communication and behavioral research. Key lessons: For exploratory work, or for studies that include formative constructs, PLS should be selected. For confirmatory work, either covariance-based SEM or PLS may be used. Despite claims that lower sampling requirements exist for PLS, inadequate sample sizes result in the same problems for either technique. Implications: SEM's strength is in modeling. In particular, SEM allows for complex models that include latent (unobserved) variables, formative variables, chains of effects (mediation), and multiple group comparisons of these more complex relationships.",10.1109/TPC.2014.2312452,95,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,
J,"Johnston, ID; McCluskey, DK; Tan, CKL; Tracey, MC",Mechanical characterization of bulk Sylgard 184 for microfluidics and microengineering,"Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers are extensively used for soft lithographic replication of microstructures in microfluidic and micro-engineering applications. Elastomeric microstructures are commonly required to fulfil an explicit mechanical role and accordingly their mechanical properties can critically affect device performance. The mechanical properties of elastomers are known to vary with both curing and operational temperatures. However, even for the elastomer most commonly employed in microfluidic applications, Sylgard 184, only a very limited range of data exists regarding the variation in mechanical properties of bulk PDMS with curing temperature. We report an investigation of the variation in the mechanical properties of bulk Sylgard 184 with curing temperature, over the range 25 degrees C to 200 degrees C. PDMS samples for tensile and compressive testing were fabricated according to ASTM standards. Data obtained indicates variation in mechanical properties due to curing temperature for Young's modulus of 1.32-2.97 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 3.51-7.65 MPa, compressive modulus of 117.8-186.9 MPa and ultimate compressive strength of 28.4-51.7 GPa in a range up to 40% strain and hardness of 44-54 Sh(A).",10.1088/0960-1317/24/3/035017,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Chui, HL; Rangarajan, A",A new point matching algorithm for non-rigid registration,"Feature-based methods for non-rigid registration frequently encounter the correspondence problem. Regardless of whether points, lines, curves or surface parameterizations are used, feature-based non-rigid matching requires us to automatically solve for correspondences between two sets of features. In addition, there could be many features in either set that have no counterparts in the other. This outlier rejection problem further complicates an already difficult correspondence problem. We formulate feature-based non-rigid registration as a nonrigid point matching problem. After a careful review of the problem and an in-depth examination of two types of methods previously designed for rigid robust point matching (RPM), we propose a new general framework for non-rigid point matching. We consider it a general framework because it does not depend on any particular form of spatial mapping. We have also developed an algorithm-the TPS-RPM algorithm-with the thin-plate spline (TPS) as the parameterization of the non-rigid spatial mapping and the softassign for the correspondence. The performance of the TPS-RPM algorithm is demonstrated and validated in a series of carefully designed synthetic experiments. In each of these experiments, an empirical comparison with the popular iterated closest point (ICP) algorithm is also provided. Finally, we apply the algorithm to the problem of non-rigid registration of cortical anatomical structures which is required in brain mapping. While these results are somewhat preliminary, they clearly demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real world tasks involving feature-based nonrigid registration.
