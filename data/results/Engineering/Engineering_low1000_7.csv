0,"This paper is dedicated to Prof. Reinhardt for excellent supervision and exciting research. He was about 20 years my supervisor and mentor. On the occasion of the 80(th) birthday of Prof. Hans-Wolf Reinhardt, one of the most important modern measuring techniques for concrete quality control is discussed. It was developed under his guidance and facilitates the ultrasound technique for monitoring and analyzing fresh concrete and mortar properties during setting and hardening. To stress Prof. Reinhardt's merits, the developments at the University of Stuttgart are summarized. They culminated in one of the first commercially available modern test device that was the blueprint for other devices. The paper is giving also an introduction into the capabilities of the technique along with some more recent example of applications and a brief overview about standardization activities. The author's hope is that more scientists and practitioners are stimulated to use and further develop this technique establishing it on a broader range in the area of building constructions.",yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes
1,"Realkalization potential of drinking water reservoir coatings The realkalizing effect of mineral mortars is known from the repair of carbonated concrete in building construction. The application there is limited to the use of an ordinary Portland cement (CEM I) based repair material and to an average carbonation depth of less than 20 mm beyond the reinforcement. Concerning the repair of drinking water reservoirs, special boundary conditions must also be considered from both a hygienic and a technical point of view. According to the DVGW Code of Practice W 300-3, cement-bonded coatings are classified according to their ability to realkalize leached or carbonated concrete. The realkalization depot of the mortar and the existing residual alkalinity of the substrate are decisive for the choice of the cement-bonded coating. The relationship between the alkalinity depot and resistance to an reoccurring leaching attack of repair mortars as well as the simultaneous realkalization of the concrete substrate are not sufficiently known. In a DVGW funded research project, the performance of repair mortars is being investigated. The necessary boundary conditions for a successful realkalisation are determined and a more detailed description of the realkalisation depot is developed, aiding planners and users in their endeavor to estimate and improve durability of structures.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no
2,"It is very difficult to plan the maintenance requirements of concrete pavements with alkali-silica reaction. Up to now, the necessary assessment has been carried out via visual appearance, AKR-provoking concrete investigations as well as polarization microscopic investigations on thin sections. With these investigations a forecast for the damage development is not possible. It is only possible to assess whether damage is no longer to be expected or whether there is still further potential for residual damage. The often significant deterioration of concrete pavement can be traced back to an undetected horizontal crack formation. In the context of an alkali-silica reaction (ASR), horizontal cracks can be found in the area of the joint crosses, the transverse joints and the longitudinal joints, which then extend several centimeters into the carriageway slab. The article illustrates the consequences of a damaging ASR and other loads in a carriageway slab. For the first time, it establishes a systematic relationship between a damaging ASR in a carriageway slab and the horizontal cracks in the area of the joints.",yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,happy,happy,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,happy,happy,no,no,yes,yes,
3,"This work presents a multi-chamber and multi-compartment model of a horizontal fluidized bed apparatus for layering granulation, coating, and drying. Each chamber is designed individually and process conditions, such as spray rate, particle feed or gas temperature, can be adjusted for each chamber separately. Particle growth is described by population balance modeling. The characteristics of the particle exchange rates between the individual process chambers are determined by separation functions to account for different weir configurations. Additionally a drying model is presented that takes initial droplet size and contact angle as well as partial wetting of the particle surface into account. Because of the great variety of parameters that influence this model, a parametric study is carried out to identify how construction or process parameters affect the product quality. The influence of different separation functions, thermal process conditions, and initial droplet properties on key product quality features such as particle size distribution, product moisture content, and degree of surface wetting are presented and discussed.

A biaxial split Hopkinson bar was used, that applied the dynamic load to the test specimen in the form of two load waves perpendicular to each other. For reference, the static compressive strengths under biaxial load with different stress ratios of the two load axes were determined in a triaxial testing machine.

The phase shift and amplitude attenuation within the dispersive media are compensated individually for each frequency component and then integrated to calculate the pixel values in the region of interest (ROI). Therefore, the multi-speed and multipath issue when an ultra-wide band (UWB) signal propagates in the dispersive media is overcome.

6,"In the combined transportation of multiple girder transport vehicles, the lifting of multiple hydraulic cylinders must ensure a certain synchronization accuracy, otherwise the bridge structure will be damaged, and even serious construction accidents will occur. The synchronous lifting of a large prefabricated bridge is studied. According to the requirements of synchronous lifting of the bridge, the appropriate control strategy is selected and the hydraulic system of synchronous lifting device is designed. The mathematical model of the synchronous lifting hydraulic system is established, and the fuzzy PID controller is applied. The simulation of the fuzzy adaptive PID control system for the synchronous lifting device is carried out by using MATLAB simulation software, and the simulation results indicate that the rationality of the control system is verified. The experimental results show that the control of the system is convenient and the synchronization accuracy is high, which can provide a reference for the synchronous lifting control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"This paper reveals various constraints in digital way of estimating the age of human facial image. The age estimation involves analyzing the facial features and classifying the age in accordance to the extracted feature values. The biometric features such as the facial parts (eye, mouth, chin, forehead, hair), texture, color and shape provide essential aging details. In the proposed method, the fractal features are extracted using fractal directional code method to retain the significant details present in the input image. The fractal features along with the local features are used to train the system. The deep neural network with three layers is used to train the system. The scaled conjugate gradient back propagation trains the system and the age is classified into seven age groups (0-10, 11-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 and 60-69). Higher accuracy is achieved by concocting the biometric features and the fractal features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noting that the quantisation partitions constructed to minimise the estimation error are not independently encodable at each node, a novel technique of compressing the partitions into sets of codewords while ensuring a perfect independent encoding is presented, leading to the sets with reasonable cardinality, which enables transmission of multiple codewords at nodes for estimation. Experiments demonstrate a significantly improved performance over various quantiser designs while achieving about 26% reduction in the size of codeword sets compared with a recent design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,"A varactor-less cross-coupled voltage-controlled oscillator based on triple frequency is presented in this paper, which is optimized for a low phase noise and low power at the high frequency. The VCO consists a voltage to current, a triple frequency, and a mixer with band-pass filter. The varactor-less VCO adjusts the frequency with the current and voltage of transconductance cell. A network R-F-C-F-R-F is applied to filter out the noise of current source at 2. The proposed circuit was simulated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS RF technology with a 1.5 V supply voltage.

14,"In this paper a position sensorless controlled synchronous-reluctance machine is optimised with regard to efficient operation. The operation of the motor is divided into a low and a high speed range with consideration of the sensorless control method. At low speed range the INFORM method is used, which is based on the magnetical anisotropy of the rotor. A suitable selection of the rotor geometry can have a considerable effect on the sensorless properties and furthermore on the achievable efficiency. At higher speeds, the back-EMF model is compared to the short-circuit model. The implementation of a suitable sensorless method can lead to a significant efficiency improvement of the drive. Finally, the proposed sensorless control methods discussed in this paper are verified by measurements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Forensic HFE attempts to understand and explain factors that may have contributed to specific human-system failures or injury events. It involves, by definition, after-the-fact review of available evidence as well as activity analysis of all involved parties and possibly site inspection, when warranted. An often-overlooked explanation for road crashes is visual misperception and illusions, which come in a variety of forms. The possible involvement of visual misperception in crash causation can be evaluated during a comprehensive site inspection under conditions that correspond as much as reasonably possible to the actual conditions that existed at the time of the crash. Two case studies are described that illustrate the value of site inspection in uncovering the possible contribution of visual misperception in these nighttime fatal crashes; case 1 involving visual illusion, and case 2 involving signal ambiguity. These cases demonstrate that site visits at night can be helpful in uncovering important visual phenomena that might not otherwise be apparent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17,"Random variation in buried oxide thickness strongly affects the digital performance of ultra-thin body germanium-on-insulator MOSFETs. Dependencies of threshold voltage, ON-current, OFF-current and subthreshold slope of ultra-thin body germanium-on-insulator MOSFETs on three different BOX dielectrics are examined by employing well-calibrated Synopsys TCAD. The variation of threshold voltage and ON-current becomes less sensitive with high-k BOX dielectrics whereas smaller variation of OFF-current is observed for the device with low-k BOX dielectrics. The subthreshold slope remains almost unaltered for all BOX dielectrics. Furthermore, a positive substrate bias is found to suppress variability of digital performance parameters of GeOI p-MOSFETs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accompanying the increasing research interests in nanodevices, developing effective design automation algorithms in different abstraction levels becomes an urgent need. However, the prosperity in the device aspect results a unique difficulty in the algorithm aspect, i.e. it is hard to provide a common object model, data structure used in design automation algorithms, for a specific nanodevice. To freeing algorithm researchers from developing different object models with only minor differences in different algorithms, the authors propose a method of creating object model automatically through C++ template meta programming.

20,"This letter investigates the energy efficiency (EE) optimisation of a distributed multiple-input single-output (D-MISO) system, and a suboptimal power allocation (PA) scheme with low complexity is developed for D-MISO system with beamforming. Different from the existing optimal PA scheme that needs iterative calculation, the developed scheme can provide closed-form PA and no iteration is required. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the upper bound of EE is first obtained, and then the optimised objective function is formulated subject to a set of power budget constraints. By maximising this upper bound, a suboptimal PA scheme for the system is derived, and closed-form PA coefficients are attained. Interestingly, it is found that the proposed scheme has the same general form of PA as the optimal scheme. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, it can achieve the EE performance very close to that of the existing optimal scheme due to better approximation, but it has lower complexity than the latter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"A novel technology based on aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN)/GaN hybrid-anode diode (HAD) for precise modulation of turn-on voltage is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. By delicately tailoring the as-grown barrier thickness, the turn-on voltage of the HAD and yet the non-linearity at zero bias (i.e. 0 V) for efficient microwave detection can be flexibly modulated. An AlGaN/GaN ultra-thin-barrier HAD (UTB-HAD) was designed and fabricated for zero-bias microwave detection. The AlGaN-barrier thickness was optimised to be 5 nm by TCAD simulation, which yields a strong non-linearity at zero bias featuring a high-curvature coefficient (gamma) of 27 V-1 in the fabricated UTB-HAD. The first-order voltage sensitivity beta(V) is projected to be as high as 2.7 mV/mu W. The proposed approach of precise sensitivity modulation is of great interests for high-efficient zero-bias microwave detection applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

24,"This paper presents a discrete-time Geo/G/1 retrial queue with two waiting buffers to model an ATM network, in which the server begins a single vacation in cases where the system is empty at the instant of a service completion. New arriving customer who finds the server being on vacation can decide to either enter the retrial buffer with some probability p or leave the system with complementary probability 1-p. But the new arriving customer can begin its service immediately if he finds the server idle and join the original buffer if he finds the server busy. We first carry out an extensive analysis of the model by using the supplementary variable method and the generating function approach, and give some performance measures, such as server's state probabilities and mean queue lengths in the original buffer, retrial buffer, and in the system. Secondly, we give the generating function of the sojourn time of a customer in the system and prove that Little's law still holds in our model. Sensitivity analysis and cost optimization are finally given for illustrative purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"This paper analyzed the drying process of the household gas clothes dryer (GCD) based on the principle of heat and mass transfer. The drying models in three scenarios were established: natural gas burned in combustion chamber, ambient air mixed with exhausted gas in hot gas duct, and clothes were dried in the drying drum. The simulation of the drying process was performed on MATLAB software. And the effectiveness of the drying model was verified by comparison with experiment results. The effects of gas flow rate, dry mass of clothes, ambient temperature, ambient humidity, textile type, and moisture extraction rate (MER) on the performance of dryers were studied. This paper provided a theoretical basis for the design and optimization of GCDs. It was found that the drying time of the gas clothes dryer was mostly affected by the gas flow and dry mass of clothes, and the specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) was mostly affected by the ambient temperature and relative humidity. The nylon clothes have the fastest MER and the smallest SMER. Moreover, reducing operating time in falling-rate drying period can improve energy efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"A new architecture for a thin (2-cm depth) rear projection display is described. In order to achieve this small depth, a very high density of rear projectors is used. Three prototype displays using rear projectors on both 5- and 2-cm pitch arrays are described. The displays can achieve an effective screen pixel pitch of as small as 0.5 mm, which makes this technology competitive in terms of resolution with fine pitch LED displays; however, orders of magnitude fewer LEDs are required: Each rear projector requires only one white LED and a color liquid crystal light modulator. In the three prototypes, the projector light modulators utilize 101-cm (40 in.), 80-cm (31.5 in.), and 60-cm (24 in.) diagonal liquid crystal display glass. To minimize cost, no lenses are utilized for the rear projectors. An RGB LED array may augment the projector array, which provides a low resolution component of the image onto which the high resolution component is superimposed by the projector array. Edge gaps between active areas on adjacent LCD glass units are completely eliminated by the rear projection approach enabling low profile wall-size seamless displays. Display contrast depends on rear projection screen design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

30,"In order to quickly suppress voltage fluctuations at the point of common coupling (PCC) caused by the doubly fed induction generator, a closed-loop control method of the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is proposed, through which proportional integral (PI) parameters of the current inner loop can be adjusted online. The core aim is to derive quantitative relationships between the PI parameters and the output current of the STATCOM based on combining mathematical mechanization theory (MMT) with digital signal processing. Due to the reduction and quasidivision of the MMT, this original control method can be used to adjust the PI parameters of the STATCOM online according to the actual sampling voltage and sampling current data.

31,"This study proposes the design of broad-band microstrip loop antennas with less-dispersive group velocity of radiation patterns for accurate direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. The proposed structure consists of radiating and feeding microstrip loops, and the radiating loop is electromagnetically coupled to the feeding loop. This feeding mechanism helps to suppress phase variations of radiating patterns by avoiding dual resonances within a wide frequency band over 60 MHz, which allows to obtain the less-dispersive group velocity for accurate DoA estimation. The effectiveness of the less-dispersive behaviour is validated by implementing the proposed structure into a four-element array to estimate vertical and horizontal placements using dual-axis phase interferometry. The results confirm that the proposed antenna has less-dispersive group velocity compared to a conventional microstrip patch antenna and is more suitable for accurate DoA estimation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"This paper presents an investigation of the influence on the shear force distribution and on the displacements of reinforced concrete bracing walls continuous through a basement, when modelling these walls. The shear forces and displacements are compared with those obtained when simplifying the wall by a cantilever with full fixity at the top of the basement, ignoring the transfer of shear force and bending moment into the basement. First, the influence of the basement is modelled by hinged connections between the wall and the base slab and the floor diaphragm above the basement, respectively. This will result in an unrealistically large wall shear force in the basement. Then, the flexural restraint of the wall by the base plate, and the lateral compliance of the floor diaphragm are modelled by a rotational spring and a lateral spring at those levels. Recommendations are given for reasonable values of the spring constants for practical design purposes. Special attention is given to the way in which including the basement in the mechanical model of such walls will influence aspects of their seismic design. Such aspects are the rigidity of the bracing system which influences the lateral earthquake loads, and the displacement ductility factor which influences the maximum admissible behaviour factor q.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35,"This paper presents an empirical study to determine whether alterations to graphical features (colour and size) of automatically generated LineSets improve task performance. LineSets are used to visualise sets and networks. The increasingly common nature of such data suggests that having effective visualisations is important. Unlike many approaches to set and network visualisation, which often use concave or convex shapes to represent sets alongside graphs, LineSets use lines overlaid on a graph. LineSets have been shown to be advantageous over shape-based approaches. However, the graphical properties of LineSets have not been fully explored. Our results suggest that automatically drawn LineSets can be significantly improved for certain tasks through the considered use of colour alongside size variations applied to their graphical elements. In particular, we show that perceptually distinguishable colours, lines of varying width, and nodes of varying diameter lead to improved task performance in automatically laid-out LineSets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"A robust private sector in space can be instrumental in achieving major space policy goals, such as those promoted by the U.S. Government: fostering private space markets and reducing the cost and time required for the government to develop and procure space systems. Meeting these goals will likely require increased government attention to the challenges facing the private sector, as well as potential implementation of new or underutilized regulatory, policy, and economic mechanisms. This article focuses on a government strategic investment fund as a potential economic mechanism, which would make equity investments in companies pursuing activities of interest to the government, and offers examples of past and current funds both in the United States and internationally. This article then assesses the utility of such a fund in addressing the challenges with meeting these 2 policy goals; these challenges were identified through a literature review and interviews with >60 space experts, economists, and other stakeholders. We identified 5 major challenges to fostering the growth of private space markets and 4 challenges to reducing government costs and accelerating the development and procurement of space systems. Our analysis concludes that although a government strategic investment fund may be useful in select scenarios, it will not most effectively address the current challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

38,"The monopoly electricity market in Indonesia uses flat tariffs but is being encouraged to change to dynamic pricing. Dynamic pricing scenarios have been implemented in many Western countries with various types of schemes. This paper discusses dynamic pricing scenarios based on residential load and generation in the Java-Bali system. The tariff scheme is a combination of critical peak pricing (CPP) and time-of-use (TOU). The CPP runs for only a few hours each year depending on the gas power plant operation. TOU will be used with peak and off-peak schedules as determined based on residential load characteristics. The gas power plant is a reference in designing the CPP rates because it is used to meet peak loads if other plants are unable to meet requirements and its cost of generating electricity is high compared to other power plants. The dynamic pricing scheme is simulated for a residential load.

39,"Catalytic CO oxidation on platinum group metals can exhibit nonlinear behaviors like catastrophe, bistability, and hysteresis, which are indicative of self-organizing processes occurring in the course of the oxidation reaction. As a result, the system demonstrates a multi-branch nonlinear input/output relationship for which the output value depends not only on the instantaneous input values, but also on the history of operations. Traditional linear control approaches may cause unstable operation in the CO oxidation reaction. In this paper, a nonlinear control strategy is proposed to solve the control problem. The control strategy incorporates a PI controller and a switching control strategy by which the control system can maintain a high regulating performance while preventing unstable operation. It may be applied to control operations in industrial processes of catalytic CO oxidation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"This paper considers the structural modeling of reinforced concrete beam-column (RCBC) joints of unbraced framed structures. The main objective is to establish a formula that determines, for each particular situation, if the centreline joint model may be used or if an explicit model, which although more accurate is also more complex, is required. Accordingly, in order to circumvent the need to analyze the full frame and to avoid the shortcomings of empirical procedures we derive simplified classification criteria (SCC) based on the stiffness of the joint components. By applying these SCC to a given RCBC joint, it is classified either as semi-rigid, meaning that an explicit model is required, or as nominally rigid otherwise. The determination of the parameters that are required by the SCC is fully discussed. The presented example illustrates the application of the developed SSC to particular RCBC joints, showing that its results are mainly confirmed by the analysis of the full frame to which they pertain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"Pakistan is one of the coal rich countries but only adds 10% of electricity to the national grid from coal fired power plants while major sources are, Hydel, LNG, Furnace oil, and natural gas. Prior to the discovery of Thar coal reservoirs, Lakhra was the largest coal field of Brown Lignite coal with high ash and sulfur contents, i.e. 30% and 7%, respectively. The power generation capacity of the plant is 150 MW. Study conducted revealed that all the existing values of un-washed coal found (High Ash, Low Moisture, Low Fixed Carbon, High Sulfur, and Low Calorific value) while the washed coal values found (Low Ash, Low Moisture, High Fixed Carbon, Low Sulfur, and High Heating value). The emission of hazardous gases and particles by using unwashed coal adversely affect the environment and human health whereas washed coal exhibited relatively low level emissions of these pollutants. It was observed that the washed coal of Lakhra is more feasible to save the environment as well as Cost Benefit for production of electricity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"In this paper, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) transmissions with multiple-input single-output transceiver pairs are considered. In each pair, a multi-antenna transmitter sends data and energy to a single-antenna receiver with a signal-splitting structure and a non-linear energy harvesting model. Each transceiver pair tries to achieve high individual harvested energy efficiency, and uses artificial noise (AN) to protect the information from being overheard by other users that cooperate like a virtual eavesdropper. The weighted sum user-centric harvested energy-efficiency maximisation problem is formulated under constraints on the required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each receiver, plus a limited SINR for virtual eavesdroppers and limited transmit power at each transmitter. The optimal precoding beamforming, AN, and signal-splitting factors are obtained by two proposed algorithms. The first solution exploits semidefinite relaxation and sequential parametric convex approximation techniques to convert the non-convex problem to a series of convex subproblems with matrix variables. We obtain optimal beamforming vectors along with an optimal covariance matrix for AN. The second solution directly utilizes beamforming approximation and obtains a low complexity solution for the convex subproblem. Moreover, we need to apply the feasible point pursuit method. Finally, numerical evaluations are provided in comparison with some benchmark schemes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"In this article, five particle size fractions such as +0.500 mm, 0.500-0.250 mm, 0.250-0.125 mm, 0.125-0.074 mm, and -0.074 mm were used to investigate the synergistic effect of particle heterogeneity and size on the hydrophobicity characterization of low rank coal surfaces using induction time and wetting thermodynamic measurements. The high induction time result of +0.500 mm size fraction with low ash content proved that the physical property, especially particle size, has a significant effect on induction time and wetting thermodynamic measurements. Moreover, LHR value and combustible recovery of 0.250-0.125 mm size fraction were higher than that of 0.125-0.074 mm size fraction, which indicated that the induction time measurement was greatly affected by the chemical property, i.e. heterogeneity. Furthermore, wetting thermodynamic measurements can be used as the supplement of induction time measurements while the ash content of the particle size fractions is close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"Occupational Applications This article describes techniques to evaluate combinations of percentile values when only the nominal percentile level and percentile values are known, but not the underlying data. The methods described can be employed to estimate anthropometric accommodation. One application is that of estimating accommodation from the sum of two or more percentile values when a desired dimension has not been directly measured, but can be estimated by combining the percentile values of two or more known percentile values (e.g. the percentile for seated eye height above the floor as the sum of 90th percentile values of seat height and eye height above the seat). A second application is to estimate the joint accommodation on multiple variables when two or more percentile values have been used to define dimensions (e.g. what is the joint accommodation for a chair seat when the height, depth, and width are defined by their respective 90th percentile values?). Technical Abstract Background: Several authors have noted the utility of combining percentile values, for example as sums of server response times, or as the proportion of cases in the intersection of sets of percentile-based parameters of objects, such as furniture dimensions. Purpose: This article describes methods to estimate unknown variances and correlations as a function of the percentages or quantiles of a distribution. Methods: Two methods are presented with which unknown variances and correlation values can be estimated. Variances are found by converting percentiles or quantiles to indicator function variables. As a result, the variance can be expressed as a function of the quantile. Similarly, there are limits on the range of correlation values, which are a function of the percentile or quantile. The midpoint of the range of possible correlation values can be used to estimate combinations of percentiles, as it minimizes the possible error due to estimates of the correlation value. Finally, estimates of combinations of percentiles are made using the derived variance and estimated correlation values. These estimates are compared with observed combinations. Results: The maximum possible error using these methods of estimating variances and correlations for combinations of two variables are illustrated for a selected range of quantiles. The maximum possible error is least at the extremes of the quantile range (e.g. for quantiles greater than the 90th or less than the 10th). Conclusions: In some instances where only limited data are available, such as a single pair of percentile values, it may be useful to draw some conclusions regarding the general population. The techniques described in this article allow for estimating the proportion of the population whose measurement values are concurrently less than or equal to the specified percentile values; or, to estimate the proportion of the population whose summed measurements are less than or equal to the sum of the known percentile values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"BACKGROUND Materials from renewable sources are in great demand to reduce carbon fingerprint. Olive pomace is a waste with high lignin content (>25%) and generated in high volumes. Therefore lignin from olive pomace is susceptible to be transformed into added value chemicals such as monomeric phenols through its catalytic depolymerization combining hydrogen donors (i.e. molecular hydrogen, polar protic solvents and formic acid) and catalysts based on transition metals (i.e. palladium and ruthenium supported on carbon, and SHVO catalyst, also ruthenium-based). RESULTS The reaction conditions for the nitrogen and hydrogen experiments were temperatures of 250 and 200 degrees C and initial pressures of 4 and 20 bar respectively. The bio-oil obtained after the catalytic process was approximately half of the initial sample weight, although somewhat lower under hydrogen conditions. The SHVO catalyst yielded 15 and 10% of monomeric phenols under nitrogen and hydrogen conditions respectively, while the other two catalysts yielded between 6 and 9% irrespective of the gas. CONCLUSION Overall, the SHVO catalyst provided a richer mixture of phenolic compounds owing to its milder hydrogenation activity compared with the other catalysts, although at the end of the reaction the catalyst did not preserve its native form. The use of formic acid under nitrogen atmosphere was advantageous to increase the yields of phenols. The most abundant monomers in the experiments using SHVO catalyst under both atmospheres were 4-propylguaiacol, (Z)-propenylguaiacol, 4-propylsyringol, dihydroconiferyl alcohol, (Z)-propenylsyringol and dihydrosinapyl alcohol.

46,"Salient object segmentation is an important computer vision problem having applications in numerous areas such as video surveillance, scene parsing, autonomous navigation etc. For images, this task is quite challenging due to clutter/texture present in the background, low resolution and/or low contrast of the object(s) of interest etc. In case of videos, additional issues such as object deformation, camera motion and presence of multiple moving objects make the foreground object segmentation a significantly difficult and open problem. However, motion pattern can also act as an important cue to identify the foreground objects against the background. This is exploited by the recent approaches via aggregation of temporally perturbed information from a series of consecutive frames. Unfortunately for images, this additional cue is not available. In this paper, we propose to emulate the effect of such perturbations by constructing a bag of multiple augmentations applied on a single input image. Saliency features are estimated independently from each perturbed image in this bag, which are further combined using a novel aggregation strategy based on a convolutional gated recurrent encoder-decoder unit. Through extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets, we show better or very competitive performance when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We further observe that even with a bag constructed using simple affine transformations, we achieve impressive performances, proving the robustness of the proposed framework.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,A compact broadband eight-way substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) based radial power divider at C-band is presented in the article. Bandwidth enhancement is achieved by employing planar impedance transformer consisting of an annular slot and circular patch at the input and output feed positions. The equivalent circuit analysis helps in the optimization of the annular slot and circular patch on the substrate. The proposed compact power divider has fractional bandwidth of 53.5% for 15 dB input return loss. Broadband characteristics are achieved without using any bulky mechanical arrangement for feed matching.

48,"The adaptive pseudocomponent characterization method for continuous mixtures was extended to mass transfer problems using the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion model. It is based on the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMoM), using a quadrature rule to discretize the molar fraction distribution of the continuous mixture. The solution method was applied to two one-dimensional mass transfer problems: the transient diffusion in a Loschmidt tube and the steady-state diffusion in a thin film. In the latter, it was showed that the DQMoM equations reduce to an equivalent problem with a fixed characterization and solution methods for linearized theory problems can be employed. For these two problems, the proposed method was verified against the discrete component model (DCM), whose implementation was also verified against existing solutions. Results showed that the adaptive method with five pseudocomponents predicts the mixture properties with maximum relative deviation smaller than 1% when compared to the DCM with 57 components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,This paper presents an all-digital 1-1 MASH Delta time-to-digital converter (TDC) using time-mode signal processing. A cascode time adder with a raised inverter threshold voltage is proposed to minimize the deterministic timing error caused by the current mismatch of the discharge paths of the time adder. A differential time integrator consisting of a pair of identical single-ended time integrators is proposed to minimize the effect of the nonlinearities of the single-ended time integrator. The random and deterministic timing errors of the TDC are analyzed. The TDC is designed in an IBM 130 nm 1.2 V CMOS technology and analyzed using Spectre from Cadence Design Systems with BSIM4 device models. Simulation results demonstrate that the TDC exhibits 40 dB per decade noise-shaping at high frequencies. The cascode-configured discharge paths and raised threshold voltage of the load inverter improve the linearity of the TDC. The TDC achieves 1.9 ps time resolution over 48-415 kHz signal band while consuming 502 mu W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,"Fast pyrolysis of corn stover was carried out in a pilot scale fluidized bed reactor in nitrogen atmosphere. The effects of varying gas flow rates at optimum reaction temperature of about 500oC and feed size of < 1.0 mm on yield and composition of bio-oil, char and gas were investigated. The results for three runs with flow rate of gas of 45, 80 and 70 L/min, respectively, were obtained. The distribution of pyrolysis products was calculated gravimetrically by mass balance and corrected with optimization mass model using proximate and ultimate analysis of feedstock and pyrolysis products. The maximum yield of bio-oil (52 wt%) was obtained in run 3 with flow rate of gas of 70 L/min having heating value of 21.20 MJ/kg. GC-MS analysis identified the major chemical compounds present in the bio-oil which were levoglucosan, hydroxyl acetaldehyde, acetol, acetic acid, phenols, 2-methyl-2-cylopenten-1-one, guaiacol, 2(5H)-furanone, fufuryl alcohol, p-cresol and 2-ethyl alcohol. The bio-oil produced from run 3 had higher amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons, non-methoxylated phenolics, levoglucosan and smaller amounts of acids.

Fifteen commercial carbon nano-particulate materials have been investigated and categorized according to their extinction efficiencies and scattering percentages when measured in-situ. The extinction efficiencies were measured both in liquid suspensions, which allows various mechanisms for particle separation, and in-situ.

52,"An experimental campaign was carried out to investigate the characteristics of the transitional supersonic wake downstream of a single roughness element. Two Mach numbers were tested, 1.6 and 2.3, and two roughness heights, 0.1 mm and 1 mm. Unsteady and steady wall temperature measurements were taken along and across the roughness wake. The spatial trends of adiabatic wall temperature and heat flux, and the spectral time evolution of temperature were documented in this paper. The initial wall temperature was varied during the temperature measurements, and the resulting steady and unsteady effects on the roughness wake were investigated. The streamwise trends of heat-flux and adiabatic-wall temperature confirmed the transitional nature of the roughness wake. Spectral analysis showed that roughness height and initial wall temperature had the same type of effect on the wake wall-temperature fluctuations. The effect of roughness height was more sensible at Mach 2.3, ant that of the initial wall temperature was more evident with the smallest roughness also tested at Mach 2.3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

55,"Purpose - Metalworking fluids can significantly increase the tool life in titanium cutting, however, full-scale cutting tests to determine the performance of metalworking fluid are expensive. The aim of this study is therefore to introduce a reliable and inexpensive alternative testing method. Design/methodology/approach - A newly developed in-process tribometer allows emulating the sliding conditions of the chip formed in cutting as closely as possible. It uses a cutting action in front of a pin to eliminate the influence of the oxidation layer. To observe the wear pattern on the pin, adhering workpiece material is removed by selective etching. A high temperature oxidation test is used to study the wear mechanism. Findings - The wear pattern on the pin correlates well with the wear pattern observed on cutting tools when using the same metalworking fluid while being much more cost-effective than a tool life test. The high temperature oxidation test reveals that cobalt leaching is causing notch wear. Research limitations/implications - The correlation between pin and tool wear is verified for the case of roughing turning of titanium with cemented carbide tools and two metalworking fluids. Practical implications - The method is applicable in an industrial context, potentially replacing the currently used tribological analyzes. Social implications - Submitted in connection with the special issue ""young tribologists - insights into the work of the new generation"". Originality/value - Methods tailored to model the tool wear in titanium cutting are rare.

56,"In the wake of digitalisation, a trend towards precise regulation and standardisation of individual steps has developed, far removed from an understanding of working in which the success of the work is paramount, and where the planners themselves decide upon the actual planning method.

In future, these standards will dictate to planning teams how they must undertake their planning work. Freelance planners in particular need to play a more active role in the shaping of these standards, along with the related question: ""How would we like to plan in future?"".

57,"Core holder is a common experimental device in the field of petroleum exploration. Each kind of core holder has an output port. The objective of this paper is to determine whether the output port will affect the fluid flow in the core. The function of the output port is to collect and derive the fluid. A compression ring with a thickness of 5 mm and a diameter of 25 mm was fabricated by using 3D printing technology. We add the ring between the rock sample and the output port. The ring does not affect the function of the output port but avoids direct contact between the output port and the core end face. We find that permeability test results obtained by adding a ring are larger than that obtained by the core holder without a ring. A numerical simulation model is established according to the size of the output port. The influence of the output port on the velocity and pressure distribution in the rock sample is analyzed by using the coupling of Stokes and Darcy flow numerical simulation method. It is pointed out that the output port affects the fluid flow within 5 mm near the end face of the rock sample. The fluid velocity is unstable in the range of 5 mm near the end face of the rock sample. In order to reduce the influence of the output port on fluid flow in the core, five new types of output port grooves are designed in this paper. Comparing the numerical simulation results of different grooves schemes, it is considered that adding a 5 mm cylindrical cavity between the output port and the rock sample can reduce the influence. It is suggested that the output port should not be in direct contact with the core, and the output port and the end face of the core should be separated by 5 mm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highly non-convex THPM problem is formulated under requirements for the data rate, the amount of harvested power, and with limited power at the transmitters. First, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and sequential parametric convex approximation are exploited to convert the non-convex THPM to a series of convex subproblems. Then, slack variables replacing interference are introduced to allow decomposing into distributed subproblems via ADMM.The interesting point is that optimal precoding matrices of the local subproblems satisfy the rank-1 constraints of SDR.

70,"In asynchronous duty-cycled wireless sensor networks (WSNs), each node has its own sleep schedule that is independent of the schedules of neighboring nodes. Since each node follows its own independent sleep schedule, the probability that a node's neighbors will wake up concurrently is quite low. For this reason, each single hop broadcast must be completed through multiple unicast transmissions, and the sender node must remain awake until all of its neighboring nodes have received the broadcast packet. In this paper, we present two energy efficient broadcast protocols, namely Broadcast Progress-based Efficient Multihop Broadcast (BPEMB) protocol and Tree-based Efficient Multihop Broadcast (TEMB) protocol, for asynchronous duty-cycled WSNs. In both of the proposed protocols, the decision of whether to transmit the broadcast packet is based on the link quality information and without any forwarder's guidance list. The redundant transmissions and collisions are avoided effectively with cooperation among the neighbors, so that the node with the best link quality to the receiver node takes responsibility to forward the packet to the receiver node. With this approach, nodes that are not involved in transmitting the broadcast packet can go to sleep and save their energy. In the BPEMB protocol, the forwarding decision of transmitting the broadcast packet is also influenced by the broadcast progress information, which is piggybacked in the broadcast packet. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed protocols can significantly improve the broadcast efficiency through reducing the energy consumption and minimizing the broadcast latency. The evaluation results also show that both the BPEMB and TEMB protocols can substantially reduce the collisions and redundant transmissions in asynchronous duty-cycled WSNs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

73,"Stable detonation flame arresters with nominal diameters from DN50 to DN300 were tested in accordance with the ISO 16852 standard, and the criteria for determining steady detonation were studied. According to the results of flame arrester tests, using the inner diameter of the pipeline as the basis for the pressure division yielded more accurate results, which was not clearly described in ISO 16852 standard. The target values of P-md/P-TB for the DN50 flame arrester were too small. Further studies are needed to determine appropriate ratios of P-md/P-TB for flame arresters with different pipe diameters. The run-up distance required to form stable detonation was beyond L = 120 D, which is commonly believed to be the required distance for stable detonation to establish. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the conditions where flame arresters to be used and the conditions under which the flame arresters were tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,"A vertical caisson breakwater on soft intercalated ground (sand replacement in the upper layer) is highly susceptible to catastrophic failure when subjected to excessive cyclic loadings. In this paper, the cyclic stability of a caisson-rubble-ground system under different sand replacement conditions is investigated via finite element methods. Structure-soil interfaces and undrained strength degradation of the soft intercalated layer are two key considerations. The latter is implemented by modifying the Yasuhara model to quantify the strength degradation in terms of the number of cycles and stress level. Cyclic responses with different replacement ratios r (i.e., the ratio of backfilled sand layer thickness to initial total soft layer thickness) are presented in terms of pore pressure and strength degradation. Failure modes and safety factors are also investigated. Numerical results show that the pore pressure and strength degradation of the soft layer mainly occurred underneath the rubble mound, and were evident at small replacement ratios. The failure modes could be caisson sliding (r <= 0.35), soft ground bearing capacity failure (r > 0.50), or a combination thereof (0.35<r <= 0.50). The safety factor first increased and then approached a constant value with increasing replacement ratios. The findings herein provide a practical implication for safety evaluation and structural design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"Repairing concrete structures with carbon reinforced textile concrete under wet conditions or even underwater is not yet taken in to account according to the German abZ. Nonetheless, it can be assumed that there is a high potential for application in outdoor areas /facilities like channels or sewers which are fully exposed to weathering or even partially flooded with water. Recent research already shows that there are possibilities of applying textile reinforced carbon concrete under such conditions, which finally led to the entitled pilot project that has already successfully been completed. This project was a highly damaged duct liable to collapse in the centre of Feldafingen. The repair must be performed as quickly as possible while traffic and thus access to the adjacent properties must be granted. To meet these requirements, it was necessary to combine the standardised shotcrete method with still developing carbon concrete technology and perform extensive underwater tests prior to the project itself. It was possible to restore the duct with an additional layer of only 70 mm thickness. Furthermore, the flow speed of the water was improved by the seamless and smooth surface of the carbon concrete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,"A Holling-Tanner system with Beddington-DeAngelis functional response and prey refuge takes the form x' (t) = x(t)(1 - x(x) - (1 - m)x(t)y(t)/a(1) + b(1 - m)x(t) + c(1)y(t), y' (t) = y(t) [delta - beta y(t)/ (1 - m)x(t)] is investigated in this paper, where a(1), b, c(1) , delta, and beta are all positive constants, m is a nonnegative constant which satisfies 0 <= m < 1. For the system without prey refuge, i.e., m = 0 case, by developing the new analysis technique, we show that C-1 >= 2 is enough to ensure the global attractivity of the positive equilibrium of the system, such a result seems amazing since it is independent of the parameter a(1), b, delta and beta. Consequently, we can draw the conclusion that for the most of the parameters, system admits a unique globally attractive positive equilibrium. For 0 < c(1) < 2, we also investigate the stability property of the positive equilibrium. Two examples together with their numerical simulations show the feasibility of the main results. For the system with prey refuge, we show that there exists a m*, such that for all m > m*, the system always admits a unique positive equilibrium, which means that enough large prey refuge can improve the coexistence of the species. Refuge plays important role on the persistent property of the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

78,"To deal with the large error of burst height measurement for novel optional burst height millimeter wave proximity fuses in new-generation long-range projectiles, a ground object recognition strategy based on echo polarization is proposed in this paper. In the height measurement process, there are many factors, including the flight condition of the projectile, tall objects, ground clutter, interference signals, etc. restricting measurement accuracy. Therefore, a novel measurement scheme is urgently needed to enhance the accuracy of height measurements. The method mainly distinguishes the surface and ground objects within the range of the detected beam, under the condition that the detection area has apparent divisions. The polarimetric rotation-invariant parameters are used to analyze the features of ground objects. On the other hand, when the detection area does not have apparent divisions, the polarimetric echo reconstruction technology is used to determine the surface. Simulation experiments show the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method compared with the traditional height measurement system. Even in the presence of extensive interference, the method allows the accurate measurement of the projectile's height above the ground.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we compute members of the families of different types of heteroclinic connections, be them point-to-cycle, as well as, point-to-point connecting orbits. The physical meaning of these orbits in relation to the physical system is also discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,"In this paper two different water flood scenarios at Volga-Kama river in Russia are presented. First scenario is based on the existing water management approach that has been implemented in the period from 23 August 2013 until 22 August 2014. The second scenario is based on the original management approach aimed at mitigation of flood impact to the populated areas. The flood propagation has been modelled in HEC-RAS software, while post-processing and impact analysis were performed in QGIS 3.0. The results show that proposed original management approach allows to decrease the impact caused by inundation at Volga-Kama river basin by two times compared to the one implemented by the operator management approach. This result is achieved due to mitigation of the flood in highly populated areas and allowing additional water discharge among water management facilities in the areas with low population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

84,"In this paper, an effective multiuser detection (MUD) is proposed for direct sequence ultrawideband- (DS-UWB-) based space formation flying systems. The proposed method called GMM-MUD is based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to suppress multiple access interference. The GMM describes probability distributions of the hypothesis testing problem which is used for bit classification. To reveal the difference between correct bits and error bits, the preprocessing operation applies a mapping function based on optimal multiuser detection. The parameters of GMM are estimated by using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. EM algorithm employs iterative operation to simplify the complexity of maximum likelihood estimation method and considers the mapping values of received bits as the observations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GMM-MUD algorithm achieves good performances in terms of bit error rate performance, user capacity, and near-far resistance. Moreover, the computational complexity is low enough for space formation flying applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"The proliferation of digital radiography (DR) has led to a re-evaluation of exposure parameters and image quality. Currently, there is a move towards reducing X-ray tube voltage (kVp) in paediatric exposures down to 40 kVp to achieve better images. However, the effect on patient dose of these modifications is uncertain. The main aims of this phantom study were to evaluate the effect of reducing the kVp in paediatric limb DR exposures on contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and patient dose. For this purpose, Monte Carlo simulations of radiographic exposures on a paediatric limb phantom were performed. The phantom included muscle tissue and bone segments of five different densities in the range of 1.12 to 1.48 g/cm(3). The overall thickness of the phantom varied between 1 and 12 cm. Dependence of the CNR at constant limb phantom muscle and bone doses and dependence of the CNR per unit of muscle and bone dose at constant detector dose on radiographic exposure factors and limb thickness were calculated. X-ray tube current-time product (mAs) values required to achieve equal detector dose versus limb thickness for different kVp were calculated, as well as muscle and bone doses for the limb phantom of varying thickness. Present work has shown that reducing the kVp in paediatric radiography of the extremities can result in a significant increase in radiation dose, particularly for thicker limbs. Low kVp radiography requires justification for use on the extremities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

88,"This study proposes a novel model-free robot manipulator joint position and velocity tracking controller with a simple structure for controlling a robotic manipulator with human-like reaching motion according to human movement characteristics. The proposed design guarantees the responses of the tracking error within preset bounds using velocity feedback. A structurally and computationally natural logarithmic controller is designed to achieve joint position and velocity tracking of a desired trajectory of a reaching motion profile with prescribed performance (PP) bounds. Simulations of a three-degree-of-freedom spatial manipulator with the PP controller confirm the conclusions even in case of typical input disturbances. Results show that the PP controller outperforms the traditional position and derivative (PD) trajectory tracking controller without requiring excessive control effort. The proposed controller that uses sole velocity feedback achieves the control objective with bell-shaped joint velocity profiles and joint consistency. Thus, the proposed controller outperforms the traditional PD trajectory tracking controller that uses position and velocity feedback with comparable control effort. The experiment with a KURA robot manipulator demonstrates that the control algorithm of sole velocity feedback can be used to achieve smooth reaching movements within a short travelling time of less than 1 s. The movements are characterised by bell-shaped joint velocity profiles and joint position consistency similar to human movements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"As an engineering software for calculating the aerodynamic parameters of aircraft, Missile DATCOM is widely used in the design and demonstration stage of aircraft research. In this paper, a 2-dimensional (2D) trajectory correction projectile is taken as the research object, and the DATCOM calculation accuracy is analyzed. The results show that in the software parameter setting, although method 1 describes the body is not accurate enough, its own geometry generators can accurately describe the body contour. The aerodynamic parameters calculated by this method are more accurate than method 2. The aerodynamic parameters of the 2D trajectory correction projectile calculated by DATCOM have a large system error compared with the wind tunnel test data. This paper proposes a system error compensation method (SECM) to compensate the calculated data, which can greatly reduce the system error. After the error compensation correction, the axial force coefficient (C-A) error is reduced to less than 3%, and the normal force coefficient (C-N) error and the pressure center position (XCP) error are generally reduced to within 10% and 5%, when the sideslip angle is 0 degrees. When the sideslip angle is less than 4 degrees, the C-A error is less than 5%, and when the sideslip angle (beta) is less than 1 degrees, the main data error of C-N is less than 15%, and the main data error of XCP is less than 25% These errors meet the engineering calculation accuracy requirements. This method cannot completely replace wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation calculations, but it can greatly reduce the number of wind tunnel tests and the CFD simulations, and has strong application value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

92,"This paper analyzes the influence of different static limits representation of generators on the load margins in voltage stability studies. Usually, a static representation of reactive power limits sets the reactive power generation at a machine to its maximum (or minimum) capacity. In this paper, an approach that considers the internal voltage of generators is presented, so both models are compared. These procedures are established using conventional bus type and the remote control bus type representations (PQV, P and theta bus type). These models are applied to a multi-machine system under different operating conditions. This knowledge aggregates crucial information to the analysis of the operating limits of the system. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is the accurate determination of load margin when different generator reactive power limits models are considered. Hence, the role of the overexcitation of generators is highlighted as a function of the reactive power margin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been extensively studied in the literature. However, in hostile environments where node connectivity is severely compromised, the system performance can be greatly affected. In this work, we consider such a hostile environment where sensor nodes cannot directly communicate to some neighboring nodes. Building on this, we propose a distributed data gathering scheme where data packets are stored in different nodes throughout the network instead to considering a single sink node. As such, if nodes are destroyed or damaged, some information can still be retrieved. To evaluate the performance of the system, we consider the properties of different graphs that describe the connections among nodes. It is shown that the degree distribution of the graph has an important impact on the performance of the system. A teletraffic analysis is developed to study the average buffer size and average packet delay. To this end, we propose a reference node approach, which entails an approximation for the mathematical modeling of these networks that effectively simplifies the analysis and approximates the overall performance of the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
94,"Assuming all states are unavailable in a class of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models with uncertainty, this article consists of designs of observers and controllers. Unlike the traditional state observer that is usually designed for the whole state once and for all, this article partitions the whole state into two parts: one is independent of the input and the uncertainty, and the other is not. Following some unique matrix transformations, an observer of the former part is first developed, based on which observers of the latter part and the uncertainty are derived. Using the observers, a controller that guarantees an asymptotically stable closed-loop control system is proposed. Moreover, in order to determine the relevant design parameters more simply, it makes clear that the separate property is held in this case. (c) 2019 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

95,"Spectral analysis was performed on the time series data computed from pressure measurements on the New MEXICO (Model Rotor Experiments under Controlled Conditions) rotor in standstill conditions. As a priori, 3D airfoil polars were recreated from standstill measurements and compared against 2D airfoil polars and flat plate theory results to verify the measurements. The spectral analysis revealed the presence of dominant shedding frequencies for certain ranges of the geometric angle of attack. Two dominant shedding modes were identified: One was associated with bluff body vortex shedding, and the other was associated with low Strouhal number shedding. No dominant shedding frequencies were observed for angles of attack beyond 50 degrees. The research improves on our current understanding of the unsteady nature of the stall regime, along with providing insight into the existence of vortex-induced vibrations on a wind turbine in standstill conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the framework of the approach, we calculate the expected value of the rate of return. We extend the deterministic Endpoints and Modified Dietz rate of return models by viewing the investments transaction timings as random variables. Our main working assumption is that the transaction timings are uniformly distributed in a certain time interval. We study a series of new rate of return models that have a wide range of practical applications. Our results generalize some well-known rate of return formulas, including the renowned Modified Dietz formula.

99,"Although green networking and fairness are both vital and rapidly increasing areas of research, providing energy-fairness in multi-domain green networks is a hitherto unexplored issue. In this study, the authors address energy-fair routing in multi-domain green networks by formulating an optimisation problem as an integer linear programme. The authors' problem maximises the energy saving of the domain with minimum energy saving while ensuring that the energy consumption of each domain is below a given threshold. The model they have established in this study also provides a flexible bandwidth assignment mechanism which improves the feasibility performance of their methods. They then propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for this problem. They evaluate the performance of their heuristic algorithm by comparison with the results obtained from their integer linear programming formulation using optimisation software CPLEX. The simulation results demonstrate that the heuristic algorithm yields close results to the values obtained from the CPLEX implementation of their proposed formulation in terms of energy-fairness and outperforms the previous results while at the same time having low computational complexity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
