0,"This chapter deals with the linearization of SPSC MFC model. The linearized system is analyzed with two distinct manipulated input variable cases: (1) dilution rate as a input, and (2) influent substrate concentration as a manipulated input variable.

2,"A feedback methodology is developed for the correction of timing errors in double pulse laser systems operating at high repetition frequencies. With continuing developments in non-intrusive measurement techniques, such as particle image velocimetry, there is an ever-increasing demand for simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution, which can make them well suited to the spectral characterization of fluid flows. This application places significant importance on the accuracy and repeatability of the timing between successive laser pulses of high-speed, double-pulsed laser systems, as any timing errors propagate directly into the computed velocity vectors and indirectly into all other derived quantities, including the spectral analysis of the flow. The present work proposes a feedback methodology to measure and correct for such errors in a time-resolved manner. Lastly, the proposed methodology is demonstrated on a test case of a cylinder wake, and the results are compared to corresponding hot-wire measurements.",yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes
3,"A micro-trigger sensor for alarm or emergency protection under abnormal working conditions is proposed. The mathematical and mechanical models with scale-dependent are established using the Euler-Bernoulli beam hypothesis and the generalized elasticity theory. Meanwhile, governing equations are deduced using the principle of minimum potential energy. The design formulas of the trigger angular speed and acceleration for the micro-trigger sensor are established. The iteration method is used to solve the trigger angular speed that cannot be directly calculated by the design formula. The scale effects of the deflection of the microcantilever under angular speed and acceleration are analyzed by using generalized elasticity theory and classical elasticity theory, and significant scale effects are observed. Lastly, the control design of the micro-trigger sensor is investigated. It shows that the measurement range of the trigger angular speed and acceleration can be increased by adopting the two-circular ring co-regulation scheme.

5,"Computers and smartphones have become indispensable parts of human daily life. Driven by various modern applications, the demand for high-speed Internet connection is always growing. Because Internet speed strongly depends on signal strength and quality, a great deal of effort has been spent to increase the number of ""bars"" displayed on the screen of wireless devices. One effective approach toward ""more bars"" is deploying microwave relay systems to provide stronger signals, and thus higher data rates, to end users. Microwave relay links facilitate the transmission of signals from one point to another by receiving, recovering, and retransmitting wireless signals with enhanced quality and strength. With more bars on the end-user side, handheld wireless devices also become smaller because of reduced power consumption in their receivers. With the help of sophisticated radio relay links in the last mile of communications networks [1], wireless data can be efficiently communicated among a variety of devices, such as home appliances, smart Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and autonomous vehicles [2], [3].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"Purpose The finite element model developed for a new-designed aircraft was used to solve some problems of structural dynamics. The key purpose of the task was to estimate the critical flutter velocities of the light airplane by performing numerical analysis with application of MSC Software. Design/methodology/approach Flutter analyses processed by Nastran require application of some complex aeroelastic model integrating two separate components - structural model and aerodynamic model. These sub-models are necessary for determining stiffness, mass and aerodynamic matrices, which are involved in the flutter equation. The aircraft structural model with its non-structural masses was developed in Patran. To determine the aerodynamic coefficient matrix, some simplified aerodynamic body-panel geometries were developed. The flutter equation was solved with the PK method. Findings The verified aircraft model was used to determine its normal modes in the range of 0-30 Hz. Then, some critical velocities of flutter were calculated within the range of operational velocities. As there is no certainty that the computed modes are in accordance with the natural ones, some parametric calculations are recommended. Modal frequencies depend on structural parameters that are quite difficult to identify. Adopting their values from the reasonable range, it is possible to assign the range of possible frequencies. The frequencies of rudder or elevator modes are dependent on their mass moments of inertia and rigidity of controls. The critical speeds of tail flutter were calculated for various combinations of stiffness or mass values. Originality/value The described approach takes into account the uncertainty of results caused by the indeterminacy of selected constructional parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"The introduction of liquid-crystal display (LCD) for television and personal computer monitor has gained momentum in sales and distribution due to its portability and energy efficiency over traditional bulky cathode-ray tube (CRT) used in the manufacture of television and personal computer. The disposal of the cathode-ray tube is further having a major challenge due to its hazardous characteristics resulting from the composition of glass used in cathode-ray tubes. There are various recycling technologies available to extract toxic lead from funnel glass of cathode-ray tube. This chapter explores the status of cathode-ray tube, disposal, and environmental issues followed by potential challenges of segregating funnel and panel glass of cathode-ray tube. Separation of funnel and panel glass from the cathode-ray tube based on open-loop and closed-loop process is discussed with pros and cons. Cathode-ray tube glass-ceramic brick and concrete, vitrification glass to stabilize nuclear waste, and fluxing materials such as silica flux are gaining momentum on the reuse of cathode-ray tube under closed-loop process. The diamond cutting method for segregation of funnel glass from panel glass is highly recommended among the various potential segregation technologies available due to its vacuum adsorption and dust recovery capacity, automatic edge searching, and laser positioning. The study finds that emerging technology using furnace and chemicals for extraction of toxic lead from the cathode-ray tube is a promising method for management of recycling in an environmentally sustainable way without any residual waste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"This paper considers price and modularity of competition between two firms with deterministic demand, in which demand is dependent on both the prices and the modularity levels determined by two firms. Bertrand competition and Stackelberg competition are formulated to derive the equilibrium solutions analytically. Because of the complexity, an intensive numerical study is conducted to investigate the impact of the sensitive parameters on equilibrium prices and modularity levels, as well as optimal profits of the two firms. An important and interesting finding is that optimal profits of the two firms under both types of competition are decreasing with the modularity cost when the price and modularity sensitivities are low, where both firms are worse-off due to decrease of the modularity levels; but they are increasing when the price and modularity sensitivities are high, where both firms are better-off at the expense of modular design. Our research reveals that Stackelberg game improves the modularity levels in most of the cases, though both firms perform better in Bertrand competition in these cases when jointly deciding the prices and modularity levels in the two firms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"One fluid formulation is an approach used for modeling and analysis of mass transfer between two immiscible phases. In this study we implement and analyze the advantages and limitations of this approach for CO2 physical mass transfer into MEA. The domain is a flat plate and gas liquid flow is counter current. The analysis was carried for operating parameters like liquid phase Reynolds number, MEA mass fraction and the angle of inclination of flat plate. The results clearly show that the model effectively captures the deviation in liquid side mass transfer coefficient due to the surface instabilities and liquid properties which are generally neglected by standard correlations. Also the model shows that the standard Higbie correlation is preferable at low Reynolds number at any angle of inclination. The grid independent studies show that a size of 6.25 mu m is required in the interface region for effectively using this approach. The computational resource time at this resolution was found as the only limitation for using this approach and we suggest a procedure to overcome this limitation. The present simulation results can help CFD researchers investigating immiscible gas-liquid mass transfer using OpenFOAM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"The ability to characterize implant debris in conjunction with corresponding immune and tissue-destructive responses renders retrieval analysis as an important tool for evaluating orthopedic devices. We applied advanced analytics and in silico approaches to illustrate the retrieval-based potential to elucidate host responses and enable discovery of corresponding biomarkers indicative of in vivo implant performance. Hip retrieval analysis was performed using variables based on immunostaining, polarized microscopy, and fretting-corrosion and oxidation analyses. Statistical analyses were performed in R. Hierarchical/k-means clustering and principal component analysis were used for data analysis and visualization. Correlation Engine (CE) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were employed for in silico corroboration of putative biomarkers. Higher giant cell and histiocyte scores and positivity for CD68 and CD3 indicating infiltration with macrophages and T-cells, respectively, were detected mainly among older generation hips with higher ultra-high-molecular-weight-polyethylene loads. Our in silico analysis using pre-existing data on wear particle-induced loosening substantiated the role of CD68 in implant-induced innate responses and identified the CD68-related molecular signature that can be indicative of development of aseptic loosening and can be further corroborated for diagnostic/prognostic testing in clinical setting. Thus, this study confirmed the great potential of advanced analytics and in silico approaches for enhancing retrieval analysis applications to discovery of new biomarkers for optimizing implant-related preclinical testing and clinical management.

11,"This chapter gives an overview of the plate tectonic processes which are at the basis of the deposition of coal layers in the South-Limburg area: the plants from which the coal was formed were of tropical nature, and thus the region was once located in a tropical climate. The position of this part of Europe in the tropics is due to the movement caused by plate tectonics. This concerns the evolution of the former microcontinent Avalonia, which is now a part of Western Europe and North America. The formation of the coal layers is also described, and the most important carboniferous plants are mentioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,"Purpose This paper aims to enhance the selection of the best material of the rocket engine combustion chamber. The chamber has been destroyed during dynamometer tests, and the goal of this inspection is to verify the nature of the damage in the context of checking the usefulness of this type of graphite for the combustion chamber construction. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents the results of visual and microscopic inspection of the rocket engine combustion chamber of o50 x 165 mm in dimension, which was made of R type graphite. Findings An analysis of the fracture surface shows that in the inspected combustion chamber voids and inclusions are present. EDS analysis of the fracture surface shows that in the inspected combustion chamber inclusions are present which have a relatively high amount of elements like: Ti, C, S, V, Si, O and a relatively small amount of Fe and Ni.

14,"The addition mud density is a key part of drilling fluid design to avoid drilling accidents resulting from the pressure surge. However, the current standard of addition mud density is empirical and whether this empirical value can be applied to all wells, especially deep wells, deserves further study. In this paper, in order to quantitatively calculate the variation of downhole pressure during tripping, the transient wellbore surge pressure calculation model during tripping was established and verified by field data fist. Then, through the analysis of the surge pressure and its influencing factors during tripping, it was found that the current standard of addition pressure difference cannot be used as an empirical value for different sections of a well, while the addition mud density was more reasonable for the open hole safety in casing program design. However, the surge pressure was much smaller than the lower limit of current standard addition mud density under the actual working conditions. On the other hand, through the analysis of the wellbore pressure variation and its influencing factors when gas kick occurs, it was found that the variation of bottom hole pressure caused by gas kick was much smaller than that caused by tripping. Therefore, the surge pressure should be the main factor in the determination of addition mud density. Based on this, the determination method of addition mud density for each tripping section was proposed, which can calculate the addition mud density quantitatively and more reasonably for each tripping section based on the comprehensive consideration of factors such as wellbore pressure variation and formation pressure prediction error. The results showed that the current standards of addition mud density are too conservative in medium and shallow formations and may not meet the safety requirements in deep formations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"This study introduces a characterization technique for trap locations (X-t) with considerable trap density along the channel in field effect transistors (FETs). The technique is based on the experimental gate-to-source or gateto-drain capacitance-voltage (C-GS-V-GS or C-GD-V-GD) characteristics of FETs. As the gate bias (V-G) increases, the effective channel length (L-eff) extends by the increased conductivity of the channel from the source or the drain. Due to trapped charges at the trap sites with a high density of traps along the channel, abrupt change in the C-V characteristics is observed. For the transition gate bias (V-G,V-t) with abrupt change in the C-V characteristics, the dominant trap location (X-t) can be converted through the channel conduction factor (alpha(V-G) to be the effective channel length L-eff(V-G) = alpha(V-G).L-ch). We expect that the proposed C-V technique to be useful in non-destructive electrical characterization of lateral trap locations (interface states, bulk traps, and/or grain boundary traps caused by the bias stress and/or fabrication process) along the channel in FETs. We successfully applied the proposed technique to the p-channel poly-Si thin-film transistors (TFTs) for characterization of the grain boundary locations along the channel. As an example for the proposed technique, we applied the technique to a p-channel poly-Si TFT and obtained a dominant trap at X-GB1 = 3.13 [mu m] from the source and another at X-GB2 = 3.70 [mu m] from the drain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"Oriented-plane curvature reproduction, the control of fingertip deformation by orientating a flat plate on contact points to generate a sensation of curvature, is one of the curvature reproduction methods with favorable effects. However, among the three geometric cues of curvature, only the zeroth- and first-order information is recovered with this method, whereas the second-order information (i.e., local curvature) is neglected due to the oriented plate's inherent characteristic of having a planar surface. The second-order information will change the contact length between the finger and the surface and thus affects the feeling. As a solution for this problem, this paper proposes to control the indentation depth of the finger pulp on the oriented plate such that the correct contact length is reproduced during the rendering. A finger wearable device is developed to control that indentation depth. Three psychophysical experiments are carried out and the results indicate that the second-order information plays a positive role in curvature rendering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"This paper presents a novel approach for the modeling of noise behavior of III-V compound semiconductor based HBT's over a wide frequency range.

24,"In this study, cobalt oxides were loaded on a CeO2 nanorod and synthesized using a hydrothermal method and wet impregnation to reduce nitrogen monoxide (NO) by carbon monoxide (CO). A series of catalysts were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray spectroscopy (XPS), and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to determine the reacting path in the reduction zones. Co species were highly dispersed on the CeO2 nanorod when the precursor solution content was less than 20% by weight. Co3+ species were the most active components in the NO+CO reaction, and the Co3+ fraction reached a maximum when the precursor concentration was 10% by weight. A possible mechanism for the CO+NO reaction was suggested in which NO adsorbs onto the surface of CoOx-CeO2 and transforms to some nitrite/nitrate species under the reacting condition. At lower temperature (<300 degrees C), adsorbed CO species react with a nitro complex to generate N2O and CO2, whereas as the temperature increases, these nitro complexes transform to coordinate nitrates reacting with CO species to generate nontoxic N2 and CO2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

26,"Introduction Diaphragmatic myopotential oversensing (dMPO) by implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) is thought to be a rare condition that can be misdiagnosed as lead failure and lead to unnecessary lead replacement. We observed several cases of dMPO in patients with Sorin/LivaNova ICDs (MicroPort Sci.). We sought to systematically assess the incidence of dMPO in patients with Sorin/LivaNova ICDs. Methods and Results A predefined number of 100 consecutive patients with Sorin/LivaNova ICDs were prospectively included in the device clinic of our center. Stored arrhythmia episodes were checked for spontaneous dMPO. In addition, we performed provocation maneuvers by Valsalva. At least one episode of spontaneous or provoked dMPO was seen in 12 (12%) of the 100 patients included in the study (86% males, median age: 66 years). Nine of 89 patients (10%) with true bipolar and 3 of 11 patients (27%) with integrated bipolar sensing configuration were affected. Spontaneous dMPO was observed in 7 of 58 patients (12%) with sensitivity programmed to 0.4 mV and in 2 of 42 patients (5%) with sensitivity programmed to 0.6 mV (not significant). In three patients, dMPO could be provoked with no spontaneous episodes recorded. In two nonpacemaker-dependent patients with a CRT-D, ventricular pacing was temporarily inhibited. No antitachycardia therapy was triggered by dMPO in any patient. Conclusions DMPO is frequent in patients with Sorin/LivaNova ICDs, especially with sensitivity programmed to 0.4 mV. It also frequently occurs with true bipolar sensing configuration. DMPO should not be misinterpreted as lead failure to avoid unnecessary lead replacement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

28,"Friction Induced Vibrations occur in many different contexts, from automotive industry to musical instruments, and are often investigated for their detrimental effects such as surface damage and dynamical instabilities. In this article, a mechanical device exploits Friction Induced Vibrations to transfer energy in a structure from a primary ambient low-frequency vibrational field towards a secondary acoustic field with a higher and wider frequency content. This device constitutes a Secondary Acoustic Source for the structure. An approach is proposed to quantify the energy flow between the primary and secondary acoustic fields from the sole measurement of acceleration signals at a finite number of points on the experimental structure.

29,"Rapid and sensitive detection techniques for foodborne pathogens are important to the food industry. However, traditional detection methods rely on bacterial culture in combination with biochemical tests, a process that typically takes 4-7 days to complete. In this study, we described a high-flux polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for simultaneous detection of nine targeted genes (rfbE, stx1, stx2, invA, oprI, tlh, trh, tdh, and hlyA) with multiplex strains. The designed primers were highly specific for their respective target gene fragments. As the selected primers follow the principles of similar melting and annealing temperature, all the targeted genes could be detected for one strain with the same PCR program. Combining with 96-well PCR plate, by adding a single different gene to each well in each row, both the ATCC strains (E. coli, Salmonella spp., V. parahaemolyticus, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus) and the clinical strains (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus) were simultaneously detected to carry their specific and virulence genes.

30,"Integration of renewable energy sources into a distribution system requires adjustments and improvement of the existing relay protection systems. Application of the three-phase reclosing in radial distribution networks often leads to the island operation of the distributed power generation, which causes the generator's disconnection from the network. The application of the upgraded single-phase reclosing technique, which is proposed in this paper, enables a partial transfer of energy into the electric power system during the temporary fault. Thus, it contributes to the maintenance of the distributed generator transient stability during temporary faults in the distribution network. Improvement of single-phase reclosing technique is reflected in the adaptation to eliminate various types of faults that may occur. The analyses include different operation conditions and stability requirements of distributed generators. The proposed solution is presented in the paper by example of different types of distributed generation: a small hydropower plant with a synchronous generator that is directly connected to the distribution network, and a wind power plant with double fed induction generator and photovoltaic systems. The results of the analyses are presented in the form of dynamic simulations performed by DIgSILENT PowerFactory software using IEEE 33-bus model of distribution network.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

32,"With the analysis on the drawbacks of the traditional direct power control for three-phase pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier, including the unfixed switching frequency, the higher grid-side current harmonic component, and the longer system setting time, one method of the model predictive direct power control based on error correction for three-phase voltage source PWM rectifier is proposed in this paper. Based on instantaneous power theory, the PWM rectifier model predictive objective function of is built. Its partial derivative is calculated to predict the variations of active and reactive power in the next sampling period and achieve the tracking control for the given power of the next period. The second-order Lagrange interpolation method is introduced to correct the predict power to achieve the minimum error of active and reactive power between actual value and the predicted value. Instead of switch table, space vector PWM is adopted to drive the power switch of rectifier. This method simplifies power control inner-loop structure and is able to achieve the fixed switching frequency. The experimental results show that this method has better dynamic and static performance; the system is not sensitive to the change of inductance parameters; it can reduce the total harmonic distortion of grid current effectively and improve the power factor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

35,"Diode rectifiers are widely used in many applications, and therefore, there is a need for an accurate model to study the rectifiers. Because of the complexity and time consuming of the analytical model of rectifiers, the average value modeling has been introduced. This paper proposes a novel average value model (AVM) for the line-commutated rectifier bridge supplied with an unbalanced power source. The unbalance condition, here, refers to the asymmetry of the three-phase voltage magnitude and the three-phase impedance, which is possible due to the occurrence of asymmetry in the sources with winding such as power sources, generators, and transformers. According to the three-phase input current of the rectifier, one cycle is divided into some intervals, and the differential equation for each interval is provided. Then, utilizing these equations, the average value of the derivative of the load current is derived from which the average value of the load current and voltage can be calculated. The proposed AVM is then verified using simulation and experimental results for the diode rectifier bridge with the load of the brushless synchronous generator field winding. Besides, the model is investigated for different load and supply parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increasing amount of computational resources required by emerging applications need experienced programmers that fully exploit hardware resources. However, the hardware platforms and programming languages to leverage them evolve at a dizzying pace, making very challenging for students the successful learning of the continuously changing high-performance computing concepts. Research Questions (a) Is the learning curve of the programming language too steep to begin learning parallel programming fundamentals? (b) Are emergent learning methodologies making even more difficult to learn parallel programming in general? Methodology It is analyzed the main challenges for succeeding in parallel programming courses at the undergraduate level in two different learning modalities, namely on-campus and online. It is analyzed the main tools available within a learning management system, showing their impact on online studies. Findings Our results reveal that the steep learning curve for parallel programming is one of the main barriers to student success, leading to an early drop out of the subject. On-campus studies mitigate this problem through a close relationship between students and educators.

In such a blast scenario, the structures adjacent to a gun may undergo sudden and unwanted damages, since they are commonly subjected to the blast load due to the impingement and propagation of the shock waves expanding from the weapon muzzle. The proposed procedure pertains the coupled use of an in-house developed tool (GUNWave3D) based on the power-law scaling technique and a general-purpose commercial fast dynamic solver to compute the structural response of the loaded components. The in-house tool, in particular, allows one to rapidly calculate the blast parameters over the surfaces of the items of interest in the function of the weapon characteristics and launch conditions, also accounting for the asymmetric shape characterizing the gun blast wave. Taking as reference the numerical free field peak overpressure profiles of a 30 mm gun, whose blast quantities were already validated in a previously published work, the final stage of the assessment was accomplished. Such an estimation consists of the comparison between the structural stresses calculated using the blast loads predicted through the in-house tool and those computed adopting the free spherical air blast of the tri-nitro-toluene model. This operation has the objective to quantify the discrepancy between the computational results of two Lagrangian techniques that can be alternatively adopted in industrial gun blast design procedures and methodologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,"For years national and international research works on performance-based durability design concepts have been performed to improve economy and durability of concrete structures with a differentiated estimation of member resistance (solidity and cover of concrete) under different environmental conditions. First concepts already have been tested on specific projects. The present state of science - partly state of the art - and the chances and risks by using performance-based durability design concepts are presented in this article. As an example the descriptive requirements according to the present German standards and the performance based design of the resistance against chloride induced corrosion (XD-exposition) are compared and explained in detail. Furthermore the present knowledge of the corrosion intensity of reinforcing steel in cracks is summarised, in which chlorides were penetrated during one winter saison. This question is essential for reinforced concrete structures in car parks with and without surface protection systems.

40,"Inspired by the polymeric ""soft"" properties and divisional isolation of tandem processes in natural systems, an artificial reactor with self-screened catalytic ability was fabricated with a polymeric tri-layer architecture. The non-responsive middle layer encapsulated catalytic metal nanoparticles, while the two outer layers consisted of a negatively and a positively thermosensitive imprinted polymer. The inverse responsiveness of the outer layers induced switchable shapes, which led to alterable tandem channeling to the reactive middle layer and, as a result, the divisional admission of different substrates. This way, the reactor led to the formation of self-screened catalytic ability. The design for this artificial reactor offers promising prospects for struggling tandem catalysts, suggesting opportunities to develop schedulable tandem processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,"In this paper, we present our novel platform called Bo_CEM. It is composed of three levels: QoE Data Sources, QoE Monitoring System, and QoE Management System. The QoE Data Sources is an umbrella retrieving information from all sources. The monitoring systems are based on fuzzy logic in order to design a novel unique value called QoE score which is our main contribution as it uses customer profile indicators in addition to network KPIs. Finally, the QoE Management System is a high level of decision using the QoE Score as decision metric. The utility of the model is validated via three cases: The first one consists on the enhancement of the troubleshooting prioritization process for NOC Teams. The use of our new approach leads to increasing the operator's profit while customers still satisfied by the expected QoS. The second used case presents a new approach for SON Mobility Load Balancing. It allows the enhancement of the traffic load over network and increases the average QoE_score per e-NodeB. In the last case, our novel metric called QoE_Score is used to evaluate the QoE perceived by Wi-Fi customers in order to alleviate the LTE-A network and route traffic to Wi-Fi network.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,"Stiffened and unstiffened fillet-welded tube-to-transverse plate connection details are widely used for mast-arm and base-plate connections for highway sign structures. However, due to repetitive wind loads, cyclic fatigue stresses are induced and they are the primary source of failure in welded connections at these locations. The resistance of fatigue critical details has been an on-going research topic because of limited experimental results and the variability in existing fatigue testing results. The main objective of this study is to evaluate fatigue resistance of fillet-welded tube connection details by utilizing the advanced fatigue tool in ANSYS Workbench platform. Finite Element (FE) models development and model validation using existing test data was presented. The resulting fatigue resistance from FE analysis was expressed in terms of fatigue life, fatigue damage, and fatigue safety factor to determine the fatigue performance of fillet-welded connections. Existing fatigue test data was grouped to perform a synthetic analysis and then analysis results were provided to determine input data and fatigue limit for the fatigue module. The local stress level at fatigue critical locations was evaluated using a static FE model for different number of stiffeners and boundary conditions. The results of this investigation provides fatigue resistance of fillet-welded connection details in the form of fatigue life, fatigue damage and safety factor for various connection parameters and structural conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

44,"Matching sketch facial images to mug-shot images have crucial significance in law enforcement and digital entertainment. Conventional methods always assume that both the sketch and photo face images have the same resolutions. However, in real criminal detection, the target facial sketches obtained by the artist usually have different resolutions against the source photos in the mug-shot database. In this paper, we propose a locality-constrained feature space learning (LCFSL) method to address the above cross-resolution sketch-photo facial images matching problem. The proposed LCFSL approach not only build bridge to associate cross-domain face images, but also can learn resolution robust representation features for cross-resolution sketch-photo face recognition purpose. After common feature space learning, we simply use nearest neighbor classifier to perform recognition based on the projected features obtained from sketch-photo faces with different resolutions. Experiments conducted on CUHK student database and AR database have shown the effectiveness and superiority of our method to some state-of-the-art face recognition approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,"It is well known that high transmission loss occurs when millimeter waves traveling through the atmosphere. As an alternative, power line is proposed as a transmission media to combat the high loss. In this article, a three-dimensional (3D) printed high-gain circularly polarized antenna was proposed for millimeter-wave broadband power line communications. It has a simple structure, where tapered slots are designed between the upper and lower layers of the waveguide to generate the circularly polarized operation. A wide impedance bandwidth of 31.58% (24-33 GHz) and an axial ratio bandwidth of 28.07% (24.5-32.5 GHz) are achieved by the proposed design. A maximum gain of 11.2 dBi is measured from the 3D printed structure. The proposed antenna has a simple structure which is easy to adjust to any working frequency. The antenna can be excited by properly integrated to the waveguide that connected to the power line end.

46,"In this paper, we propose a banknote aging simulator for generating aged banknotes from new banknotes. When new banknotes begin to be circulated, automatic teller machines (ATMs) are trained with these new banknotes. However, the ATM operations become more erroneous after several months as the banknotes start aging. Also, the process of updating ATM software for aged banknotes is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we developed a simulator for banknote aging that uses the Gaussian and Perlin noise models. The proposed simulator allows ATMs to better handle aged and soiled banknotes without updating ATM software. The experimental results show that the classification and validation performance of aged and soiled banknotes improved noticeably when the classification and validation algorithms were designed using the proposed simulator for new banknotes.

47,"Structured glass-fiber catalysts (GFC) are considered for application in the process of oxidation of endogenous SO2 directly in the media of flue gases from coal-fired powerplants. Such oxidation may be used for conditioning of flue gases to improve the efficiency of ash particulates in electrostatic precipitators. Comparison of Pt-based and vanadia-based GFC showed the much better performance by Pt/GFCs, having much higher activity and significantly lower ignition temperature (similar to 300 degrees C). The best performance is demonstrated by Pt/GFC synthesized by high-temperature synthesis method in combination with spraying of active component precursor solution on the glass-fiber support surface instead of conventional impregnation. Application of structured GFC cartridges makes possible to apply them directly inside the flue gas duct with appropriate pressure drop. High permeability of such cartridges makes possible to apply them in the gas fluid contaminated with ash particulates with minimized risk of clogging. Beyond the mentioned advantages, application of GFC may be useful for resolution of related environmental problems: incineration of polyaromatic compounds and mercury-containing organic substances in flue gases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"We consider the well-known wireless fair opportunistic schedulers (mainly the alpha-fair schedulers) and analyze their price of fairness (PoF). Efficient scheduler, designed from the system perspective, maximizes the sum of accumulated utilities of all the agents, accumulated over several time slots. On the other hand, the fair schedulers deviate from such a schedule to provide a given level of fairness to various customers utilizing the system. This obviously results in a lower (total) accumulated utility. We study this loss, using the well-known performance measure, the price of fairness. Previous studies show that the PoF mostly increases, as the number of agents increases. We have very different results for opportunistic schedulers. We group agents into finite classes, each class having identical utilities and QoS requirements (inspired by wireless cellular networks), to obtain the asymptotic PoF (APoF). This is always below one. Further, in many cases, the PoF actually decreases to zero/negligible value as the number of agents increases. We also consider the case of multiple resources with bounded utilities. We again have zero/small APoF, depending upon the distributions of the utilities and the relative proportions of various classes. We derive closed-form/easily computable expressions for the APoF, using extreme-value theory, center-order statistics and the maximum theorem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"We explore options for improving the rigidity of a framework if the modeled building presents cubic symmetries. Braces are used to provide resistance to lateral loads in the framework. These cubic symmetries allow us to use a graph theoretical model and the possibility of a more accurate prediction of the rigidity of the braced cubic structure. Fixed joints attach the three-dimensional cubic grid structure as Scaffolding its base face and its lateral face to the planar ground and a planar lateral wall, respectively. Inserting some short or long bracing elements, we make the framework of the Scaffolding rigid. We suggest the revision of the sample scaffolding one of the standards. We provide a convenient method to determine if a braced structure as an n-story building with a core is rigid or flexible. This result is also useful from the algorithmic point of view, and it is applicable in structural and safety engineering, which could be a useful input of simulation and topology optimization. When the simulation is expensive, the Bar and Joint model could work at a low computational cost.

50,"There were many wake-up calls in past decades right from the early industrialized Europe to the present century, from the Americas and to Asia. In Asia, the most prominent process safety incident was the 1984 Bhopal accident in India that greatly impacted the chemical industry. Today, it is the prerequisite for the management of major hazards installations (MHIs) such as petroleum refining, petrochemical manufacturing facilities, and chemical processing plants to be fully aware of their responsibility to ensure meeting safety, health, and environment requirements. Any MHI failure would not only lead to operation slowdown that result in financial loss, but also to worst-case scenarios. One typical example is hazardous material release to the atmosphere as occurred in Bhopal which can result in catastrophic consequence.We must always maintain a sense of vulnerability, learning from past incidents, adherence to code of practices, and standards for new as well as existing equipment. Such a proactive approach will definitely reduce the risk of MHI to as low as reasonably applicable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"A discussion of a number of important topics related to modeling of high energy cosmic ray interactions is presented. Special attention is devoted to novel theoretical approaches employed in event generators of hadronic interactions and to the impact of experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In relation to studies of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), differences between various predictions for basic characteristics of UHECR-induced extensive air showers in the atmosphere are analyzed and traced down to differences in the respective treatments of hadronic interactions. Possibilities to discriminate between the alternative approaches, based on LHC and UHECR data, are demonstrated and the relation to UHECR primary composition is outlined. Finally, in relation to direct studies of charged cosmic rays, potential improvements of the treatment of cosmic ray interactions at low and intermediate energies are discussed. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

52,"PAMELA, a medium-sized experiment for the detection of cosmic rays, took data in space from 2006 to 2016. Composed of a magnetic spectrometer and several auxiliary detectors, the instrument compensated the reduced dimensions with the high performance of the individual detectors to obtain high-precision measurements over a range of energy from tens of MeV/n to 1 TeV/n. In ten years of operation PAMELA revealed very interesting features in cosmic rays, namely in the fluxes of protons, helium, electrons, that might change our basic vision of the mechanisms of production, acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Amazing and stimulating have been the measurements of cosmic antiproton and positron fluxes that have allowed the nature of dark matter to be probed in a new way, suggesting new ideas and setting strong constraints to the models. The constant monitoring of the solar activity and the detailed study of the solar modulation of cosmic rays for a long period have boosted important improvements to the comprehension of the heliosphere mechanisms.

54,This study produces a skewed-imaginary planar rack cutter with discrete conical teeth that is used to create a helical gear with discrete ring-involute teeth. A mathematical equation for the skewed-imaginary rack cutter with discrete conical teeth is firstly solved. The coordinate system for the rack cutter and gear pair is then established and a family of the rack-cutter surfaces is obtained using homogeneous coordinate transformation. The relative velocity method is used to produce the equation for meshing between the rack cutter and the gear pair. Substituting the equation of meshing into the family of the rack-cutter surfaces gives the mathematical models for the gear pair with discrete ring-involute teeth. The transmission error for the gear pair is calculated using the assembly error and a tooth contact analysis. A computer-aided design software package is used to establish solid model for the gear pair. A software interference function is used to simulate the contact condition for the gear pair for various assembly errors. Finite element analysis software is then used to determine the contact stress for the gear pair. The transmission error and the contact stress for the gear pair are insensitive to any horizontal misalignment in the assembly errors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,"A comparison is presented between the experimental dynamic behavior of detuned AlInGaAs ridge waveguide distributed feedback lasers operating at O band and C band at two different temperatures. The nominal center wavelengths at 25 degrees C for the set of devices studied were 1270, 1310, and 1550 nm. Preliminary static characterization of the samples showed consistent trends between wavelength detuning, characteristic temperature, and power output. For all set of samples, the characteristic temperature was substantially higher for the samples detuned to longer wavelengths (red) at room temperature. At the temperature of 85 degrees C, a higher power efficiency was observed for those samples that thermally shifted nearer the peak optical gain. Resonance frequencies were extracted at 25 degrees C and 85 degrees C by means of electro-optical transmission measurements and relative intensity noise measurements. The extracted values confirmed that at room temperature the samples detuned to shorter wavelengths (blue) showed the highest modulation efficiencies. At the temperature of 85 degrees C, however, the wavelength and optical gain thermal shift makes those same samples to have the lowest resonant frequencies. The dynamic trends over temperature were clearer for the O band set of samples, while the detuning had a less pronounced effect at C band. The range of maximum resonance frequencies studied was from 12 to 14 GHz, which makes the devices suitable for uncooled communication applications at multi-gigabit data rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, it allows a scalability of the blocking voltage by the extension to a light-controlled supercascode [1] which is also shown. After a brief theoretical consideration experimental set-ups will be presented and measurements are shown. Due to the difficulty to buy appropriate devices required for the experimental set-ups some compromises were necessary. Therefore, these first experiments show a very slow switching behaviour.

59,"The aim of the present study is to develop a theoretical concept of multi-property mineral separator (MPMS). In general, most of the conventional mineral separators exploit a single physical property difference for beneficiation. However, the idea behind MPMS is to utilize multiple physical properties of particles in a single separator for beneficiation. Mathematical formulations were developed for conceptual MPMS, where physical properties of particles such as density, magnetic susceptibility, and surface work function will be exploited in a single separator. Simulations were carried out for tracing particle trajectories in MPMS using MATLAB. Simulation results indicate that separation efficiency can be enhanced by exploiting multiple physical properties of particles simultaneously in a single separator. Based on the developed theoretical model of MPMS in the present paper, the fabrication of a prototype separator is under construction. Experimental results and validation using prototype MPMS will be reported in near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

63,"The commonly used normal-temperature air-thawing method is time-consuming and cannot achieve constant temperature thawing. Furthermore, microwave thawing consumes a considerable amount of electricity. These two common thawing methods cannot guarantee food quality. Thus, a new type of constant air-temperature thawing system (CATT) that uses compressor casing thermal storage is designed and tested in this study. Results show that the CATT has faster speed than the air-thawing method. Furthermore, although the thawing speed of CATT is slower than that of microwave thawing, food with 274.25 g thawing quality can save 0.2 kW h of electricity per iteration. The weight loss of CATT at 34 degrees C was 64.6% of that of microwave thawing. The weight loss of CATT at 46 degrees C was 40.8% of that of microwave thawing. When thawing at a constant temperature of 46 degrees C, the thawing time required for the central temperature of chicken meat to increase from -8 to 10 degrees C is 2 hr. The thermal storage material can decrease compressor noise effectively by 17.65%. Practical Applications The thawing of frozen food is a common problem. Hence, this paper proposes a new thawing method based on the residual heat of the refrigerator compressor casing. This method does not need to consume other energy and instead uses directly waste heat generated by the compressor casing to thaw frozen food. Frozen food can be thawed naturally at a constant temperature by controlling the temperature of the thawing chamber, and consequently, the disadvantages of long-term air thawing and poor quality of microwave thawing are improved. The application of this method can increase the thawing function of the refrigerator and has considerable application prospects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"In this paper, a parallel group detection (PGD) algorithm is proposed in order to address the degradation in the bit error rate (BER) performance of linear detectors when they are used in high-load massive MIMO systems. The algorithm is constructed by converting the equivalent extended massive MIMO system into two subsystems, which can be simultaneously detected by the classical detection procedures. Then, using the PGD and the classical ZF as well as the QR-decomposition- (QRD-) based detectors, we proposed two new detectors, called ZF-based PGD (ZF-PGD) and QRD-based PGD (QRD-PGD). The PGD is further combined with the sorted longest basis (SLB) algorithm to make the signal recovery more accurate, thereby resulting in two new detectors, namely, the ZF-PGD-SLB and the QRD-PGD-SLB. Various complexity evaluations and simulations prove that the proposed detectors can significantly improve the BER performance compared to their classical linear and QRD counterparts with the practical complexity levels. Hence, our proposed detectors can be used as efficient means of estimating the transmitted signals in high-load massive MIMO systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally we analyze a new design proposal with active cooling for the consolidation of the PS external dump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"This document studies the problem of near-field pattern uniformity in high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. The existence of such inhomogeneity is related to the composition of the global near field radiation pattern of the receiving antennas in the MRI system. For the MRI image uniformity enhancement, two approaches are proposed in order to obtain the optimal image in terms of the acquisition process and subsequent post-processing. The first one is based on a progressive variation of the antenna phase feeding in the array distribution, either at each arraying or between rings, which lets reduce the radial inhomogeneity between the central value (maximum) and the rest of the surrounding values. The second one is based on a progressive variation (rotation) of the antenna location in the array distribution, which lets reduce the pattern ripples at the outer cylindrical rings of the volume under test. In this work, a metaheuristic optimization strategy has been selected to obtain the optimal configuration. This optimal configuration implies angular rotation and the addition of feeding phase values to strain ripple reduction and pattern uniformity, depending on the particular size of the cylinder volume that conforms the volume under exploration for image acquisition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a given paneled reflector, the peak gain losses and the first side lobe level increments caused by different PIEs for the whole reflector are presented. Then, through an analysis for each ring of panels, including the effects of different amplitude aperture distribution functions and different ratios of focal length to diameter (F/D ratios), the results clearly show that the PIEs of the panels for different rings have different effects on the reflector's average power pattern, and valuable results are obtained.

69,"A compact monopolar microstrip patch antenna (MPA) with enhanced-bandwidth is proposed. In order to achieve the miniaturized patch, the zeroth-order mode of the MPA instead of its higher-order modes is employed at first by loading the shorting pin around the center of the patch. After that, a L-shaped microstrip line with a shorting pin is introduced at the periphery of the patch radiator to excite an additional non-radiative mode for bandwidth enhancement. In final, the proposed MPA is fabricated and measured. The results illustrate that the antenna generates an enhanced-bandwidth of about 4.1% ranging from 2.39 to 2.49 GHz, which is significantly larger than that of the traditional MPA around 1%. Meanwhile, the dimensions of the radiating patch are obviously decreased down due to the employment of zeroth-order mode, which are kept as small as about 0.17 lambda(0) x 0.22 lambda(0) x 0.026 lambda(0) (lambda(0) is the free-space wavelength).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the temperature increasing from 303 to 323 K, the post-synaptic current (PSC) at the resting state increases from 1.8 to 7.3 mu A. Under a single gate pulse of 1 V and 1 s, the PSC signal altitude and the PSC retention time decrease from 2.0 to 0.7 mu A and 5.1 x 10(2) to 2.5 ms, respectively. A physical model based on the electric field-induced ion drifting, ionic-electronic coupling, and gradient-coordinated ion diffusion is proposed to understand these temperature-dependent synaptic behaviors. Based on the experimental data on individual transistors, temperature-modulated pattern learning and memorizing behaviors are conceptually demonstrated. The in-depth investigation of the temperature dependence helps pave the way for further electrolyte-gated transistor-based neuromorphic applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,"The differences between N- and N+ buried layers in improving the breakdown voltage of RESURF (reduced surface field) LDMOSFETs (lateral double-diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors) are discussed in this paper. Two concise RESURF criteria for LDMOS with a low-doped fully depleted N- buried layer (NBL) and a highly doped nondepleted N+ floating layer (NFL) are developed by optimizing the lateral and vertical electric fields. The analytical solution quantitatively demonstrates the variation of the drift charge concentration and its dependence on the key NBL and NFL parameters. It also indicates that the NBL LDMOS achieves a superior tradeoff between specific on-resistance (R-s,R-on)and breakdown voltage (BV) to the NFL LDMOS. The BV2/R-s,R-on for NBL LDMOS is 3.1 MW/cm(2), which is increased respectively by 93.8% and 40.9% compared with the single RESURF and NFL-LDMOS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"Based on the finite element method of traditional straight Euler-Bernoulli beams and the coupled relations between linear displacement and angular displacement of a pre-twisted Euler-Bernoulli beam, the shape functions and stiffness matrix are deduced. Firstly, the stiffness of pre-twisted Euler-Bernoulli beam is developed based on the traditional straight Euler-Bernoulli beam. Then, a new finite element model is proposed based on the displacement general solution of a pre-twisted Euler-Bernoulli beam. Finally, comparison analyses are made among the proposed Euler-Bernoulli model, the new numerical model based on displacement general solution and the ANSYS solution by Beam188 element based on infinite approach. The results show that developed numerical models are available for the pre-twisted Euler-Bernoulli beam, and which provide more accurate finite element model for the numerical analysis. The effects of pre-twisted angle and flexural stiffness ratio on the mechanical property are investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,"Foundations are a vital part of structures. Over time, the foundations can deteriorate due to unforeseen overloads and/or settlements, resulting in the appearance of cracks in the concrete. These cracks produce changes in the static and dynamic behavior of the affected foundation, which alter its load carrying capacity. In this work, non-destructive techniques of relative simplicity of application are presented for the detection, location, and quantification of damage, using numerical models, solved with the finite element method and Power Series. For this, two types of parameters are used: static (displacement and elastic curvature) and dynamics (natural frequencies). In the static analysis, the damage detection is done by means of a finite elements model representing a beam supported on an elastic foundation with a discrete crack that varies in length and location. With regard to dynamic analysis, the governing equations of the model are presented and a method based on Power Series is used to obtain the solution for a data set, which could be the Winkler coefficient, the location of the crack or the frequency. In order to validate the proposed methodologies, these techniques are applied to data obtained from laboratory tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
77,"The mode perturbation method (MPM) is suitable and efficient for solving the eigenvalue problem of a nonuniform soil deposit whose property varies with depth. However, results of the MPM do not always converge to the exact solution, when the variation of soil deposit property is discontinuous. This discontinuity is typical because soil is usually made up of sedimentary layers of different geologic materials. Based on the energy integral of the variational principle, a new mode perturbation method, the energy-based mode perturbation method (EMPM), is proposed to address the convergence of the perturbation solution on the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes and is able to find solution whether the soil properties are continuous or not. First, the variational principle is used to transform the variable coefficient differential equation into an equivalent energy integral equation. Then, the natural mode shapes of the uniform shear beam with same height and boundary conditions are used as Ritz function. The EMPM transforms the energy integral equation into a set of nonlinear algebraic equations which significantly simplifies the eigenvalue solution of the soil layer with variable properties. Finally, the accuracy and convergence of this new method are illustrated with two case study examples. Numerical results show that the EMPM is more accurate and convergent than the MPM. As for the mode shapes of the uniform shear beam included in the EMPM, the additional 8 modes of vibration are sufficient in engineering applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
78,"The characteristics of square twin surface jets at various offset heights from the free surface were studied using a particle image velocimetry technique. The offset heights were varied from 1 to 4 nozzle widths at a fixed Reynolds number of 3890. The entrainment and mixing characteristics were examined using the potential core length, merging point, combined point, maximum velocity decay, half-velocity width and were found be nearly independent of offset height in near field. The jet-surface interaction was examined by surface velocity, vorticity thickness and surface turbulence intensities. The growth rate of the vorticity thickness reduced in the interaction region; and was more severe for shorter offset height. Turbulent structures were examined using weighted joint probability density function and two-point cross-correlations between swirling strength and velocity fluctuations. Weaker turbulent events were observed for deeper jet close to a free surface at the streamwise location beyond the attachment point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
79,"Reliability of a wireless communication system depends on the performance metric of the oscillators employed. In this paper, we have discussed the commonly used oscillator architectures, their equivalent RLC circuits and the influence of the inductor performance on the oscillator design. Inductors designed for the oscillators are fabricated in 180 nm CMOS process. Inductors are implemented with 20 k top metal layer of the P1M6 layer architecture. Two-turns twisted and 3-turns spiral shape inductors are fabricated with and without the substrate shield, respectively. Twisted shape inductor with the floating substrate shield has higher Q-factor due to low substrate loss. To further validate the performance of inductors, digitally controlled oscillators (DCO's) are designed around the inductors and simulated for its phase noise performances. Inductors are designed on a (lossy) substrate with a resistivity of 2 omega-cm. The twisted shape inductor has a Q-factor of 5.23 at the operating frequency of 1.8 GHz for the inductance value of 2.8 nH and has a self-resonance frequency (SRF) of 10 GHz. Whereas spiral shape inductor achieves the maximum Q-factor of 1.18 for the inductance value of 3.4 nH with SRF of 12.5 GHz.

80,"The paper presents numerical investigations of 921A steel target plates impacted by truncated nosed alloy steel projectiles. The material point method is used to simulate and analyse the problem. Decohesion is an important failure mode to solve the fracture mode, because its constitutive equation is established to solve the local discontinuous fracture problem. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results. The error of the break diameter is only 2.6% compared with the experimental data. The residual velocity agrees well with the experiment under six different conditions, and the error is less than 10%. The failure behaviour of the frame is similar to the actual situation, and the failure modes are almost the same. The penetration effects of different nosed projectiles are also compared, which verifies the conclusion that different contact forms lead to different failure modes. The results of this study show that MPM with decohesion can be well used to simulate the penetration problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,"The work safety level is a reflection of the work safety situation, but in the past, we simply used a single absolute indicator or a single relative indicator to measure the work safety level, which is inadequate. This paper chooses five relative indicators and uses grey fixed weight clustering method to give a comprehensive evaluation of the work safety level in different provinces. According to the evaluation results, we grade the work safety level of geographic and economic regions, and find the gap in different provinces and regions. Our analysis suggests that the work safety level in different provinces and regions basically accords with the stage of industrialization process, but the fluctuated data analysis indicates that the theory of the relationship between the work safety and industrialization process has its defects, and the warped-tail phenomenon of work safety level in the final and mature stage of industrialization process is thus pointed out. Taking the comparison between Henan and Shanghai as an example of the analysis of the warped-tail phenomenon, the factors related to the work safety level in the final and mature stage of industrialization process are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,"The existing database of the loading response of offshore pile foundations needs to be enriched, so that safety and economic considerations can be optimally balanced in design. This paper details a programme of field tests on an open-ended steel pile. The pile with a diameter of 2 m was driven to a depth of 72.8 m in a stratified soil site and then subjected to monotonic compressive, tensile and lateral loadings. Resting periods were allowed before each test to enable strength recovery, and a period of about one month was found to be sufficient (i.e., the axial bearing capacity increases from about 10 MN to 25 MN). The test results were interpreted in terms of the internal forces and displacements/deformations of the pile, and the more detailed pile-soil interactions (i.e., q(s)-s and p-y curves). It is found that, for cohesive soils, the unit shaft resistance q(s) remains constant through each soil layer regardless of the almost linearly varying undrained shear strength s(u) obtained from CPTu tests, and the soil layer with overall higher s(u) does not guarantee greater q(s) owing to different proportions of silty and clayey components. Upon reaching the ultimate uplift load, the shaft resistance within the cohesive soils shows a clear softening response. Extensive comparisons were made between these results and the predictions from existing design methods wherever applicable to discuss the accuracy of each.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83,"Purpose This paper aims to study the possibility of controlling the electromagnetic stirrer (EMS) is fundamental in a continuous casting line to achieve the desired properties of homogeneity and mechanical strength in the solidified cast. Design/methodology/approach Coupled electromagnetic (EM) and fluid dynamic (FD) simulations allow to predict the mixing effect on molten metal, in terms of velocity amplitude and shape of the flow. This paper describes the numerical results of EMS effect within a cylindrical crucible, surrounded by a solenoidal inductor, filled with a low melting temperature alloy, i.e. GalInStan. Findings Induced forces and resulting velocity distribution of the flow of the liquid metal have been calculated depending on varying amplitude and frequency of the supplied current. As expected, at a given amplitude of the current supply, the velocity distribution shows a maximum at a certain frequency while the intensity of electrodynamic forces monotonically increase as the frequency increases Originality/value The paper deals with simply models and experiments applied to coupled EM and FD problem, to assess the applied methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"Patient-specific computational models are powerful tools which may assist in predicting the outcome of invasive surgery on the musculoskeletal system, and consequently help to improve therapeutic decision-making and post-operative care. Unfortunately, at present the use of personalized models that predict the effect of biopsies and full excisions is so specialized that tends to be restricted to prominent individuals, such as high-profile athletes. We have developed a finite element analysis model to determine the influence of the location of an ellipsoidal excision (14.2 mm x 11.8 mm) on the structural integrity of a human skull when exposed to impact loading, representing a free fall of an adult male from standing height. The finite element analysis model was compared to empirical data based on the drop-tower testing of three-dimensional-printed physical skull models where deformations were recorded by digital image correlation. In this bespoke example, we found that the excision site did not have a major effect on the calculated stress and strain magnitudes unless the excision was in the temporal region, where the reduction in stiffness around the excision caused failure within the neighboring area. The finite element analysis model allowed meaningful conclusions to be drawn for the implications of using such a technique based on what we know about such conditions indicating that the approach could be both clinically beneficial and also cost-effective for wider use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"The capability of time-shifting-based phase difference method against noise can be considerably improved with the increase of the translation coefficient. However, the anti-noise performance of the traditional method is limited due to the wrapped phase problem. In order to obtain high accuracy of estimate, this paper proposes an improved phase interpolation estimator which is derived in terms of the time-shifting-based phase difference method. First, the estimator utilizes three segments of signal in the time domain to build two sets of frequency estimate. Then the absolute difference of the frequency estimate between the two sets can be calculated. Subsequently, four frequency estimates with minimal absolute difference are selected. Finally, the one in four frequencies owning maximum energy is selected as the final frequency estimate. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm can overcome the wrapped phase problem to some extent and can achieve better noise immunity than traditional algorithms.

86,"Key management solutions are cornerstone requirements for any security service. Due to resource limitations, public key cryptographic (PKC) solutions are unsuitable for IoT devices like sensors of WSN. Consequently we opt for key predistribution schemes (KPS) to preload lightweight symmetric cryptographic keys and later establish them. KPS are designed over random and/or combinatorial graphs and requires several devices to share individual keys (conventionally r many). This causes a dip in the resultant system's resilience. Cichon et al. [10] introduces a technique that involve recursive use of a one-way function to distinguish each key's cycle and improve the given system's resilience. Bechkit et al. [2,3] considers a cryptographic hash function to form their hash chains (KPS), i.e., HC(x) for a given KPS x. They construct hash chains according to node identifiers (ids) and consider modulo n, (n is an element of Z(+)) to reduce hash chains. This paper uses signed weighted graph (SWG) to conceal node ids in the key sharing graph of the underlying KPS x during short-lived key establishment phase (KEP). The concealment of information permits distinct indexing of each sensor according their position in the cycles of preloaded keys. Resultant system remains distributed with improved resilience and is independent of other parameters. In this way, a new class of KPS, named as key-node indexed hash chains (KPS), i.e., KNIHC(x) for the selected KPS x is proposed. It eliminates smart attack (SA). Moreover being fully connected (due to choice of underlying KPS), the proposed system supports mobility. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"Mechanical expansion is the key process in the manufacture of giant metallic ring. The mechanical expansion process of a 10-m-class aluminium alloy ring is taken as the research object in this paper. First, based on the springback theory of small curvature plane bending, the springback ratio formula is derived for the wall thickness centre-line of the ring cross section after unloading, and the mechanical expansion stroke model is established by the mould displacement compensation method. Then, a calculation method for mechanical expansion force is proposed by considering the friction between the mould arc surface and the ring inner wall. Moreover, a finite element model (FEM) is established to simulate the mechanical expansion process of a 10-metre-class aluminium alloy ring using MSC_Marc. The results show that the model proposed in this paper reduces the dimension error of the ring after unloading by 9.19%, and increases the calculation accuracy of the mechanical expansion force by more than 30% under different friction coefficients. Furthermore, the effects of processing parameters, centre angel of the mould segment, relative radius of the mould segment, fillet radius of the edge mould segment, ovality, expansion rate and friction coefficient on the fabricated ring quality are numerically investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,"Buoyancy-driven convention from a pair of horizontal heated cylinders, set side by side inside a square cooled cavity filled with water, is studied numerically. The system of the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy expressed in dimensionless form is solved through a control-volume formulation of the finite-difference method. The pressure-velocity coupling is handled using the SIMPLE-C algorithm. Numerical simulations are executed for different values of the Rayleigh number based on the cylinder diameter, as well as the width of the cavity, the inter-cylinder spacing and the distance of the cylinders from the bottom wall of the cavity normalized by the cylinder diameter. Two heat and fluid flow configurations are generally found to establish inside the cavity, according as the cylinders are located at close distance or at such a distance that the effects of the lateral walls of the cavity become important, each of these configurations being distinguished by the existence of an optimum inter-cylinder spacing which maximizes the overall heat transfer rate. Moreover, when the inter-cylinder spacing is such that the cylinders are located sufficiently close to the cavity sides, a periodic flow arises.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

90,"The mechanisms of skull impact loading may change following surgical interventions such as the removal of bone lesions, but little is known about the consequences in the event of subsequent head trauma. We, therefore, prepared acrylonitrile butadiene styrene human skull models based on clinical computed tomography skull data using a three-dimensional printer. Six replicate physical skull models were tested, three with bone excisions and three without. A drop tower was used to simulate the impact sustained by falling backwards onto the occipital lobe region. The impacts were recorded with a high-speed camera, and the occipital strain response was determined by digital image correlation. Although the hole affected neither the magnitude nor the sequence of the fracture pattern, the digital image correlation analysis highlighted an increase in strain around the excised area (0.45%-16.4% of the principal strain). Our approach provides a novel method that could improve the quality of life for patients on many fronts, including protection against trauma, surgical advice, post-operative care, advice in litigation cases, as well as facilitating general biomechanical research in the area of trauma injuries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"The present study proposes the use of dune sand, reinforced with geotextile, as roadway layer. The investigation aims to evaluate the convenience of the reinforced sand, with a view to face of the scarcity of used materials, and also for socio-economic development in northern-Africa Sahara regions. The analytical approach is totally experimental and is based on the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test procedure. The obtained results are interpreted with referring to bearing of a foundation soil. These indicate that inclusion of single geotextile liner increases the sand CBR value by 73%. The inclusion of two geotextile layers increases this ratio more than 6 times. This makes the sand to pass from a low bearing material to a good supporting novel composite product. The study highlights the advantage of implementing geotextile sheets comparing to geocell reinforcement, as well as the manifest of slab-effect by the confined sandy layer. Furthermore, the soil layer depth beyond which the geotextile contribution becomes insignificant is pointed-out, as well as the sandy layer supporting the applied load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
92,"This paper proposes an enhanced control algorithm in permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) with machine current sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) and current management for hardware protection. Different from existing work on machine current sensor FDI, the proposed method addresses the sensor FDI problem under co-existence of PMSM current sensor and non-sensor imbalance faults, and thereby help prevent the controller performance degradation caused by a faulty machine current sensor signal. Meanwhile, hardware protection is achieved through the proposed algorithm which has a unique feature of providing online overcurrent regulation and source power management at the same time to enhance protection of power inverter and power source. Benchmark comparison of the proposed sensor FDI method to state-of-the-art techniques is carried out to validate the good performance of the proposed FDI method in terms of fault detection time, false detection rate and missed detection rate. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed current management algorithm with overcurrent regulation and source power management is performed under changing rotor flux linkage and machine stator d-axis self-inductance, as an example to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm for hardware protection against system parameter variations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is confirmed by simulation results in MATLAB for a PMSM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various experimental parameters such as pressure, operational time and speed of agitation were considered to determine the rejection coefficient and gel layer concentration. The introduction of agitation speed delivered a drastic improvement in the permeate flux and the bulk GA concentration. The values obtained at 0 and 400 rpm for permeate concentration, calculated gel layer concentration (C-g) and time required to drain the whole extract from the membrane were 2.14 x 10(-2) & 7.9 x 10(-3) mg/L, 6.46 x 10(-2) to 2.99 x 10(-3) mg/L and 3.14 and 0.23 h, respectively. The experimental results showed that the retentate concentration increases from 3.51 x 10(-2) to 8.09 x 10(-2)mg/L by varying the agitation speed from 0 to 400 rpm. Also, the optimal rejection coefficient of 88.34% was obtained at 300 rpm. A mathematical investigation of the data was carried out to find the gel layer concentration over the membrane.

95,"Herein a new polymer processing method referred to as Melt-Mastication (MM) is presented as way to substantially improve the thermal and mechanical properties of Polypropylene (iPP) and other semi-crystalline polymers. MM is a low temperature mixing technique that subjects molten iPP to chaotic flow under at temperatures between the melting and crystallization temperatures, thereby promoting flow induced crystallization (FIC). The resulting materials demonstrate an unusual crystal morphology that is highly crystalline by thermal calorimetry (57% crystal volume fraction), melts at a temperature 10.3 K higher than conventionally processed iPP, and demonstrates melt memory after annealing at 200 degrees C. The highly crystalline morphology does not show birefringence in polarized optical microscopy and by SEM and AFM appears to be comprised of largely disorganized lamellar crystals, with possible stacked ordering in local (1 mu m) regions. Melt-Masticated iPP demonstrates improved compressive modulus (+77%), strength (+40%), and strain hardening modulus in uniaxial compression, which are attributed to enhanced crystal volume fraction, lamellar crystal thickness, and network connectivity, respectively.

97,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion measurements of surfactants suffer from fast exchange of the surfactant between the micellar aggregate and bulk solution. Therefore, hydrophobic probe molecules are commonly used to directly measure aggregate diffusion under the assumption that the probe molecules remain solubilized inside the micelles. Aggregate size is then determined or estimated from the aggregate diffusion value. Unfortunately, the probe molecule also experiences rapid exchange between the aggregate and bulk, leading to inaccurate or unreasonable micelle diffusion values, a fact that has often been ignored in the literature. In this article, we present a systematic evaluation of probe molecules in cationic and anionic surfactants, obtained by measuring the diffusion of probe molecules with varying hydrophobicity. We find that an octanol-water partition coefficient of at least similar to 5 is required for correct measurements of aggregate diffusion in the systems studied. Notably, some commonly used probes have a partition coefficient much lower than five and are therefore not suitable for aggregate diffusion measurements. Consideration of these results will help researchers obtain accurate results for micelle sizing or partitioning studies with pulsed-field-gradient NMR.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
