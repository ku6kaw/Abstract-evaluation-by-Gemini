This work examined their degradation characteristics in a mixed culture system and also analyzed the microorganism community. After acclimation for 58 d and 43 d, the high removal efficiency of 100% of 2-FA and 95.3% of 3-FA was obtained by adding 25 mg L-1 of 2-FA or 3-FA to the two reactors, respectively. In addition, the high defluorination rates of 2-FA and 3-FA were observed to be 87.0% and 89.3%, respectively. The degradation kinetics showed that the maximum specific degradation rates of 2-FA and 3-FA were (21.23 +/- 0.91) mg FA (g center dot VSS center dot h)(-1), and (11.75 +/- 0.99) mg FA (g center dot VSS center dot h)(-1), respectively. PCR-DGGE analysis revealed that the unique bacteria degrading 2-FA were mainly composed of six genera (Novosphingobium, Bradyrhizobium, Aquaspirillum, Aminobacter, Ochrobactrum, and Labrys), and five genera that degraded 3-FA (Ochrobactrum, Aquaspirillum, Lachnobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, and Variovorax). Analysis of the key catabolic enzyme activities indicated that the simultaneous hydroxylation and dehalogenation were involved in monooxygenase elimination of 2-FA and conversion of 3-FA to 4-fluorocatechol by dioxygenase, indicating that enriched mixed cultures were effective to metabolize 2-FA or 3-FA by unconventional pathways to prevent the accumulation of toxic metabolites.",10.1080/10934529.2019.1688044,0,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no
J,"Heunisch, S; Fhager, LO; Wernersson, LE",A phase-correlated duo-binary waveform generation technique for millimeter-wave radar pulses,"We propose a technique for generating millimeter-wave radar waveforms using edge-triggered pulse generator circuits. By synchronizing the chip rate to the oscillation frequency of a binary control signal, a phase shift is introduced in the generated pulses. This way, the millimeter-wave signal can be phase-modulated without the need of additional circuit elements. We show that high-resolution radar waveforms with low range side lobes can be generated with this technique. Using brute-force optimization, we evaluate all possible sequences up to a sequence length of 25 chips and identify optimal waveforms for each length. Optimal sequences with the energy centered at zero delay and side lobes not exceeding unity are presented. The optimized waveforms are measured and verified using an in-house resonant tunneling diode (RTD) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) pulse generator. The matched filter response of the optimal waveforms is reproduced closely in the measurements. The results enable increased sensitivity in radar systems using coherent millimeter-wave pulse generators for low power applications, as for instance, radar gesture recognition in handheld devices. Using pulsed millimeter-wave radar systems with low duty cycles, continuously running oscillators can be avoided and systems with ultra-low power consumption are possible.",10.1002/cta.2699,1,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

J,"Juanicó, LE",Heating houses by using vacuum-tube solar collectors and a small aboveground water tank: a cost-effective solution for maritime climates,"This work presents a simple dynamical solar-thermal modelling and cost-optimized solution for heating houses in maritime climates by using many vacuum-tube solar collectors together with one small well-insulated aboveground water tank and the underfloor hot-water heating system. This was performed for a single house in the cold-maritime climate of Bariloche (13,000 kWh/y), which could be fully satisfied by using ten collectors on 70 degrees-inclined roof and 4.6 m(3) tank, costing euro12,900. This cost is noticeably lower than for previous large projects in cold-continental climates, what is supported by four key factors: (1) solar resource and heating demand in maritime climates are more distributed than in continental climates; (2) small aboveground tanks can get noticeably higher efficiencies and lower costs that huge underground tanks; (3) vacuum-tube collectors get higher performances than flat collectors during winters; (4) high winter solar yield is achieved by installing collectors on high tilt angles (or half on low-inclined roofs and half on walls). These four factors will be discussed by solar-thermal and cost analyses, by comparing the system performance for climatic conditions of Bariloche and Okotoks.",10.1080/17512549.2019.1688186,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protocol interference model is extensively used in the design of wireless networks. However, the setting of interference range, a crucial part of the protocol interference model, is rather heuristic and remains an open problem. In this paper, we use the stochastic geometry and the direct approach to obtain the associated feasibility distributions. After that, we use the binary hypothesis testing to achieve the Bayes risk under binomial point process (BPP) and Poisson point process (PPP), respectively. According to the first derivative of the Bayes risk, we provide the equation to achieve the optimal interference range for minimum Bayes risk. We extend the method proposed by Wildman et al. to a more general situation. Furthermore, we show that for infinite PPP, those two methods converge to the same results. Several numerical results for wireless networks under BPP, finite PPP, and infinite PPP are given. Simulation results show that in the finite wireless network, the BPP method performs better than the PPP method.",10.1186/s13638-019-1585-z,6,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,
J,"Singh, SP; Kumar, A; Mishra, S; Lakshmanan, M; Kumar, S",A novel analytical model for interference estimation in CR-enabled femtocells,"Commercial, multideployed cognitive femtocell base stations (CFBSs) with cognitive capabilities are envisioned as a promising approach to meet the requirement of the higher data rate in today's wireless communications with nomadic users. However, random deployment of CFBSs results in interference between primary links, ie, the link between a macrocell base station (MBS) and macrocell user equipment (MUE), and secondary links, ie, the link between a femtocell base station (FBS) and femtocell user equipment (FUE). In this research paper, different analytical expressions for statistical measures such as cumulative distribution function of outage probability (F-out) and probability distribution function (P-out) have been proposed for the CFBS system. The fading channel for the secondary and primary links is taken as mixture gamma (MG) and Rayleigh distribution, respectively. It should be noticed that MG fading is one of the most generic fading channels and has not been included for analysis of the CFBS system to date. In addition, this paper presents average detection probability (PD over bar ) for cognitive radio (CR)-enabled femtocells or the CFBS system. The numerical analysis presents the effects of various parameters such as spatial density of CFBS nodes (lambda), interference tolerance threshold (beta(th)), and transmitting power of MBS (p) and fading parameters of the channel on F-out, P-out, and PD over bar .

In these poultry farms, artificial lighting system is an essential factor for the success of the commercial production of egg layers and broilers. Lighting loads connected to the existing AC system requires DC power. Nearly 25% of the total power consumed in India is by lighting loads. Therefore, low-voltage DC distribution system is the new requirement of electrical network to improve energy conservation. In this paper, an energy efficient single-stage LED driver topology is proposed as a better alternative to fluorescent lights used in poultry farms. The proposed topology is a phase-shifted buck converter with reduced size of passive components. The converter is mathematically modelled and designed for a power of 24 W LED lights. An experimental prototype is developed for the proposed converter and the results are validated in terms of cost, energy savings, and energy efficiency with various other LED driver topologies like conventional buck converter and interleaved buck converter.

It has been reported that insoluble hyaluronic acid may prevent adhesions. Materials and methods: This study had two objectives: first, to determine the in vivo degradation and absorption process, as well as the intrathoracic retention, of solid insoluble hyaluronic acid membrane; and second, to elucidate the association between postoperative intrathoracic retention and the morphological changes of insoluble hyaluronic acid in 12 Wistar rats. Insoluble hyaluronic acid membranes were cut into 2.0 cm x 1.0 cm rectangles in a dry state. After weighing, the test membranes were soaked and washed with saline to be implanted after pericardiotomy via thoracotomy. At Days 4, 7, 10, 14, and 28 after implantation, the rats were euthanized, the chest was opened, and the condition and implantation site of the inserted test membrane were examined. Results: Although approximately 10 days were required for the test membrane to decrease to half in the thoracic cavity, the intrathoracic remnant decreased to a mean of 2% just 4 days later. Conclusion: This study clarified the time-dependent degradation process and remnants of insoluble hyaluronic acid in the thoracic cavity.

J,"Bindu, E; Reddy, BVR",RETRACTED: Capacity maximization in multi-user multiple input multiple output cognitive radio system through optimal beamforming design using game theory (Retracted Article),"A novel beamforming scheme based on non-cooperative game theory for multi-user multiple input multiple output cognitive radio network is proposed. In a cognitive network, the secondary transmitter is allowed to access the primary network spectrum when the interference to the primary network is below certain power threshold. While transmitting, the secondary user should cause minimal interference to primary user. So it is inevitable to use a transmit beamformer at the secondary user to focus the beam to desired receiver. A distributed iterative algorithm is formulated through non-cooperative game approach for optimizing the beamforming along with optimum power allocation by maximizing signal to interference ratio of secondary users. This is achieved by deriving an optimal pricing policy for each secondary user, which adapts to the strategies offered by rest of the users, which eventually converges the game into Nash equilibrium. Non-cooperative optimization of transmit power leads to maximization of signal to interference ratio. Subsequently, channel capacity maximization is achieved through water filling algorithm. Through simulations, the effectiveness of the game theory based algorithm is validated and impact of beamforming on signal to interference ratio and system capacity is discussed. The paper is constructed to help graduate students and research scholars easily understand the concept and application of game theory.",10.1177/0020720919883802,10,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no

J,"Poveda, H; Ferré, G; Tajan, R",Real-time decoding of automatic dependent surveillance - Broadcast signals by using software-defined radio and MATLAB®,"In telecommunications engineering degrees, simulations are used to understand better theoretical concepts. However, in courses related to digital communications or signal processing usually these simulations cannot be easily applied to real data or in real scenarios. This limitation does not allow the students to verify that the learned theoretical hypotheses are valid in practice. Nowadays, software defined radio platforms have been proposed to validate theoretical telecommunications concepts in real situations. Therefore, by combining a software defined radio and simulation tools, students can implement the learned notions over real data in real scenarios. This allows students to work under real applications in order to learn by experience and to see that the theoretical concepts are valid in the real world. This paper presents a project involving real-time decoding of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) signals, implemented by using a universal software radio peripheral software defined radio and MATLAB (R). The universal software radio peripheral allows to receive real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals sent by the aircraft. Then, by using MATLAB (R) tools, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast baseband signals are decoded. The students are guided through a manual to demodulate the real automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast signals and display in a map the aircraft trajectories. The evaluation is based on a competition between the students, considering execution time of their algorithms, and a final report of the project. This project allows to obtain a game-oriented and novel approach for teaching digital communications and signal processing. The implementation of this project in telecommunications engineering courses motivate the students, allowing them to understand better difficult theoretical concepts, and improve their computer, teamwork, and collaboration skills.

J,"Valasek, M; Marek, O; Olgac, N; Neusser, Z","Rigorous treatment of wave-based control concept, structured procedures and critical observations","The concept of wave-based control (WBC) has been around for about two decades. It is designed primarily for controlling the end-point motions of one-dimensional lumped mass flexible chains. The systems under consideration are, therefore, severely underactuated. Typical control objective for such systems is a point-to-point motion without unwanted residual oscillations. These oscillations, however, become troublesome especially for the lightly damped cases. The only way to attenuate them is to 'shape' the control input. For this WBC concept considers a set of hypothetical (forward and backward) motion waves, which combine to form the actual motions. This document critically investigates wonderful properties of WBC which are claimed over the years and presents a completely new mathematical and rigorous treatment of the method. We rectify several misconceptions, especially on the level of a priori knowledge which is required on the system dynamics. Second, the authors present a novel step-by-step procedure to design a WBC law which ultimately leads to a number of opportunities for future explorations.

These models estimate the volumetric reversible heat generation and EMF of electrochemical reactions, within each electrode at local conditions of temperature and pressure, based on entropy change of half reactions.

The 3D models considerably simplify the problem since the abdominal structures are separated, and in turn, this reduces the possibility of large segmentation errors. In addition, a fully automatic segmentation procedure was also implemented. Twenty slices of MRI at the abdominal region for each of twelve subjects were analysed.

The establishment of a simulation model is the fastest, most convenient, and practical way to achieve this goal. However, few scholars have focused on the reliability of a passenger train evacuation simulation model. This paper proposes a new validation method based on dynamic time warping and multidimensional scaling. The proposed method validates the dynamic process of a simulation model, provides statistical results, and can be used for small-sample scenarios such as a train evacuation scenario. The results of a case study indicate that the proposed method is an effective and quantitative approach to the validation of simulation models in a dynamic process. Thus, this paper describes the influence of the train structure size on an evacuation based on the results of simulation experiments. The structural size factors include the door width, aisle width, and seat pitch. The experiment results indicate that a wide aisle and reasonable seat pitch can promote a proper evacuation. In addition, a normal train door width has no effect on an evacuation.",10.1186/s10033-019-0399-6,23,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes

J,"Wulff, SS; Cao, YT; Robinson, TJ",DP Pareto optimal balanced orthogonal subplot designs,This paper considers the problem of identifying optimal Split-Plot Designs (SPDs) using traditional design criteria along with pure error degrees of freedom. An optimal SPD is of little use if it does not allow for suitable variance estimation of the whole plot and subplot variance components. The proposed approach incorporates a multi-criterion version of DP-optimality to represent the conflicting criteria involving the D-criterion and the replication at each design level. A set of Pareto optimal designs can then be obtained that consists of the optimal design with respect to each criterion and which cannot be dominated with respect to all the criteria. Key to this development is the notion of Orthogonal Subplot Designs (OSUBD) since this class of SPDs leads to a clear representation of DP-optimality. A number of common SPD design scenarios are provided to demonstrate the approach and to highlight the benefits of using the proposed multi-objective criterion.,10.1080/16843703.2019.1683930,25,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes

Specifically, we analyze the degrading effects of quantization noise (Q(n)) upconversion on DDSR sensitivity, which is a major concern in mixer-first DDSR architecture. We demonstrate that with the chosen approach, the mixer-first architecture is suitable for the DDSR despite the potential challenges arising from Q(n) upconversion. A systematic modeling and understanding of Q(n) upconversion effects is presented, which lead to simple design guidelines. The results demonstrate that a first-order low-pass Q(n) filtering is sufficient in most cases for mixer-first DDSR implementations. Based on analytical results, we design a transistor-level mixer-first DDSR by merging the functionality of N-path capacitors both as channel select and Q(n) filters.

Dexamethasone is commonly used to deal with musculoskeletal disorder with dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward tenocytes. Ascorbic acid is essential for tenocytes culture and collagen secretion and can alleviate the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone.

The deposition morphology of the dried drop changes significantly when such a drop dries in the vicinity of another similar drop. Here we present an observational study and statistical analysis of the patterns formed inside an isolated as well as interacting drops of gelatin containing sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). In all the cases, multiple concentric regions of solute particles combined with the polymer gel appear as the drops dry up. Needle crystals of sulfur and coacervates of salt and gelatin are visible in some regions. The outer region becomes non-uniform, so does the size distribution of the needle crystals and coacervates. The non-uniformity increases with proximity of the drops. Here we propose a novel mechanism of growing patterns inside the single drop during drying and correlate that with the results obtained for interacting drops. This study and the proposed mechanism provide insights into the future studies of drying drops under different physical conditions. Further we explore the statistical characteristics of the single and interacting drops using the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images. Next, we report fractal and image texture analyses along with object shape statistics of the drop FESEM images, under various experimental conditions.

This procedure allows for a multiscale decomposition of any signal. When the chosen points are the zeros of the th GSF, scaling functions generate a -dimensional space and happen to be orthogonal.

J,"Kajiya, D",An agar sandwich method for patterning transparent conducting oxides,"Transparent electrodes are frequently used to drive opto-electronic devices, and the patterning of these electrodes is essential. The present work demonstrates a facile means of removing transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) from a glass substrate in selected areas. When agarose gel (agar), a material typically used in desserts, is sandwiched between two TCO-coated glass substrates and connected to a dry cell, the TCO is removed from the glass at the agar stamping area within 2 min. This method allows etching of TCOs using acid-free, inexpensive, and readily available starting materials. Analyses by optical microscopy, transmission spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that this etching occurs as a result of reduction of the TCO in conjunction with the electrolysis of water at the interface between the TCO and agar surfaces. Using this technique, high-throughput patterning of TCOs with an edge resolution of several micrometres was achieved. Furthermore, the shape of the agar template can be readily changed simply by cutting the agar using scissors. Therefore, this method provides a useful means for both researchers and students to easily fabricate patterned substrates for use in electronics and related technologies.",10.1007/s10854-019-02440-4,37,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

In this work, we introduce a novel error protection scheme for memory, based on feature extraction through Principal Component Analysis and the modular-wise technique to segment the data before PCA. The extracted features can be protected by replacing the fault vector with the averaged confinement vectors. This approach confines the errors with either single or multi-bit flips for generic data blocks, whilst achieving significant savings on execution time and memory usage compared to traditional ECC techniques.

The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction.

The developed simulation model, which has been verified experimentally, was used to determine the influence of changes in meteorological parameters on the temperature distributions on the surface of the lamp. It will be used in the future to optimize the geometry of the heat sink used in the lamp in terms of electricity consumption and thermal resistance. It is planned to extend the application of the lamp under difficult climatic conditions. Abstract The article presents the results of experimental and theoretical works aimed at determining the distribution of heat emitted by an obstacle lighting lamp. These kind of lamps are commonly applied as a warning for air traffic vehicles. There is a need for lighting devices with various intensities, whose application depends on the location and operating conditions. The overall aim of the author's work is to develop a computer model that would enable us to conduct research aimed at determining the optimal parameters of lamp operation without the need to build many physical models. Measurements of heat emitted by a currently manufactured lamp were made, and based on these, a numerical model of the lamp operating under laboratory conditions was developed. The considered lamp has two heat sources, one of which is light-emitting diodes (LEDs), while the other heat source consists of stabilizers and other elements of the lamp power supply system. After positive experimental verification of the numerical model, theoretical analyses of heat emission under various meteorological conditions were carried out, while the values of ambient temperature and airflow velocity were changed; then, the influence of these parameters on the temperature distribution on the surface of the lamp was determined.",10.3390/app9224951,47,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes

J,"Abbas, JL; Allawi, AA",Structural Behavior of Axially Loaded Composite Concrete-steel Plate Shear Walls,"composite concrete-steel plate shear walls are the most critical resisting structural members that resist lateral and axial loads. This type of wall consisting of two steel faceplates presenting the outer skin, infill concrete and shear connectors which are used to provide the composite action of the steel faceplates with infill concrete in order to increase the strength and to reduce the local buckling of steel faceplates. The experimental investigation of composite concrete - steel plate shear walls under axial loads is presented in this research. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of concrete compressive strength and the thickness of the wall on the axial capacity, lateral displacement and axial shortening of the walls. The obtained results indicate that the increase in compressive strength of concrete enhances the ultimate axial load capacity of the wall and it should have an effect on crushing strength of the composite wall which can affect the failure loads of the composite walls. In addition, the concrete strength increased by enlarging the thickness of wall from 55mm to 70mm and this is because the concrete participation leads to large assistance to avoid relatively steel plate from premature buckling as well as, the concrete plays an important role in avoiding instability of steel plate. Thus, the failure load, lateral displacement at top and mid-height of the wall as well as the axial shortening at failure load increased by increasing the compressive strength and increasing the wall thickness of the wall. The failure of the composite walls was started by local buckling of the steel plates, cracking and crushing of the concrete infill in the top region of the composite wall.",10.5829/ije.2019.32.11a.06,50,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no

In this work, the performance of denoising process is analyzed based on calculated mean square error (MSE) and signal to noise ratio (SNR).

It is a viable alternative to today's widely used RF technologies in order to avoid the associated health risks for a specific group of interest, namely babies. Special signal processing and circuit techniques are proposed to overcome drawbacks of classical ultrasound communications; such as echoes and excess ringing, achieving a measured communication range of 28m with a 50bit/is data rate and bit error rate (BER) of 0.01. Targeting a biomedical sensory pacifier, the proposed design needs to be insulated, small size, and low power. Utilizing a 40 kHz ultrasound transducer and a 5-pin low-power controller, a wirelessly-charged high-accuracy remote temperature sensor system with nominal average current consumption of 0.416 mu A is designed and tested. Multiple subsystems were merged in total volume of 12mm diameter and 15mm height, excluding the charging coil, which is designed as the pacifier's handler. Thanks to echo avoidance, ringing suppression, dynamic detection threshold adjustment techniques along with 3-bit preamble synchronization; the proposed low-power sub-sampling IQ demodulation of OOK bits results in high-sensitivity robust ultrasound communication system without any alignment requirement for the transducers.

To achieve the objective of the research study, a congestion control after fast-recovery module for congestion control scheme of Multistream Fast TCP is proposed. The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Consequently, Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP consumes the available network bandwidth in lesser time and increases the throughput and goodput.

This oil can be improved based on its natural behaviour and can be used as an alternative to replace widely used commercial mineral oils. Thus, the negative impact towards the environment can be reduced. The purpose of this research is to study the performance of two type of lubricants which are vegetable oil (Palm Stearin) and commercial mineral engine oil (CMEO).

The materials used for this experiment are pure aluminium pin (A110) with spherical head and stainless steel disc (SKD11) with four grooves.

The wear rate and coefficient of friction can be determined in this experiment. From the result obtained, the coefficient of friction (COF) of palm stearin is 45% higher than CMEO and also the trend for both oils are inversely proportional with sliding speed. Besides that, the wear rate of palm stearin is also higher than CMEO, which shows that CMEO has better lubrication performance when compared to palm stearin.

A depth-integrated CFD model, based on the finite-volume method, is developed and applied to calculate detailed velocity and temperature distributions inside the pond. The numerical model is validated by comparing results with temperature measurements available for an experimental cooling pond. The model is used to investigate effect of mass flow rate (m) on pond hydrodynamics and thermal characteristics for cases of without and with internal baffles. The results show that the pressure loss coefficient remains constant, while the pressure drop between pond inlet and outlet increases with increasing m. The heat dissipated from the pond at the air-water interface increases with m despite the decrease in difference between water inlet and outlet temperatures. The pond effective heat-transfer coefficient, pond mean temperature, and water loss by evaporation are determined as a function of m. and relative humidity. The outlet temperature from the pond is determined as a function of pond cooling capacity. Streamline plots show that the flow pattern is independent of m but is strongly dependent on geometric configuration. A single contour map of normalized speed is, therefore, sufficient to describe all speeds inside the pond for different m. It is recommended that m should be as high as possible in order to enhance heat transfer from the pond but this would increase pumping power of cooling water through condenser tubes in which a compromise must be sought.",10.5004/dwt.2019.24548,65,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no

Currently traditional reinforced concrete floor slabs at least 20 centimetres thick are still designed and built. Such practice has no justification, as thick concrete floor slabs hinder architectural creativity as well as all the other aforementioned aspects. In this paper, the authors analyse and demonstrate the simultaneous correlation between flexibility-adaptability, energy efficiency, seismic safety and the mass of the floor slabs in residential buildings. Massive floor slabs limit the distance between load-bearing walls and consequently the adaptability of residential space. A large mass directly intensifies the seismic forces it induces. Thick concrete slabs have high heat capacity, as they have high mass and volume. The solution to floor slabs which satisfy all three aspects is to design and build them as waffle slabs. These two-way spanning concrete slabs have low mass, are rigid and can span the distance of more than 10 metres between two load-bearing walls. The authors of this paper suggest that floor slabs conform to the limitation in mass provided in this paper under Eq. (5) and (6).

J,"Amirsoleimani, P; Panahi, A; Amiri, GG; Darvishan, E",Comparison of Seismic Behavior of Buckling-restrained Braces and Yielding Brace System in Irregular and Regular Steel Frames under Mainshock and Mainshock-Aftershock,"Due to low stiffness of braces after yielding, the structures with buckling-restrained braces (BRBs) experience high residual drifts during an earthquake, which can be intensified by aftershocks and causes considerable damages to structures. Also, due to poor distribution of stiffness, this problem is exacerbated for irregular structures. Recently, the yielding brace system (YBS) has been introduced; which is an alternative to BRBFs to solve this problem. YBS has a secondary stiffening part in its hysteresis behavior which can prevent excessive deformations. Therefore, structures with YBS are expected to show a better peroformance in seismic sequences compared to BRBs. However, the seismic behavior of the YBS system in irregular structures has not been studied so far. On this basis, this paper investigates the seismic behavior of frames with BRB and YBS in regular and irregular structures under seismic sequences. Twenty four 4-, 8-, and 12-story frames with these two systems were designed and evaluated. First, a nonlinear dynamic analysis was conducted on the frames under mainshocks, and the maximum interstory drift and the residual interstory drift of the frames were compared. Then, using incremental dynamic analysis and fragility curves, the behavior of the frames under mainshocks was investigated.

J,"Amromin, E",Capillary Waves Joint to Super-Hydrophobic Bars,"Super-hydrophobic coating reduces hydrodynamic drag of rigid surfaces due to separation of a part of the surface from the flow by air. The drag reduction ratio is proportional to the ratio of the surface area covered by air to the whole surface area. The maximum ratio may be achieved for coating with a regular spanwise super-hydrophobic bar. The air-water boundary over such bar would be a capillary wave with wavelength equal the distance between bar apexes. The numerical analysis of such waves was carried out by solving a two-dimensional nonlinear free-boundary problem of ideal fluid theory. Besides several wave shapes, the main computational results include dependencies of wavelengths and dimensionless pressure coefficient necessary for wave maintenance on Weber number. These dependencies make it possible to select the bar size and inflow speed allowing for existence of such waves and the highest drag reduction ratios.",10.1115/1.4043424,69,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no
J,"Nguyen, AH; Tanigawa, Y; Tode, H",Adaptive Channel Access Control Solving Compound Problem of Hidden Nodes and Continuous Collisions among Periodic Data Flows,"With the rapid increase in IoT (Internet of Things) applications, more sensor devices, generating periodic data flows whose packets are transmitted at regular intervals, are being incorporated into WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks). However, packet collision caused by the hidden node problem is becoming serious, particularly in large-scale multi-hop WSNs. Moreover, focusing on periodic data flows, continuous packet collisions among periodic data flows occur if the periodic packet transmission phases become synchronized. In this paper, we tackle the compounded negative effect of the hidden node problem and the continuous collision problem among periodic data flows. As this is a complex variant of the hidden node problem, there is no simple and well-studied solution. To solve this problem, we propose a new MAC layer mechanism. The proposed method predicts a future risky duration during which a collision can be caused by hidden nodes by taking into account the periodic characteristics of data packet generation. In the risky duration, each sensor node stops transmitting data packets in order to avoid collisions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that considers the compounded effect of hidden nodes and continuous collisions among periodic data flows. Other advantages of the proposed method include eliminating the need for any new control packets and it can be implemented in widely-diffused IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 devices.",10.1587/transcom.2018EBP3329,70,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes
J,"Animah, I",A fuzzy analytical hierarchy process-weighted linear combination decision-making model for prioritization of ballast water treatment technologies by ship owners in Ghana,"Giving the ratification of the ballast water management convention, a number of ballast water treatment technologies are emerging in the maritime industry; however, choosing the most appropriate technology has been a big challenge for ship owners because it is a very complex and critical task. The aim of this article is to propose a multi-attribute decision analysis model which integrates the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and the weighted linear combination method into a more comprehensive approach to select the most appropriate ballast water treatment technology for ship owners. The proposed model consists of 6 attributes (i.e. technological readiness, commercial readiness, operational readiness, seafarer's skills readiness, biological efficacy readiness and cost of ballast water treatment technologies) and 17 ballast water treatment technologies among which ship owners can choose the best. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process is used to obtain more realistic weights of the attributes, while the weighted linear combination is applied to prioritize the technologies. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, it is applied to select the best ballast water treatment technology for a ship owner in Ghana. The result shows that the ballast water treatment technology which uses membrane filter is selected as the best. Sensitivity analysis is then carried out to determine the effect of changing attributes' weights on the final priority rankings of the ballast water treatment technologies. Finally, the model is validated by comparing the obtained results to those from the PROMETHEE model and both results are consistent.",10.1177/1475090218817041,71,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no

J,"Arvelo, ER; Martins, NC",Optimal sensor scheduling for station-keeping in denied environments,"Consider that a particle-like agent, affected by exogenous disturbances, seeks to remain as close as possible to a reference point. Its state evolves as a Markov decision process in discrete time and the actuation effort is cost-free. A denied environment within which state measurements must be requested and are costly encloses the reference point. Measurements outside the denied region are provided cost-free without the need for a request. No control is applied in the absence of a measurement. At each time step, the agent has the authority to decide whether to wander like a random walk or to request a measurement and use it to move towards the reference point. This paper investigates measurement request policies that minimize an objective function that comprises the expected mean squared deviation of the agent from the reference point and the cost of requesting a measurement inside the denied region. The goal is to characterize the trade-off between paying to access the state immediately and waiting for a free measurement that occurs when the agent is carried outside the denied region by the accrued effect of the disturbances over time. We show that the analysis of this problem simplifies by recasting it as a renewal reward process, for which the maximum wait time between the most recent renewal and a measurement request parametrizes all policies. Our analysis concerning wait-time optimization enabled us to establish conditions under which any local minimum (if it exists) is also global within a pre-specified interval, thus facilitating the search for a minimizer. Our results are discussed for the cases in which the agent's loci are the integers or a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Baek, YJ",On Non-Completeness and G-Equivariance,"With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.",10.3390/app9214692,77,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

J,"Baker, NT; Diaz, D; Bailly, D; David, L; Monnier, JC",Mechanical vs. phenomenological formulations to determine mean aerodynamic drag from stereo-PIV wake measurements,"The present work compares two different drag formulations based on a global balance of momentum (cf. for instance Rival and Van Oudheusden in Exp Fluids 58(3):20, 2017) fed with wake surveys of a finite-size wing. The traditional expression in terms of velocity and static pressure is considered, and compared to the phenomenological drag breakdown put forward by Meheut and Bailly (AIAA J 46(4):847-862, 2008) within the aerodynamic context. Both formulations require information on the velocity field, but also the static or stagnation pressure in the wake plane of the model of interest. In this paper, we focus on computing the results based on velocity data exclusively, acquired by stereo-PIV. These two methods are benchmarked experimentally on the wake of a SACCON model (Schutte et al. in J Aircraft 49(6):1638-1651, 2012) that has been measured in one of ONERA's wind-tunnels, and their performance is evaluated by comparing their results to direct force balance measurements. It is shown that while both formulations perform similarly, with drag predictions lying within 10% of the balance measurements, the phenomenological approach can additionally inform on the physical origins of drag. The latter method may thus be valuable to aerodynamicists, by giving them valuable clues as to how to fine-tune the performances of a given airframe.",10.1007/s00348-019-2813-3,80,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes

The proposed passive mixer is part of a medical implant communication service (MICS) receiver front-end operating at 402-405 MHz. By performing time-domain analysis, two LTI models have been developed to study the fully-differential double-balanced passive mixer: A simplified model and a complete model taking into account harmonic components. Both models account for the AC coupling capacitors at the mixer input and account for baseband voltage variation over one LO period. In this study it has been shown the ability of mixer input impedance matching by varying baseband resistor at the mixer output. The frequency of match can be controlled by varying the AC coupling capacitors and baseband capacitors. The performance of the proposed models was compared with that of the mixer and the results were very close. In particular, the results of simulations of the input impedance as a function of the baseband resistance and as a function of the IF frequency show the validity of the proposed models.

J,"Calvo-Brenes, G; Mora-Molina, J",Development of a basin management program to improve water quality in rivers based on an environmental water quality predictive model,"This research has the aim of establishing the amount of land that the Conservation Area National System (SINAC) needs to buy and specifying its use inside the Golfo Dulce Forest Reserve in order to maintain the good quality of the rivers. The study was done inside Rincon sub-basin in the Osa Peninsula, a land dedicated to primary and secondary forest (Melina tree plantations), mangrove forest, urbanism, chaparral, pasture for grazing livestock and crop cultivation, mainly rice and African palm; uses that may change in time affecting the actual water quality (WQ) in rivers and the bay. Changes in land uses modify the WQ and it can be predicted using WQ models based on environmental variables through the evaluation of different scenarios. It was found through modeling that pasture or chaparral land use has no negative impact on WQ; all the contrary happens with increments in crop cultivation or human population. At the present, the coastal area, adjacent to the reserve, has low agricultural activity but that could increase over time, affecting the WQ. Therefore, SINAC should continue with its acquisition land activity to counteract the negative environmental effect of agricultural activity to preserve the actual good quality of the rivers.",10.2166/ws.2019.079,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Camacho-Vallejo, JF; Nucamendi-Guillén, S; González-Ramírez, RG",An optimization framework for the distribution process of a manufacturing company balancing deliverymen workload and customer's waiting times,"In this paper, we consider the distribution process of a manufacturing company that supplies products to the customers located in a service region. The company distributes its products partitioning the service region into delivery zones or districts that are served by a single deliveryman. Two objectives are considered when designing the delivery zones: balance the workload associated with each zone, and the minimization of the customers' waiting times (latency). The former objective concerns a districting decision, and the latter objective is related to a routing decision. To support these planning decisions, an optimization framework based on a novel bi-objective optimization model is proposed. To approximate the frontier of non-dominated solutions of the bi-objective problem, an efficient heuristic algorithm inspired in the c-constraint method is developed. The proposed algorithm exploits the characteristics of the problem, and it is used to solve a real case study. Obtained results are compared with the current solution employed by the company. Both objective function values are improved by any of the solutions in the approximated Pareto front. To show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, an additional set of instances derived from the case study is tested. The results indicate that the algorithm is able to approximate the Pareto fronts despite their shape. Hence, interesting managerial insights to improve the current decisions of the company are provided derived from the computational experiments.",10.1016/j.cie.2019.106080,95,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes

This study mainly deals with the multipath suppression problem in three-dimensional (3D) through-the-wall radar imaging. The authors propose a correlation-matching multipath suppression algorithm to eliminate the first-order back wall multipath ghosts. Specifically, they first extract the barycentre coordinates of all objects in the original radar image. Second, a decision criterion is provided to measure the relevance between these objects. If two objects are closely related, they assert that they have multipath-target relationship. Finally, they eliminate the multipath ghosts after all objects being determined. At the analysis stage, they assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulation results, which shows its ability of well-removing multipath ghosts.",10.1049/joe.2019.0546,96,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes

However, its application in elliptical planar array remains to be validated. Here, the authors first analyse the properties of monopulse ratio curves for phased array radar with elliptical plane. Then, formulas about the weighted fusion monopulse angle estimation are derived according to the theory of four-channel monopulse. Finally, the relationship between the angle estimation performance and the target position is examined by simulation experiments, and the result is compared with that of the traditional monopulse method. The results show that the weighted fusion four-channel monopulse angle estimation method can effectively improve the accuracy of angle estimation, and this improvement would be more salient when the target deviation angle increases.",10.1049/joe.2019.0660,98,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no
J,"Cassenti, BN",<i>L</i><sub>1</sub> to Mars: A Combined Robotic/Piloted Mars Mission,"Mission scenarios for piloted Mars mission have traditionally consisted of a landing on Mars followed by a long stay time before the Earth-Mars planetary alignment would allow a minimum energy return. The long mission times increase both cost and risk, which need to reach levels below current projections before any such missions will be practical. An option that may eventually prove advantageous would be to orbit the spacecraft at the sun-Mars L-1 Lagrange point. Such a mission appears possible using bimodal nuclear thermal electric propulsion (BNTEP). The use of BNTEP can decrease round-trip mission times to Mars to one year, significantly reducing not only the cost, but also the risks from cosmic rays, solar flares, weightlessness, and isolation. Orbiting the spacecraft near the Lagrange equilibrium point L-1, using high-performance electric propulsion systems driven by nuclear power, reduces the propellant mass (cost) required and the risk by shortening the mission time. Because L-1 is an unstable equilibrium point, little propellant is required to leave after parking at L-1. Stationing the spacecraft also allows for the use of electric propulsion to enter and leave the equilibrium point. Leaving from L-1 using electric propulsion will also significantly shorten the transit time back to Earth, primarily because spiraling out from low Mars orbit will not be necessary. For BNTEP mission scenarios to become a reality, high-performance electric propulsion needs to be developed and high-performance bimodal nuclear thermal reactors need to be designed and tested.",10.2514/1.A34349,99,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
