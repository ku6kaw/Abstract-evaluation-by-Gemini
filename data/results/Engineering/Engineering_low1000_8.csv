J,"Qu, FZ; Zhang, MH; Wang, ZD; Qian, CJ; Lu, XS; Wei, Y",Sparse channel estimation for filtered multi-tone in time domain and subband domain based on matched filtering demodulation,"The interference between filtered multi-tone (FMT) symbols exists and becomes conspicuous especially in frequency selective fading channel, like an underwater acoustic channel. This leads to the necessity of channel estimation and equalisation. In this study, the authors consider two approaches to utilise the channel sparsity to improve FMT channel estimation performance and further reduce bit error rate in underwater acoustic communications. While the first studies FMT sparse channel estimation in the time domain and is based on received FMT signal and known transmitted FMT signal that is reconstructed by pilots, the second is based on matched filtering demodulated FMT symbols and pilots. Theoretical analysis is performed followed by simulation and experiment accordingly. It is found that the first method is able to successfully estimate the sparse channel while the estimation performance of the second method is unsatisfactory due to poor orthogonality between bases of the channel estimation matrix. Moreover, the lake experiment is carried out with the first method and its results prove that sparse channel estimation has better performance than least square channel estimation.",10.1049/iet-com.2018.5931,0,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no

The proposed antenna is investigated using circular wire loop antenna designing and is, then, extended to a strip structure antenna. Here, a circular reflector is employed to achieve maximum gain, while a coax line feeds the dipole element. Additionally, the presence of a balun, or lack thereof, is examined. The bazooka balun balances the coaxial cable and increases the bandwidth. Consequently, a wide bandwidth and a triple bandwidth are achieved. The resulting parameters demonstrate that the entire S, partial L and C IEEE radio bands comprise the bandwidth of the proposed antenna. The simulated current distribution, experimented and simulated efficiency, radiation pattern, reflection coefficient and gain of the designed antenna are also examined.

J,"Gao, YF; Shi, YY; Cao, WG; Zhang, S; Liang, ZR",Energy enhanced tissue texture in spectral computed tomography for lesion classification,"Tissue texture reflects the spatial distribution of contrasts of image voxel gray levels, i.e., the tissue heterogeneity, and has been recognized as important biomarkers in various clinical tasks. Spectral computed tomography (CT) is believed to be able to enrich tissue texture by providing different voxel contrast images using different X-ray energies. Therefore, this paper aims to address two related issues for clinical usage of spectral CT, especially the photon counting CT (PCCT): (1) texture enhancement by spectral CT image reconstruction, and (2) spectral energy enriched tissue texture for improved lesion classification. For issue (1), we recently proposed a tissue-specific texture prior in addition to low rank prior for the individual energy-channel low-count image reconstruction problems in PCCT under the Bayesian theory. Reconstruction results showed the proposed method outperforms existing methods of total variation (TV), low-rank TV and tensor dictionary learning in terms of not only preserving texture features but also suppressing image noise. For issue (2), this paper will investigate three models to incorporate the enriched texture by PCCT in accordance with three types of inputs: one is the spectral images, another is the co-occurrence matrices (CMs) extracted from the spectral images, and the third one is the Haralick features (HF) extracted from the CMs. Studies were performed on simulated photon counting data by introducing attenuation-energy response curve to the traditional CT images from energy integration detectors. Classification results showed the spectral CT enriched texture model can improve the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score by 7.3%, 0.42% and 3.0% for the spectral images, CMs and HFs respectively on the five-energy spectral data over the original single energy data only. The CM- and HF-inputs can achieve the best AUC of 0.934 and 0.927. This texture themed study shows the insight that incorporating clinical important prior information, e.g., tissue texture in this paper, into the medical imaging, such as the upstream image reconstruction, the downstream diagnosis, and so on, can benefit the clinical tasks.",10.1186/s42492-019-0028-3,7,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,

Design/methodology/approach LIF experiments under various impacting velocities were performed on SUS304 stainless steel tubes with various guiding lengths on a custom-designed measurement system to investigate the effects of impacting velocity and guiding length on the coefficient of friction (COF) in the guiding zone. Findings The results indicate that the COF changes dynamically in the guiding zone and decreases with the deformation process. The reduction range of the COF is wider in LIF than in both the conventional and pulsating hydroforming (THF), which may be contributed to the impacting velocities in a short time. Moreover, the COF decreases faster in the first half of the LIF process than in the second half. Under different impacting velocities and guiding lengths, the decreasing rate of the COF in the first half is more sensitive and obvious than that in the second half. Originality/value A method for determining the COF in the guiding zone in LIF is proposed and the frictional characteristics in LIF are studied. Comparing the COF of tubes in conventional THF, pulsating THF and the LIF process is valuable for improving and predicting the tubular formability in various hydraulic environments for industrial production.",10.1108/ILT-07-2019-0269,11,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no
J,"Ni, JC; Li, L",Memetic Variable Clustering and Its Application,"Clustering analysis is an important and difficult task in data mining and big data analysis. Although being a widely used clustering analysis technique, variable clustering did not get enough attention in previous studies. Inspired by the metaheuristic optimization techniques developed for clustering data items, we try to overcome the main shortcoming of k-means-based variable clustering algorithm, which is being sensitive to initial centroids by introducing the metaheuristic optimization. A novel memetic algorithm named MCLPSO (Memetic Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization) based on CLPSO (Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization) has been studied under the framework of memetic computing in our previous work. In this work, MCLPSO is used as a metaheuristic approach to improve the k-means-based variable clustering algorithm by adjusting the initial centroids iteratively to maximize the homogeneity of the clustering results. In MCLPSO, a chaotic local search operator is used and a simulated annealing- (SA-) based local search strategy is developed by combining the cognition-only PSO model with SA. The adaptive memetic strategy can enable the stagnant particles which cannot be improved by the comprehensive learning strategy to escape from the local optima and enable some elite particles to give fine-grained local search around the promising regions. The experimental result demonstrates a good performance of MCLPSO in optimizing the variable clustering criterion on several datasets compared with the original variable clustering method. Finally, for practical use, we also developed a web-based interactive software platform for the proposed approach and give a practical case study-analyzing the performance of semiconductor manufacturing system to demonstrate the usage.",10.1155/2019/4195318,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Abbasi, MR; Guleria, A; Devi, MS",A genetic algorithm-based flow update scheduler for software-defined networks,"Software-defined networking (SDN) facilitates network programmability through a central controller. It dynamically modifies the network configuration to adapt to the changes in the network. In SDN, the controller updates the network configuration through flow updates, ie, installing the flow rules in network devices. However, during the network update, improper scheduling of flow updates can lead to a number of problems including overflowing of the switch flow table memory and the link bandwidth. Another challenge is minimizing the network update completion time during large-network updates triggered by events such as traffic engineering path updates. The existing centralized approaches do not search the solution space for flow update schedules with optimal completion time. We proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm-based flow update scheduling method (the GA-Flow Scheduler). By searching the solution space, the GA-Flow Scheduler attempts to minimize the completion time of the network update without overflowing the flow table memory of the switches and the link bandwidth. It can be used in combination with other existing flow scheduling methods to improve the network performance and reduce the flow update completion time. In this paper, the GA-Flow Scheduler is combined with a stand-alone method called the three-step method. Through large-scale experiments, we show that the proposed hybrid approach could reduce the network update time and packet loss. It is concluded that the proposed GA-Flow Scheduler provides improved performance over the stand-alone three-step method. Also, it handles the above-mentioned network update problems in SDN.",10.1002/dac.4188,13,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

MethodsSixty-three consecutive patients (35 males, age: 53.5 14.4 years) without any exclusion criteria who had undergone PVC ablation between 1 July 2018 and 1 July 2019 constituted our study population. The time interval between the beginning of the EGM and the beginning of the QRS of each catheter-induced PVC (Cath EGM-ECG) and the time interval between the beginning of the EGM of clinical PVCs at the earliest site and the beginning of the QRS of clinical PVCs (PVC earliest EGM-ECG) were noted for each patient. The value of Cath EGM-ECG as a reference for procedural success of ablation was evaluated by examining the relationship between Cath EGM-ECG and PVC earliest EGM-ECG. ResultsFifty-two patients had successful ablation, and 43 of them (82.7%) had PVC earliest EGM-ECG values greater than or equal to Cath EGM-ECG. Eleven patients had procedural failure, and all of them had PVC earliest EGM-ECG values lower than Cath EGM-ECG. A PVC earliest EGM-ECG value -1.5 ms greater than Cath EGM-ECG predicted successful ablation with a sensitivity of 90.4% and a specificity of 100.0% in the general patient population.

J,"Heldin, M; Wiklund, U",Influences of load and temperature on groundwood pulping with well-defined tools,"Groundwood pulping is an industrial process with a high energy demand, although only a minor part of the energy is used for actually separating the fibres and the rest for working them. Traditionally, the separation process employs a grinding stone having particles embedded in a softer matrix. The position and distribution of the particles have been random, causing their interaction with the wood to also be random. This makes studies of the mechanisms during the separation process difficult. Knowledge of the mechanisms in the separation process helps when designing future tools aimed at energy efficiency or tailored fibre properties. Recently, grinding surfaces having diamond particles brazed to a steel backing at fixed positions have been developed and commercialised. In this work, individual particles are not positioned at the tool surfaces. Instead, well-defined structured diamond films, soldered to a backing, are used as grinding tools. The grinding asperities of such films can be tailored to shapes that are not possible to achieve by using particles. Using this kind of tool in a lab scale grinding equipment, confirms the well-known fact that increased load or increased temperature both lead to lower energy consumption for fibre separation and longer, less damaged fibres.",10.1016/j.wear.2019.203051,20,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes

In this paper, we propose optimal RS codes (OptRS codes in short) based on RS codes and CRS codes that can offer better performance for encoding and decoding as well as maximizing the utilization of storage space. OptRS codes can speed up the matrix computation which is regarded as the most important factor to impact the efficiency of coding by transferring the matrix computation from the Galois field mapping to the XOR operation. OptRS codes employ an algorithm called row elimination scheme (RE scheme in short), which can eliminate the same XOR operation to minimize the number of XOR operations. We analyze optimal matrices (OM in short) in theory, which prove the optimal performance of OptRS codes over the Galois field. Our method is implemented on the top of the distributed storage system, and code parameters were carefully chosen. The test result shows that OptRS codes can improve the performance in different data block numbers, parity block numbers, block size, normal reading, and degraded reading, compared with RS codes and CRS codes.",10.1155/2019/4163780,23,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

The internal air flow field of the test room for ASWC is determined by air supply from the air outlets. In this investigation, the air field of the test room is analyzed in calculation with the air velocities set at 1.5 m/s, 2.0 m/s, 2.5 m/s and 3.0 m/s in six air supply ducts including square duct (model A, control group), the air supply duct at 30(B)/45(C)/60(D) slope, air supply duct with equal height continuous slope (E) and that with equal air flow continuous slope (F). High similarity is found between calculation results and experimental verification thereafter in most of the models.

The statistical matching problem is one of those cases. The statistical matching problem has been recently studied also inside a misclassification setting. To proceed with a correction in such a framework, if marginal assessments on the conditioning event are wanted to remain fixed, the only possible solutions are the closest Frechet-Hoeffding bounds for the misclassification probabilities. On the contrary, if also the marginal probabilities are allowed to be modified, the -based procedure can be applied by a straightforward translation in an MIP problem.

J,"Choi, HC; Kim, MS",Image style transfer learning for style-strength control,"Image style transferring is a process of generating an output image in a target style from a given pair of content and target style images. Recently, a simple linear interpolation technique in encoded feature space has been employed in this process to generate output images of intermediate style because controlling the strength of style transferring effect is a key function of an image editing filter. However, this simple technique is effective in generating images of around full style but around zero style hence it cannot smoothly control the style transferring effect from an original content image to a fully stylised image. In this Letter, the authors tackle the missing work on style-strength control from content reconstruction to full style generation. To deal with this problem, they propose to use additional unbiased training data and losses for a style transfer network to learn an unbiased regression between output style strength and style control parameter.

In most of the developing countries, the mortality and morbidity rate have increased due to CHD. Invasive and noninvasive methods are used to measure the pathogenicity of the liver. In this study, ultrasonographic images, clinical findings, and laboratory findings are used to determine the stages of CHD. The stages of CHD are (a) chronic hepatitis, (b) compensated cirrhosis, and (c) decompensate cirrhosis. The histopathological analysis is adopted by the invasive method to conduct a liver biopsy. Results of liver biopsy have shown some kind of complications such as pain after liver biopsy, pneumothorax, bleeding, or puncture of the biliary tree and rarely death due to heavy bleeding. In such situations, noninvasive procedures are used as an alternative for liver biopsy. In this study, Hough-based histogram-oriented gradient features are extracted and classified using combined multi-support vector machine and hidden Markov model classifiers. A large number of feature models containing 42 chronic hepatitis, 49 compensated cirrhosis, and 47 decompensate cirrhosis were selected specifically for the experimental study.

Wheelset-bearing fault detection is of great significance to ensure the safety of high-speed train service. Convolution sparse representations (CSRs) provide an excellent framework for extracting impulse responses induced by bearing faults. However, the performance of CSR on extracting impulse responses is fairly sensitive to inappropriate selection of method-related parameters, and a convolution model for representing the impulse responses has not been discussed. In view of these two unsolved problems, a convolutional representation model of the impulse response series is developed. A novel fault detection method, named adaptive CSR (ACSR), is then proposed based on combinations of CSR and methods for estimating three parameters related to CSR.

Recently, many CMH methods have been proposed to establish the semantic connection of different modalities. However, most of these methods only use a simple quantisation strategy, resulting in large quantisation error, and inferior hash codes. To address this issue, in this study, the authors propose a novel self-taught CMH (STCMH) to minimise the semantic encoding loss. In particular, the common semantic representations across different modalities are first learnt based on collective matrix factorisation. Then, the quantisation procedure based on orthogonal transformation is integrated to encode the semantic representations into discriminative binary codes. Moreover, similarity preservation is imposed to further boost the discriminative power. Finally, hashing functions learning is formulated as a binary classification problem by self-taught scheme.

Here, the fundamental relationship between inherent parameters of a dark and low contrast image, and the intensity of external noise-induced to produce best contrast enhancement is systematically modelled using regression line parameters. With this, the amount of noise to be added is automatically predicted, and is utilised to enhance the dark and low contrast document images. The proposed enhancement technique using noise-induced (non-dynamic) stochastic resonance is computationally very efficient, unlike the existing methods which estimate the optimum value of noise to be added through a time-consuming iterative method.

J,"Länger-Möller, A",Development of an interface to introduce stationary LES data to the URANS solver THETA for HAWT performance prediction,"The impact of different sheared velocity profiles on the performance prediction of a horizontal axis wind turbine in the atmospheric boundary layer is investigated. Firstly, the wall roughness in the analytical logarithmic description of the atmospheric boundary layer is varied to obtain different velocity profiles. Subsequently, it is proposed to replace the analytical logarithmic description of the atmospheric boundary layer by the time-averaged velocity data of a precursor large eddy simulation (LES) and to reconstruct the turbulence of the velocity fluctuations. The LES data are introduced as inflow condition through a LES-RANS interface in a one-way coupling approach. Three different methods to reconstruct URANS turbulence values out of the velocity fluctuations are investigated. It is shown that the reconstruction method has an impact on the development of the velocity profile, turbulent kinetic energy, and the turbulent dissipation during the transport through the URANS domain. The different inflow data, which the horizontal axis wind turbine experiences, are responsible for changes in the overall rotor thrust (up to 2.7%) and rotor torque (up to 2.4%). Conversely, the induction factors and effective angles of attack hardly change and can well be compared with a blade element momentum method. Finally, the results of both approaches to prescribe the atmospheric boundary layer are compared. The thrust and power coefficients, and wake recovery are close to each other. Simulations are carried out on an industrial 900 kW wind turbine with the incompressible URANS solver THETA.",10.1002/we.2421,51,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,

Methods Two hundred human hearts (Caucasian, 22.5% females, 48.7 +/- 4.9 years old) were investigated. Results The mean length of the medial isthmus was 42.4 +/- 8.6 mm. Additionally, the medial isthmus line was divided by the oval fossa into three sections with equal mean lengths (upper: 14.2 +/- 7.2 vs middle: 14.1 +/- 6.1 vs lower: 14.9 +/- 4.6 mm; P > .05). The left upper section of the atrial wall was thinner than the lower section (2.5 +/- 1.1 vs 3.4 +/- 1.6 mm; P < .0001). This study noted three separate spatial arrangements of the isthmus line. Type I (54.5%) had an oval fossa located outside the isthmus line; type II (32.5%) had an oval fossa crossed by the isthmus line, and type III (13.0%) had an oval fossa rim located tangentially to the isthmus line. In 68.5% of the examined specimens, the isthmus area had a smooth surface. Conversely, the remaining 31.5% had additional structures within its borders such as diverticula, recesses, and tissue bridges. Conclusion This study is the first to describe the morphometric and topographical features of the left atrial medial isthmus. Interventions within the medial isthmus line should be performed cautiously, especially when they are transected by the oval fossa (32.5%). Careful navigation of the area is also recommended due to the possibility of existent additional structures. The latter could lead to catheter entrapment during ablation procedures.",10.1111/pace.13834,53,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no

The performance of the linearity and nonlinearity to the proposed EMM system is evaluated and compared. Moreover, the voltage response in time history and the phase portrait are studied under an external rectifier circuit with a resistor. The results show that the nonlinearity of the reported EMM system changes the coherent resonance vibration mode from single to double under a harmonic base excitation within the frequency range of 20 Hz-50 Hz. Meanwhile, the substrate plate D contributes more averaged voltage output at a lower frequency while the substrate plate A contributes the voltage output at the relatively higher frequency for the nonlinear EMM system.

Consideration of the power balance in the lossy array antenna has allowed ascertaining that its impedance matrix is a sum of the radiation resistance matrix and loss resistance matrix, which are in general case complex Hermitian matrices and only in some particular cases can be real.

The circuit topology and SISL technology are combined together to reach balance in performances such as compact size, wideband, high frequency selectivity, low loss, good in-band isolation, wide stopband, and self-packaging so that there are no obvious flaws. Wide bandwidth and two near-band transmission zeros are contributed by the proposed circuit topology. Good isolation can be obtained by comparing different coupling schemes with one resistor. An additional transmission zero for extending the upper stopband can be achieved by the two closely placed stubs without increasing the size of the design.

First, the position adjustment formula of the tool coordinate system is proposed, and a coordinate plane is established to describe the grinding path of the robot based on the position adjustment formula.

The Tabulated Premixed CMC (TPCMC) model is a modification of the premixed CMC model that seeks to reduce the time consumed in solving equations by making the premixed CMC model amenable to the tabulation of chemistry. TPCMC model considers the effect of small scale mixing of reactants and products using the scalar dissipation rate and effect of large scale turbulence on the flame using the beta probability density function. The validation of TPCMC model using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data has been attempted in this paper. DNS of growth of an ignition kernel in a turbulent medium was performed for this purpose.

Twenty-three participants with a history of ACLR (Age = 21 +/- 3 years; Height = 174.5 +/- 7.2 cm; Mass = 76.2 +/- 9.9 kg) and 23 healthy controls participants (Age = 21 +/- 3 years; Height = 173.8 +/- 9.2 cm; Mass = 75.0 +/- 10.5 kg) were included. Kinematics were collected bilaterally. Correlations between tasks were evaluated for kinematics. Independent sample t-tests were used to evaluate differences between groups for each dependent variable. Peak trunk rotation and medial knee displacement were strongly correlated (p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.63), between tasks. ACLR group performed SLS and JC tasks with less sagittal plane motion compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Lack of frontal and transverse plane control during SLS resulted in positions of increased lateral trunk flexion, hip adduction, and medial knee displacement during JC.

With the continuous expansion of network capacity, the coverage area and the participating relays, it is unwise to traverse all the nodes to select the best relay. An optimal scheme based on cognitive wireless multi-hop relay selection has been proposed in this study, in which a threshold value is set for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Only when the SINR exceeds the threshold can the node be selected as the relay node. Because of the random distribution and geographical universality of the relay, the candidate relays would better be limited within a particular area. Then a model based on stochastic geometry is established to rapidly find the relay which meets the demand near optimally, without needing of the global channel state information of the network in advance. The simulation results show that the optimized scheme can reduce the searching time and improve the performance of the secondary transmission. In addition, theoretical formula of the outage probability and channel data transmission rate has also been derived and verified its effectiveness through simulation.",10.1007/s11227-019-03077-0,79,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

The retention behavior of these ions in different soils and combinations (binary and ternary system) has not been fully understood by previous studies. This study seeks to probe into the retention behavior of macro cations (Na+, K+, Ca+2) in six different soils under multiple combinations of ions solution. The retention of common ions was quantified by using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms. Na+ (single) pollutant-soil interaction was desorbed in most of the soils. The retention of K+ and Ca+2 was much greater than that of Na+. There is no definite trend for retention of Na+ in the presence of K+. For all soils, the retention results of K+ in the presence of Na+ decreased. Affinity for K+ was greater than that for Ca+2 in most of the soils. This study also demonstrated the affinity sequence of the ion retention for each soil and the percentage reduction of ions in competition with respect to single ions. Anomalous trends of the isotherm parameter fitting suggested the limitation of the mathematical models in predicting the experimental data.

But the traditional CF-based trackers have two inherent issues needed to be solved. On the one hand, the boundary effect caused by the circulant structure will affect the performance. On the other hand, the target response is assumed as Gaussian response and the value is fixed. In order to deal with the boundary effect, a spatially regularized method by imposing space penalties to the spatial coefficients is proposed. About the fixed target response, some researchers propose a framework that can adaptively change the response to deal with it, but the two issues only be coped with separately.
