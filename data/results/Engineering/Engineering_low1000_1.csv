First, we establish a communication model for offloading scalable tasks in TDD-OFDMA systems.

Around 130 t of NbTi strands were supplied and used for the PF conductors. During the package execution process, the Chinese Domestic Agency (CNDA) has organized the verification for the NbTi strand acceptance tests based on the requirements of the ITER procurement arrangement (PA). The verification tasks for NbTi strands were undertaken by the Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP). In total, about 550 billets of NbTi strands have been verified and supplied for the PF conductors. The verification levels fit the ITER PA requirements. The test results showed that the quality of the NbTi strands has been well controlled. In addition, in order to supply essential data for the conductor performance prediction and analysis, a full critical current I-c characterization of the NbTi strands, which requires a measurement of I-c versus field, B and temperature, T, has been obtained using the test facilities from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and ASIPP.

J,"Lugaresi, G; Lanzarone, E; Frigerio, N; Matta, A",A robust cardinality-constrained model to address the machine loading problem,"Several deterministic models have been proposed in the literature to solve the machine loading problem (MLP), which considers a set of product types to be produced on a set of machines using a set of tool types, and determines the quantity of each product type to be produced at each time period and the corresponding machine tool loading configuration. However, processing times are subject to random increases, which could impair the quality of a deterministic solution. Thus, we propose a robust MLP counterpart, searching for an approach that properly describes the uncertainty set of model parameters and, at the same time, ensures practical application. We exploit the cardinality-constrained approach, which considers a simple uncertainty set where all uncertain parameters belong to an interval, and allows tuning the robustness level by bounding the number of parameters that assume the worst value. The resulting plans provide accurate estimations on the minimum production level that a system achieves even in the worst conditions. The applicability of the robust MLP and the impact of robustness level have been tested on several problem variants, considering single- vs multi-machine and single vs multi-period MLPs. We also consider the execution of the plans in a set of scenarios to evaluate the practical implications of MLP robustness. Results show the advantages of the robust formulation, in terms of improved feasibility of the plans, identification of the most critical tools and products, and evaluation of the maximum achievable performance in relation to the level of protection. Moreover, low computational times guarantee the applicability of the proposed robust MLP counterpart.",10.1016/j.rcim.2019.101883,5,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,,
J,"Darby, J; Sánchez, MB; Bew, S; Loram, I; Butler, P",The development of a video retrieval system using a clinician-led approach,"Patient video taken at home can provide valuable insights into the recovery progress during a programme of physical therapy, but is very time consuming for clinician review. Our work focussed on (i) enabling any patient to share information about progress at home, simply by sharing video and (ii) building intelligent systems to support Physical Therapists (PTs) in reviewing this video data and extracting the necessary detail. This paper reports the development of the system, appropriate for future clinical use without reliance on a technical team, and the clinician involvement in that development. We contribute an interactive content-based video retrieval system that significantly reduces the time taken for clinicians to review videos, using human head movement as an example. The system supports query-by-movement (clinicians move their own body to define search queries) and retrieves the essential fine-grained movements needed for clinical interpretation. This is done by comparing sequences of image-based pose estimates (here head rotations) through a distance metric (here Frechet distance) and presenting a ranked list of similar movements to clinicians for review. In contrast to existing intelligent systems for retrospective review of human movement, the system supports a flexible analysis where clinicians can look for any movement that interests them. Evaluation by a group of PTs with expertise in training movement control showed that 96% of all relevant movements were identified with time savings of as much as 99.1% compared to reviewing target videos in full. The novelty of this contribution includes retrospective progress monitoring that preserves context through video, and content-based video retrieval that supports both fine-grained human actions and query-by-movement. Future research, including large clinician-led studies, will refine the technical aspects and explore the benefits in terms of patient outcomes, PT time, and financial savings over the course of a programme of therapy. It is anticipated that this clinician-led approach will mitigate the reported slow clinical uptake of technology with resulting patient benefit. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Han, J; Wang, YJ; Gong, ZH; Leus, G",Equalization of OSDM over time-varying channels based on diagonal-block-banded matrix enhancement,"Orthogonal signal-division multiplexing (OSDM) has recently emerged as a promising alternative to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for high-rate wireless communications. Although providing more flexibility in system design, it suffers from a special interference structure, namely intervector interference (IVI), when channel time variations are present. In this paper, we first derive the general OSDM signal model over time-varying channels, and then show that a time-domain window can be used to enhance the diagonal-block-banded (DBB) approximation of the channel matrix in a transformed domain. Furthermore, based on the DBB matrix enhancement, a low-complexity OSDM equalization algorithm is designed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed equalizer has significant performance advantages over that using the direct DBB approximation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Yet some inconsistencies with the theory of dynamic systems exist. The machine eigenvalues suggest the existence of two damped oscillators, physically not understandable. The respective eigenfrequencies change with the angular velocity of the reference frame. This contradicts the understanding that eigenfrequencies are inherent system properties. Physically, the dynamics depend on the continuous distribution of magnetic energy and its spatial displacement during transient processes. Information on the system dynamics is lost when dividing the continuum of magnetic energy into discrete portions. Complex state variables associate the dynamics to the propagation in space of distributed magnetic fields. The dynamic analysis reveals the existence single-complex eigenvalues. These define a novel class of system identifiers. They are characterized by having only one imaginary part instead of a conjugate complex pair. The use of complex state variables conveys insight and physical understanding of the dynamic processes within the machine.

It combines standard finite element method (FEM) and meshfree techniques based on the weaken-weak (W2) formulation. This project, for the first time, develops a preprocessor software package SFEM-Pre for creating types of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) S-FEM models following strictly the S-FEM theory. Because the software architecture of our 3D processor is the same as our 2D preprocessor, we will mainly introduce the 2D preprocessor in terms of software design for easier description, but the examples will include both 2D and 3D cases to fully demonstrate and validate the whole preprocessor of S-FEM. Our 2D preprocessor package is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy use, and with a connectivity database for efficient computation. Schemes are developed for not only automatically meshes the problem domains using our GUI, but also accepts various geometry files made available from some existing commercial software packages, such as ABAQUS (R) and HyperMesh (R). In order to improve the efficiency of our preprocessor, a parallel triangulation mesh generator has also been developed based on the advancing front technique (AFT) to create triangular meshes for complex geometry, and at the same time to create six types of connectivity needed for various S-FEM models. In addition, a database is implemented in our code to record all these connectivity to avoid duplicated calculation.

Finite-element analysis (FEA) was used to construct flexural strength-reduction curves for tub girders with various out-of-flatness magnitudes covering a range of girder cross sections and spans. Tub bottom flange slenderness ratios between 25 and 120 were modeled as covering the practical range. Models were built with coexisting out-of-flatness in both webs and flanges. The appropriate residual stress pattern was created using heat analysis. Models were laterally supported to ensure the local buckling limit state controls. Both 344.7-MPa (Grade 50 Steel) and 689.4-MPa (Grade 100 Steel) yield steel plates were considered with elastic-perfectly plastic material behavior. Large deflection theory was used to iteratively capture the secondary moments due to out-of-flatness. The current tolerance of D/150 out-of-flatness for the fascia web of an I-shaped plate girder was shown to implicitly accept a 20% strength reduction. Results showed that compressive flexural design formulas for tub girders in current standards conservatively reduce the strength to account for local buckling. Code adoption of b(f)/200 is recommended for the tub girder bottom flange out-of-flatness tolerance, where b(f) represents the bottom flange width.

J,"Besson, O; Vincent, F",Properties of the partial Cholesky factorization and application to reduced-rank adaptive beamforming,"Reduced-rank adaptive beamforming is a well established and efficient methodology, notably for disturbance covariance matrices which are the sum of a strong low-rank component (interference) and a scaled identity matrix (thermal noise). Eigenvalue or singular decomposition is often used to achieve rank reduction. In this paper, we study and analyze an alternative, namely a partial Cholesky factorization, as a means to retrieve interference subspace and to compute reduced-rank beamformers. First, we study the angles between the true subspace and that obtained from partial Cholesky factorization of the covariance matrix. Then, a statistical analysis is carried out in finite samples. Using properties of partitioned Wishart matrices, we provide a stochastic representation of the beamformer based on partial Cholesky factorization and of the corresponding signal to interference and noise ratio loss. We show that the latter follows approximately a beta distribution, similarly to the beamformer based on eigenvalue decomposition. Finally, numerical simulations are presented which indicate that a reduced-rank adaptive beam former based on partial Cholesky factorization incurs almost no loss, and can even perform better in some scenarios than its eigenvalue or singular value-based counterpart.

Firms use various forms of dynamic pricing, including personalized pricing, markdowns, promotions, coupons, discounts, and clearance sales, to respond to market fluctuations and demand uncertainty. In this paper, we study a temporary price increase policy, a form of dynamic pricing, for a non-perishable product, a practice used by several giant retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Apple. We develop a continuous review inventory model that allows for joint replenishment and pricing decisions, where the lead time is not zero. A replenishment decision controls supply, while a pricing decision controls demand. A manager exercises a temporary price increase to slow demand and avoid a stock-out situation while waiting for a shipment, which may not necessarily increase revenues, but decrease stock-out costs. The problem is to solve for the optimal replenishment and the pricing policy parameters that maximize the long-run expected profit. That is, when and how much to order and when to raise the price. In this paper, the inventory level and time trigger a price increase. We solve many numerical examples and perform extensive sensitivity analyses. Our results show that compared to a model that focuses on fixed pricing, our model brings an additional increase in profit of about 13%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The proposed models, also regarded as polytomous random item effects models, can take the uncertainty in explanation and/or the random nature of item parameters into account for polytomous items. To develop the models, the concepts and types of polytomous random item effects are investigated and then added into the existing polytomous item explanatory models.

An empirical example demonstrates practical implications and applications of the proposed models to the Verbal Aggression data. The empirical findings show that the proposed models with random item errors perform better than the existing models without random item errors in terms of the goodness-of-fit and reconstructing the step difficulties and also demonstrate methodological and practical differences of the proposed models in interpreting the item property effects in each of the item location explanatory Many-Facet Rasch Model and the step difficulty explanatory Linear Partial Credit Model approaches.

J,"Lee, J; Kim, DH",Analytic Pade-like approximations of exp(-sqrt(s)) for simulations of diffusion processes in the semi-infinite geometry,"Detailed transient behaviors of mass and heat transfer processes are required to solve partial differential equations. When those partial differential equations are coupled, they are still difficult to solve in time domain. For linear mass and heat transfer processes, their Laplace-domain solutions are obtainable and, when they are approximated by rational polynomials in the Laplace variable s, the problems can be transformed to a set of ordinary differential equations solved easily in time domain for various initial conditions. In this approximation, the conventional Pade method based on the Tayler series expansion of the Laplace-domain solutions has been well developed and effective. However, for some mass and heat transfer processes in the semi-infinite geometry, the Pade approximation is not applicable because the Laplace-domain solutions involving exp(-sqrt(s)) are not analytic at s = 0. Here, for such processes, analytical methods to approximate exp(-sqrt(s)) by rational polynomials are proposed. First it is expanded in series in terms of cosh(-1)(2(k)sqrt(s)) which converges fast. This series, when truncated, is analytic at s = 0 and its Pade approximations are available. The proposed method enables partial differential equations be replaced to a set of ordinary differential equations, reducing computations considerably for coupled partial differential equations.

Using the first-order Markov chain model and an extreme-value theory for randomly occurring events, this study investigates probabilistic properties of both extreme run lengths in a stationary hydrologic time series. The interaction between negative run length, positive run length, total run length, life span, and number of total runs was analyzed. As a result, a joint probabilistic space was defined for negative (or positive) and total run lengths, and a corrector was established for an existing cumulative distribution function (CDF) of negative run length. Lengths of incomplete runs were considered appropriately, especially when no total run occurred during the life span. A generalized CDF was formulated for each extreme value, and simplified versions of the generalized CDF were proposed as practical approximate methods, including expectation approximations and limiting approximations. Results of computational examples indicated that expectation approximations generally provided better results than limiting approximations for maximum negative run lengths, and the non-negligible probability of no total run occurring during the life span may have a significant influence on CDFs.",10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001869,20,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,

In this work, we reported a chemical approach to significantly reduce required crystallization time to 40-120 min by adding citric acid (CA) in synthesis gel. The time consumed with the proposed process is comparable with that by special heating intensification method while it is simpler, cheaper, and greener than latter. The ultrafast crystallization was attributed to the non-classical nucleation theory inspired by kinetic analysis, in which chelation interaction between CA and Al3+ favored metastable phase generation evidenced by XRD and Al-27 NMR. Other chelate agents (tartaric acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) with multi carbonic group also showed promising interaction.

In QDs, entangle photon pairs are generated through a cascaded emission process: biexciton to exciton to the ground state. The FSS of the excitonic states destroys the entanglement of the photon pairs; hence, it needs to be eliminated. For numerical investigation of FSS and design optimization, a multiscale-multiphysics many-body calculation is required. In this article, we report the coupling of a full configuration interaction (FCI) method with a 10-band ( $sp<^>{ {3}}$ $s<^>\ast $ -spin) tight-binding (TB) model to calculate the excitonic energetics of realistically sized InGaN/GaN dot-in-nanowire structures. Model benchmarking has been done against a recently reported InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) structure in the ${a}$ -plane orientation. Computational methodology of implementing a hexagonal-base truncated pyramid shaped QD has been presented. The effects of QD shape/thickness, material composition, and crystal growth direction (polar ${c}$ -plane and non-polar ${m}$ -plane and ${a}$ -plane) on the FSS of InGaN/GaN based photon emitters have been investigated. Polarization profiles of the emitted photons from the excitonic transitions have been derived quantum mechanically from transition dipole moments. With the smallest FSS, the non-polar ${m}$ -plane device has been found to be most promising for the QKD application.",10.1109/JQE.2019.2955938,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J,"Rueda, DR; Cotta, C; Fernández-Leiva, AJ",Memetic collaborative approaches for finding balanced incomplete block designs,"The balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) problem is a difficult combinatorial problem with a large number of symmetries, which add complexity to its resolution. In this paper, we propose a dual (integer) problem representation that serves as an alternative to the classical binary formulation of the problem. We attack this problem incrementally: firstly, we propose basic algorithms (i.e. local search techniques and genetic algorithms) intended to work separately on the two different search spaces (i.e. binary and integer); secondly, we propose two hybrid schemes: an integrative approach (i.e. a memetic algorithm) and a collaborative model in which the previous methods work in parallel, occasionally exchanging information. Three distinct two-dimensional structures are proposed as communication topology among the algorithms involved in the collaborative model, as well as a number of migration and acceptance criteria for sending and receiving data. An empirical analysis comparing a large number of instances of our schemes (with algorithms possibly working on different search spaces and with/without symmetry breaking methods) shows that some of these algorithms can be considered the state of the art of the metaheuristic methods applied to finding BIBDs. Moreover, our cooperative proposal is a general scheme from which distinct algorithmic variants can be instantiated to handle symmetrical optimisation problems. For this reason, we have also analysed its key parameters, thereby providing general guidelines for the design of efficient/robust cooperative algorithms devised from our proposal.

We aim to (1) extract the epileptic activities or sources generating the seizures, and (2) investigate the temporal changes of seizures. To achieve our goals, we describe the recorded seizures by a linear superposition of static and dynamic sources. The static sources are stable and have a fixed structure, while the dynamic sources can be intermittent, and may be with different locations. Retrieving the sources and their structures from the recorded seizures helps us to achieve the desired analysis. Experimental results show the existence of a static source and three specific dynamic sources during the recorded seizures. The dynamic sources randomly activate with the static source and one of them disappears towards the end of the seizures. Moreover, it is shown that the spatial locations of the sources are similar in different absence epileptic rats. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Consequentially, the internal moisture content distribution changes continuously, which induces bending of the board over time. With increasing asymmetry in the internal moisture content distribution, induced by an increasing difference in relative humidity over the board thickness, the board's curvature increases. In case the board is subjected to two different sinusoidal fluctuations in relative humidity on its opposite sides, the bending response is a superposition of two sinusoidal fluctuations. The influences of different fluctuation frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts on the macroscopic bending are theoretically predicted and experimentally explored. Moisture transport characteristics are derived from a frequency analysis of the macroscopic bending response, whereas the equilibrium bending configuration provides the linear hygroscopic expansion coefficient. Furthermore, the effect of hysteresis during sinusoidal relative humidity fluctuations is explored.

A particular application is oscillating gas jets, encountered in scientific and industrial studies dealing with mass transfer and flow control. Multiple methods, such as statistical moments (including mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis), proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and Hartigan's dip test are common post-processing methodologies. However, as demonstrated in this paper, they do not provide sufficient in-depth information from a statistical perspective to attribute probabilities to potential flow topologies. In this work, a novel approach to describe probability distributions based on extracted streamline patterns is proposed. Based on the available streamline patterns, the convolution with adaptive Gaussian kernels reveals the probability density function of the flow topology. The proposed methodology, as well as more traditional post-processing approaches, are assessed on the basis of synthetic flow fields and experimental PIV data of oscillating impinging gas jets, demonstrating the added value of the streamline probability map in characterising the scrutinised flow.

However, the broadband ambiguity surface for such signals exhibit high sidelobe levels that are undesirable in applications where the signal is subject to broadband Doppler. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the maximum sidelobe levels of such signals over a set of delay-Doppler values. This problem is non-convex and difficult to solve.

We further explore some heuristic methods to reduce computational and memory complexity of the solution, to enable us to design longer signals.

J,"Helmi, A; Vosoughi, Z",Quantum effect on adsorption of fluids in slit pores: A DFT study,"In this paper, the Wigner-Kirkwood quantum theory and the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) effective diameter method in Classical DFT are employed to account for the effects of quantum corrections on the Helmholtz free energy of bulk and confined fluids. Initially, experimental data are exploited toward accurate prediction of pressure-volume isotherms and vapor-liquid equilibrium in bulk fluids. In the second part, the effects of quantum correction on the structure and thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in slit pores are investigated. Our results show that quantum effects may come into account by considering the effective size of the particles and also intermolecular interaction which both of them have direct effects on the density distribution of molecules in the slit pore. Furthermore, the excess adsorption of fluids at a fixed bulk density is shown to increase with quantum effect, but this trend is reversed with increasing wall fluid interaction because of the entropy and energy effects. Also, it is found that the excess adsorption and interfacial tension of the fluid against the solid surface of fluids exhibit oscillatory behaviors with maximum and minimum values for half integer and integer values of pore width. This oscillatory behavior disappears at high values of pore width with increasing quantum effect. Another finding of the present study indicates that the interfacial tensions of the fluid against the solid surface for a classical fluid are negative but quantum effect increases it and shifts its sign to positive. Finally, it is shown that the locus of phase transition is shifted toward higher bulk densities as a result of increasing quantum effect. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Antibiotic compounds are one of the main pollutants found in the aquatic systems, because they are often inadequately prescribed and as a part of antibiotics is not completely consumed or degraded in human and animal bodies. Their residues can be entered in aquatic systems by wastewater treatment plants.

J,"Jin, SK; Jin, JL; Gong, YF",Pressure-induced dipole theory and pressure pulsation in shallow urban road tunnels with top vents,"Shallow urban road tunnels with top vents represent environmentally friendly and energy-saving technology. To date, four such tunnels are operational in Nanjing, and their intra-tunnel air quality has been widely acclaimed. However, no prescriptive design methods have been developed for this technology. Natural ventilation at the top of the tunnels is caused by the pressure difference inside and outside the top vents. Thus, a prerequisite to the development of scientific design methods for such tunnels is a complete understanding and representation of the pressure wave distribution pattern in the tunnels. Based on an analogy with an electric dipole, we propose a pressure-induced dipole theory and construct an intra-tunnel pressure distribution model. An experimental platform is developed to evaluate the pressure distribution inside tunnels under 6 operational conditions. The results suggest the following. (1) The proposed pressure-induced dipole theory can well describe and explain the pressure wave distribution rules in road tunnels. (2) With a uniform and continuous traffic flow, the real-time pressure on each point in the tunnels demonstrates periodical asymmetrical quasi-sinusoidal pulsation, where the cycle is given as T = (S + L)/v.

J,"Kaya, ZE; Yilmaz, A",Modeling and simulation of an anthropomorphic hand prosthesis with an object interaction,"Background and Objective: Kinematic and dynamic modeling of any physical process is critical especially for the design phase of associated control units and the prediction of their performance levels. In this paper, a dynamical model and a development frame including interactions with the objects for a tendon-driven underactuated hand are developed and examined. Using the proposed dynamic model, free movement and the object interaction of the underactuated hand can be simulated with a single, integrated simulation step in the simulation frame. Methods: Lagrangian Method is used to model the dynamic behavior of the underactuated fingers and the thumb under tendon dependency in a 3D coordinate system. Then, as an important extension to the modeling studies that can be found in the literature, the interaction of the hand with an object that co-exists in its workspace is modeled in terms of contact forces acting on the joints of the fingers. The unified dynamic model is simulated by using the Simulink platform. Results: The simulations showed that the adaptability of the underactuated mechanism and joint torque levels are modeled and examined realistically. The flexion movement of the fingers resulted in realistic torque levels which can be handled by commercially-off-the-shelf actuators. Various tendon forces were examined in terms of the distance of the individual phalanx to the object and their contact instants. Applying an increasing input force with 1.617 N/s ramp slope, finger flexion movement was obtained in 1s. In another simulation scenario, compliance of the underactuated mechanism to an object was examined. With 0.66 N/s tendon force input ramp, proximal, middle and distal phalanx contacted an object in 1.3 s, 2.35 s and 2.75 s, respectively. Conclusions: Presented features obtained by the simulation platform are especially useful to researchers working on the development of control methods for underactuated prosthetic hands and robot manipulators. Through the simulations of experimental scenarios, a detailed analysis of dynamic responses of each finger phalanges can be carried out properly in any level of the design phase.

Using the symmetry and the periodicity of the structures, their rigidity is a problem of long-standing interest in kinematics, statics, and optimization. We considered the skeletal of a wide class of 3-dimensional tiling with the special assumption that the original polygonal faces are allowed to deform in a way that faces remaining central symmetrical and not necessarily planar. Some vectors that represent the parallel edges with the bracing elements as auxiliary framework characterize the mobility of this framework. A new theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the rigidity of the tiling framework applying face diagonals as bracing elements. This result implies an efficient algorithm for the rigidity of the braced tiling structure. Based on simple elements, we construct new mechanisms which move as the skeleton tiling structure with the planar and the central symmetrical assumption.

It was constructed with several composite-varactor branches in parallel, each of which consists of p-type (P+/Pwell) and n-type (N+/Nwell) accumulation-mode varactors in a cascode configuration. The optimum ratio of the channel width between p-type and n-type accumulation-mode varactors was investigated through the simulation in order to maximize a quality factor (Q-factor) of the tunable capacitor at the maximum capacitance (C-MAX) state. The number of composite-varactor unit in each branch was designed to be binary-weighted, and the total capacitance can vary linearly by digitally turning on and off both varactors. It was firstly implemented in 65-nm bulk CMOS process, and showed comparable tuning range, Q-factor, and harmonic distortion performances while reducing the silicon area by half and eliminating the MIM capacitor in comparison with the conventional SCA. In the measurement, the proposed tunable capacitor showed a Q-factor of 60.3 at C-MAX state and a tuning range of 2.8 at 2 GHz frequency band. In addition, it was perfectly capable of handling a high power signal up to 0 dBm with excellent second and third-order harmonic distortion of greater than 70 dBc at the minimum capacitance (C-MIN) state and 77 dBc at C-MAX state.",10.1016/j.sse.2019.107697,83,yes,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,

Meanwhile, redundant via insertion is considered as an essential step for yield improvement. For better reliability and manufacturability, in this paper, we first concurrently consider DSA guiding template cost assignment with multiple redundant via and dummy via insertion. Firstly, by analyzing the structure property of guiding templates, we propose a building-block based solution expression to discard redundant solutions. Then, honoring the compact solution expression, we construct a conflict graph with dummy via insertion, and then formulate the problem to an integer linear programming (ILP). In addition, to optimize the guiding template cost, we incorporate it into the objective of ILP by introducing vertex weight and edge weight in conflict graph. To make a good trade-off between solution quality and runtime, we relax the ILP to an unconstrained nonlinear programming (UNP). Finally, a line search optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the UNP. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our new solution expression and the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

Spatio-temporal decorrelation is a useful preprocessing technique that can reduce the blind separation problem into a simpler orthogonal matrix estimation problem. However, it is computationally expensive for its large unknown parameter set. Realtime spatio-temporal decorrelation method remains an open issue for years. In this paper, we focus on accelerating the adaptation process in the FIR filter based decorrelation method. Firstly, the update equation is decoupled into spatial decorrelation and temporal decorrelation. Then, their respective convergence conditions are systematically analyzed using eigenvalue decomposing method. Based on it, a fast algorithm for FIR filter network with spatio-temporal decoupled adaptive step-sizes is proposed. Comprehensive simulations are performed on both synthetic data and real world captured sEMG data. We have compared the proposed algorithm with the fixed step size method, IIR filter with natural gradient, and the annealed step size method. The factors including number of iteration, number of channel, computational time, selection of filter order and window size are elaborately compared and discussed. The results verified the reliable performance of our method on accelerating the adaptation process for spatio-temporal decorrelation simultaneously compared to classical methods.

J,"Nafia, N; El Kari, A; Ayyad, H; Mjahed, M",Design of a Robust Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Adaptive Super Twisting Control for a Given Class of Disturbed MIMO Nonlinear Systems,"This study deals with the tracking control problem of a large class of multi input multi output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics and subject to unknown disturbances. First, two interval type-2 adaptive fuzzy systems (IT2-AFSs) are constructed to efficiently estimate the unknown nonlinear dynamics. Then, based on IT2-AFSs and super-twisting algorithm (STA), a new robust adaptive fuzzy-reaching STC law (AF-RSTCL) has been added to the global control law to improve the robustness of the studied systems in the presence of approximation errors and unknown disturbances. In order to avoid the chattering phenomenon and guarantee simultaneously the best tracking performance, the gains of the designed AF-RSTCL are optimally online estimated. The adaptive parameters of the global synthesized control law are deduced from the stability analysis in the sense of Lyapunov. Finally, an example of simulation is used to confirm the effectiveness of the developed method in achieving the predetermined objectives of the tracking control.",10.5937/fmet2001063N,91,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,,,,
J,"Neuvéglise, S; Perret, G; Smaoui, H; Marin, F; Sergent, P",Impact of a Quayside Floating System on Overtopping,"This paper reports results of the impact of a quayside floating system on overtopping. The approach is experimental and analytical. Rectangular floaters in heave motion were considered at various distances from a vertical wall. Floaters with different widths and heights were tested. The effect of the draft and the floater's distance to the wall on overtopping quantification was considered in intermediate water conditions. First, overtopping evolution as a function of the wave period was found to be correlated with the floater behavior. The overtopping increased at the resonance period of the floater but decreased at larger periods. The experimental results were then compared with a linear analytical model based on potential flow theory, where the wave height at the seawall was given using the Van der Meer formula. An improvement of the analytical model was obtained by introducing a term corresponding to pressure losses between the floater and seawall. The experimental results are in good agreement with the corrected analytical model: the evolution is similar, with an averaged standard deviation of 1.2 for large wavelengths. The present results show that the wave period and distance of the floater to the vertical wall are significant parameters for overtopping. Overtopping is reduced by the presence of the quayside floater for small distances to the vertical wall and large wave periods when the floater follows waves.",10.1061/(ASCE)WW.1943-5460.0000532,92,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,
J,"Nezhad, MK; Mirshamsi, D; Zarif, FA; Rezaeiun, HRM",Effect of loss on transverse localization of light in 1D optical waveguide array in the presence of Kerr-type nonlinearity,"In this paper we have comprehensive study on the interplay among radiation loss, transverse disorder (diagonal and off-diagonal) and Kerr-type nonlinearity on the light propagation in 1D array of optical waveguides. Our numerical results demonstrate the presence of three distinguished regimes of transverse light expansion at different propagation distances. At short propagation distance, the Kerr-type nonlinearity are dominated and results in the transverse localization of light through the self-trapping mechanism. Radiation loss, causes the light escape from the injected guides, affect the light expansion in middle distance via broadening the light beam width. At longer distance the disorder terms led to the transverse localization of light, again. Also, we compared the propagation of light in edge and middle modes in the presence of the above effects. Our results show that the propagation distance of first localized regime for edge modes is larger than the middle modes since the edge modes can exchange energy with one of the left or right waveguides, while for middle modes there are two ways for energy exchange. Therefore the discrete diffraction can be diminished the nonlinear effects in middle modes faster than the edge modes.",10.1007/s11082-019-2110-7,93,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,
S,"Nowakowski, P",Reconfigurable Recycling Systems of E-waste,"E-waste collected from households must be properly processed in recycling plants to acquire high-purity output materials and hazardous substances removed. It requires a systematic approach to the disassembly process and wastes classification and categorization. Big variety of shapes and materials used in the equipment need processing lines including manual and automated sections. The main purpose of the machines used on the processing lines is to shred equipment into small size fraction and then separate each material depending on the physical properties. In such case, the output material from the E-waste disassembling plants can be recycled and used in new parts or components. This chapter includes a description of methods of disassembly focused on E-waste recycling in compliance with environmental standards. The required steps of the end-of-life products disassembly vary depending on the category of waste equipment. To show these differences, the chapter includes two case studies showing the configuration of a layout of E-waste processing lines with possible options to reconfigure them. The variants of the system's configuration depend on the volume of the waste stream, labor cost, and required purity of output materials. Economic efficiency indicator of E-waste processing indicates big differences in potential profit from recycling E-waste mainly depending on labor cost. Example of calculation of this indicator has been presented in this chapter on cooling appliances recycling for four European countries.",10.1007/978-3-030-14184-4_2,94,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,

Such mathematical modeling is done in two ways: engineering and statistical approaches as shown in Fig. 2.1. Ensemble models can also be formulated by integrating both engineering and statistical models. The different operational parameters can be, bacterial growth rate, reaction rate, pH value, temperature, substrate concentration of the influent etc. while the design parameters are the surface area, sizes and materials (of electrodes), size of biofilm, electron donor variants, external resistance, membrane variants etc. MFCs are categorized into different types on the basis of chamber model, variants of microorganism cultures, substrate supply modes, and ion and electron transfer [4]. The various formulations of MFCs are shown in Fig. 2.2 for the ease of readers.",10.1007/978-3-030-18068-3_2,99,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,
