Fabrication of Nanosticks-Like CdS Sensitizer for the Application of Solar Cells	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												The novelty of this work is to fabricate the Nanosticks (NSs) like CdS sensitizer on the surface of TiO2 electrode by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method with a very high vacuum annealed at 350 degrees C for 30 min. Whereas, nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes have been prepared on FTO (SnO2: F) glass by a spin-coating method with high purity (99.99%, Degussa P25) TiO2 powder. The surface of the CdS layer has been covered by NSs like structures which are confirmed by the scanning electron microscope image. The 100 nm of platinum-coated FTO substrate and polysulfide-based electrolyte are used to assemble the Gratzel Solar cell (GSC). The performance of solar cell (SC) based on NSs like CdS has been compared with the nanoparticles (NPs) based CdS sensitized SC, where CdS NPs has synthesized by CBD without any post-annealing. The efficiency of NSs like CdS sensitized SC exhibits 2.44%, which is 2 folds of the efficiency of the CdS NPs sensitized SC. The NSs like CdS sensitized SC shows the highest photocurrent 20.24 mA/cm(2) compared to CdS NPs based SC.

J	Li, KD				Li, Kun-Dar			The Influence of Process Parameters on the Morphological Characteristics by Directional Etching for Materials Nanoarchitectonics	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												In nanoarchitectonics, the advanced technology of directional etching is highly demanded for the fabrication of modern electronic device with high anisotropy ratio of structures. To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle. The featured surface morphologies, including the pyramid, ripple, mounds and etch pits, are reproduced numerically, and these simulation results correspond well with the observations of directional etching experiments. This study provides the fundamental knowledge and detailed information for the advanced application of the directional etching technology.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				MAY	2020	20	5					3060	3070		10.1166/jnn.2020.17429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17429								31635649					WOS:000492366900051

Investigation of Swift Heavy Ion Irradiated Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO)/Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) Nanocomposite Using Raman Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												In this work, a few layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite have been synthesized by liquid exfoliation method. The morphological and structural properties are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. The optical properties are also investigated using absorption and Raman spectroscopy. This report presents quantification of swift heavy ion irradiation induced defects using Raman spectroscopy. We found both Raman mode E-2g(1) and A(1g) corresponding to MoS2 and Raman modes of rGO are strongly affected by increasing ions doses. The defect induced lattice strain in the rGO/MoS2 nanocomposite is also estimated from Raman spectroscopy. MoS2 layers are found to be much more sensitive than rGO in the rGO/MoS2 nanocomposite.

Fabrication of Al-TiO<sub>2</sub> Thin Film Electrode by Spray Pyrolysis Technique for Urea Sensing	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												A simple cost effective Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was fabricated for urea sensing. Urea is the key end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans. Increased level of urea leads to loss of kidney function. Thus determination of urea is important in analysis of kidney diseases. Al-TiO2 thin films were deposited with different concentration of Al by Spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the anatase phase of the Al-TiO2 thin films with tetragonal structure. A shift is observed in the XRD peak position compared to as prepared TiO2 thin film indicates the incorporation of Al ions into Ti ions. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study shows that the absorption increases and the absorption peak shifts towards the visible region for Al-TiO2 thin films compared with that of the as prepared TiO2 thin film. The optical band gap values changes with the change in the Al concentration in TiO2 thin films. The electrochemical analysis for optimized Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. CV studies of Al-TiO2 thin film electrode show the good stability and linearity which is essential to fabricate biosensor. The sensor response to urea is linear with correlation coefficient of 0.944 and the sensitivity is 3.17 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2).																			1533-4880	1533-4899				MAY	2020	20	5					2887	2892		10.1166/jnn.2020.17447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17447								31635625					WOS:000492366900027

A series of the materials such as mesostructured aluminum organophosphonate (AOP) and AlPO type ones were investigated according to the molecular structure and crystallinity of inorganic-organic hybrid and non-hybrid inorganic frameworks. Considering a uniqueness of AlPO based frameworks, a rational insight on strength of interactions between crystalline/amorphous AlPO based units and cationic surfactant molecules was surveyed as one of the most significant factors for understanding the mesostructural variation.

In the first step, synthesis of PPy was carried out by chemical oxidative route. In the second step, the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The as-synthesized PPy-ZnO nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) and Ultra violet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy to reveal the phase, morphology, chemical and optical properties. The physical and chemical characterizations confirmed presence of both PPy and ZnO phases in the nanocomposite. In the present work, antimicrobial activity of the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite against human pathogen Y. lipolytica has been investigated. Attempts have been made to reveal the influence of PPy percentage on the antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, all PPy-ZnO nanocomposites, irrespective of PPy percentage showed 90 to 95% inhibited growth of Yarrowia lipolytica. The results obtained herein imply the potential of PPy-ZnO biofilm in inhibiting the growth of Y. lipolytica and thus preventing infections caused due to Y. lipolytica in humans.

The mechanical reliabilities of Sn58Bi and epoxy Sn58Bi solder were evaluated by the board-level drop test and the 3-point bend test after temperature-humidity storage testing. The microstructure and chemical composition of the solder joints were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The addition of epoxy in solder paste did not affect the morphology of the intermetallic compound. The thickness of the scalloped-shaped Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound of solder/OSP joint increased with aging time. The drop number until fail for the epoxy Sn58Bi/OSP joint was higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint; the average numbers of drops withstood by the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint and epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint following the reflow process were fewer than 10 drops and 180 drops, respectively. The drop number of solder/OSP joints decreased with increasing aging time. The result of the 3-point bend tests shows that the number of bend cycles for the epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint was 30 times higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint. The number of bend cycles for solder/OSP joints was decreased with increasing aging time.					kim, nayoung/IWV-4038-2023														1947-2935	1947-2943				APR	2020	12	4					525	530		10.1166/sam.2020.3660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/sam.2020.3660													WOS:000495065200011

Scintillator-decoupled detectors with different contents (1, 3, 5 and 7 wt%) of Ag NPs were fabricated and tested using a solar simulator. Compared with the detector having pristine P3HT:PC70BM layer, the detector with 3 wt% Ag NPs blended in the P3HT:PC70BM layer showed 26% higher PCE and 19% higher J(sc). CsI(Tl) scintillator-coupled detectors were then tested under irradiation of X-ray source. The detector with 3 wt% Ag NPs-blended P3HT:PC70BM layer showed the highest CCD of 350.51 nA/cm(2) and the highest sensitivity of 2.20 mA/Gy.cm(2).

Around 130 t of NbTi strands were supplied and used for the PF conductors. During the package execution process, the Chinese Domestic Agency (CNDA) has organized the verification for the NbTi strand acceptance tests based on the requirements of the ITER procurement arrangement (PA). The verification tasks for NbTi strands were undertaken by the Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP). In total, about 550 billets of NbTi strands have been verified and supplied for the PF conductors. The verification levels fit the ITER PA requirements. The test results showed that the quality of the NbTi strands has been well controlled. In addition, in order to supply essential data for the conductor performance prediction and analysis, a full critical current I-c characterization of the NbTi strands, which requires a measurement of I-c versus field, B and temperature, T, has been obtained using the test facilities from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and ASIPP.

The hydrophobic surfaces covered with square pillar structures in the hexagonal array were prepared and the repulsive normal load and friction coefficient of the droplet were characterized. The force measurements in the vertical and lateral directions on the droplet confined between the prepared hydrophobic surfaces revealed that the compressive resistance to the vertical motion which is identical with the repulsive capillary force increases with deformation when the deformed droplet is horizontally symmetric. On the other hand, the friction coefficient of the squeezed droplet is inversely proportional to the repulsive capillary force. It was found that the reduced pressure acting on the solid-liquid interface results in the abnormal reduction in friction coefficient. In addition, the critical hydraulic pressure analysis confirmed that the partially wetted Cassie-Baxter (CB) state is maintained during sliding motion.																			1947-2935	1947-2943				APR	2020	12	4					589	593		10.1166/sam.2020.3671	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/sam.2020.3671													WOS:000495065200021

Using the principle of evaporation-induced assembly in contact free dispersion droplets, we have synthesized porous micrometric HAp granules consist of interlocked ellipsoidal nanoparticles. We have shown that the shape of the microgranules can be tuned from spherical to doughnut solely by controlling the drying temperature during assembly. The structure and interparticle correlation in the synthesized granules have been probed by electron microscopy and small-angle scattering. The observed morphological transition has been attributed to the buckling of elastic shell made of interlocked HAp nanoparticles. Alteration of granular morphology at higher drying rate does not affect the local packing fraction of the correlated HAp nanoparticles in the granules. The absorption of bovine serum albumin protein by the synthesized granules has been tested as a potential application.

These batteries are expected to have extensive applications in fields requiring high-energy density. However, such applications are hindered by some serious intrinsic obstacles. Herein, TiO2 nanosheets-rGO/sulphur (TiO2 NS-rGO/S) composites were fabricated through a two-process hydrothermal method. TiO2 nanosheets served as active sites for polysulphide absorption, whereas rGO offered space for sulphur improvement and TiO2 NS-rGO/S composites. The TiO2 NS-rGO/S composite exhibited high discharge capacity of 1099 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2 C rate and retained a capacity of 690 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles, with high sulphur loading of 3 mg.cm(-2). The high initial specific discharge capacity and improved cyclic stability were attributed to the synergistic effects of TiO2 nanosheets and rGO. These results indicated that the simple, low-cost and scalable method provides a novel perspective on practical utilisation of lithium-sulphur batteries.					xie, keyu/F-8076-2012; JIANG, Feng/HTP-2862-2023; Li, Qingyu/AGT-0982-2022; zhang, kun/HPB-5142-2023	Li, Qingyu/0000-0003-4638-4401													1533-4880	1533-4899				MAR	2020	20	3					1715	1722		10.1166/jnn.2020.16957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.16957								31492335					WOS:000484782900045

In this paper, the MgFe-LDH with Mg/Fe molar ratio of 3.0 was prepared by urea method and the calcined products are obtained by calcining at different temperatures (473 K, 573 K, 673 K, 773 K, 873 K and 973 K) under a N-2 atmosphere for 4 h. The structure, morphology, texture, pyrolysis kinetics and mechanism of the MgFe-LDH were studied in detail.

The results suggested that the thermal decomposition of the LDH experienced two steps, i.e., removal of the interlayer water, followed by dehydroxylation and decarbonation. Moreover the Makel method was used to define the most probable reaction mechanisms of the pyrolysis behavior.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				MAR	2020	20	3					1822	1831		10.1166/jnn.2020.16958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.16958								31492348					WOS:000484782900058

The influence of crosslinkers and magnetic particle distribution along the filament backbone on the magnetic properties of supracolloidal linear polymer-like chains	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												Diverse polymer crosslinking techniques allow the synthesis of linear polymer-like structures whose monomers are colloidal particles. In the case where all or part of these colloidal particles are magnetic, one can control the behaviour of these supracolloidal polymers, known as magnetic filaments (MFs), by applied magnetic fields. However, the response of MFs strongly depends on the crosslinking procedure. In the present study, we employ Langevin dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of the type of crosslinking and the distribution of magnetic particles within MFs on their response to an external magnetic field. We found that if the rotation of the dipole moment of particles is not coupled to the backbone of the filament, the impact of the magnetic content is strongly decreased.

For the same peak-indentation load, increasing the holding time and/or decreasing the indentation-loading rate cause the increase of the indentation depth. There exists the "bulge" of the unloading curve at the onset of the unloading for small indentation-loading rates. The Vickers hardness is a monotonically increasing function of the indentation-loading rate for the same peak-indentation load. For the indentations with the same loading and unloading time of 30 s and without an intermediate stage at the peak-indentation load, the Vickers hardness of the Cu47.5Zr19Hf28.5Al5 bulk-metallic glass-matrix composite decreases with the increase of the indentation load. The strain energy dissipated through plastic deformation during the indentation is a power-law function of the indentation load with a power index of 3/2, and the energy ratio (total energy/plastic energy) linearly increases with the depth ratio (residual indentation depth/maximum indentation depth).																			1533-4880	1533-4899				MAR	2020	20	3					1530	1539		10.1166/jnn.2020.16954	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.16954								31492316					WOS:000484782900026

These interesting evolutions and dynamical properties are compared and discussed. We conjecture that the manifestation of anomalous electronic transport properties and Mooij correlations near the MIT or superconductor-insulator transition in systems with non-negligible electron-lattice coupling effects may be linked to the coexistence of competing polaronic phases and the dynamical intertwining of the deformable lattice and the random electronic potential.

In this work, we study at a fundamental level the effects of the reduction of spatial dimensionality on this phenomenon. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of a metallic glass-formers in two dimensions (2D). We show that in the supercooled regime particle localization in the cage and structural relaxation are blurred by long-wavelength fluctuations specific to low-dimensional systems.

J	Chen, SH; Huang, TW				Chen, Son-Hsien; Huang, Tsung-Wei			Spin-orbit torques from intrinsic spin-orbit couplings in a periodically buckled honeycomb lattice	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												In this paper, we study the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) originated from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of intrinsic type in a periodically buckled honeycomb nanoribbon such as silicene. Using the Green function formalism with density matrix expressions, we analyze the SOT contributions from the Fermi-level and -sea electrons. We find that the intrinsic-SOC-induced inverse spin galvanic effect generates spin accumulations perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The anti-damping torque results purely from the Fermi-level contribution, while the field-like torque from both the Fermi-level and -sea contributions. At zero bias voltage, the SOT is symmetric with respect to the Fermi energy (i.e., an even function of the Fermi energy), whereas the presence of bias further introduces the anti-symmetric torque components. When the ferromagnet magnetization lies in the honeycomb plane, all Fermi-sea contributions disappear. The maximum SOT among different Fermi energies is also inspected. For large enough in-plane magnetization compared to the staggered potential, the field-like torque has a maximum at zero Fermi energy. When the magnetization is smaller than some value characterized by the intrinsic SOC, the maximum of the anti-damping torque occurs at the cross point of the two Dirac linear bands in the leads. More importantly, we find that the anti-damping torques responsible for magnetic switching as well as the torkance require staggered potential from an applied out-of-plane electric field, i.e., lattice buckling is essential to the switching. When the electric field is reversed, the anti-damping torque and the torkance are also reversed. Accordingly, full electric control of the SOTs can be realized in this buckled system.																			0304-8853	1873-4766				FEB 15	2020	496								165914	10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165914	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165914													WOS:000491941800012

However, the origin of phonon anomaly has remained ambiguous (i.e. longitudinal acoustic or transverse acoustic modes). We performed first-principles calculations to investigate the phononic properties of these materials and theoretically confirmed that the Kohn anomaly originates from the lower transverse acoustic mode along the ?X direction, thereby revealing the frequency derivative discontinuity of the mode. In particular, the Kohn anomaly region is found to move from the interior to the boundary X point of the Brillouin zone with increasing number of valence electrons. We deduced that the Kohn anomaly originated from the electrons of the filled energy level near the van Hove singularity. These results suggest that the screening of the ionic electric field decreases, while the coupling of conduction electrons with the highly degenerate modes between the TA and LA via Umklapp scattering process increases. The Fermi surface nesting also plays a role in enhancing the superconductivity. The electronic excitation effect induces a stabilization of the V-2 group transition metal nitrides.

This type of special cement is mixed with PVA as polymer additive material so it can have a higher strength and sufficient elasticity per unit weight. Also, boric acid which can absorb neutrons having poisonous effect in nuclear reactions is added into the cement in order to minimize environmental disaster caused by a nuclear accident. Compressive and bending strengths were measured based on TSE tests of graphene doped PVA and boron-based cement paste. Then, samples were measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Method (BET) and subjected to X-ray Diffraction (XRD). In XRD measurements, crystalline structure was observed in all materials. According to compressive strength tests, as the graphene amount increases compressive strength also increases, however in bending strength tests as the graphene amount increases bending strength decreases. Although the values of bending strength of samples produced decreased with increase of graphene content, these values were found to be above the standard values. In addition to boron, graphene admixture has a significant effect on material with its positive strength properties.

However, as compared with bilayer heterostructures, it is very challenging in experiments to prepare single crystal epitaxial ultrathin superlattices consisting of ferromagnetic metal and antiferromagnetic insulator, where the interface exchange coupling, magnetic order, and electrical transport properties are expected to be greatly modulated due to the multiple interfaces and periodical structures. Here we prepared single crystal epitaxial [Co/CoO](n) superlattices consisting of ferromagnetic metal Co and antiferromagnetic insulator CoO by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that the saturation magnetization of [Co 0.6 nm/CoO 1.2 nm](5) superlattice is robust against temperature increase, which only shows a slight decrease of 1.5% from 5 K to 300 K. Moreover, we found that the longitudinal resistivity and anomalous Hall resistivity of [Co/CoO](n) superlattices are strongly modulated by the short-period Co/CoO heterostructure, which are quite distinguished from the electrical transport properties of Co bulk ferromagnetic metal. The [Co/CoO](n) superlattices provide a new insight into heterostructures consisting of ferromagnetic metal and antiferromagnetic insulator, which are beneficial for designing future spintronics devices.

Specifically, one of the walls is a diffuse reflection boundary, and the other wall is a Maxwell-type boundary whose accommodation coefficient has a periodic distribution in the direction perpendicular to the flow. The behavior of the gas is studied on the basis of the linearized Bhatnagar?Gross?Krook?Welander model of the Boltzmann equation. The extended integral equation for the macroscopic flow velocity is derived for the analysis at large Knudsen numbers, and is numerically solved. Features in the dependence of the mass flow rate on the distribution of the accommodation coefficient observed in the previous study (Doi 2015 ASME J. Fluids. Eng. 137 101103) were found to hold over a quite wide range of the Knudsen number up to 1000. A successive approximation method of the solution for a large Knudsen number is numerically tested using the integral equation.																			0169-5983	1873-7005				FEB	2020	52	1							015502	10.1088/1873-7005/ab523b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1873-7005/ab523b													WOS:000499351400001

J	Giraldo, JC; Peña, NM; Ney, MM				Giraldo, Juan-Carlos; Pena, Nestor M.; Ney, Michel M.			Encoding the electrodynamics in spatiotemporal boundaries	COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS												Maxwell's equations represented by differential operators describe the local dependence between both electric and magnetic fields in every location of space and time. This description responds to the field concept proposed by Michael Faraday and formalized by James Clerk Maxwell. The discretized version in the form of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique relies on a proposal of local computation of the respective differential operators making use of the central difference approximation of the second derivative of functions through the Taylor series expansion. This article introduces a novel time -symmetric "non -local" technique from the mathematical formalism of electromagnetic potentials in the wave equation and its physical interpretation in the Minkowski spacetime. In the proposed case study, the "non-local" proposal is 1643 faster than FDTD, i.e.,more than three orders of magnitude, and it uses a time-step that is 4096 times greater than the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy limit without encountering stability problems. New electromagnetic potentials are calculated from the previous and distant ones located at vertices of spatiotemporal regions called causal diamonds that tessellates spacetime without the need for computations inside them. We show that the performance gain is proportional to the size of the spacetime tessellations because the ratio "domain to boundary" increases as the domain extension does. Consequently, our novel "non -local" approach provides a reduction in computational complexity and a more comprehensible explanation of their fundamental physical aspects, without contradicting the principles of the successful classical field theory. Program summary Program Title: SOME_models Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/7sgh6grm7g.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: C Nature of problem: The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition imposes a numerical bound to the size of the Yee cell in the FDTD approach. This restriction causes excessive oversampling, degrading the computation time of this technique. Solution method: We applied the parallelogram rule to solve the wave equation for the case of (1 + 1) time-space dimensions. With this rule, we proposed a novel algorithm that allows encoding potentials along the characteristic lines that tessellate the spacetime. The new technique produces higher performance gains than those achieved through traditional FDTD. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The as-prepared magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles calcined at 400 degrees C for 2 h with absolute alcohol of 30 mL were characterized with the average nanoparticle size of around 30 nm and the specific magnetization (Ms) of 14.7 emu/g. The adsorption characteristics of reactive blue (RB) from aqueous solutions onto Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles were investigated by UV spectroscopy at room temperature; the adsorption kinetics data were in good agreement with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model in the initial RB concentrations of 100-400 mg/L. Compared with Langrnuir and Freundlich models, the Temkin model (correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.9998) could be used to evaluate the adsorption isotherm of RB onto the magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles at room temperature, which revealed that the adsorption of RB onto the magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles was a hybrid of monolayer and multilayer adsorbing mechanism.					he, dawei/GZK-8280-2022														1533-4880	1533-4899				FEB	2020	20	2					957	964		10.1166/jnn.2020.16932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.16932								31383092					WOS:000484777500033

Two kinds of doping scenarios are considered, namely dopants into pristine graphene and vacancy graphene. It is observed that the doping energy is negative for dopant (N, P, S) into vacancy graphene at pyridinictype site, yet it is positive at graphitic-type site for pristine graphene. It could be inferred that the introducing process is exothermic reaction for defective graphene. Meanwhile, for the adsorption of C2H2 on the surface of defective graphene, we notice that C2H2 would prefer to be adsorbed at the top site of the doping atom and the adsorption energy increases with the introducing of dopants, indicating that the dopant would enhance the interaction between C2H2 and graphene. Regarding hydrogen molecule, the dopant has less promotion effect on the adsorption. Moreover, the graphene plays a role of electron donor while the gas molecule (C2H2/H-2) is the electron acceptor when it is adsorbed. For the co-adsorption, the C2H2 is privileged to interact with the graphene and the pre-adsorbed C2H2 on doped graphene would weaken the opportunity of the uptake of H-2 molecule. We anticipate that our results would provide information to design the optimized catalysts.

The characteristics of D:Si(110)-(1 x 1) are unique compared to those of H:Si(110)-(1 x 1) (Matsushita et al., 2015) in terms of the resolved vibrational modes. By the HREELS, one-dimensional surface phonons consisting of D-Si stretching vibrations are observed above the bulk-phonon band energy edge of 64.5 meV. Ten modes are observed below this value, classified as surface, surface resonant, and bulk phonons according to the calculated energy dispersion as well as the depth profile of spectral density and displacement vectors. In particular, five D Si bending modes are observed out of the seven theoretically predicted modes. The bending modes are strongly coupled with the displacements across the D and five Si layers. The DFT-LDA surface phonon dispersion is in good agreement with the experimental results except a few frequency/dispersion mismatches, as the structure optimized by DFT-LDA mismatches with the previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results (Matsushita et al., 2015). D:Si(110)-(1 x 1) elucidates the nature of covalently bonded phonons and their characteristics both experimentally and theoretically.

The degeneracy can be avoided by adding an artificial quantity of another material into the pure phase. However, nonphysical waves are introduced by the artificial treatment. In this paper, an improved pressure-equilibrium diffuse interface model, which is able to treat zero/unity volume fractions, is presented for solid-fluid interaction. In the proposed model, the phasic density equations are replaced by the algebraic relation between phasic densities and inverse deformation gradient tensors. In consequence, the volume fractions and the phasic densities do not appear explicitly in the conservative equations any more. The degeneracy introduced by zero/unity volume fractions are prevented. A flux-splitting based finite difference algorithm suitable for this formulation is then presented. A series of one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed model can present more accurate results near material interfaces.

According to hydration heat, hydration products, microstructure and porosity of GNPs cementitious matrix materials, the microcosmic mechanism for autogenous shrinkage was also investigated. It was testified that moderate addition of GNPs decreased the autogenous shrinkage of cement-based composites. Moreover, the autogenous shrinkage value was minimal after treatment with 0.10 wt% GNPs cement paste sample for 7 days, at the water to cement ratio of 0.35, and the depressed percentage of autogenous shrinkage reached 81.60% compared with the blank sample.

In QDs, entangle photon pairs are generated through a cascaded emission process: biexciton to exciton to the ground state. The FSS of the excitonic states destroys the entanglement of the photon pairs; hence, it needs to be eliminated. For numerical investigation of FSS and design optimization, a multiscale-multiphysics many-body calculation is required. In this article, we report the coupling of a full configuration interaction (FCI) method with a 10-band ( $sp<^>{ {3}}$ $s<^>\ast $ -spin) tight-binding (TB) model to calculate the excitonic energetics of realistically sized InGaN/GaN dot-in-nanowire structures. Model benchmarking has been done against a recently reported InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) structure in the ${a}$ -plane orientation. Computational methodology of implementing a hexagonal-base truncated pyramid shaped QD has been presented. The effects of QD shape/thickness, material composition, and crystal growth direction (polar ${c}$ -plane and non-polar ${m}$ -plane and ${a}$ -plane) on the FSS of InGaN/GaN based photon emitters have been investigated. Polarization profiles of the emitted photons from the excitonic transitions have been derived quantum mechanically from transition dipole moments. With the smallest FSS, the non-polar ${m}$ -plane device has been found to be most promising for the QKD application.

Here we study, as a function of Bi-doped Si film thickness, the evolution and ultimate removal of lattice defects that are associated with a recently demonstrated viable route to precisely incorporate Bi dopants in homoepitaxial Si thin films. Scanning tunneling microscopy imaging reveals how the elongated defect structures in the Si lattice, originating from prefabricated Bi nanolines on the substrate surface that are the source of the Bi dopants, evolve with increasing Si overlayer thickness.

The QCM frequency quickly decreased by introducing the trichlorosilane gas, while it slowly decreased by the dichlorosilane gas. The QCM frequency behavior was explained by the gas flow condition, such as the plug flow and recirculating flow, in the reactor. The relationship was consistent with the gas flow calculations, because the heavy and light gases could directly flow downward and recirculate, respectively, in the chamber due to natural convection. The information obtained from the QCM frequency behavior is expected to be utilized for the real-time gas monitoring and for the process design.

However, there still lack quantitative valid scales for these models, in which scale the solutions by simulation can be treated as physically credible. In this work, Euler and Navier-Stokes models are implemented on the typical unsteady flow with discontinuities: Sod shock tube problem. Firstly, based on the Boltzmann model whose valid scale is molecule kinetic scale, we compare the values of different moments of Euler and Navier-Stokes to Boltzmann with the evolution of flow. The results provide the valid scales of Euler and Navier-Stokes models quantitatively. Secondly, following the real conditions and parameters in real air, the physical characteristics of waves' generation and evolution in Sod shock tube are observed and analyzed numerically at the microscopic level for the first time.

In this paper, anisotropic nanocomposite PrFeB/PrCo5 hot-deformed magnets with and without doping PrCu eutectic alloy were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. With the addition of 6 wt% PrCu, the coercivity of the magnet (10.8 kOe) is almost double than that of undoped magnet (5.6 kOe), with an enhancement of the remanence (9.1 kG versus 8.4 kG). For the magnet with PrCu, the nonmagnetic PrCu phase is mainly distributed in the phase boundary regions, introducing a coupling effect of demagnetization on the hard-magnetic phases, which obtained an enhancement of the coercivity. The deformed Pr2Fe14B grains of the hybrid magnet have elongated platelet shapes, but the PrCo5 grains are not easy to be deformed, which affects the overall degree of deformation texture of the hybrid magnet. This implies that there is uncoordinated deformation for the PrFeB/PrCo5 hybrid magnet.

A novel 2D quantitative birefringence measurement method based on ptychographic iterative engine (PIE) in a planar polariscope is proposed. The birefringent sample is placed in the parallel probe-forming path. By inserting an isotropic diffractive object with good modulation property for the probe, the ptychographic scan measurements are performed under two different dark-field states. The amplitudes and phases of the two probes containing different birefringence information were reconstructed, and the phase retardation and azimuth angle obtained with a simple and straightforward extraction approach. The approach was verified using a classic diametrically compressed disc. The proposed method solves the problem of quantitative birefringence measurement in planar polariscopes by introducing the phase information. It reduces the PIE scans and shortens the data collection time, which provides a practical measurement means for birefringence in materials, biophysics and opto-mechanical system.

Low boiling solvents such as hexane show an oscillatory modulation of transmitted light intensity (period similar to 4 s) while solvents with intermediate boiling points such as toluene give a stable switching response. An on/off ratio of 83% is observed in the transmitted pump beam. Using this, a pump beam (404 nm, 80 mW continuous wave) was shown to reversibly switch the state of a probe laser (630 nm, 5 mW continuous wave). This switch thus serves as an optical analog of an electronic transistor and demonstrates the potential for all optical switching of low power light beams. Further, all optical universal logic gates, NAND and NOR, were also demonstrated using the micro-bubble switch.

We have systematically studied and proved that the choice of metal has a great impact on optoelectronic performance. Ag and Al with similar low work functions display similar current?voltage behavior before and after the introduction of MoOx; whereas Au and Ni which own similar high work functions lead to another type of current?voltage behavior. MoOx in the metal/MoOx/Si samples brings the superior diode behavior with an enhanced responsivity and decreased dark current as compared with the metal/Si samples. The choice of Ag as the top electrode on MoOx/Si has low alloying or defect formation with the MoOx/Si structure preventing the deterioration of the diode behavior, and the large downward band bending in MoOx at the Ag/MoOx junction facilitates the multitunnelling capture emission. This leads to high responsivity while maintaining the low dark current.

A proposed upgrade for the polarized cold neutron spectrometer, D7	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT												The concept for a proposed upgrade to the D7 diffuse scattering spectrometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, is presented. The upgrade consists of rebuilding the primary spectrometer, substantially relaxing the incident beam divergence to match the divergence that can be accepted by the secondary spectrometer. Monte-Carlo simulations and acceptance diagram calculations have been used to verify the performance of the proposed instrument relative to the current D7. The proposed upgrade is not the final instrument plan, as modifications and compromises will need to be applied for space compatibility with neighbouring instruments. The concept offers an intensity upgrade for a nominal sample of a factor > 20. The relative wavelength spread of the incident beam will be reduced by a factor approximate to 3. The increased divergence will result in a degraded Q-resolution for small scattering angles from the sample, but a reduced resolution at large scattering angles.

In order for Xe to have good electronic qualifies, it needs to be of high purity. This work reports on the determination of the charge carrier lifetime in Xe, which reflects its purity and characterizes the quality of the gas for gamma-spectroscopy. Our previously developed analytical model for charge transport in an ionization chamber filled with Xe is used to determine the electron lifetime in Xe in the parallel-electrode configuration. The model is used to fit the measurement results obtained by using a dedicated ionization chamber. For undoped Xe gas of approximately 6N purity, the dependence of the ionization pulse rise time vs. gas pressure was measured. By using the data and the analysis, the lifetime at each pressure was estimated.

Depending on the bare model parameters, one or two quantum phase transitions into non-magnetic spin -liquid and Kondo Fermi-liquid ground states can occur with increasing the bare coupling constant. Whereas the renormalization of the magnetic moment in the ordered phase can reach orders of magnitude, spin fluctuation frequency and coupling constant are moderately renormalized in the spin-liquid phase.

The spin excitation spectrum as well as the thermodynamic quantities are calculated by means of the extended self-consistent mean-field theory. Two branches of energy spectrum are obtained and the energy gap between them is 1.7641 at zero temperature which agrees quite well with other numerical results. The contribution of bonding alternation delta, anisotropy lambda and magnetic field H to the energy gap are present in this research.

At Heisenberg point, the e(0) is -0.7326 and f(0) is -1.4659 at zero temperature in this work are reasonable compared with the results calculated by other methods.

The photogenerated current of the InZnO phototransistor at long light wavelength (>600 nm) was significantly improved by utilizing narrow bandgap MoS2 as the capping layer (1.3 eV). At lower wavelength, photocarriers are generated due to the optical absorption of both InZnO and MoS2 layers, whereas the latter ensures significant photocarrier generation even at the higher wavelength region of the visible spectrum. The photogenerated carriers subsequently transfer to the underlying InZnO layer of superior carrier mobility that has a high channel conduction of additional electrons from the optically-induced doubly positively charged oxygen vacancies (Vo(++)) where the gate field is screening, thereby leading to the higher photoconductive gain of the InZnO/MoS2 phototransistors. The dynamic photosensitivity behaviour of the aforesaid phototransistor reveals the presence of persistent photoconductivity (PPC) due to the oxygen vacancy associated with InZnO which can be removed by applying a reset gate pulse from -15 to +5 V. The optical properties of these phototransistors were further enhanced by replacing the opaque Ti/Au electrode by an ultrathin transparent Ti/Au electrode. Utilization of the transparent electrode results in enhanced electron injection from source to channel due to a reduced barrier height under illumination giving rise to a ten-fold improvement in the photocurrent and responsivity of the phototransistors. A position-dependent study of the photocurrent w.r.t beam position also reveals that the enhancement in photocurrent is strongly dependent on the position and is at its maximum when the beam is placed near the source region.

As known, the ultrathin alumina mask (UTAM) surface nanopatterning technique allows the fabrication of periodic nanoparticle (NP) arrays with 5 nm gaps among the NPs, however, it still faces a significant challenge in realizing the reliable distribution of nanogaps over a large area, because of the unavoidable collapse of the UTAM pore wall during the traditional one-step homothermal pore-widening process. Herein, an efficient two-step poikilothermal pore-widening process was developed to precisely control the pore wall etching of a UTAM, enabling effectively avoiding the fragmentation of the UTAM and finally obtaining a large-scale UTAM with a pore wall thickness of about 5 nm. As a result, large-scale NP arrays with high-density sub-5 nm and even smaller gaps between the neighboring NPs have been realized through applying the as-prepared UTAM as the nanopatterning template. These NP arrays with sub-5 nm gaps show ultrahigh SERS sensitivity (signal enhancement improved by an order of magnitude compared with NP arrays with 5 nm gaps) and good reproducibility, which demonstrates the practical feasibility of this promising two-step pore-widening UTAM technique for the fabrication of high-performance active SERS substrates with large-scale ultra-small nanogaps.

J	Lu, HC				Lu, Hao-Chun			Indicator of power convex and exponential transformations for solving nonlinear problems containing posynomial terms	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												Posynomial terms frequently appear in many nonlinear problems and are the core components of geometric and generalized geometric programming problems. The most popular method to treat nonconvex posynomial terms for obtaining global optimization is to convert nonconvex posynomial terms as convex underestimators using transformation techniques. Among the transformation techniques, exponential transformation (ET) and power convex transformation (PCT) can yield the tightest underestimators of posynomial terms. However, the current literature has rarely discussed which to select between ET and PCT. This study employs the definite integral with piecewise linear technique to calculate the error between the original posynomial and the corresponding ET/PCT underestimators. Lastly, this study aims to identify an indicator that can choose the appropriate transformation between ET and PCT and analyze the correctness of the proposed indicator for posynomial terms in nonlinear problems. The proposed indicator can efficiently solve nonlinear problems containing posynomial terms. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed indicator. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The whole beamline based on large-aperture superconducting solenoids is composed of several sections: charge selection section, pion decay channel, bending section, adiabatic taper and muon decay channel. To improve particles transmission and neutrino flux while maintaining low background at the far detector of 150 km, the curved solenoids with additional vertical dipole field are applied in the charge selection and bending sections.

The GAS algorithm (Janse van Rensburg and Rechnitzer 2011 J. Knot Theol. Raman 20 1145?71) is used to sample lattice polygons of fixed knot type in a confining cube and to estimate the free energy of confined lattice knots. Lattice polygons of knot types the unknot, the trefoil knot, and the figure eight knot, are sampled and the free energies are estimated as functions of the concentration of monomers in the confining cube. The data show that the free energy is a function of knot type at low concentrations, and (mean-field) Flory?Huggins theory (Flory 1942 J. Chem. Phys. 10 51?61; Huggins 1942 J. Phys.

Modelling uncertainties in phase-space boundary integral models of ray propagation	COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION												A recently proposed phase-space boundary integral model for the stochastic propagation of ray densities is presented and, for the first time, explicit connections between this model and parametric uncertainties arising in the underlying physical model are derived. In particular, an asymptotic analysis for a weak noise perturbation of the propagation speed is used to derive expressions for the probability distribution of the phase-space boundary coordinates after transport along uncertain, and in general curved, ray trajectories. Furthermore, models are presented for incorporating geometric uncertainties in terms of both the location of an edge within a polygonal domain, as well as small scale geometric fluctuations giving rise to rough boundary reflections. Uncertain source terms are also considered in the form of stochastically distributed point sources and uncertain boundary data. A series of numerical experiments is then performed to illustrate these uncertainty models in two-dimensional convex polygonal domains. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To our knowledge, laser-induced incandescence (LII) and extinction are used to characterize particulate emission at the exhaust for the first time because laser diagnostics are generally applied to laboratory flames, automotive engines and aeroengines. The 30-kW boiler was first characterized by temperature mapping in the combustion chamber and particle diameter analysis by scanning mobility particle sizer at the exhaust and inside the first combustion chamber for a better understanding of the running of this complex combustion system. Non-intrusive laser-based diagnostics including broadband LII, two-color LII and laser extinction excited at 1064 nm have been employed to study the particulate emissions at the exhaust of the boiler during the start-up and the steady-state phases of the boiler. The cross analysis of the experimental results obtained with the different diagnostics shows that particle size distributions, particles volume fractions and the temperature distribution are strongly dependent on the boiler cycle linked to the pellets loading. Laser extinction and LII-based methods provided complementary information about the particulate emissions. The LII technique probes incandescent soot particles formed during the combustion of pellets, while laser extinction detects both soot and non-incandescent particles (such as dust, fly ashes).																			0946-2171	1432-0649				JAN	2020	126	1							6	10.1007/s00340-019-7350-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00340-019-7350-5													WOS:000500062300001

Tuning of structural and magnetic properties by intriguing radical-radical interaction by double electron oxidation in U-A-U′ triplex formation	CHEMICAL PHYSICS												The spin coupling properties of a series of two di-radical centers A(.)U(.) and A(.)U'(.) in U-A-U' triplex were investigated. These two series are considered by intriguing the radical-radical cation (A(.+) U (.+) and A( .+)U' (.+)), radical-dehydrogenated (A(. +)U(-H1)(.), A(-H1)U-.(.) , A(-H1)U-.'(.+ )and A( .+) U'(-H1)), and dehydrogenated-dehydrogenated (A(-H1)U-.(-H1)(.) and A(-H1)U-.(,)(-H1)(.) ) as RNA base couplers. The structural and electronic properties were calculated employing density functional theory (DFT). The di-radical character was identified by performing DFT and complete active space self-consistent (CASSCF) calculations. The calculated value of coupling constant revealed the presence of both types of magnetic interaction i.e. ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM). A strong magnetic interaction is found for the radical-dehydrogenated A(-H1)U-.(.+) series whereas a weak magnetic interaction is observed for radical-radical cation, A(.+)U(.+), A(.+)U'(.+) and other di-radical series e.g. A( .+) U.+(-H1)(.), A(.+) U'(-H1)(.), and A(-H1)U-.'(-H1) (.) .

The results from FT-IR spectra, carbon content, the XPS spectra of Cu 2p and O1s reflected that the photochemical reactions were inhibited by high UV temperature. And we proposed a model to analyze and explain the mechanism of how the UV temperature affect the photochemical reactions. Finally, the YBCO films irradiated at 100 or 150 degrees C had higher Jc values (about 7.0 MA/cm(2) at 77 K and 0 T) than samples UV-irradiated under high UV temperatures (beyond 200 degrees C), which showed lower Jc values due to the weakening of oxidation progress. Consequently, a temperature window of 100-150 degrees C in UV irradiation process maybe suitable for the deep UV irradiation method used in YBCO preparation.						, weibai/0000-0001-7693-3972													1051-8223	1558-2515				JAN	2020	30	1							6000205	10.1109/TASC.2019.2930944	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2019.2930944													WOS:000482591300001

Their alternating current impedance characteristics, under various frequencies, were measured and studied as a function of temperature in the range 200 to 400 K. Both the real (Z') and imaginary (Z '') parts of the complex impedance were temperature dependent. It was apparent that the Z ''-Z' curve for all temperatures exhibited single semicircles. The center of these semicircles was below the Z' axis. With temperature increment, the diameter of the semicircles decreased. The characteristics of the semicircular curve indicated that the parallel resistance (R-p) and constant phase element (CPE) in parallel combination with the series resistance (R-s) should be appropriate for the equivalent electrical circuit model for the produced heterojunctions. Through simulation, the value of R-s at 200 K was found to be 5.04 x 10(3) Omega, and fell to 252.05 Omega at 400 K. Also, the value of R-p was 1.34 x 10(7) Omega at 200 K and decreased to 3.37 x 10(5) Omega at 400 K. Moreover, the value of CPE at 200 K was 95.91 x 10(-12) F with a deviation from the standard (n) value of 0.90 and rose slightly to 115.60 x 10(-12) F with an n value of 0.98 at 400 K.

The results of current density-voltage (J-V) curves justified a large leakage current along with minimal response under illumination. A recombination process controls the mechanism for carrier portage in the zone of V <= 0.16 V, while a space-charge-limited current process governs the carrier portage mechanism in the circumstance of V value beyond 0.16 V. Frequency (f) dependent conductance (G/omega)-V and capacitance (C)-V curves were measured to extract the series resistance (R-s) and density of the interface state (N-ss). On the basis of extraction in the manner of Nicollian-Brews, the value of R-s rose with f abatement. With zero bias voltage applied, the value of R-s was 189.84 Omega at 2 MHz and rose to 715.10 Omega at 20 kHz. The acquired R-s may be attributable to the occurrence of R-s in the neutral zones as well as Ohmic contact. The values for N-ss, which were extracted in the manner of Hill-Coleman, were 1.23 x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2) at 2 MHz and 6.51 x 10(12) eV(-1) cm(-2) at 20 kHz.

Oxygen was introduced during the sputtering process to prevent the reduction of transmittance and the formation of nonstoichiometric compositions. The dependence of the optical and electrical properties of MTO thin films on the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio was systematically investigated. The transmittance of the MTO single layer (24 nm) at 550 nm gradually increased from 85.9% to 88.2% with an increase of the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio from 0% to 7.9%. The optical band gap was also affected by the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio, varying from 3.30 to 3.64 eV. The MTO film deposited at an O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio of 2.7% showed the minimum resistivity (0.03 Omega . cm). The XPS spectra indicated that the SnO2 thin films become almost stoichiometric as the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio increased. Thus, this sputtering process can be used to prepare flexible MTO films with a wider optical band gap, improved transmittance, and decreased resistivity.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					505	509		10.1166/jnn.2020.17254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17254								31383200					WOS:000484770600067

To reduce refractive index-mismatching, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and MTO layers were inserted between the MTO/Ag/MTO multilayer film and the PET substrate. MTO and Ag were deposited by RF/DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature, whereas spin-coating was used to deposit PDMS at various dilution ratios in hexane. In this study, pattern visibility was examined by comparing the differences in the color and reflectance of oxide/metal/oxide multilayers before and after adding the PDMS and MTO IMLs. In addition, the effects of the PDMS dilution ratio on the electrical and optical characteristics were also investigated. The MTO/Ag/MTO/PDMS/MTO multilayer films showed high transmittance (>86% at 550 nm) except at the dilution ratio of 1:50. As the PDMS dilution ratio increased from 1:50 to 1:200, the reflectance difference (Delta R) increased from 0.08% to 0.35% and the color difference (Delta b*) increased from 0.31 to 1.23. The maximum resistance changes of the multilayer films were 0.126% and 0.124% after outer and inner bending, respectively, for 10,000 cycles with a radius of curvature of 4 mm.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					594	598		10.1166/jnn.2020.17255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17255								31383217					WOS:000484770600084

In this study, we propose a direct contact resistance measurement method without a test structure by separate processes to improve the nano-area contact resistance.

In addition, it is confirmed that the contact resistance decreased with an increase in bonding strength in the case of nano-area homo-metal contact. However, the contact resistance is affected by the tunneling effect and bond energy according to the distance between the first layers of atoms in the case of nano-area hetero-metal contact.

Thus, it is found that properties of the fundamental flexural mode change in a strongly non-monotonous way. In particular, by increasing the thickness of added layer one may observe the same propagation velocity for up to three different values of layer thicknesses ratio. Existence of an important criterion based on the relative signs taken by the amplitudes on the outer surfaces in this regime is revealed. It allows to establish a clear correspondence between symmetric and antisymmetric solutions for a single layer and those for a bilayered plate. It is suggested that the criterion is not limited to case of two layers. Branches of the spectrum are classified accordingly and their evolution from long to short wavelength is discussed. Analysis of a specific example which includes volume and surface modes (Rayleigh and Stoneley) is presented. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme and possible extensions are suggested. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

With the development of nanotechnology, a huge potential has been created for the design of highly sensitive sensors with low energy consumption and low costs. If a composite material constructed with carbon nanotubes is used as an electrode in contact with a contaminant, this material undergoes an oxidation-reduction reaction with the contaminant that allows the electrode to function as an electrochemical sensor. This study involved the application of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and modified working electrodes constructed with multi-walled carbon nanotube composites (Ag- and ZnO-multi-walled carbon nanotubes) as electrochemical sensors. These electrodes have good response speed and sensitivity at low concentrations, and they are reusable. To lower the price of these sensors, our goal was to maximize their sensitivity by using the low-cost multi-walled carbon nanotubes in conjunction with silver electroless plating of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotube composites.

This class of polyanilines exhibits electrochemical activity, capacitive behaviour, and a contact angle of 119-125 degrees with water. The addition of multi-wall carbon nanotubes facilitates the control of the polymer morphology and increases the specific capacitance of the material. We obtained microfibers or flake-like morphologies depending on the amount of multiwall carbon nanotubes added in the organic phase and through cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge, we evaluated the effect of the backbone geometry and the addition of nanotubes on the electrochemical properties of the composites and the pristine polymers. The capacitance of the linear 3-perfluoroctyl polyaniline is consistently better than the cross-linked 4-perfluoroctyl polyaniline, where the para position relative to the amine group is blocked by fluorocarbon chains.

The configurations examined were obtained from an extensive experimental study that shows that the jammed packing fraction of the wire within the cavities depends heavily on the topology of the cavity. The analysis reveals regions of the configurations dominated by finite-size effects controlled by the drive force of injection, and bulk domains strongly controlled by the density of pins. In the bulk regime a persistence length, as obtained in the Kratky?Porod model of polymers, is found to depend linearly with the number of pins which develops the role of an inverse effective temperature. That is, the temperature for the system in this case depends on the topology of the space. The regions characterized by finite-size effects present two regimes corresponding to different mechanical rigidities.					de Lima, José/U-5935-2019	Lima, Jose/0000-0001-8231-5759													0031-8949	1402-4896				JAN	2020	95	1							015705	10.1088/1402-4896/ab475e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1402-4896/ab475e													WOS:000499372300001

The present paper considers the simple nonlinear chemical feedback model for standard glycolytic route with prototype autocatalytic steps. Quadratic S + P reversible arrow 2P. Cubic S + 2P reversible arrow 3P. We couple these steps to get the mixed quadratic-cubic model but remarkable array of complex behavior and oscillatory patterns as expected on coupling is surprisingly missing. The observation is in conformity with natural glycolytic alternatives like the Entner-Doudoroff (ED), and phosphoketolase pathways found in Archaea - Thermoproteustenax and other prokaryotes. The fundamental and the practical implications of our findings are thoroughly discussed with pilot calculations and numerical simulations supported via non-linear dynamic analysis. A basic kinetic scheme is suggested for natural glycolytic alternative, ED pathway with its comparison and contrast to other standard routes for glucose metabolism. A key outcome of the study is the phenomenon of oscillator death for the coupled network. A discussion on the thermodynamic aspect of entropy production rate for the model networks are also presented for a comparison.																			0301-0104	1873-4421				JAN 1	2020	528								110531	10.1016/j.chemphys.2019.110531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphys.2019.110531													WOS:000490758300004

Spectral-resolved two-light beam photoresponse spectroscopy to resolve and investigate different photogeneration processes in organic semiconductors	ORGANIC ELECTRONICS												A photocurrent spectroscopy employing two-color light excitation beams scanned at different photon energies is proposed to resolve and to investigate different photogeneration processes involving exciton dissociation and above bandgap excitations in organic semiconductors. The basic concept of this spectroscopy is based on the phenomenon of photoresponse enhancement (PE), recently observed in pentacene films. In this phenomenon, the photocurrent, generated with modulated probe-light creating excitons, undergoes enhancement under additional above bandgap bias-light excitation, which acts to facilitate exciton dissociation. In the proposed photocurrent spectroscopy, the excitation energies of probe-light producing photocurrent undergoing PE and those of the biaslight which can induce PE are specified. This allows us to resolve photogeneration via exciton dissociation, which is facilitated by above bandgap excitations, and the onset of the above bandgap excitations, which facilitate exciton dissociation in pentacene films. It is found that light excitation in the region of 1.77-2.43 eV generates excitons diffusing with a diffusion length of 50-80 nm, which is compatible with that of triplet excitons, to the pentacene-substrate interface where dissociate via electron transfer to positive donor-like traps. For light excitation exceeding 2.43 eV, above bandgap excitations become strong competing triplet exciton creation by singlet fission. These results can be explained if the singlet fission and the above bandgap excitations are mediated by charge transfer states with energy-dependent electron-hole separations.

A muon-based observable for a photon search at 30-300 PeV	ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS												The observation of an ultra-high energy photon component of the cosmic radiation is one of the open problems in Astroparticle Physics. The stringent theoretical and experimental upper limits to the photon flux above 100 TeV make the search of a weak photon signal in the vast hadronic cosmic ray background a challenging task. At these energies, photon primaries entering the atmosphere develop an extensive air shower which is driven by electromagnetic processes with a poor muon component. The muon content of the air showers is one of the most promising observables that could lead to the best possible discrimination between photons and hadronic cosmic rays. In this article, we define a parameter capable of quantifying the muon component while reducing the fluctuations due to the unknown lateral distribution of muons. We explain the different features of this observable using simulated air showers between 30 and 300 PeV. We show that a merit factor of 5 in the separation between photon and proton primaries and a photon signal efficiency of at least similar to 92% while rejecting 99.97% of the proton-initiated showers can be reached in the mentioned energy range of interest. This separation power can be achieved provided the shower features, specially the primary energy, are reconstructed sufficiently precise and without significant biases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Structural study and hydrogen sorption kinetics of ball-milled magnesium hydride. Journal of Alloys and Compounds, 293, pp. 495-500). However, the formation of hydrogen products at high temperatures, the phenomenon of rapid alloy deterioration, and the low rate of reaction in the hydriding and dehydriding processes have been the main hindrances to commercialization of these alloys for hydrogen storage. In this study, to increase the reaction rate with hydrogen, Mg-Al-Zn-CaO-H-x hydrogen storage alloys were fabricated HIMA (Seok, S., et al., 2005.

SEM was used to confirm the shape of the particles. The crystal structure of the synthesized materials was analyzed by XRD, and BET measurements were performed to determine the correlation between the BCR and specific surface area.

However, the initial surplus water in mortar causes the internal calcium component to leach out and contaminate the surface, and the hardening of concrete that contains pigment is generally slower than that of normal concrete. This study was to evaluate the physical properties of mortar colored by carbon amino silica black (CASB), using a methyl cellulose (MC) polymer to reduce surface efflorescence and increase early strength by means of steam curing. MC modifies the mechanical properties of mortar by forming a polymer film, which prevents the soluble calcium from migrating to the surface and reduces whitening in steam cured mortar. However, steam curing significantly decreased the strength with increasing MC content when CASB content was high.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					584	588		10.1166/jnn.2020.17237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17237								31383215					WOS:000484770600082

Among lithium secondary batteries, the lithium polymer battery, which has similar performance to the lithium secondary battery, is made of a solid polymer electrolyte. Lithium ions in a solid polymer electrolyte exist in the form of a solution by a polar group in a polymer matrix.

Long life and minimal energy consumption are often the most attractive advantages for electronic devices. Because LEDs are based on compound semiconductors, which explore the direct transition between the conduction and valance band edges, thermal energy loss can be minimized during operation. However, even though these types of LEDs are based on direct transition type semiconductors, thermal energy is still emitted during operation owing to forward conduction and reverse leakage currents.

Structurally, the linearized operators associated with these fronts have unstable essential spectrum-corresponding to instability of the spatially asymptotic states - and stable point spectrum-corresponding to stability of the transition profile of the front. We show that these waves are linearly orbitally asymptotically stable in appropriate exponentially weighted spaces. While the technical device of exponential weights allows us to accommodate the unstable essential spectrum of individual waves in our linear analysis, it does not shed light on the long-time pattern formation that is observed experimentally and in numerical simulations. To begin to address this issue, we consider a periodic array of unstable front and back solutions. While not an exact solution of the governing equation, this periodic pattern mimics experimentally observed phenomena. Our numerical experiments suggest that the convecting instabilities associated with each individual wave are damped as they pass through transition layers and that this stabilization mechanism underlies the pattern formation seen in experiments.

On the other hand, carbon materials have been mainly studied in the field of hydrogen storage with high specific surface area and lightweight properties; however, results show that they cannot store a large amount of hydrogen.

J	Kim, S; Im, D				Kim, Sanggil; Im, Donggu			A digitally tunable small-area composite-varactor array operated with positive and negative control voltages for high linearity and low loss RF circuit applications	SOLID-STATE ELECTRONICS												A small-area composite-varactor-based digitally tunable capacitor operated with positive and negative control voltages is proposed to remove several drawbacks resulting from the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor of the conventional switched capacitor array (SCA). It was constructed with several composite-varactor branches in parallel, each of which consists of p-type (P+/Pwell) and n-type (N+/Nwell) accumulation-mode varactors in a cascode configuration. The optimum ratio of the channel width between p-type and n-type accumulation-mode varactors was investigated through the simulation in order to maximize a quality factor (Q-factor) of the tunable capacitor at the maximum capacitance (C-MAX) state. The number of composite-varactor unit in each branch was designed to be binary-weighted, and the total capacitance can vary linearly by digitally turning on and off both varactors. It was firstly implemented in 65-nm bulk CMOS process, and showed comparable tuning range, Q-factor, and harmonic distortion performances while reducing the silicon area by half and eliminating the MIM capacitor in comparison with the conventional SCA. In the measurement, the proposed tunable capacitor showed a Q-factor of 60.3 at C-MAX state and a tuning range of 2.8 at 2 GHz frequency band. In addition, it was perfectly capable of handling a high power signal up to 0 dBm with excellent second and third-order harmonic distortion of greater than 70 dBc at the minimum capacitance (C-MIN) state and 77 dBc at C-MAX state.																			0038-1101	1879-2405				JAN	2020	163								107697	10.1016/j.sse.2019.107697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sse.2019.107697													WOS:000496807500011
J	Korkmazhan, E				Korkmazhan, Elgin			Fluctuation relations for non-Markovian and heterogeneous temperature systems	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												Fluctuation relations such as the Jarzynski equality provide general statements about thermodynamic variables and have been used to infer free energy from nonequilibrium measurements. Here we utilize model-specific fluctuation relations derived from corresponding stochastic dynamical equations to study systems whose thermodynamics have not been well-understood. We detail steps of known frameworks to obtain specific forms of fluctuation relations for examples governed by non-Markovian Langevin dynamics and spatial temperature heterogeneity. We show related simple approximations in a system obeying Tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics and propose efficient design features for biomolecular machines.

The Influence of Edge Energy on Step Flow Instability for Crystals with Bravais Versus Non-Bravais Lattice Structures	COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS												We examine the meandering instability for prismatic lattices formed from triangles, squares and hexagons using a nearest neighbor kinetic Monte Carlo model. In the first two cases, which are Bravais lattices, we find that facets with the orientation favored in the equilibrium shape of isolated islands are most prone to this instability, while the analogous facet for the hexagonal lattice is the least unstable. We argue that this is due to a significant difference in the reconstructed/equilibrium versus the non-reconstructed edge energy for non-Bravais crystals. Surface/edge energy is typically modeled as a single-valued function of orientation. We put forward a simple geometric argument that suggests this picture is inadequate for crystals with a non-Bravais lattice structure. In the case of a hexagonally structured lattice, our arguments indicate that the non-reconstructed edge energy can be viewed as both discontinuous and multi-valued for a subset of orientations that are commensurate with the crystal structure. We support these conclusions with density functional theory calculations that also reveal multivalued surface energies for the set of singular orientations.

The prepared specimen was post-annealed at a temperature of 773 K for various time durations, and the effects of annealing conditions have been investigated. Vickers hardness of Al6061, Al6063 and Cu decreases as annealing time decreases; however, that of the interface between Al alloys and Cu increases with an annealing time of 1 h, and then decreases as annealing time increases further. The growth of a diffusion layer in Al6063/Cu is larger than that in Al6061/Cu, because the activation energy in the Al6063/Cu is lower than that in Al6061/Cu during the annealing process. Cracking of the diffusion layer occurs by annealing for extended periods of time in both materials, which contributes to the decrease in hardness.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					599	602		10.1166/jnn.2020.17258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17258								31383218					WOS:000484770600085

We emphasise the types of reasoning students use in explanations at macroscopic and microscopic levels, as this knowledge is helpful for designing and implementing novel teaching approaches, which help articulate macroscopic and microscopic levels of description. Two open-ended questions were used to analyse students? reasoning, with emphasis on explanations. As seen in the obtained results, an important percentage of students are not able to correctly interpret phenomena in simple transitory current states. Their explanations can be categorised into two general categories. The first one is based on relational causal reasoning and the second one is a form of reasoning that excludes current flow in transitory state processes. We look at several aspects that have barely been mentioned in previous research at university level related to the topic of transitory current in circuits, such as possible difficulties with complex reasoning and the type of reasoning students use when they establish macro-micro relationships.

This paper deals with the refinement of hard particles, in order to improve the microstructure of the surfacing layer. The comparison of microstructure and hard particles composition between laser arc composite surfacing layer and arc surfacing layer confirmed that hard particles of both are (Fe, Cr)(7)(B, C)(3) and (Fe, Cr)(2)B. Also, the results show that in the cross section of the arc surfacing layer, the hard particles are in the shape of long strips, hexagonal and regular quadrangular blocks. But the size of hard particles decreases and follows a uniform distribution under laser induction. The wear resistance of laser arc composite surfacing layer is obviously improved. This may be due to that thick hard particles were broken into smaller units by pulsed laser stirring molten pool, thus providing more nucleating particles for the formation of hard particles. At the same time, the thick hard particles were melt down by high energy laser beam, which improves the temperature gradient and forces hard particles to grow uniformly.																			0030-3992	1879-2545				JAN	2020	121								105797	10.1016/j.optlastec.2019.105797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.optlastec.2019.105797													WOS:000491217800028

However, mammary glands and ducts are highly sensitive to radiation; the absorbed dose to glandular tissue may increase the risk of secondary breast cancer. Therefore, accurate suborgan breast dosimetry for breast nuclear medicine imaging represents an important issue. In this study, a series of anthropomorphic software breast phantoms (ASBPs) with various volumes and glandularitles were built. The realism of the ASBPs was assessed by using the two-dimensional projection and fractal dimension (FD) analysis. Breast self S values and suborgan S values for F-18 and Tc-99(m) were simulated using the Monte Carlo technique. The projected images of the ASBPs were similar to clinical mammograms in tissue distribution and image contrast. The mean FD value for the ASBPs was 2.23. The maximum differences between the breast self S values of ASBPs and OLINDA/EXM for (18)( ) and Tc-99(m) were -14.4% and -16.7%, respectively. For the breast suborgan S values, the maximum ratios between the S value from gland to gland S(g <- g) and the S value from breast to breast S(1).-b) were 4.84 for F-18 and 3.60 for Tc-99(m). The mean ratios between the S value from gland to duct S(d <- g) and that from gland to gland S(g <- g) were 0.296 for F-18 and 0.356 for Tc-99m. The suborgan breast dosimetry based on the ASBPs can be used for internal dose evaluation and carcinogenic risk assessment of mammary glands and ducts in breast nuclear medicine imaging.

Characterizing time intermittency in non-diffusive fast ion transport through plasma turbulence	PLASMA PHYSICS AND CONTROLLED FUSION												Turbulent fast ion transport has been investigated in astrophisycal, laboratory and fusion plasmas. When gyro- and drift-averaging across plasma structures manifest as non-markovian and non-local effects, this results in generally non-diffusive transport. The intermittency of the formation of these plasma structures, such as blobs, can potentially be reflected in the transport of the fast ions as well. In the TORPEX basic plasma device, a toroidal beam of suprathermal Li-6 ions is injected into electrostatic plasma turbulence. Conditional sampling techniques confirm turbulent E x B-drifts as physical driving mechanism of radial fast ion transport, which features sub-, super- or quasi-diffusive regimes depending on the fast ion energy and propagation time. To address the question of how far local intermittency is associated with each regime, we analyze characteristics of time-intermittency on an extensive set of local fast ion time-series across all observed regimes. Modeling the time-average fast ion profiles as the result of a meandering smaller instantaneous beam allows us to predict the skewness of such time-series based on their time-average. Comparisons with the skewness of simple two-valued time-series can yield relative indications towards certain transport regimes in our specific system, based on the differences in the size of the instantaneous fast ion beam.

For this purpose, a deeper understanding of the crystal growth scheme and well-designed organometallic precursors are needed. Density functional theory calculations were used to find the activation barriers for the initial reaction of Zn, Ga, and In precursors with tris (trimethylsilyl)phosphine, and differences in reactivity between dissimilar metal precursors were revealed. The coordinations of the P precursor to Zn, In, and Ga precursors were found to differ significantly, depending on the coordination number and the ionic radius, and these results were consistent with reports that found that InZnP can be alloyed, but InGaP is not easily alloyed. The activation energies become close to each other when using thiol ligands with less steric hindrance in monodentate ligands. These results will lead to achieving precise composition control and great luminescence properties.

Numerical study on the impact of variable diffusion co-efficients and chemical reaction on transport phenomenon in nonlinear axisymmetric flow	PHYSICA SCRIPTA												In this article, conservation laws, temperature dependent viscosity, thermal conductivity and mass diffusion models are used for mathematical modeling of flow of Casson fluid induced by nonlinear axisymmetric stretching sheet exposed to non-uniform magnetic field. Mathematical models are solved by finite element method. Convergence is ensured and grid independent analysis is performed. Several numerical simulations are executed to investigate the behavior of velocity, temperature and concentration under the variation of parameters. The impact of viscous dissipation, Joule heating, variation of viscosity and thermal conductivity is investigated through numerical simulations. The developed computer program is tested by comparing with computed results. The intensity of applied magnetic field and Joule heating are directly proportional to each other and an increase in the intensity of magnetic field causes an increase in the temperature. A rise in viscosity due to a rise in temperature has remarkable impact on both velocity and temperature. However, an increase in thermal conductivity (due to rise in temperature) results a significant increase in the temperature as conduction of heat from hot surface into the fluid speeds up. The wall heat flux increases when intensity of the magnetic field is increased.

Our numerical results demonstrate the presence of three distinguished regimes of transverse light expansion at different propagation distances. At short propagation distance, the Kerr-type nonlinearity are dominated and results in the transverse localization of light through the self-trapping mechanism. Radiation loss, causes the light escape from the injected guides, affect the light expansion in middle distance via broadening the light beam width. At longer distance the disorder terms led to the transverse localization of light, again. Also, we compared the propagation of light in edge and middle modes in the presence of the above effects. Our results show that the propagation distance of first localized regime for edge modes is larger than the middle modes since the edge modes can exchange energy with one of the left or right waveguides, while for middle modes there are two ways for energy exchange. Therefore the discrete diffraction can be diminished the nonlinear effects in middle modes faster than the edge modes.

OSL using a prototype fibre-mounted sensor and automated reader assembly	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY					2nd AMDI International Oncology and Medical Physics Symposium	MAR 01, 2019	Penang, MALAYSIA	AMDI				Application-viable yields of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) are known to be provided by a number of materials, Al2O3:C nanoDot OSLDs being one of those currently favoured, dominating the world of commercial passive radiation dosimetry. Associated with the use of such materials is the need for versatile, high performance readout devices, opportunities remaining for novel developments in support of the OSL media, as emphasised herein. Present study focuses on the data acquisition capability of an in-house prototype OSL reader, luminescence stimulation being provided by a 30 mW green LED light (spectral mid-point similar to 515 nm). In providing for the additional versatility of making stand-off (at a distance) measurements, the dosimeter sensors (nanoDot OSLD chips) were attached to a polymethyl-methcrylate (PMMA) fibre cable, allowing characterization of the OSL (phosphorescence) at very low risk. Using this prototype instrument, key OSL features from an Al2O3:C sensor medium have been captured, excellent quantitative agreement being found between present results and those of others using other readers. One further feature of the current design is that it also allows investigation of the excitation light wavelength dependence of sensor media that could be competitive to Al2O3:C, there being the additional ability to swap out the OSL sensor, filters and other support components.

These photocathodes are robust against laser irradiation and RF fields, are easy to handle, and have longevity. The surface cleaning of photocathodes is essential to improve and maintain their quantum efficiency (QE) in an RF gun cavity. In this paper, we propose a backside electron-beam irradiation heating technique as an in situ surface-cleaning procedure for photocathodes in an RF gun cavity. In the proposed technique, thermal electrons accelerated by a DC electric field are irradiated from the back of the photocathode, and their beam power is converted to heat, thereby heating the photocathode. Unlike other surface-cleaning techniques, surfaces of any cathode shape can be cleaned uniformly using this heating method. We designed and developed a cathode plug that includes the proposed heating system for large-diameter (similar to 8 mm) photocathodes. Thermal simulation of the entire system, including the photocathode and its holding structure, and RF simulation of the choke structure for preventing the leakage of RF power were performed. The developed heating system was installed in an RF gun in High Energy Accelerator Research Organization KEK and subjected to RF aging and beam commissioning. From the results of beam commissioning, it was found that the QE of the photocathode increased to approximately 2.5 times the initial value due to the in situ annealing in the RF gun cavity.

It is based on an analysis of the Poincare recurrence statistics on massive grids of initial data or values of parameters. We concentrate on Hamiltonian systems, featuring the method separately for the cases of bounded and non-bounded phase spaces. The embodiments of the method in each of the cases are specific. We compare the performances of the proposed Poincare recurrence method (PRM) and the custom Lyapunov exponent (LE) methods and show that they expose the global dynamics almost identically. However, a major advantage of the new method over the known global numerical tools, such as LE, FLI, MEGNO, and FA, is that it allows one to construct, in some approximation, charts of local diffusion timescales. Moreover, it is algorithmically simple and straightforward to apply. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CTA is expected not only to provide an unprecedented sensitivity in the tens of GeV to hundreds of TeV range, but also to considerably improve the systematic uncertainties of the measurements. We study the images registered by Cherenkov telescopes from low energy gamma rays with its first interaction in the upper parts of the atmosphere. The images show a characteristic separation due to the deflection of the first e(-)e(+) pair in the Geomagnetic Field. We evaluate the performance of the standard stereoscopic analysis for such events. We derive also a novel method for energy estimation of V-shaped events based purely on geometrical properties of the image. We investigate the potential of combining the classical energy estimation and the novel method for independent validation of the systematic shifts in the energy scale of Cherenkov telescopes and discuss the limitations of such analysis.

The formation of Cluster (1) was substantially suppressed by the formation of Cluster (2) during step quenching at 100 degrees C for 0.06 ks. The hardness increase was retarded for a period during two-step aging at 170 degrees C in the case of natural aging for 604.8 ks. The hardness decrease was determined to be due to the dissolution of nanoclusters in the early stage of two-step aging at 170 degrees C. On the other hand, hardness was directly increased in the step-quenched samples during multi-step aging at 170 degrees C. It is noted that Cluster (2) directly transforms into the strengthening phase. The bake hardening response is fairly enhanced by the formation of Cluster (2), which is formed by the step quenching process. It was confirmed that the step-quenched samples had a higher number of precipitates than the naturally-aged ones based on TEM images. The structure of the precipitate was identified to be the beta '' phase by analyzing HRTEM image.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					540	545		10.1166/jnn.2020.17278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17278								31383207					WOS:000484770600074

Laser-assisted interaction between nonrelativistic electrons and positrons	LASER PHYSICS LETTERS												The effective interaction between two classical nonrelativistic electrons (positrons) in the presence of intense electromagnetic radiation (one and two waves) is theoretically studied. Small relativistic corrections are considered in the laboratory reference frame. The field of an intense wave forms the movement of particles in such a way that their trajectories are practically parallel for quite a long time and, in the perpendicular direction, the particles shift slightly, approaching first and then moving away from each other. This result can be considered an effective attraction for same-charged particles. We show that the effective attraction of two electrons and two positrons could be substantially asymmetric.

Longitudinal phase-space diagnostics using a stripline-type beam-timing monitor at the KEKB injector linac	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT												A new beam-timing monitor (BTM) has been developed to analyze the longitudinal beam dynamics and bunching characteristics at the pre-injector of the KEKB injector linear accelerator (linac). The BTM is a conventional stripline-type beam monitor with two pickup electrodes. It measures the relative time delay between the arrival time of the beam signal and 1st-zero-cross time of the fundamental accelerating radio frequency (rf) signal (2856 MHz) immediately after the detection of the beam signal. The beam tests were performed to evaluate the performance and characteristics of the BTM for primary single-bunched electron beams with high bunch charges of similar to 8 nC for positron production. It was found that the results show that the resolution in the delay-time measurement is sigma similar to 1.2 ps in one standard deviation. This report describes the basic design of the BTM system, the beam tests, and results in detail, to investigate the sensitivity and stability of the beam timing based on the longitudinal phase-space parameters at the pre-injector and location A1 of the injector linac, along with the calibration method in the pulse-height variation of the BTM signal.

The basis sets of both types are generated using Ehrenfest trajectories of nuclear coherent states. These trajectories can either serve as a moving (time-dependent) basis or be employed to sample a fixed (time-independent) basis. We demonstrate on the example of two-state two-dimensional and three-state five-dimensional models that both basis set types can yield highly accurate results for population transfer at intersections, as compared with reference quantum dynamics. The details of wave packet evolutions are discussed for the case of the two-dimensional model. The fixed basis is found to be superior to the moving one in reproducing true nonlocal spreading and maintaining correct shape of the wave packet upon time evolution. Moreover, for the models considered, the fixed basis set outperforms the moving one in terms of computational efficiency.

Towards a high efficiency amplifier based on Raman amplification	PLASMA PHYSICS AND CONTROLLED FUSION												Ultra high power laser amplifier systems based on plasma may provide a pathway to reach petawatt to exawatt powers, vastly exceeding the limitations imposed by the currently low damage threshold of solid state optical elements. In theory unfocused intensities of 10(17) W cm(?2) could be reached. The Raman amplification scheme has been demonstrated as a promising candidate through the observation of 10% energy transfer efficiency due to amplification of noise, which implies potentially much larger efficiencies. However, controlled amplification of a seed pulse has not hitherto exceeded an efficiency of 7%. Here we discuss several saturation mechanisms that can limit the gain, such as early pump scattering and thermal effects. We show that chirped pulse Raman amplification can mitigate these deleterious effects.

This equation allows to find asymptotics of the current at long(small) length of the wire, in this paper, we examine the region in which the system becomes strongly interacting and very few pieces of information can be extracted by perturbation theory. Nevertheless, due to the integrability, exact results for the current can be obtained. We observe that at the limit of a long wire, the current becomes exponentially small and we believe that it is the signal that phase slips may destroy superconductivity for long wires, below BKT phase transition.

J	Wang, BH; Hu, YH				Wang, Bohan; Hu, Yuhang			Pressure diffusion wave and shear wave in gels with tunable wave propagation properties	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS												Gels are composed of cross-linked polymer network and solvent. Gels are both ubiquitous in nature and widely applied in engineering applications. In this work, we develop a physics-based dynamic theory to investigate the tunable wave propagation properties of gels. Gels are soft and can generate large deformation. The constitutive relation takes account the coupled large deformation and diffusion of gels. The dynamic governing equations take account the relative motions between the polymer network and solvent, which leads to a pressure diffusion wave similar to the "slow pressure wave" in the classical Biot's poroelastodynamics. It is different from the pressure wave in pure solid or pure liquid. The phase velocity, group velocity and attenuation coefficient are analyzed at different frequencies and propagating directions for both pressure wave and shear wave. We show that the wave propagation properties of gels are not only related to the material properties including the crosslink density and the interaction property between solvent and polymer, but also can be tuned by different mechanical loading conditions and chemical stimuli. It is also predicted that the constrained swollen gel exhibits anisotropic wave propagation properties, which leads to the splitting of the pressure wave and shear wave propagating through it. The theory provides a general frame for fundamental understanding and quantitative characterization of the dynamic behaviors of gels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The technique is based on the experimental gate-to-source or gateto-drain capacitance-voltage (C-GS-V-GS or C-GD-V-GD) characteristics of FETs. As the gate bias (V-G) increases, the effective channel length (L-eff) extends by the increased conductivity of the channel from the source or the drain. Due to trapped charges at the trap sites with a high density of traps along the channel, abrupt change in the C-V characteristics is observed. For the transition gate bias (V-G,V-t) with abrupt change in the C-V characteristics, the dominant trap location (X-t) can be converted through the channel conduction factor (alpha(V-G) to be the effective channel length L-eff(V-G) = alpha(V-G).L-ch). We expect that the proposed C-V technique to be useful in non-destructive electrical characterization of lateral trap locations (interface states, bulk traps, and/or grain boundary traps caused by the bias stress and/or fabrication process) along the channel in FETs. We successfully applied the proposed technique to the p-channel poly-Si thin-film transistors (TFTs) for characterization of the grain boundary locations along the channel. As an example for the proposed technique, we applied the technique to a p-channel poly-Si TFT and obtained a dominant trap at X-GB1 = 3.13 [mu m] from the source and another at X-GB2 = 3.70 [mu m] from the drain.

After extrusion, the intermetallic compound having a needle shape in the cast state was finely decomposed based on the direction of extrusion. Significant changes in the microstructure were detected after annealing at 500 degrees C with fragmentation and sphering of eutectic particles. The annealing temperature of Al-1.0RE alloy increased proportionally to the electrical conductivity. The formation of Al-RE intermetallic compounds increases the electrical conductivity and improves the mechanical properties of the alloy through precipitation hardening.

Moreover, the time evolution characteristics of plasma temperature and electron density were discussed. Within the time delay range of 0?5 ?s, the spectral intensity of the characteristic lines of Si I: 288.158 nm, Ti I: 336.126 nm, Al I: 394.400 nm and Fe I: 438.354 nm of the four main elements in two kinds of national standard soil decayed exponentially with time. The average lifetime of the spectral lines was nearly 1.56 ?s. Under the condition of different time delays, the spectral intensity of Pb I: 405.78 nm in soil increased linearly with laser energy. However, the slope between the spectral intensity and laser energy decreased exponentially with the increase in time delay, from 4.91 to 0.99 during 0?5 ?s. The plasma temperature was calculated by the Boltzmann plot method and the electron density was obtained by inversion of the full width at half maximum of the spectrum. The plasma temperature decreased from 8900 K to 7800 K and the electron density decreased from 1.5?10(17) cm(?3) to 7.8?10(16) cm(?3) in the range of 0?5 ?s.																			1009-0630	2058-6272				JAN	2020	22	1							15502	10.1088/2058-6272/ab4c6a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2058-6272/ab4c6a													WOS:000496471600002

The main advantage is that the proposed model is based on two individual un-correlated noise sources, and easy to be incorporated with commercial circuit simulation software. The model is verified by measurements of the four noise parameters of an InP HBT up to 20 GHz and a GaAs HBT up to 26 GHz. The good agreements have been obtained.

By using a compact quadrupole mass filter system a hyperthermal ion beam is mass filtered. The GaN thin film depositions with varying ion-to-atom arrival ratio and kinetic energies of 40 eV and 80 eV are performed to highlight the distinct impact of the ion species on the early stages of the growth. It is evaluated that precise selection of ion beam parameters enables the preferred growth of either the metastable zinc blende GaN phase or the stable wurtzite GaN phase on 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Further, using molecular nitrogen ion species thin films of high crystalline quality could be deposited even at ion kinetic energies of 80 eV, while films with atomic nitrogen ion assistance feature reduced crystalline quality.

However, the mechanism of the crystallinity improvement in C-60 overlayers remains to be fully elucidated. In this work, the surface (step and terrace structure) of pentacene films is investigated in terms of the terrace width using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to clarify the mechanism. We found that the terrace width becomes wider as the substrate temperature for pentacene film growth increases, and the terrace width becomes narrower as the thickness of pentacene films increases. In addition, we investigate the influence of the terrace width of pentacene underlayers on C-60 overlayers using AFM and X-ray diffraction. We found that pentacene underlayers with wide terraces increase the grain size and improve the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers. These findings indicate that growing pentacene underlayers with wider terraces allows for further enhancement in the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers, leading to higher quality pentacene/C-60 stacked heterostructures.																			0040-6090					DEC 31	2019	692								137638	10.1016/j.tsf.2019.137638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tsf.2019.137638													WOS:000499678700026

Impact of free electron degeneracy on collisional rates in plasmas	PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH												Degenerate plasmas, in which quantum effects dictate the behavior of free electrons, are ubiquitous on earth and throughout space. Transitions between bound and free electron states determine basic plasma properties, yet the effects of degeneracy on these transitions have only been theorized. Here, we use an x-ray free electron laser to create and characterize a degenerate plasma. We observe a core electron fluorescence spectrum that cannot be reproduced by models that ignore free electron degeneracy. We show that degeneracy acts to restrict the available electron energy states, thereby slowing the rate of transitions to and from the continuum. We couple degeneracy and bound electron dynamics in an existing collisional-radiative code, which agrees well with observations. The impact of the shape of the cross section, and hence the magnitude of the correction due to degeneracy, is also discussed. This study shows that degeneracy in plasmas can significantly influence experimental observables such as the emission spectra, and that these effects can be included parametrically in well-established atomic physics codes. This work narrows the gap in understanding between the condensed-matter and plasma phases, which coexist in myriad scenarios.

Behavioral regimes and long-lived emitter states in mesolasers	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS												Emergence of long-lived emitter states is predicted to occur in a mesolaser driven below self-quenching threshold. Distinct behavioral regimes of the emitters are separated by peaks in photon fluctuations (the Fano factor) in a manner analogous to but fundamentally different from the nonequilibrium phase transition analogy in conventional lasers. The parameter space in which long-lived states emerge in mesolasers containing two or more emitters is identified and shown to be controlled by the strength of coupling to external baths.

A method is proposed for the automatic generation of first-principles unconstrained EOSs using a Gaussian process on a set of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, thereby closing the continuum equations with the accuracy determined by the underlying first-principles theory. The method is validated for bulk silicon using density-functional theory (DFT) by comparing planar (one-dimensional) shock waves with experiment, and also with an explicit first-principles molecular dynamics simulation, both in the hyperelastic regime. Its applicability is then illustrated it for two-dimensional shock waves in DFT bulk silicon, following their nonlinear, temperature-dependent, anisotropic dynamics after a cylindrical region is instantaneously heated. The method is applicable to condensed matter systems in other regimes, using well-known continuum techniques and/or molecular dynamics simulations at larger scales.

However, many issues, especially imbalanced carrier injection, have limited their development, so further research is needed. Herein, 4,4 '-cyclohexane-1,1-diylbis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)aniline] (TAPC) with a large bandgap is introduced as a multifunctional hole transport layer (MHTL) for efficient hybrid organic/inorganic WLEDs. Optimized hybrid WLEDs with TAPC are achieved with a peak current efficiency of 20.6 cd A(-1) and a near purity white light with color coordinates of (0.32, 0.33). They exhibit better EL performance than those without TAPC. This proves that an optimized TAPC layer can effectively reduce electron overflow and improve hole injection to acquire much better charge balance in the emitting layers. Such good results will significantly promote the design and fabrication of phosphor-free WLEDs with high performance.

Thermal Conductance of Interleaving Fins	PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED												Interleaving fins can significantly increase heat transfer by increasing the effective area per unit base area. The fins are separated uniformly by a gap, which is filled with a flow medium to control the heat flux. The heat flux between the plates depends strongly on the thermal conductivity of the fin material and the medium between them, as well as the dimensions. In earlier studies, an empirical fitting method has been used to determine the total effectiveness of the fins. However, it required complete characterization of the fins for each new set of operating conditions. In this paper, a simplified analytical model is developed, which still preserves the main physical traits of the problem. This model reveals the dimensionless parameter group containing both the material properties and the fin geometry that govern the heat transfer. Rigorous testing of the model using a numerical finite-element model shows an accuracy within 2% over a large parameter space, varying both dimensions and material properties. Lastly, this model is put to the test with previously measured experimental data and good agreement is obtained.

The measurements of thermal cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C and 24-hour temperature cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C withstanding the effects of 20-hour penetration of 85 degrees C were carried out in CdS/CdTe solar cells with structures of FTO/CdS/CdTe/Au, FTO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, and FTO/MZO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, respectively. The performances of these cells before and after the thermal aging experiments were investigated by using light and dark I-V together with C-V. The results reveal varied performance degradation before and after thermal aging in the cells with different structures. Among these, the most deteriorated device is the one without back contact (BC), whose efficiency decreased by 25.12% after thermal cycling accompanying an obvious roll-over phenomenon when forward bias was greater than open circuit voltage. On the contrary, the reduction in the efficiency was about 16.80% in the case cells with BC, and the roll-over phenomenon was not so significant. Furthermore, for the devices with optimized front contact of FTO/MZO, the thermal stability was improved obviously. Interestingly, short-circuit current density associated with the carrier concentration of cells remained relatively small variations compared with the change of Voc and fill factor. All the results indicated that an efficient back contact layer and an optimized front electrode were the indispensable structural elements to attain high stabilization in the CdS/CdTe solar cells.					li, bing/HTS-1845-2023	Wang, Qiong-Hua/0000-0002-8727-8843													1110-662X	1687-529X				DEC 20	2019	2019								3579587	10.1155/2019/3579587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/3579587													WOS:000522149200002

A new paradigm for the dynamics of the early Universe	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY												This paper invokes a new mechanism for reducing a coupled system of fields (including Einstein?s equations without a cosmological constant) to equations that possess solutions exhibiting characteristics of immediate relevance to current observational astronomy. Our approach is formulated as a classical Einstein-vector-scalar-Maxwell-fluid field theory on a spacetime with three-sphere spatial sections. Analytic cosmological solutions are found using local charts familiar from standard LFRW cosmological models. These solutions can be used to describe different types of evolution for the metric scale factor, the Hubble, jerk and de-acceleration functions, the scalar spacetime curvature and the Kretschmann invariant constructed from the Riemann?Christoffel spacetime curvature tensor. The cosmological sector of the theory accommodates a particular single big-bang scenario followed by an eternal exponential acceleration of the scale factor. Such a solution does not require an externally prescribed fluid equation of state and leads to a number of new predictions including a current value of the ?jerk? parameter, ?Hopfian-like? source-free Maxwell field configurations with magnetic helicity and distributional ?bi-polar? solutions exhibiting a new charge conjugation symmetry. An approximate scheme for field perturbations about this particular cosmology is explored and its consequences for a thermalisation process and a thermal history are derived, leading to a prediction of the time interval between the big-bang and the decoupling era. Finally it is shown that field couplings exist where both vector and scalar localised linearised perturbations exhibit dispersive wave-packet behaviours. The scalar perturbation may also give rise to Yukawa solutions associated with a massive Klein?Gordon particle. It is argued that the vector and scalar fields may offer candidates for ?dark-energy? and ?dark-matter? respectively.

However, polarization may be induced in the surface due to the surface dangling bonds. In this work, using the average local dipole evaluated by maximally localized Wannier functions, we investigated polarization properties of these two surfaces layer-by-layer. It is found that a remarkable polarization which is more than eight times that of the bulk, is induced on these two surfaces. Moreover, we found that the polarization oscillates around the bulk value in the inner surface layers, and quickly approaches to the bulk value at a depth of four layers. Such polarization variation was further analyzed from the viewpoints of atomic rearrangement and charge transfer. Thus (1010)$(10\bar{1}0)$(101 over bar 0) and (1120)$(11\bar{2}0)$(112 over bar 0) surfaces are actually not completely non-polar facets, but rather non-polar bulk core combined with polar surface layers which would potentially affect the surface properties. The present study may provide a deeper understanding of the non-polar AlN surfaces.

We also present a detailed study on its QED background due to psi(2S) feed-down, where the psi(2S) is produced through e(+)e(-) -> psi(2S)+ gamma and e(+)e(-) -> psi(2S) + f (f) over bar (f = lepton, light quark), as well as those due to the QED contribution to the direct J/psi + q (q) over bar production with q = u, d, s quark. We find that the QED background is huge in the whole phase space region; however, it can be largely reduced when a suitable kinematic cut condition on p(J/psi) and theta(J/psi) is implemented, where p(J/psi) is the momentum of J/psi and theta(J/psi) is the angle between J/psi and the e(+)e(-) beam. In the range of pi/9 < theta(J/psi) < 8 pi/9 and P-J/psi > 3 GeV, the cross section of the QED background is of the same order as that of the QCD contribution.

The harmonic emission process is explored by the electron probability density evolution. The research shows that it is the influence on the electron movement imposed by inhomogeneous field that causes the quantum paths to be manipulated. In view of these simulations, only one short quantum path is significantly enhanced but others are suppressed by selecting optimized inhomogeneous factor e and laser pulse duration. Meanwhile, a ultrabroad supercontinuum up to 300 orders harmonic plateau and an isolated 48-as pulse are generated.					liang, ting/JFB-4960-2023														0009-2614	1873-4448				DEC 16	2019	737								136843	10.1016/j.cplett.2019.136843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2019.136843													WOS:000500939400020
J	Morice, C; Kopp, T; Kampf, AP				Morice, Corentin; Kopp, Thilo; Kampf, Arno P.			Nonunique connection between bulk topological invariants and surface physics	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												At the heart of the study of topological insulators lies a fundamental dichotomy: Topological invariants are defined in infinite systems but surface states as their main footprint only exist in finite systems. In the slab geometry, namely, infinite in two planar directions and finite in the perpendicular direction, the 2D topological invariant was shown to display three different types of behavior. The perpendicular Dirac velocity turns out to be a critical control parameter discerning between different qualitative situations. When it is zero, the three types of behavior extrapolate to the three 3D topologically distinct phases: trivial, weak, and strong topological insulators. We show analytically that the boundaries between types of behavior are topological phase transitions of particular significance since they allow us to predict the 3D topological invariants from finite-thickness transitions. When the perpendicular Dirac velocity is not zero, we identify a new phase with surface states but no band inversion at any finite thickness, disentangling these two concepts which are closely linked in 3D. We also show that at zero perpendicular Dirac velocity, the system is gapless in the 3D bulk and therefore not a topological insulating state, even though the slab geometry extrapolates to the 3D topological phases. Finally, in a parameter regime with strong dispersion perpendicular to the surface of the slab, we encounter the unusual case that the slab physics displays nontrivial phases with surface states but nevertheless extrapolates to a 3D trivial state.

J	Pomeau, Y; Tran, MB				Pomeau, Yves; Minh-Binh Tran			Shock waves from the inhomogeneous Boltzmann equation	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												We revisit the problem on the inner structure of shock waves in simple gases modelized by the Boltzmann kinetic equation. In a paper by Pomeau [Y. Pomeau, Transp. Theory Slat. Phys. 16, 727 (1987)], a self-similarity approach was proposed for infinite total cross section resulting from a power-law interaction, but this self-similar form does not have finite energy. Motivated by the work of Pomeau [Y. Pomeau, Transp. Theory Stat. Phys. 16, 727 (1987)] and Bobylev and Cercignani [A. V. Bobylev and C. Cercignani, J. Stat. Phys. 106, 1039 (2002)], we started the research on the rigorous study of the solutions of the spatial homogeneous Boltzmann equation, focusing on those which do not have finite energy. However, infinite energy solutions do not have physical meaning in the present framework of kinetic theory of gases with collisions conserving the total kinetic energy. In the present work, we provide a correction to the self-similar form, so that the solutions are more physically sound in the sense that the energy is no longer infinite and that the perturbation brought by the shock does not grow at large distances of it on the cold side in the soft potential case.																			2470-0045	2470-0053				DEC 16	2019	100	6							062120	10.1103/PhysRevE.100.062120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.062120								31962387					WOS:000502793700006

To suppress beam spread due to multiple scattering and nuclear reactions, we developed a full energy scanning method. In some cases, such as eye treatments, the irradiation fields are very small and short ranged. Accordingly, we prepared a minimum low-energy carbon-ion beam corresponding to water-equivalent residual ranges of less than 2 mm. We performed experimental verification for low-energy carbon-ion beams ranging from 55.6 to 96.0 MeV/u. The accuracy of 3D dose delivery with the low-energy carbon-ion beam was verified by measuring the dose distributions for different target volumes. The results confirmed that the measured dose distributions agree well with the calculated ones. Then, the first eye treatment with low-energy carbon-ion beam to a patient was performed in 2018.

Molar volumes and electron densities were obtained with ab initio methods assuming a hypothetical metallic state. The electronegativity parameter and transformation enthalpy were obtained by linear extrapolation and regression analysis. Negative transformation enthalpies were introduced to obtain reliable values for the formation enthalpy of halides. Formation enthalpies of halides are computed within 25 kJ/mol.at and their molar volumes are underestimated by 20%. The MAM provides better estimates than models using Palling electronegativity or Born-Haber cycle calculations assuming an ionic lattice of the Born-Haber type. The inclusion of the halogens in the MAM scheme has extended its application to both alloys and ionic compounds.

The evolution of the collision cascade as well as the defects generated in the nanotube were studied using molecular dynamics simulation. We found that point defects and stacking faults were induced by the cascade. The interior surface of the nanotube acts as the sinks to absorb the point defects as the same as the exterior surface does, especially when the distance between them is decreased. Consequently, both the two surfaces influence the time evolution and the residual number of point defects in the nanotubes. In the gold nanotubes with fixed external diameter, the number of interstitials is decreased with the internal diameter increasing, while the number of vacancies does not show a clear trend with the variation of the internal diameters. The probability of formation of stacking faults is higher in gold nanotubes with larger internal diameters which caused by the fact that the formation of stacking faults is facilitated by the interior surface. The results show that, due to the specific geometry of the nanotubes, the evolution and the production of the cascade-induced damage has its own features.

Enhancement of ABCs efficiency at computer simulation of optical pulse interaction with inhomogeneous nonlinear medium	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS												We focus our attention on enhancing of computation performance at numerical simulation of a laser pulse interaction with inhomogeneous nonlinear medium (optical periodic structure or photonic crystal) which is described in the framework of 1D Schrodinger equation without using slowly varying envelope in spatial coordinate. It allows taking into account the optical pulse reflection from medium inhomogeneous. In practice, as a rule at computer simulation the domain size before photonic crystal is many times greater than the photonic crystal size. Decreasing this domain one can essentially increase a computation performance. This aim is achieved by re-statement of the problem: instead of initial distribution of complex amplitude along spatial coordinate before the photonic crystal we consider its specifying as a boundary condition (BC), which results in the pulse propagation in both directions of the propagation axis. Taking this into account and that a part of a laser pulse reflects from faces of photonic crystal layers, we use the artificial boundary conditions (ABCs). To avoid an influence of waves propagated in negative direction of spatial coordinate on the laser pulse interaction in photonic crystal (this influence appears due to imperfection of ABC). We introduce in consideration some number of artificial waves related with the equation under consideration. With this aim, firstly, we provide a computation of the laser pulse propagation in a linear medium and storage the complex amplitude values at chosen section of a coordinate, along which a laser light propagates. Then we use this complex amplitude values as a left boundary condition for 1D nonlinear Schrodinger equation in domain containing a nonlinear photonic crystal. To decrease amplitude of the wave reflected from artificial boundaries. We demonstrate also that instead of a complex amplitude values storage one can use the corresponding analytical expression for the linear Schrodinger equation solution, corresponding to a laser pulse propagation in a linear domain before the photonic crystal. We discuss also various ways for full transform of the optical pulse energy for reflected wave into artificial waves. This results essentially increasing of computation efficiency.

Numerical simulation of the hydrodynamics and mass transfer in the capping of large size Z-cut plates	JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH												Numerical simulation of the hydrodynamics and mass transfer involved in the capping of large size Z-cut KDP plates has been performed. The variations of surface supersaturation with thin layer height, bulk supersaturation and rotation rate are analyzed. The results show that keeping still is very unfavorable for the growth of thin layer, a certain rotation rate should be applied to the Z-cut plate to increase the concentration gradient across the (0 0 1) face, thus making sure that thin layers can grow from the edges while small pyramids barely grow from the face center. Given the result that end faces of thin layers nearly bear a bulk supersaturation, a relative low bulk supersaturation will be better to ensure both the growth of thin layers and the good surface uniformity brought by low supersaturation. Moreover, as thin layers grow, rotation rate should be increased to make up the insufficient solute supply resulting from the decreasing linear speed. The optimal parameters for rapid and high-quality capping of large size Z-cut plates are suggested, the relevant simulation results are also presented.

Spatially-homogeneous relaxation problems are used to demonstrate that the FSM conserves mass and momentum/energy to the machine and spectral accuracy, respectively. Based on the variational principle, transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion are calculated by the FSM, which agree well with the analytical solutions. Then, the FSM is applied to find the accurate transport coefficients through an iterative scheme for the linearized quantum Boltzmann equation. The shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of three-dimensional quantum Fermi and Bose gases interacting through hard-sphere potential are calculated. For Fermi gas, the relative difference between the accurate and variational transport coefficients increases with fugacity; for Bose gas, the relative difference in thermal conductivity has similar behavior as the gas moves from the classical to degenerate limits, but the relative difference in shear viscosity decreases when the fugacity increases. Finally, the viscosity and diffusion coefficients are calculated for a two-dimensional equal-mole mixture of Fermi gases. When the molecular masses of the two components are the same, our numerical results agree with the variational solutions. However, when the molecular mass ratio is not one, large discrepancies between the accurate and variational results are observed; our results are reliable because (i) the method does not rely on any assumption on the form of velocity distribution function and (ii) the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy density satisfies the minimum bound predicted by the string theory.

The SEM results showed that the as-prepared composite microspheres with an average diameter of 23.1 mu m exhibited a regular spherical shape and a high dispersity. Their inorganic phases were identified as low-crystallized hydroxyapatite and amorphous SiO2. Moreover, the PVA/SiO2/HA composite microspheres presented an enhanced capacity for both loading and sustained release of vancomycin hydrochloride (VH) as compared to their bi-component equivalents (PVA/SiO2 and PVA/HA composite microspheres), suggesting their good potential to be used as a drug carrier in bone tissue engineering.

This compound consists of two separated phases of major magnetic (non-superconducting) and minor superconducting components. The internal magnetic field of the major magnetic component decreased at the SC2 phase and disappeared around 15 GPa, while that of the minor non-magnetic component maintained its intensity up to 14.9 GPa. Multiple internal magnetic fields were introduced for improved fits to the spectra of the magnetic component at the SC2 phase, suggesting the importance of the electron-electron correlation in the emergence of the SC2 phase.

In this study, with numerical analysis and thermal imaging method, the ablation plume and its effects on energy deposition of IPIB on solid target was studied. Radiation experiments of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) targets with a thickness of 200 gm were carried out on BIPPAB-450 pulsed ion beam accelerator and the energy deposition of the ion beam was investigated with infrared imaging diagnostics. It is revealed that due to the low thermal conductivity and decomposition temperature of PVC, ablation plume can be formed during the early stage of beam irradiation and the ablation product may shield the energy of the ion beam from depositing in the target when energy density reaches a certain threshold. This effect needs to be taken into consideration in order to avoid its influence on applications and beam diagnostics.

A signal photon is generated by a trigger photon and coherence among parahydrogen, which is prepared by two counterpropagating pump pulses, and we investigate the dependence of the signal pulse energy on the trigger frequency. The measured spectra depend on the geometry, shifting depending on the direction of the signal pulse and on the small angle formed by the counterpropagating pump pulses. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of signal pulse energy on the incident time of the trigger pulse. The measured signal pulse energy is high if the trigger pulse is delayed slightly with respect to the pump pulses. We demonstrate that these geometry-dependent spectra and coherent-transient response can be explained by using simple models.

Reaction rates for alpha-induced reactions are calculated with the semi-microscopic optical potential constructed using double folding method, where nuclear density distributions for finite nuclei along with the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction are the important components of the folded potential. For this purpose, density distributions of target nuclei are obtained from relativistic mean field approach. Astrophysical reaction cross-section for elastic scattering of alpha-particle from Mo-92 target is compared with the existing experimental results to constrain the newly formed potential. Further, to check the credibility of the present theoretical framework, the astrophysical S-factor for (alpha, gamma) reactions are compared with the experimental observation, wherever available.

CP-Violation phase analysis via nontrivial correlation of quarks and leptons in 3+1 scenario	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A												The existence and mysterious nature of sterile neutrinos are revolutionizing physics from the particle level to the cosmological scales. The recent results from the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermi-lab observed far more v e appearance than expected, which have provided a hint about the possible existence of sterile neutrinos. The results, if confirmed in future experiments, will have significant implications for cosmology and astroparticle physics. This will require new neutrino mass models to accommodate these additional degrees of freedom. In respect to that, this work is just an extension of our recent work toward the CP phase analysis of Quark-Lepton Complementarity (QLC) model in a 3+1 scenario. The parametrization of CKM4 and PMNS4 using Monte Carlo Simulation is used to estimate the texture of nontrivial correlation matrix (V-c4). As such, we have successfully investigated the constrained values for sterile neutrino parameters, and also predicted the values for Dirac CP-Violation phase and the CP re-phasing invariant (J). The results obtained are consistent with the data available from various experiments, like NovA, MINOS, SuperK and IceCube-DeepCore. Furthermore, this analysis would be very important in view of growing sterile neutrino experiments.

This type of product, however, can suffer from syneresis: densification due to the expulsion of fluid. Gaining insight into the physical principles governing syneresis in such soft hybrid dispersions remains a challenge from a theoretical perspective, as experimental data are needed to establish a basis. We record non-accelerated syneresis in a model system for low-fat mayonnaise: a colloid polymer mixture, consisting of oil in water emulsion with starch in the aqueous phase. We find the flow rate of expelled fluid to be proportional to the difference in hydrostatic pressure over the system. The osmotic pressure of the added starch, while being higher than the hydrostatic pressure, does not prevent syneresis because the soluble starch is lost to the expelled fluid. From these findings, we conclude that forced syneresis in these systems can be described as a gravity-driven porous flow through the densely packed emulsion, explainable with a model based on Darcy's law.

However, the Li2S full cell suffers from rapid capacity degradation due to the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. Herein, a Li2S/Si full cell is designed with a Li2S cathode incorporated by titanium nitride (TiN) polysulfide immobilizer within parallel hollow carbon (PHC). This full cell delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(Li2S)(-1) (1007 mAh g(sulfur)(-1)) at 0.5 C rate and excellent cyclability with only 0.4% capacity fade per cycle over 200 cycles. The long cycle stability is ascribed to the strong polysulfide anchor effect of TiN and highly efficient electron/ion transport within the interconnected weblike architecture of PHC. Theoretical calculations, self-discharge measurements, and anode stability experiments further confirm the strong adsorption of polysulfides on the TiN surface. The present work demonstrates that the flexible Li2S cathode and paired Si anode can be used to achieve highly efficient Li-S full cells.

For an initial state with equal probability densities in both the wells, stabilized localization atop the barrier can be achieved on a periodic high-frequency driving. The barrier localization is characterized using Shannon information entropies in position and momentum spaces, defined as S-rho = - integral |psi|(2) ln |psi|(2) dx and S-gamma = - integral |phi|(2) ln |phi|(2) dp, where psi and phi refer to position and momentum space wave functions, respectively. The information entropy sum, S-rho + S-gamma, goes through a minimum indicating the formation of the barrier-localized state, when the peak intensity of the oscillating field is reached. The generalized uncertainty via the Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski inequality (S-rho + S-gamma >= 1 + ln pi) is saturated upon this minimization. This serves as a signature of the formation of the barrier-atop localized state, in terms of Shannon entropies of measurable densities.

Controlling spontaneous emission via electronic correlations and temperature in transparent oxides	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We study spontaneous emission of two-level quantum emitter agglomerates embedded in transparent oxides. The two levels correspond to the splitting between vacancy impurity states F, F+, and V- color centers, whereas correlations are due to narrow bands in transition-metal oxides with ABO(3) perovskite structures. For these systems, we put forward a mechanism to control light emission in which micrometer-size vacancy-rich regions play the role of cavity resonators for the emitted radiation with normal frequencies mode volumes, and emission linewidths determined by their size and material properties. We argue that a physical scenario in which the emitter's natural frequency and linewidth can be fine-tuned via electronic correlations or temperature explains unusual features in the experimental photoluminescence spectra of Ar-irradiated SrTiO3. By unveiling the role of electronic correlations on spontaneous emission in transparent oxides, we hope our findings help set the basis for the design of controllable engineered solid-state single-photon sources.

Neither abnormal behaviour of the hyperfine parameters at or near T-c nor phonon softening were found. A comparison of Fe-57 Mossbauer data of Ni- and Co-based superconductors with those of Th7Fe3 indicated that with decreasing 3d-electron numbers across the series Th7Ni2.5 Fe-57(0.5) -> Th7Co2.5 Fe-57(0.5) -> Th7Fe3, the s-electron density around the Fe nucleus and as well as the electric field gradient strength increases.

Evidence for a dynamics crossover and its implication on the freezing temperature determination of relaxor ferroelectrics	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS												Relaxor ferroelectrics are characterized by a broadened and dispersive permittivity peak in their temperature-dependent dielectric spectra. Although several models have been proposed to explain the nature of these materials, understanding their relaxation dynamics still remains open and requires additional theoretical and experimental explanations. Particularly, a precise determination of the freezing temperature still remains controversial because the influence of dynamic ruptures at temperatures approaching the freezing states (dynamic crossovers) has never evaluated before. In this paper, a model-free approach for describing the super-Arrhenius behaviour in glassy systems is validated for relaxor ferroelectrics. As a result, a predicted dynamic change at a specific temperature (crossover temperature) is evidenced by a derivative-based representation of the relaxation time data. The Stickel function is suggested as a more straightforward but model-dependent method for obtaining the dynamic crossover temperature. Furthermore, the divergence (freezing) temperature is obtained on the basis of the Gruneisen-style activation energy temperature index without assuming any model equation for parameterizing the relaxation data. The influence of the dynamic change occurrences on the freezing temperature determination is also considered, showing that the dynamic crossover temperature determination is a key factor for a proper finding of the freezing temperature in relaxor ferroelectrics.

Even though the radiation field does not lift the energy degeneracy of the lowest Landau levels (LLs), it nevertheless has a strong effect on the photoinduced pseudospin polarization response for higher LLs (n >= 2). Our results show that the photoinduced bandgaps lead to a finite response of the averaged pseudospin polarization with nontrivial oscillating behavior. It is shown that the contribution from these higher LL transitions turns out to be crucial to achieve an enhanced photoinduced polarization in radiated bilayer graphene. The experimental feasibility of our findings is also discussed.					; Mireles, Francisco/IXX-3121-2023	Berche, Bertrand/0000-0002-4254-807X; Mireles, Francisco/0000-0003-0506-0793													0953-8984	1361-648X				DEC 11	2019	31	49							495703	10.1088/1361-648X/ab3c3c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/ab3c3c								31422949					WOS:000485723900001

Dielectric properties of liquid crystals from the thioester series with a terminal polar group*	PHASE TRANSITIONS												This paper presents the results of our studies of the phase transition behaviour and dielectric properties of three compounds from two series of thiobenzoates characterised by the presence of polar terminal groups. In two of the compounds (5OSCl and 6OSCl), the polar terminal substituent is -Cl, whereas the third compound (11OSNO(2)) has a terminal nitro group. The compound 5OSCl has an enantiotropic nematic phase N and monotropic smectic A phase and 6OSCl is characterised by the existence of two enantiotropic phases, the N and smectic A phases. The compound 11OSNO(2) only exhibits an enantiotropic SmA phase. The permanent dipole moments of the studied molecules are located parallel to their long axes, which promotes the formation of SmA phase variants. The results of dielectric permittivity dispersion and absorption and spontaneous polarisation measurements allowed the SmA phase to be identified in the compounds we investigated.

J	Pantoja, N				Pantoja, Nelson			Self-gravitating <i>SU</i>(5) Higgs domain walls as a braneworld	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												Five-dimensional domain walls in gauged SU(5) generate a position-dependent symmetry breaking pattern along the additional dimension. We analyze the perturbative stability and the four-dimensional (4D) spectrum of these walls in the self-gravitating case, in terms of diffeomorphism-invariant and Lie algebra gauge-invariant field fluctuations. We show that tachyonic modes are absent, ensuring perturbative stability. As expected, gravitational tensor and vector fluctuations behave like their counterparts in the standard Z(2) domain walls. All the Lie algebra valued fluctuations exhibit towers of 4D massive modes, which propagate in the bulk, with a continuous spectrum starting from zero. All the would-be 4D Nambu-Goldstone fields, which are gravitationally trapped in the case of a global symmetry, are nontrivially absent. However, we fmd no localizable 4D gauge bosons, either massless or massive. Instead, quasilocalizable discrete 4D massive modes for the gauge field fluctuations are found, along the spontaneously broken directions.

For the four-zero textures, the effective low energy Majorana mass matrix is parametrized with seven parameters. They are three mass-dimensional parameters, two angles and two CP violating sources. The number of these parameters is less than that of the general description of the Majorana mass matrix with three neutrino masses, three mixing angles and three CP violating phases. In particular, only two independent CP violating sources give rise to three CP violating phases. The efficient and comprehensive method is proposed in this paper to investigate four-zero textures in Type-I seesaw. We numerically show the possible range of CP violating phases in the plane of a Dirac CP violating phase and one of Majorana phases. Some cases show the strong correlations among two phases. These correlations can be explained by hidden relations among the elements of Majorana matrix with the fourzero textures. The hidden relations are classified according to the position of one vanishing off-diagonal element of Majorana mass matrix. The Majorana mass matrix all of whose elements are non-vanishing also produces other hidden relations particularly in the case of four-zero textures. By applying the hidden relations, we describe the concrete correlations among CP violating phases. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Investigation of the energy of wave motions in a three-layer hydrodynamic system	WAVES IN RANDOM AND COMPLEX MEDIA												In this paper, the propagation of the energy of internal waves in a three-layer hydrodynamic liquid system 'a layer with a solid bottom-a layer-a layer with a lid' is investigated. The problem statement is executed in a dimensionless form. Using the method of multidimensional development, the first three linear problems were obtained. For the first approximation problem, a dispersion equation of the first order is derived, and two pairs of independent solutions are obtained. The dependence of total energy on the wave number and thickness at different values of physical parameters were graphically illustrated and analyzed. The limiting case in which the obtained results are compared with the calculation of the energy that transferring the wave in the hydrodynamic system 'liquid layer-a layer with a lid', which was investigated earlier is considered. Graphically illustrates the transition of this system to a two-layer one. Data obtained as a result of the study of the problem of propagation of internal wave energy in a liquid three-layer hydrodynamic system can be used in the study of similar areas in the ocean and in the development of appropriate technologies and devices using the energy of water waves or converted into electricity.

Model reduction of rigid-body molecular dynamics via generalized multipole potentials	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												Motivated by the challenges of uncertainty quantification for coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics, we investigate the role of perturbation theory in model reduction of classical systems. In particular, we consider the task of coarse-graining rigid bodies in the context of generalized multipole potentials that have controllable levels of accuracy relative to their atomistic counterparts. We show how the multipole framework yields a hierarchy of models that systematically connects a CG "point molecule" approximation to the exact dynamics. We use these results to understand when and how the CG models fail to describe atomistic dynamics at the trajectory level and develop asymptotic error estimates for approximate molecular potential energies. Implications for other model-reduction strategies are also discussed. Key findings of this work are that (i) omitting rotational energy introduces significant error when coarse-graining and (ii) attention to symmetry can improve accuracy of "point-molecule" approximations. Analytical derivations and numerical results support these conclusions. Relevance to nonrigid bodies is also discussed.					; McFadden, Geoffrey/A-7920-2008	Dienstfrey, Andrew/0000-0002-5461-8741; McFadden, Geoffrey/0000-0001-6723-2103													2470-0045	2470-0053				DEC 10	2019	100	6							063302	10.1103/PhysRevE.100.063302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.063302								31962507					WOS:000501808200004

Grassmannian and flag sigma models on interval: phase structure and L-dependence	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS												We discuss the two-dimensional Grassmannian SU(N)/S(U(N - 2) x U(2)) and the flag SU(N)/S (U(N - 2) x U(1) x U(1)) sigma models on a finite interval and construct analytical solutions of gap equations in the large-N limit. We show that the flag model admits a homogeneous solution for "mixed" Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) boundary conditions only for sufficiently large length L and undergoes a phase transition from the phase of partly broken gauge symmetry U(1) to the symmetric phase U(1) x U(1) for large L. On the other hand, the Grassmannian model has a detached phase with one massive and one massless non-zero condensates that completely break U(2) gauge symmetry. This phase lives on a region of L bounded from above and has to use the Robin boundary conditions. We also examine the L-dependence of the total energy and detect the linear growth inherent to confining string in all phases.

Here, we report on the configuration of horizontally aligned ZnO-nanowires-based metallic cavity ensemble with a light to dark current ratio of similar to 1000. An enhanced polarization photodetection ratio of transverse electric (TE) to transverse magnetic (TM) was experimentally observed compared to the single ZnO nanowire photodetector. Finite difference time domain simulation was performed on the metallic cavities, showing the distinct resonance behaviors under TE and TM light. The confinement by the multi-reflection and optical resonances between the metallic claddings contribute to the high anisotropy ratio. Furthermore, the polarized light absorption in the metallic cavity was studied as well as in the naked nanowire, which reveal a significant dependence on the cavity diameter and wavelength. For the metallic cavities, the absorption ratio of TE to TM show an enhanced value in the range of 300-500 nm wavelength and 85-150 diameter and a reversed value in the range of 400-500 nm wavelength and 17-50 diameter. While for the naked nanowires, the ratio show an apparently opposite value in these two regions. The presented metallic cavities demonstrate a specific paradigm of optical engineering in nanoscale and potentially helps the development of optoelectronic devices.

J	Deng, WT; Zhao, G; Xia, HJ; Zhang, M; Yang, YF				Deng Wan-Tao; Zhao Gang; Xia Hui-Jun; Zhang Mao; Yang Yi-Fan			Method of correcting tilt aberration for array laser of incoherent combination	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												The beam quality of array lasers which propagate in atmosphere will degrade in far-field. Therefore, the ultimate efficiency of combined lasers will be affected if no compensation measure is taken in some typical systems such as high energy system. Based on the model of array lasers with incoherent combination, laser propagation in atmosphere is simulated by generating a random atmospheric turbulence phase screen to modulate the phase of the laser beam. The distorted wavefront of atmospheric turbulence is divided according to the array distribution. The phase generated by tilt aberration coefficient which is solved by the method of fitting sub-wavefront data is eliminated in the phase of sub-beam, which simulates the process of correcting tilt aberration. The simulation results show that comparing with the case of tilt aberration, the power in the bucket (PIB) and the Strehl rate (SR) of combined lasers focusing in far-field are improved when the tilt aberration influenced by the same atmospheric turbulence phase screen is corrected. At the same time, coherence length ranging from 4 cm to 45 cm is used to characterize atmospheric turbulence of different intensities. At each coherent length, the PIB and SR are calculated when the distances of propagation of lasers are 2 km and 3 km, separately. The simulation results show that although PIB and SR before and after tilt aberration are corrected, they become worse with the decrease of coherence length, and PIB and SR are improved more obviously when tilt aberration is corrected in stronger turbulence. An experiment in the case of 2 km is carried out by using a prototype of incoherent combination, and the data are obtained by measuring the focused spot at the target. The measurement results confirm that the correcting of tilt aberration can improve the beam quality of array lasers with incoherent combination in far-field. In summary, the research conducted in this work can obtain tilt aberration accurately and the corresponding method of correction is easy to implement, which can provide supporting data for improving the performances high energy laser systems.

We take advantage of the Grassmannian representation of the dimer model, first to calculate the probability distribution of the number of nontrivial loops around a cylinder, which is consistent with the previously known result, and then to calculate the expectation value of the number of loops surrounding two faces and the left-passage probability, both in the discrete and the continuum cases. We also briefly explain the calculation of some related observables. As a by-product, we obtain the partition function of the dimer model in the presence of two and four monomers, and a single monomer on the boundary.

The results show that the reaction can be easily carried out under the catalysis of transition metal oxides. The transition barriers and the reaction rate constant all show oscillation modes that are consistent with the increase of atomic number at 298 K. while the calculated reaction energies (Er/kcal mol-(1)) are gradually increased. The oxidised dioxide can be treated to form metal and oxygen that can still be used as a catalyst for methane oxidation; the resulting oxygen can continue to be used as an oxidant. We also calculated the rate constant of methane oxidation reaction to give the resulting methanol pathway. The calculated dynamic characterisation shows that the rate constant has a positive temperature dependence. Our calculation show that this reaction is exothermic reaction via the RuO/RhO/PdO catalyst, and the reaction is thermodynamically feasible. This study also provides theoretical reference data for us to identify new catalysts for the catalytic oxidation of methane.

We prescribe a method based on a real space renormalization group method, that unravels a subtle correlation between the positions of the side coupled atoms and the energy eigenvalues for which the incoming particle finally gets trapped. We discuss how, in such conditions, the periodic backbone gets transformed into an array of infinite quantum wells in the thermodynamic limit. We present a case here, where the wells have a hierarchically distribution of widths, hosting standing wave solutions in the thermodynamic limit. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Observation of flux qubit states with the help of a superconducting differential double contour interferometer	PHYSICS LETTERS A												The critical current of a new structure, the superconducting differential double contour interferometer (DDCI), investigated recently, depends on the parity of the sum of quantum numbers of the two superconducting loops connected in two points by two Josephson junctions. The theory confirms that the DDCI structure can be used for the ideal readout of quantum states of the flux qubit. Large jumps in the critical current and voltage enables to observe continuously the change in time the state of the flux qubit. Such observations can have fundamental importance for the investigation of macroscopic quantum systems with strongly discrete spectrum such as the flux qubit.

Here, the annihilation process of the 30 degrees Shockley partial dislocation pairs in CdTe is studied by first-principles calculations. We found that the dislocations can glide relatively easily due to the weak local bonding. Our systematic study of the slipping mechanism of the dislocations suggests that the energy barrier for the annihilation process is low. Band structure calculations reveal that the band bending caused by the charge transfer between the two dislocation cores depends on the core-core distance. A simple linear model is proposed to describe the mechanism of formation of the dislocation pair. More importantly, we demonstrate that hole injection can affect the core structure, increase the mobility, and eventually trigger a spontaneous mutual annihilation, which could be employed as a possible facile way to reduce the dislocation density.

J	Yamashita, K; Hanasaki, K; Ando, A; Kinoshita, T				Yamashita, Kazuya; Hanasaki, Kouhei; Ando, Akihiro; Kinoshita, Toshiya			Phase coherence of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical antidot lattice	PHYSICAL REVIEW A												We report on the experimental investigation of the phase coherence of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical antidot lattice (ADL). In the ADL, a series of potential hills are arranged on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice and crisscrossing channels with zero ac Stark shift form a 2D mesh with multiple junctions. Due to these structural features, matter wave interference released from the ADL is clearly visible even at antidot heights of the 300 times the photon recoil energy. However, phase coherence is significantly reduced at extremely tall antidot heights and atom hopping is suppressed. We explain this loss of coherence by introducing a periodic effective potential felt by the atoms on the mesh lines, which is the result of the quantization of the faster atomic motion in the orthogonal direction. This effective potential localizes atoms at the junctions, forming a bundle of tubelike gases. Using the Bose-Hubbard model, we interpret the coherence properties in terms of a 2D Josephson junction array. We have also observed the emergence of vortexlike holes after merging the tubelike gases. We discuss the effect of transverse thermal phase fluctuations and interpret the appearance of the vortexlike holes as a possible signature of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless crossover in the 2D lattice plane.

The effects of different composite ratios on the phase structure and electrochemical properties of LiFePO4/C-Li4Ti5O12 composite cathode materials were investigated. The results showed that the structure of LiFePO4/C and Li4Ti5O12 in the composite prepared by the simple blending method did not change. XRD shows only the characteristic peaks of these two substances and no characteristic peaks of other crystal impurities. When the recombination ratio was 8:2 (LPF-8), the obtained composite material had fine particles and uniform size. The initial discharge capacity at 0.1C rate is 151.56 mAh g(-1) at the voltage of 1.0-4.2 V. After 100 cycles, the capacity retention rate was 97.3% which exhibited more outstanding electrochemical performance than samples with other composite ratios.

Size Distribution of Emission Vortex Rings in Turbulence Induced by Vibrating Wire in Superfluid <SUP>4</SUP>He	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS												We report the spontaneous emission of vortex rings from turbulence induced by a vibrating wire in superfluid He-4, and investigate the statistical behavior of quantum turbulence. Using a set of vibrating wires as a turbulence generator and vortex detectors, we measured the distribution of times of flights between the generator and the detectors for emission directions parallel and perpendicular to the vibration direction of the generator wire. We find that the times exhibit a single exponential distribution for emissions in both directions, indicating temporally random emission of vortex rings with a single mean emission rate. When a limit is set on the detection diameter of the vortex rings, the detection times exhibit a double exponential distribution for the perpendicular direction for ring diameters above 10 mu m, suggesting that large vortex rings reach the detector with a high rate emission at later times. In the parallel emission direction, the emission rate during an equilibrium state exhibits a power law behavior with a minimum diameter of detected vortex rings, implying that a vortex tangle generated by an oscillating object has a self-similar structure of vortex lines.

When the high power laser is injected into silver spherical hohlraum, the high temperature radiation source formed in the hohlraum can drive the high velocity blast wave in the laboratory to study various astrophysical phenomena such as supernova remnants, stellar jets, etc. As the basis of laser driven blast wave experiments, the first experimental results of energy coupling and partitioning of silver spherical hohlraum with one laser entrance hole (LEH) on Shenguang III prototype laser facility are introduced in this work. Four beams with 3.2 kJ of laser energy in a 1ns square laser pulse from the upper hemisphere are used to heat the silver spherical hohlraum targets. The silver spherical hohlraum targets are 800 mu m-diameter and 650 mu m-diameter LEH, and are fabricated by electroforming silver onto an acrylic mandrel. The laser coupling and partitioning to the targets are investigated by using the optical and X-ray diagnostics. The experimental results show that the radiation temperature is beyond 240 eV, the laser-to-X-ray conversion efficiency of silver hohlraum is 0.68 and the silver albedo is 0.83. With the driving of the high temperature radiation source, most of laser energy is coupled to the residual shell, and the high velocity blast wave can be generated. The laser energy not coupled to the target is lost through scattering light, emitting hot electrons and radiating X-rays. The experimental results show that the fraction of energy lost due to the scattering light is 15%, that due to emitting the total hot electrons is less than 1%, almost 30% of the laser energy is lost from the LEH by radiating the X-ray flux, almost 9% of the laser energy leaks from the spherical shell consisting of the 5.6 mu m-thick Ag layer and 10 mu m-thick CH layer through the X-ray radiation flux, and 45% of the laser energy is converted into the kinetic energy and internal energy of the remaining spherical shell. Therefore, more than 50% of the laser energy will be used to drive the high velocity blast wave in the subsequent experiments. After 950 ps, the silver plasma is concentrated in the center of the silver spherical hohlraum, which does not affect the injection of 1ns laser. The experiment on energy coupling and partitioning of a spherical silver hohlraum laser is carried out for the first time on Shenguang III prototype laser facility, which lays a foundation for the subsequent experiments on laser driven blast wave.					pu, yu/KFQ-4809-2024; yu, bo/HMP-0594-2023; Zhang, Wen-Hai/D-4987-2016; Li, Jicheng/HLH-8596-2023														1000-3290					DEC 5	2019	68	23							235201	10.7498/aps.68.20191026	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20191026													WOS:000501344000023

In addition, the electron effective masses of investigated MgxZn1-xO structures are calculated.

Magic Angle Spinning and Truncated Field Concept in NMR	CONCEPTS IN MAGNETIC RESONANCE PART A												In order to thoroughly comprehend and adequtely interpret NMR data, it is necessary to perceive the complex structure of spin Hamiltonian. Although NMR principles have been extensively discussed in a number of distinguished introductory publications, it still remains difficult to find illustrative graphical models revealing the tensorial nature of spin interaction. Exposure of the structure standing behind mathematical formulas can clarify intangible concepts and provide a coherent image of basic phenomena. This approach is essential when it comes to hard to manage, time-dependent processes such as Magic Angle Spinning (MAS), where the anisotropic character of the spin system interactions couple with experimentally introduced time evolution processes.

Two-Dimensional Non-abelian <i>BF</i> Theory in Lorenz Gauge as a Solvable Logarithmic TCFT	COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS												We study two-dimensional non-abelian BF theory in Lorenz gauge and prove that it is a topological conformal field theory. This opens the possibility to compute topological string amplitudes (Gromov-Witten invariants). We found that the theory is exactly solvable in the sense that all correlators are given by finite-dimensional convergent integrals. Surprisingly, this theory turns out to be logarithmic in the sense that there are correlators given by polylogarithms and powers of logarithms. Furthermore, we found fields with "logarithmic conformal dimension" (elements of a Jordan cell for L0). We also found certain vertex operators with anomalous dimensions that depend on the non-abelian coupling constant. The shift of dimension of composite fields may be understood as arising from the dependence of subtracted singular terms on local coordinates. This generalizes the well-known explanation of anomalous dimensions of vertex operators in the free scalar field theory.

Specifically, the etch process of ultra-narrow via is one of the most intricate technical challenges. The critical dimension (CD) of ultra-narrow via is sensitively affected by this process. In this paper, a Design of Experiment (DOE) was presented to develop an optimized etch process. Various statistical correlations between factors and measured results were analyzed by statistical software. Tail phenomenon and cliff effect were explicated by wafer level analysis. A process regression model was employed for process window check and process optimization. Based on data analysis, modeling, and supplementary experiments, the ratio of CxFy to CxHyFz during the etching of anti-reflective coating (ARC) was identified as the most significant factor for the etch process of ultra-narrow via.

Dependences of Mechanical Properties of Ceramics with Bimodal Pore Size Distribution on the Porosity at Various Scale Levels	RUSSIAN PHYSICS JOURNAL												Peculiarities in the dependences of the elastic and strength properties of ceramics with a hierarchically organized pore structure on the porosity are revealed. To exclude the influence of other microstructural factors, such as, for example, grain size, the study was carried out on the basis of multilevel computer modeling using movable cellular automata and a probabilistic approach. A special computer model of the mechanical behavior of porous ceramics with a bimodal pore size distribution has been developed. At the lower level of the model, small isolated pores are explicitly taken into account and series of calculations are carried out for the representative samples with individual pore arrangement in space. The values of the elastic and strength characteristics of these samples obtained as a result of Weibull analysis serve as effective properties of the porous material matrix at the mesoscale. At the mesoscale, large pores of both equiaxial and elongated shapes are considered explicitly. At the macrolevel, the heterogeneity of the material is described implicitly by setting to the automata the unique elastic and strength properties obtained from the Weibull analysis of the calculation results obtained at the mesoscale.

J	Stysch, J; Roser, F; Dast, D; Cartarius, H; Wunner, G				Stysch, Jonathan; Roser, Felix; Dast, Dennis; Cartarius, Holger; Wunner, Guenter			Purity oscillations in coupled Bose-Einstein condensates	PHYSICAL REVIEW A												Distinct oscillations of the purity of the single-particle density matrix for many-body open quantum systems have been shown to exist [D. Dast, D. Haag, H. Cartarius, and G. Wunner, Phys. Rey. A 93, 033617 (2016)]. They are found in PT-symmetric Bose-Einstein condensates, in which the coherence of the condensate drops and is almost completely restored periodically. For this effect the presence of a gain and loss of particles turned out to be essential. We demonstrate that it can also be found in closed quantum systems whose subsystems experience a gain and loss of particles. This is shown with two different lattice setups for cold atoms, viz., a ring of six lattice sites with periodic boundary conditions and a linear chain of four lattice wells. In both cases pronounced purity oscillations are found, and it is shown that they can be made experimentally accessible via the average contrast in interference experiments. This shows that it is possible to identify this characteristic effect in closed quantum systems which have been proposed to realize PT-symmetric quantum mechanics via separation into subsystems.

In this paper, a new gradient calcination process through four-step temperature gradients is applied to synthesize LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material synthesized by gradient calcination shows more excellent electrochemical performance than traditional method. The XRD results indicate that the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material produced by four-step calcination shows lower cation mixing degree and better crystallinity. In addition, the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode produced by gradient calcination presents the highest initial capacity (177.9 mAh g(-1)) and a retention of 82.07% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. And the material shows the best electrochemical properties when the final temperature in these steps is 820 degrees C. Our results explain the reason why the thermal stability and electrochemical performance could be improved by gradient calcination from the aspect of material crystallinity, crystal defects, cation mixing degree and the completeness of the layered structure.

Aspects of the Formation of Tin Oxide under Annealing of Nanopowders Obtained by Pulsed Laser Ablation of Metallic Tin in Aqueous Media	RUSSIAN PHYSICS JOURNAL												Nanocolloids, obtained by pulsed laser ablation (Nd:YAG laser, 1064 nm, 7 ns, 150 mJ) of metallic Sn in distilled water and also in solutions of hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid, were dried and subjected to heat treatment at different temperatures up to 800 degrees C. It has been shown that addition of H2O2 or HNO3 has an effect not only on the size characteristics and structure of the initial nanoparticles, but also on the process of formation and the final characteristics of SnO2 under annealing. By the method of powder x-ray diffraction it was established that in the case of pulsed laser ablation in water and in a solution of nitric acid, the initial particles contain the phase SnO, but for annealed sample obtained by ablation in HNO3, an intermediate orthorhombic phase of SnO2 is formed. Additional studies using Raman spectroscopy and thermal analysis made it possible to determine the presence of tin hydroxide in the initial samples and formation of intermediate forms of its oxides, SnOx, upon annealing.

Parametrisation of the optimised effective potential method based on the Coulson-Fischer wave function for excited states	MOLECULAR PHYSICS												This article further develops the Coulson-Fischer formalism in conjunction with the optimised effective potential method [V.N. Glushkov and S. Wilson, Molec. Phys. 110, 149 (2012)] to incorporate both exchange and static correlation effects for excited states having the same symmetry as the ground state. By using this formalism, we compute complete potential energy curves for the ground and first excited states of the molecule and the isoelectronic heteronuclear ion. Effective potentials are generated in according to a novel density functional theory [A.K. Theophilou, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 074104 (2018)] in which the Kohn-Sham (KS) like potential has spherical symmetry around each nucleus. In this way, the inconsistencies of standard density functional theory concerning the asymmetry of the KS potential are remedied. In our implementation, an effective potential which satisfies this requirement is expressed as a direct mapping of the external potential. Different approximations for the effective potentials are investigated. It is shown that applications of the proposed formalism support good agreement with the exact Coulson-Fischer theory for both the ground and first excited state potential energy curves and thus a qualitatively correct description of dissociation.

Uncertainty Relations for the Entanglement Between a Qubit and a Qutrit	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS												We consider a qubit-qutrit system interacting each other through an isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian in a uniform magnetic field. An expression for the entanglement between the two parties as a function of both the anisotropy factor and the expansion coefficients is found. It is also calculated the uncertainty in the concurrence C (measured as the standard deviation) as a function of the anisotropy factor. We make a strictly mathematical assumption that there exists a canonical conjugate variable (called p) to the concurrence C. Furthermore, we assume that such two variables satisfy (Robertson, Phys. Rev. 34, 163 1929) uncertainty relation of the form (A) 2( B)2 > | 12 .|[ A, B]|. |2. From such an inequality we impose bounds for the uncertainty of p for several values of the anisotropy factor. The above may help to open a novel vision about the properties of the concurrence between a qubit and a qutrit.

Influence of Horizontal Ionosphere Nonuniformity on the Spatial Distribution of Ultralow-Frequency Magnetic Fields from Ground-Based Sources	RADIOPHYSICS AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS												A significant difference was found in the amplitude and polarization spectra of ULF magnetic noise at stations with a base of 120 km during periods of absence of regional thunderstorm activity. A simultaneous analysis of low-frequency data and ionosonde data allowed us to conclude that the difference in the main parameters of the polarization spectrum at two stations is due to the appearance of sporadic E-s layers having a nonuniform horizontal intensity distribution with characteristic scales of the order of the base between stations. A difference in the depth of variations in the polarization parameter epsilon was also found during the ionosphere recovery after magnetic storms. It could be related with Es layers, which had not only a nonuniform intensity distribution, but were also located at different altitudes. A difference was found in the frequency scales of the spectral resonance structure during recording of time variations of its fundamental frequencies. Numerical calculations of the parameter epsilon with specifying model E-s layers and electron-density profiles corrected at the altitudes of the ionospheric F layer adequately explained the observed difference in the magnetic noise spectra and allowed us to determine the altitudes at which the horizontal ionospheric irregularity existed. The studies were carried out on the basis of records of horizontal magnetic components at Radiophysical Research Institute midlatitude observatories Novaya Zhizn (56 degrees N, 45.74 degrees E) and Staraya Pustyn (55.66 degrees N, 43.63 degrees E, 120 km east of the first reception point).

The target space is argued to be two dimensional and flat, and its orthogonal directions are physically interpreted. All terms in the map equation have a geometrical meaning in the target space, and the pullback of its rotational Killing 1-form allows the construction of a velocity field in configuration space. Identification of this velocity field with tangent vectors in the source space leads to the dynamical law of motion. For a specific choice of an arbitrary scalar function present in the map equation, and using Cartesian coordinates in the target space, the map equation becomes linear and can be reduced to the Schrodinger equation. We link the bidimensionality of the target space with the essential nonlocality of quantum mechanics. Many extensions of the framework presented here are immediate, with deep consequences yet to be explored.

Effect of Projectile Charge State on Electron Emission Spectra from He Atom	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS												The single ionization of He atom by the impact of highly charged dressed projectile nucleus is investigated by applying the three-body formalism of three-Coulomb wave (3CW) model and the first Born approximation (FBA). In the 3CW formalism, the interaction between the dressed projectile and the active electron is represented by a model potential containing both the long-range and short-range part of the Coulomb potential. The target is treated as a one-electron atom, where the interaction of the active electron with the rest of the target is represented by a similar type of model potential. The correlated motion of each pair of particles, interacting through long-range Coulomb potential, is taken into account in the final state. In addition, an independent particle model and a single-zeta Roothaan-Hartree-Fock 1s wavefunction, describing helium in its ground state, is used to carry out the calculations, where the effective charge of the target nuclei is obtained from the initial orbital energy. The energy distributions of the double-differential cross sections (DDCS) at low and intermediate energy electron emission from helium atom have been investigated. Our theoretical results are compared with both the available experimental measurements and theoretical calculations using other methods. There is good overall agreement of the present calculations with experimental data except for low-energy electron emission (less than 10 eV). For target ionization by a dressed projectile, we find that the cross sections depend on the projectile charge. For distant collisions involving high energy ions, the primary effect of bound projectile electrons is to screen the projectile nuclear charge, thereby reducing the strength of the interaction potential. Finally, the energy distribution of DDCS ratio at different angles has also been studied.

The direct correlation function of a hardcore potential is assumed to be represented by A Mayer function instead of THE one used in the Random Phase Approximation and Mean Spherical Approximation. Correcting the unphysical behaviour of the corresponding pair correlation function in the hardcore region will give rise to a new perturbation theory as a natural generalisation of the Optimised Random Phase Approximation.

J	Pagano, A; Pagano, EV				Pagano, Angelo; Pagano, Emanuele, V			A note on Lorentz transformations and simultaneity in classical physics and special relativity	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL H												Since early models of wave propagation in both stationary and moving media during the nineteenth century, the Lorentz transformation (LT) has played a key role in describing characteristic wave phenomena, e.g., the Doppler shift effect. In these models LT connects two different events generated by wave propagations, as observed in two reference systems and the synchronism is absolute. In relativistic physics LT implements the relativity principle. As a consequence, it connects two space-time event coordinates that both correspond to the same physical event and "absolute synchronization" is not allowed. The relativistic interpretation started from Einstein's early criticism of the notion of "simultaneity" and Minkowski's invariance of the space-time interval. In this paper, the two different roles of LT, i.e., in classical wave propagation theories and in relativistic physics, are discussed. Einstein's early criticism is also re-examined with respect to LT in view of its significance for the notion of simultaneity. Indeed, that early criticism is found to be defective. Our analysis is also useful for general readers in view of its impact on modern speculations about the existence of a preferred system of reference sigma, where light propagation is isotropic, and related implications.

Effect of Fluctuation in the Coupling Strength on Critical Dynamics of 1D Transverse Field Quantum Ising Model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS												The effect of uniformly distributed fluctuation in the coupling strength of a 100 spins transverse field quantum Ising chain is studied using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group on the Matrix Product States formalism. Uniform noise with mean zero and amplitude eta is introduced to uniform nearest neighbour coupling of value unity. Disordered averages of thermodynamic quantities are calculated from 100 disordered realizations for each transverse field reading. We show that the system exhibits distinct behaviour of ordered and disordered state separated at eta 1.0. For eta less than or similar to 1.0, thermodynamic behaviour of the system gradually deviates from pure quantum Ising model. For eta > 1.0 system exhibits highly fluctuating thermodynamic behaviour. Edward-Anderson order parameters are calculated and shown to be much less fluctuating and suitable as an order parameter for eta > 1.0. Qualitative behaviour of the system is not affected by finite-size effect and replacing the fluctuation with normally distributed noise. Finally, for noise level between eta = 1.0 and 1.5, the system exhibits a faster phase transition and enhances transverse magnetization before the critical point. For certain ranges of noise amplitude before the critical point, the quantum fluctuations are amplified. This suggests a potential improvement of quantum annealing within that regime.

These iron oxide-based materials were obtained by a direct plasma-dynamic synthesis with supersonic outflow of an iron-containing electric discharge plasma into an oxygen atmosphere. Subsequently, they were used as an initial precursor and placed in the plasma-chemical reactor, where the multicomponent C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanostructures were synthesized under the influence of the pulsed electron beam. This method was based on the volume excitation of the reaction gas by a pulsed electron beam in such a way as to control the uniform process implementation in the entire excitation region. The morphology and phase composition of the synthesized C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanocomposites were studied. A typical morphological feature of the C/SixOy/Fe2O3 samples was found to be the formation of filamentary nanostructures. Their diameter does not exceed 10-20 nm, while their length varies up to 1 mu m.

J	Suzuki, M; Kabashima, Y				Suzuki, Masato; Kabashima, Yoshiyuki			Statistical mechanics of the minimum vertex cover problem in stochastic block models	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												The minimum vertex cover (Min-VC) problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. Earlier studies illustrate that the problem defined over the Erdos-Renyi random graph with a mean degree c exhibits computational difficulty in searching the Min-VC set above a critical point c = e = 2.718.... Here, we address how this difficulty is influenced by the mesoscopic structures of graphs. For this, we evaluate the critical condition of difficulty for the stochastic block model. We perform a detailed examination of the specific cases of two equal-size communities characterized by in and out degrees, which are denoted by c(in) and c(out), respectively. Our analysis based on the cavity method indicates that the solution search once becomes difficult when c(in) + c(out) exceeds e from below, but becomes easy again when c(out) is sufficiently larger than c(in) in the region c(out) > e. Experiments based on various search algorithms support the theoretical prediction.

J	Taylor, T; Wenninger, H; Zichichi, A				Taylor, Thomas; Wenninger, Horst; Zichichi, Antonino			LAA: a project using dedicated funding to develop technology for high-energy physics experiments	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL H												In the mid-1980s, the cost of investment in infrastructure for particle accelerators and colliders at the highest energy had risen to such level that the host laboratory (CERN) could no longer afford the cost of development of new detector technology required for the experiments. Large particle colliders were identified by the tools of the future for high-energy physics research, and a long-term view of their development was already conjured up in the late 1970s. It was based on this appraisal that a separate project, called LAA, which addresses the development of the technologies that are required to fully exploit the potential of the new infrastructure, was conceived. The project, specifically funded by the Italian government, centers on advanced microelectronics, and it is largely thanks to this development that the experiments at the large hadron collider (LHC) at CERN were equipped with performant detectors. Some of this equipment features in (i) the Italian School project to observe Extreme Energy Events (EEE), (ii) the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in the International Space Station and (iii) the time-of-flight (TOF) detector of the LHC heavy ion experiment ALICE at CERN. Several spin-offs for applications in medical instrumentation and advanced electronics were also initiated by development in the framework of the LAA project. The project also covers development work on superconductors and high field superconducting magnets for a future very LHC. The impact of LAA on technology is widely acknowledged.																			2102-6459	2102-6467				DEC 2	2019	44	4-5					307	319		10.1140/epjh/e2019-100010-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjh/e2019-100010-9													WOS:000499782100002

Numerical computations of dispersion relation in the pinch plasma medium showed that CR started at approximately E = 0.0645 MeV with the relativistic velocity of 0.46 (m/s). Furthermore, the positron loses its energy by collision with the background plasma at a rate approximated by Bethe-Bloch equation through the pinch plasma diameter of 3 cm and annihilates after traveling a distance of about 1 cm.

Previous studies have obtained exact analytical results for the electrical conductivity of a single layer with and without a magnetic field, as well as for the thermoelectric response of a magnetic field-free double-layer. Here, we generalize these exact solutions to the magneto-thermoelectric response of a single layer and to the thermoelectric response of a double-layer.

J	Al Matwi, M				Al Matwi, Malik			Yang-Mills Theory of Gravity	PHYSICS												The canonical formulation of general relativity (GR) is based on decomposition space-time manifold M into R x Sigma, where R represents the time, and Sigma is the three-dimensional space-like surface. This decomposition has to preserve the invariance of GR, invariance under general coordinates, and local Lorentz transformations. These symmetries are associated with conserved currents that are coupled to gravity. These symmetries are studied on a three dimensional space-like hypersurface Sigma embedded in a four-dimensional space-time manifold. This implies continuous symmetries and conserved currents by Noether's theorem on that surface. We construct a three-form E-i Lambda DA(i) ( D represents covariant exterior derivative) in the phase space ( E-i(a), A(a) (i)) on the surface Sigma, and derive an equation of continuity on that surface, and search for canonical relations and a Lagrangian that correspond to the same equation of continuity according to the canonical field theory. We find that Sigma(0a)(i) is a conjugate momentum of A(a)(i) and Sigma F-ab(i)ab(i) is its energy density. We show that there is conserved spin current that couples to A(i), and show that we have to include the term F mu viF mu vi in GR. Lagrangian, where F-i = DA(i), and A(i) is complex SO(3) connection. The term F mu viF mu vi includes one variable, A(i), similar to Yang-Mills gauge theory. Finally we couple the connection A(i) to a left-handed spinor field psi, and find the corresponding beta function.						al Matwi, Malik/0000-0002-5403-683X														2624-8174				DEC	2019	1	3					339	359		10.3390/physics1030025	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/physics1030025													WOS:000645022100003

Proton lifetime, the main associated phenomenology of the noncommutative virtual black holes, has been studied, first in four-dimensional space-time and then generalized to D dimensions.

The dominant molecular orbitals contributing into absorption peaks of an organic light-emitting molecule	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS												The dominant molecular orbitals (MO) making roles in electronic transitions responsible for optical processes in an OLED molecule are investigated. Whole molecule transition during absorption of stimulus light in such devices are commonly described first-principally as a summation of electronic transitions between several MOs. Time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can determine the percent of each electronic transition contributing into a specific molecular transition between ground and excited states. This scheme, however, ignores electronic correlation during the transitions, which of crucial importance for correcting the difference energies between MO levels. This electron-hole interaction energy can be recovered considering every peak of absorption spectrum of the molecule to one single electronic transition between two specific MOs. The corresponding single-excited molecular orbitals (SEMO) are employed to calculate the intensities of absorption peaks of a well-known OLED molecule Alq(3). First, TDDFT is used to simulate the molecule and to obtain its MOs and it is shown that TDDFT is capable to track the dominant electronic transitions and their specific MOs responsible for the optical process, and so, it provides a reliable basis for calculations of SEMO. The SEMO is then applied on MOs contributing dominantly in each absorption peak of the molecule. The calculations, performed within this scheme, move the computational curve excellently closer to experimental measurement of the absorption peaks.																			0022-3697	1879-2553				DEC	2019	135								109092	10.1016/j.jpcs.2019.109092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpcs.2019.109092													WOS:000488419800026

Elemental evaluation of urban road dirt via three analytical techniques	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY												Worldwide, toxicological consequences are arising from vehicular contributions to environmental pollution. Herein, elemental monitoring has been conducted of road dirt via three analytical techniques, sampling being made along the busy campus roads of universities/research institutes in Guildford and Riyadh. Using the ICPOES and ICPMS techniques, absolute values have been determined for Ti, Mn, Mg, Co, Zr, Mo, Ba, Tl, V, Rd, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cd, and As, while an SEM/EDX technique has provided weight % values. Results, both qualitative and quantitative, are compared. By using SEM most prominent among the elements observed in the road samples are Al, Fe, Mg, and Si, particularly in the Gulf city of Riyadh and are in agreement with values observed in previous work by the same group. By using ICPMS and ICPOES Mg, Ti, V, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr and Ba have also been observed in both climates, albeit at lower concentrations than that found for Al, Fe, and Mg, with particle sizes of < 45 mu m. Elemental presence is seen to be influenced by climatic conditions as well as vehicle engine size. In conclusion, the various techniques offer complementary information on vehicular emission elemental concentrations in urban environments.

Iterative deconvolution for kernels with strictly positive Fourier transforms	INVERSE PROBLEMS												In many practical situations, the recovery of information about some phenomenon of interest f reduces to performing deconvolution on indirect measurements g = p * f, corresponding to the convolution of f with a known kernel (point spread function) p. However, in practice, only discrete measurements of g will be available. Consequently, the construction of discrete approximations to f reduces to deriving discrete versions of g = p * f. How this is done depends crucially on what is assumed about the properties of the kernel p. Here, it is assumed that p is symmetric and integrable, and that the Fourier transform *p of p is strictly positive. Different discrete versions are obtained depending on how the discretisation of g = p * f is performed. After establishing convergence of the truncated schemes, we discuss the underlying difficulties reflecting their ill-posedness and detail how approximations have to be treated with due care. Some of the technical issues underlying the arguments are treated in the appendix.					de Hoog, Frank/A-4555-2009	Loy, Richard/0000-0002-1926-3519													0266-5611	1361-6420				DEC	2019	35	12							125013	10.1088/1361-6420/ab292e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6420/ab292e													WOS:000499909100001

J	Arnaudon, A; Takao, S				Arnaudon, Alexis; Takao, So			NETWORKS OF COADJOINT ORBITS: FROM GEOMETRIC TO STATISTICAL MECHANICS	JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC MECHANICS												A class of network models with symmetry group G that evolve as a Lie-Poisson system is derived from the framework of geometric mechanics, which generalises the classical Heisenberg model studied in statistical mechanics. We considered two ways of coupling the spins: one via the momentum and the other via the position and studied in details the equilibrium solutions and their corresponding nonlinear stability properties using the energy-Casimir method. We then took the example G = SO(3) and saw that the momentum-coupled system reduces to the classical Heisenberg model with massive spins and the position-coupled case reduces to a new system that has a broken symmetry group SO(3)/SO(2) similar to the heavy top. In the latter system, we numerically observed an interesting synchronisation-like phenomenon for a certain class of initial conditions. Adding a type of noise and dissipation that preserves the coadjoint orbit of the network model, we found that the invariant measure is given by the Gibbs measure, from which the notion of temperature is defined. We then observed a surprising `triple-humped' phase transition in the heavy top-like lattice model, where the spins switched from one equilibrium position to another before losing magnetisation as we increased the temperature. This work is only a first step towards connecting geometric mechanics with statistical mechanics and several interesting problems are open for further investigation.

Microscopic and Spectroscopic Characterization of Nanostructured Topographical Surface of Rattlesnake Rattle	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												Rattlesnakes are easily recognized by a rattle on the tail. Despite the advances in molecular, morphological, and evolutionary studies about several aspects of rattles, there are no studies elucidating these nanoscale topographical features using high-resolution techniques. Here we propose a set of approaches to show these micro/nano surface features searching for patterns or hidden signatures. The results showed that the older rattle ring (segment 8) presented higher roughness values when compared to other segments. Cluster analysis allowed the observation of similarities/differences among some groups, which reinforced the strong discrepancy of the segment 8 when compared to the others and enable possible topographical transitions among each segment features, considering their linkages and Euclidean distances. Attractive forces and surface hardness were also significant increased on segment 8, while adhesion was significantly decreased on the segments 5, 6, and 7 compared to segment 1 (P < 0.05). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed typical profiles of keratin spectra considering the amino acids present in this protein structure. Energy dispersive spectroscopy results indicated possible different molecular composition on each segment.

The most important defect of these rocks is solubility against water flow. The dissolution phenomenon in gypsum is accompanied by the release of the sulfate ion in water increasing its concentration, gradually. In this research, the effect of water flow temperature (T), Reynolds number (Re) and water head (H) on gypsum dissolution rate was evaluated, experimentally. In all of the experiments, gypsum samples were prepared approximately in the same dimensions and a circular hole was created inside the sample. Results showed that by increasing the temperature above T/Ta = 1.30 (Ta = temperature of the ambient air), the dissolution rate of gypsum was significantly increased. At the end of the experiment, the hole diameter (d) at the temperatures T/Ta = 1.09, 1.30, 1.52 and 1.74 has been increased about 90%, 137%, 141% and 148% from the initial hole diameter (di), respectively. The dissolution rate at T/Ta = 1.09 is about 50% less than the dissolution rate at temperatures T/Ta = 1.52 to 1.74. Moreover, the increasing rate of the outlet discharge for H/d = 333 is 1.89 times the increasing rate of the outlet discharge for H/d = 167.

Combined NMR and X-ray diffraction study of structural aspects, dynamics and charge ordering mechanism in Li<sub>x</sub>VOPO<sub>4</sub>•2H<sub>2</sub>O intercalation compounds	SOLID STATE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE												We carried out a detailed investigation of the local ordering and dynamics of the lithium intercalation in paramagnetic LixVOPO4 center dot 2H(2)O (with 0 < x <= 1) materials. This question was addressed using a combination of X-ray diffraction, P-31 and Li-7 MAS NMR experiments. We first studied the structure of the fully ordered end-member of the series, Li1VOPO4 center dot 2H(2)O, revisiting the X-ray single crystal diffraction data on the basis of the information provided by P-31 MAS NMR. We then carried out Li-7 MAS and exchange NMR experiments and P-31 MAS experiments on the polycrystalline powders obtained after partial lithium insertion in VOPO4 center dot 2H(2)O phases. These experiments evidenced an unexpected ageing of the material related with lithium dynamics between the VOPO4 layers and a V4+/V5+ charge ordering mechanism within the layers.					roiland, claire/AAG-7816-2019; roiland, claire/E-9551-2019	roiland, claire/0000-0001-9587-1340													0926-2040	1527-3326				DEC	2019	104								101623	10.1016/j.ssnmr.2019.101623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssnmr.2019.101623								31678745					WOS:000496913500001

In particular, we are interested in 2N-ctwistors describing colored spinless conformal massive particles with phase space U(2N, 2N)/U(2N) x U(2N). Penrose formulas for incidence relations are generalized to N > 1. We propose U(2N)-gauge invariant Lagrangians for 2N-ctwistors and we quantize them through a bosonic representation, interpreting quantum states as particle-hole excitations above the ground state. The connection between the corresponding Hilbert (Fock-like with constraints) space and the carrier space of a discrete series representation of U(2N, 2N) is established through a coherent state (holomorphic) representation.

On Alfven wave propagation along a circle on dipolar coordinates	JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS												The multipolar representation of the magnetic field has, for the lowest-order term, a magnetic dipole that dominates the far field. Thus the far-field representation of the magnetic field of the Earth, Sun and other celestial bodies is a dipole. Since these bodies consist of or are surrounded by plasma, which can support Alfven waves, their propagation along dipole magnetic field lines is considered using a new coordinate system: dipolar coordinates. The present paper introduces multipolar coordinates, which are an example of conformal coordinates; conformal coordinates are orthogonal with equal scale factors, and can be extended from the plane to space, for instance as cylindrical or spherical dipolar coordinates. The application considered is to Alfven waves propagating along a circle, that is a magnetic field line of a dipole, with transverse velocity and magnetic field perturbations; the various forms of the wave equation are linear second-order differential equations, with variable coefficients, specified by a background magnetic field, which is force free. The absence of a background magnetic force leads to a mean state of hydrostatic equilibrium, specified by the balance of gravity against the pressure gradient, for a perfect gas or incompressible liquid. The wave equation is simplified to a Gaussian hypergeometric type in the case of zero frequency, otherwise, for non-zero frequency, an extended Gaussian hypergeometric equation is obtained. The solution of the latter specifies the magnetic field perturbation spectrum, and also, via a polarisation relation, the velocity perturbation spectrum; both are plotted, over half a circle, for three values of the dimensionless frequency.					da Costa Campos, Luis/AAL-2562-2020; Moleiro, Filipa/I-4843-2015	Moleiro, Filipa/0000-0001-9287-3519; Campos, Luis/0000-0002-1418-9532; Silva, Manuel/0000-0002-7522-336X													0022-3778	1469-7807				DEC	2019	85	6							905850608	10.1017/S0022377819000837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022377819000837													WOS:000500342100001

It is found that the specific heat of BiFeO3 exhibits two peaks. The first peak appears at the magnetic phase transition temperature T-N = 650 K. This anomaly in specific heat can be interpreted as antiferromagnetic transition. The values of the specific heat (at the magnetic phase transition temperature T-N) increase with the increasing of the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g. Another abnormal peak of specific heat appears at nearly 550 K, which is associated with the onset of structural changes. Note that the second peak shifts to lower temperature as the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g decrease. It is considered that the main reason of leading to the structure distortion increases is due to the increase of the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g. Those calculation conclusions are in accordance with the experimental results of other researchers.

J	Cervantes, HJ; Kopel, FM; Rabbani, SR				Cervantes, Hernan J.; Kopel, Felipe M.; Rabbani, Said R.			Metabolomics Data Analysis Improvement by Use of the Filter Diagonalization Method	APPLIED MAGNETIC RESONANCE												The filter diagonalization method (FDM) was implemented and used instead of fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra from the free induction decay (FID) signals. The areas obtained by the FDM, from selected absorption lines, were used as input for a multidimensional method of data analysis. This procedure was applied in a NMR-based metabolomics investigation. In FDM, instead of spectra, the absorption peaks' specification, such as central frequency, line width, amplitude and relative phases, are estimated and the spectra are built using this information. Therefore, one can select the lines by width and intensity to exclude the broad lines such as baseline, solvent line and albumin peak. Also lines with small amplitude such as noise can be excluded from the spectra. Moreover, the spectra do not suffer from aliasing or baseline problems. These characteristics are fundamental in the metabolomics investigations. To show the superiority of our method over the standard FFT to obtain the spectra, we reconstructed the spectra from simulated FID by both methods. As an example, this new approach is used to analyze the non-small cell lung cancer A549 exposed to different treatments and principal component analysis is used to compare the performance of both methods.

The monitoring technology has the advantages of anti-intrusion, low manufacturing cost, high-temperature resistance, and simple structure. At present, ECT systems use small-scale sensors for signal capture, but such sensors have problems such as low sensitivity and poor anti-interference, which have attracted the attention of researchers. In this study, a light-trigger sensor was proposed, which was equipped with a special light window to receive optical signals. At the same time, in terms of the problem of electromagnetic shielding and optical window protection, a light window structure that transmitted optical signals and shields electromagnetic waves was designed. Based on the light-trigger sensor, the other modules of the ECT system were designed, considering that the sensor would be interfered by the measurement of stray capacitance, the intra-isoelectric driver cable shielding technology, the double T-type simulation switch matrix, and the digital-mode demodulation technology was introduced. Consequently, the performance of the sensor was tested. During the experiment, the sucrose flow pattern was used as the test object. The results showed that compared with the traditional sensors, the image distortion of the sensor based on the ECT system was lower; while in the performance test of the ECT system, the introduction of the double T-type simulation switch matrix, the digital-analogy demodulation technology, and the bipolar plate excitation mode could further optimize the signal-to-noise ratio index of the image; in the sensitivity test of the ECT system, the introduction of bipolar plate excitation mode could improve the output sensitivity of the capacitance.																			1555-130X	1555-1318				DEC	2019	14	12					1733	1741		10.1166/jno.2019.2709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jno.2019.2709													WOS:000495610700012

The output force of the traditional asymmetric microgripper is stable. However, its output displacement is small, typically half the output displacement of the symmetric microgripper. To solve these problems, in this study, we designed a large-displacement asymmetric microgripper. First, we calculated the relationship between the theoretical input and output variables based on their geometric relationship. Then, we analyzed the performance of the microgripper using finite element software. Lastly, we used a piezoelectric actuator as the input driver of the microgripper. The errors associated with the theoretical and simulated output displacements were 7.05% and 924%, respectively. At 150 V of driving voltage, the maximum output displacement was 224 pm, and the actual magnification was 11.2 times. Microparts can be gripped in parallel and stably, which confirms the validity of the design. Copyright (C) 2019 Tianjin University.

Overlooked in a paper by Einstein's colleague Sommerfeld and kept under wraps until publication of a recent book, the germane criterion points to a seemingly unknown hemispherical liemix' spiral which encapsulates the Gudermannian relating a fixed thrust rocket's velocity and clocked own-time. This opens new avenues for analysing relativistic noninertial length contexts whereby hemix-generated real-metric lambda vertical bar tau 'own-szrfaces' visualisable in are corroborated by radar path attributes, oddly a strategy unexploited in relativity. The Euclidean models epitomise not only Born's (one off) 'rigid motion' but also non-Minkowski extended medium acceleration scenarios such as the previously unresolved Bell's spaceships problem where the +/- [+++-] signature is misplaced, increment 'own-lines' and radar paths turn out to be nongeodesics, and Gauss curvature remains the same along each shared own-time likewise nongeodesic 'medium curve'.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102721	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102721													WOS:000502391000196

Exploring Magnetic Resonance with a Compass	PHYSICS TEACHER												Magnetic resonance is a quantum phenomenon and describes a resonant interaction of spins with electromagnetic fields. Its understanding requires advanced knowledge of quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics and thus often remains elusive to students. However, the great impact of this phenomenon on medicine, science, and technology makes magnetic resonance an important subject for general education, and it requires a graspable model for translating the physical concepts without resorting to advanced physics. One of the most common and familiar objects related to magnetism is the compass. Here, we develop an inexpensive tabletop demonstration experiment for magnetic resonance. The compass is placed into the magnetic field of a permanent magnet (strong refrigerator magnet); an alternating field of an electromagnetic coil (solenoid) excites a resonant oscillation of the compass needle. The experiment has been proven to catch the attention of audiences of all ages.																			0031-921X					DEC	2019	57	9					633	635		10.1119/1.5135797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.5135797													WOS:000500003600016

By slowly varying the amplitude of modulation, we steer the light to the desired output waveguide when equal amounts of lights are launched into each waveguide. We reveal that depending on the sign of the static propagation constant mismatch (detuning) between two waveguides, the launched light can be completely switched to either of waveguides. Additionally, we numerically examine the performances of light switching for general inputs and modulation amplitudes, and show that the localization of output light is robust against small to moderate variations in the final modulation amplitude, phase difference and intensity distribution of input field between two waveguides. More importantly, according to the principle of the proposed scheme, we are capable of steering the output light to the targeted waveguide at extremely low input power. In theory, our findings can be explained qualitatively by means of adiabatic navigation of the so-called nonlinear Floquet states.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102792	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102792	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102792													WOS:000502391000266

EXPLOITING FARADAY ROTATION TO JAM QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION VIA POLARIZED PHOTONS	QUANTUM INFORMATION & COMPUTATION												Quantum key distribution (QKD) involving polarized photons could be vulnerable to a jamming (or denial-of-service) attack, in which a third party applies an external magnetic field to rotate the plane of polarization of photons headed toward one of the two intended recipients. Sufficiently large Faraday rotation of one of the polarized beams would prevent Alice and Bob from establishing a secure quantum channel. We investigate requirements to induce such rotation both for free-space transmission and for transmission via optical fiber, and find reasonable ranges of parameters in which a jamming attack could be successful against fiber-based QKD, even for systems that implement automated recalibration for polarization-frame alignment. The jamming attack could be applied selectively and indefinitely by an adversary without revealing her presence, and could be further combined with various eavesdropping attacks to yield unauthorized information.

Here, we present an authentic research project for introductory physics students that focuses on kinematics that can be done outside a formal laboratory space. This experiment can be done in a high school or a university setting. Because it is not confined to a formal laboratory space, students can perform the experiment outside of a formal time period dedicated for labs, and over the course of a semester. This activity was developed as a part of an integrated science and mathematics program where students used their knowledge in kinematics to observe the psychology of animal behavior. Students were guided to write a research proposal for their experiment and to carry it out over a semester. The following describes the activity, experimental methods, and sample data.																			0031-921X					DEC	2019	57	9					618	620		10.1119/1.5135792	http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.5135792													WOS:000500003600011

Moreover, while moving in a confined structure, Brownian particles also could exhibit peculiar kinetic behavior. The dependence of directed current on various parameters is systematically studied. Our results indicate that the direction of motion can be reversed by modulating the coupling strength, free length, and microchannel width. In addition, we have achieved the conditions of forward motion in this study. That is, when the interparticle average horizontal interval Delta x > 0.25L, where L is the spatial period of the external potential, the forward motion of coupled Brownian particles effected by the synchronized noise and confined to a microchannel can be generated in the strong-coupling case.					zhao, qi/KGK-3760-2024														0577-9073					DEC	2019	62						106	114		10.1016/j.cjph.2019.10.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cjph.2019.10.002													WOS:000497964900010

Partial electronic density of states, highest occupied molecular orbital, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital were given and used to discuss the detailed electronic structures. Dielectric function, refractive index, reflectivity, absorption coefficient, and energy loss functions under several pressures were calculated and used to investigate the optical properties. We found that Co6Se8(PMe3)(6) transfers electrons and C-60 receives electrons, making contributions to electron communications between the positive and negative counterparts on the basis of electrostatic interactions. The superatomic structures are made from assemblies of charge-rich and charge-poor molecular precursors. In the solid state, charge is transferred between the components, with a net reduction of C-60 by less than one electron (0.75 electron approximately).					lu, yilin/W-7007-2018	Li, Jie-Sen/0000-0002-5230-2874													2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102595	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102595													WOS:000502391000074

Geodesic dynamics in Chazy-Curzon spacetimes	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS												In the last decades, the dynamical studies around compact objects became a subject of active research, partially motivated by the observed differences in the profiles of the gravitational waves depending on the dynamics of the system.In this work, via the Poincare section method, we conduct a thorough numerical analysis of the dynamical behavior of geodesics around Chazy-Curzon metrics. As the main result, we find only regular motions for the geodesics in all cases, which suggest the existence of the so-called Carter's constant in this kind of exact solutions. Moreover, our simulations indicate that in the two-particle Chazy-Curzon solution, some oscillatory motions take place as in the classical MacMillan problem.

Here the generation of mode-locked MIR frequency comb in a LiNbO3 microring through optimized slot-waveguide design is proposed. Such microcomb can span over four-fifths of an octave (ranging from similar to 2810 nm to similar to 4630 nm) with pump power as low as 50 mW, which can be applied to the 2f-3f self-referencing for fully stabilization and helpful to monolithic integration of the whole system. Further investigations on complex dynamical processes for the microcomb generation suggest that the intracavity soliton drifting caused by the third-order dispersion could be compensated by the self-steepening effect as introducing an additional drift through proper dispersion tailoring. This work could facilitate the low-threshold broadband MIR frequency comb generation technique, as well as provide a way to realize more delicate control of soliton microcombs in both temporal and spectral domain.

Prime-index parametrization for total neutrino-nucleon cross sections and <i>pp</i> cross sections	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS G-NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS												A prime number based parametrization for total neutrino-nucleon cross section is presented.

This prime-index relation provides estimates of the neutrino-nucleon cross sections valid across many decades of neutrino energy scales. The PeV data are from the recently published astrophysical nu(mu) + (nu) over bar (mu) rates in the IceCube detector as well as neutrino-nucleon cross section measurements.

The precursors with bithiazole were successfully prepared, their inorganic and organic parts were connected on molecular level. The DSC results indicated they would all exist in liquid phase at temperature ranging from 180 K to 280 K. The UV-VIS showed that a red shift of the main electronic transitions from 254 to 268 nm of PBSIBTHM to PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 14 (from 249 to 266 nm of PBSIBTMeM to PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 17). This verified the formation of a more extensive pi -> pi* conjugating system due to coordination interaction between Ni2+ and PBSIBTHM or PBSIBTMeM. The magnetic measurement results of PBSIBTHM-Ni2+ and PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+ reflected they both exhibited ferromagnetic properties at low temperature. For PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+, it had a transition temperature (T-tran) at 160 K, and became an anti-ferromagnet above T-tran. For PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, it had a very high Curie-Weiss temperature (T-c = 253 K). This strategy was expected to find potential application in fabricating the complexes with desired physicochemical properties.

The magnetic properties of the samples were studied using hysteresis curves obtained by an alternating gradient magnetometer. Theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory are also performed to support experimental data. The results indicated that Fe incorporated into de SrTiO3 structure induced intrinsic magnetic properties, which increase as the Fe percentage increase. At 5 mol% of Fe in the sample showed a single-domain state, typical of a ferromagnetic material capable for information storage. This latter result would be due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies as more Fe was added and to the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions reinforced the magnetic behaviour of the compound.

New metrics for the gravitational field of a charged and rotating mass	RESULTS IN PHYSICS												The mathematical transformations used in a previous paper by the author enable one to recast the Kerr-Newman metric for the gravitational field of a charged and rotating mass in two new forms which satisfy physically judicious requirements necessary for a relevant system of reference to be realizable with the aid of real bodies throughout all space as distinct from the initial Kerr-Newman metric. The new metrics are physically admissible for any angular momentum of the rotating central mass provided the charge of the mass is not too large. Properties of the metrics are studied. One of the metric is preferable from the physical point of view because all coefficients in the metric are non-singular except for the points where the rotating disk creating the gravitational field is located. The results of the present paper show that there are no black holes around rotating masses, be they charged or noncharged.

Tailoring fields of one-sheet and two-sheet planar ion trap mass analyzers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY												In this paper, a simulation study on tailoring the fields in planar ion trap geometries for making them suitable for mass analysis is presented. Two different planar trap geometries were considered: the first is a One-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry in which the ions are trapped off-plane and the second is a Two-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry in which the ions are trapped in between the two sheets. Both DC and RF potentials were used to trap ions. The fields were tailored to obtain linear trapping fields in these two geometries. This was done by splitting the central electrode into segments and applying suitable DC potentials to them. The potentials were computed using a least square method. The simulations were carried out considering a printed circuit board (PCB) with a Teflon base. The One-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry consists of five electrodes, of which the central electrode is segmented. In Two-Sheet Ion Trap Geometry, each sheet consists of three electrodes, of which the central electrode is segmented. The method outlined in the study is able to tailor fields to be linear as well as mildly superlinear. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Impact of the Frequency Dependence of the Parasitic Admittance on the Diffusion Noise of a Diode Junction at Low Bias	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES												In this article, we report for the first time that the well-established diffusion noise can be apparently increased in large proportions and that such a situation can be very common at some specific frequencies in the p-n junction structures operating at a very low direct bias current. Noise theories and the associated measurement techniques are a major issue for the emerging semiconductor technologies, the development of accurate computer-aided design (CAD) models, and the designing of low-noise circuits and systems. The conventional shot noise model usually satisfactorily describes the p-n junction noise in solid-state devices, such as diodes and transistors. It has proven to be very efficient for many different conventional and advanced semiconductor technologies. However, alterations may sometimes be needed as previous works indicate scenarios where this so-called shot noise exhibits deviations from the theory, which translates into some noise suppression. In this article, we report on alterations that look like low-frequency diffusion noise enhancement (unexpected noise increase). It occurs at low current levels, for many generic commercially available diodes and the p-n junctions in transistors. Therefore, we propose an appropriate electrical noise model that satisfies both the low-frequency noise experimental data and the electrical behavior of the devices observed from impedance spectroscopy. We also evaluate this model as the ambient temperature is varied. Finally, it is discussed how this model can be connected to the conventional van der Ziel shot noise model and a better insight on the possible origin of such diffusion noise enhancement is provided.

Here we show that whenever a C*-dynamical system (A, G, alpha, tau) equipped with a faithful G-invariant trace tau, where G is an even dimensional abelian Lie group, determines a spectral triple, the smooth dense subalgebra A(infinity) inherits a noncommutative Kahler structure. In particular, whenever T-2n acts ergodically on the algebra, it inherits a noncommutative Kahler structure. This produces a class of examples of noncommutative Kahler manifolds. As a corollary, we obtain that all the noncommutative even dimensional tori are noncommutative Kahler manifolds. We explicitly compute the space of complex differential forms and study holomorphic vector bundles on all noncommutative even dimensional tori. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Schottky behavior was transformed into Ohmic in the blended polymer. PSB was synthesized from the solution of polycondensation of terephthaloyl chloride (T) and 4-(4-hydroxybenzylideneamino)phenol (SB). The polymer showed good thermal stability with T-g of 312 degrees C as determined by thermal gravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry TGA-DSC and high molecular weight 3.5 x 10(5) (g/mol) with coiled conformation as determined by laser light scattering. PBS was blended with various weight percentage ratios of PANI (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 percent by weight of the pristine polymer). The metal contact (Au) was formed and studied in the temperature range of 293-373 K, which showed that Schottky behavior in the intrinsic polymer with an ideality factor was close to 2 and then reduced to 1.0-1.2 in the blended polymers. In blended polymers, the conduction across the junction was characterized by Schottky emission at low field and Poole-Frenkel emission at high field. The Schottky barrier height showed a small increase with temperature, which was attributed to reduction in the built up of image charge. The Schottky and Poole-Frenkel emission coefficients were also determined and Schottky emission coefficient agreed with the theoretical value, while Poole-Frenkel emission coefficient was small. In short, the metal-semiconductor junction was affected by the blending, while conduction within the polymer remained independent of PANI concentration.

J	Guo, ST; Liu, Y				Guo Song-Tao; Liu Yu			Experiment and analysis on the quantum liquid droplets formed in ultra-cold potassium atomic gases	RESULTS IN PHYSICS												As a new state of matter, the quantum liquid droplets formed in ultra-cold potassium (K-39) atomic gases have been studied experimentally by Cabrera et al. (2018) and Semeghini et al. (2018). In this paper, we combined the experimental findings with the theory of mean-field, and obtained the potential function of inter-atomic interaction and the function of forces on atoms. The relation between the radial size of liquid droplet (sigma(r)) and magnetic field (B) is established based on the previous functions. From the viewpoint of energy balance, the condition under which the liquid droplets can stably exist and the dependence of the critical atom number (N-C) on B are discussed. A semi-theoretical relation between N-C and B is derived and verified to be valid by comparing the experimental values with the calculated ones. The energy balance (the potential energy of system equaling the kinetic energy of the system) can be considered as a condition under which the liquid droplets exist stably. Our results are helpful to further understanding of the quantum liquid droplets.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102697	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102697													WOS:000502391000172

The presence of Ti in Bi2O2 layer spacer or superconducting BiS2 layers was investigated. For this study, the polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 superconductor was prepared following a two-step solid-state reaction. Grains consisted of lamellae, similar to 5-10 mu m in the planar orientation and 100-500 nm thick, presenting a tetragonal crystalline structure, with space group I4/mmm. For the first time, Raman spectroscopy revealed three modes at room temperature, with no significant changes in the spectra with Ti doping. The superconductivity was observed by the Meissner effect from ZFC and FC magnetization measurements. For both samples, the critical temperature was around 3.5 K, showing that Ti doping did not change the T-C value, probably due to fact that Ti is in the Bi2O2 layer spacer. Also, the doped sample presented a strong positive magnetic moment, probably due to the presence of ferromagnetic order.

J	Hajijamali-Arani, Z; Jazi, B				Hajijamali-Arani, Zeinab; Jazi, Bahram			A theoretical study for temperature effects on the dominant color in colloidal nano sphere solutions	PHYSICA SCRIPTA												The effects of the electron temperature on the dominant color in colloidal nano sphere solutions are analytically studied. This system contains ions (as radiators) close to the hot nano plasma spheres (HNPSs). Considering two separate models of the point radiated ions and applying the fluid dynamic equations and suitable Green's function, the optical resonance of HNPSs is declared. The thermal effects in HNPSs show that a series of optical resonances occur in the system and the dominant resonance frequencies depend on the plasma geometry, electron density, electron temperature. The resonance frequencies in the two different models are exactly identical. Also, a new type of resonance frequency (subsidiary resonance frequencies), resulting in the thermal effects, is seen by considering two radiators beside the HNPS and, in this case, due to the sign of the ion radiators with same strengths, the even or odd modes are excited, separately. In other words, the permissible resonance frequencies in colloidal nano sphere solutions are categorized into two principal types: dominant resonance frequencies and subsidiary resonance frequencies. In addition, the graphs of the scattering patterns and resonance frequencies of this problem are analyzed. All of the resonance frequencies are varied with the temperature so that decreasing the Debye length (temperature) of HNPSs decreases the resonant frequencies and changes the dominant color of the system. Moreover, the dominant color of the system depends on the number of spheres in a colloidal solution including many bodies of nano-spheres with different radii.

Convenient method for Curie temperature determination in holmium and yttrium manganite based on capacitance value	RESULTS IN PHYSICS												This study reported an alternative technique to measure the Curie temperature (T-c) of hexagonal manganite as multiferroic sample. The method is based on change identification in slope of capacitance value as a function of temperature. Temperature variation of the capacitance observed in holmium and yttrium manganite sintered at 1250 degrees C has been studied respectively. The optimum preparation of holmium and yttrium manganite with space group P6(3)cm by using high energy ball milling has been chosen in order to provide a convenient T-c. The changes of the capacitance value as a function of temperature range from 300 up to 1000 K at 50 Hz has been carried out in order to obtained the T-c value. Results obtained from the experiments showed that T-c transition could be clearly exhibited by the capacitance value for both the holmium manganite and yttrium manganite samples. The measured property values gave their T-c transition around reported value in previous studies. The ferroelectric T-c transition was observed to be 850 K and 860 K for HoMnO3 and YMnO3 respectively. A completely intrinsic behaviour of T-c was revealed by our simple and low cost method since no applied external field was used, yielding a truly spontaneous ferroelectric behaviour.

Our method consists of two steps, in first step: the main equation is converted to a homogeneous one using interpolation. In second step: two-dimensional approximation of functions by shifted Jacobi polynomials is used to reduce the problem into a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. The archived system is solved by Newton's iterative method. Our method is stated in general case on rectangular [a, b] x [0, T] which is based upon Jacobi polynomial by parameters (alpha, beta). Several test problems are employed and results of numerical experiments are presented and also compared with analytical solutions. Also, we verify the numerical stability of the method, by applying a disturbance in the problem. The obtained results confirm the acceptable accuracy and stability of the presented method.																			1565-1339	2191-0294				DEC	2019	20	7-8					811	822		10.1515/ijnsns-2018-0339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ijnsns-2018-0339													WOS:000496934600007

However, one of the significant challenges that hinder the wide application of singular beams is how to effectively identify the topological charge and the polarization order of arbitrary singular beams. We found that when a light beam with arbitrary polarization state illuminates a polarization-sensitive blazed-grating, the horizontal and vertical component can be separated from the incident beam. Based on this phenomenon, an effective method is proposed to probe the integral topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams. With this detection method, the vortex beam, cylindrical vector beam and cylindrical vector vortex beam with different topological charges and polarization orders have been experimentally identified. This effective detection method can be widely used to measure the topological charge and polarization order of arbitrary singular beams.

The greatest developments were achieved in the Antiquity and in the Middle Ages, but modern physicists also contributed their part. In 1956, a former student of Wolfgang Pauli, Heinz Schilt, constructed an underwater sundial in his garden pond, using refraction to reshape the sundial's hour lines. His approach is developed further in this paper and combined with Thales' geometric concept of gnomonic projection. Together, this leads to a beautiful result: Snell's law can be used to build a sundial whose hour lines portray the Earth and its meridians. A prototype has been built to demonstrate the idea.

Influence of Post-Synthesis Modifications of Ti<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Zr<i><sub>x</sub></i>O<sub>2</sub> Nanocrystallites on Their Photocatalytic Activity for Toluene and Methylcyclohexane Degradation	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												The modification of the structural and surface characteristics of Ti1-xZrxO2 nanocrystallites by post-synthesis treatments is revealed as an effective way to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Starting with the same batch of mixed oxide prepared from reverse microemulsions, different photocatalysts have been obtained by either solvothermal treatment, calcination or a combination of both. Extensive physicochemical characterization of the resulting materials shows that solvothermally treated oxides present lower crystallite size and larger surface area, although without previous calcination these samples appear to have a higher degree of structural disorder. These differences are sharply reflected in the changes in photocatalytic activity for the removal of methylcyclohexane (MCH) and toluene vapours at relatively high concentrations. Thus, the best performance for MCH elimination is obtained with the photocatalysts prepared by calcination and subsequent solvothermal treatment. Following this procedure, the resulting Ti1-xZrxO2 material presents larger surface area and high Zr surface concentration with minimal disturbance of the anatase structure. In contrast, for toluene photooxidation, the solvothermally prepared sample shows improved performance, most likely due to its larger surface area, which contributes to hinder deactivation.

This microstructure possesses both sharp edge and sharp corner (SESC) in topography. The sharp edge can hinder liquid spreading significantly, whereas the sharp corner enhance spreading. By lithography technology on polymer film, Parylene-C, the microstructure can be tailored into different shapes to achieve various liquid spreading properties, two of which are demonstrated here. 2-D SESC microstructure illustrates ultra-high contact angle difference in parallel and perpendicular directions as high as 93.8, as well as bidirectional wetting properties.

J	Iliev, N; Trivedi, AR				Iliev, Nick; Trivedi, Amit Ranjan			Low-Power Sensor Localization in Three-Dimensional Using a Recurrent Neural Network	IEEE SENSORS LETTERS												This letter discusses a novel low-power circuit to self-localize a mobile sensor node in the three-dimensional space using a passive optical receiver. Self-localization of sensors, where a sensor node computes its spatial location by itself, reduces transmission demand, and improves real-time conformity of mobile wireless sensor systems. Our approach forms an over-determined system of angles-of-arrival (AoAs) to mobile sensor received from an optical anchor grid. The AoA system is solved with a linear program (LP) solver, which is implemented using a nonlinear feedback recurrent neural network. To solve the primal and dual LP optimization problems in the AoA system, we show a single multifunctional data path that does not require matrix inversions; thereby, enables within-sensor low-power computations to self-localize. Additionally, unlike other optical indoor positioning architectures, our approach does not require measurements of received signal strength and, thereby, is insensitive to power and alignment imbalances in the anchor grid. We show proof-of-concept field programmable gate array (FPGA) and ASIC simulations of our approach and validate its operation under noisy AoA data and for different numbers of anchors. An FPGA implementation in 180 nm CMOS achieves a peak similar to 0.12 mega localization operations per second per Watt (MOPS/W), while ASIC design in 45 nm CMOS shows a peak similar to 7.7 MOPS/W.

As a result, the beam quality of amplified signal will become poor. In this article, a hybrid seeding scheme with a paired two-stage OPA system is used, where the first and second stages used the signal and the idler as seed sources, respectively. The numerical results show that the hybrid seeding OPA scheme can suppress the phase distortion transformation from pump to signal in both spatial and temporal domains. Consequently, the phase of output signal is well restored to its input state.

However, such side information is generally derived from users' explicit interactions, such as Twitter connections or trust lists, which is not always available in most scenarios. Alternately, obtaining such side information from users' implicit networks is easy. Thus, in this paper, we consider the similarity network for users' semantic locations, assuming that users with neighboring semantic locations have similar consumption habits. To demonstrate this, we evaluate our study in a practical scenario: the smartphone recommendation based on operator records. A novel recommendation paradigm is designed, which includes three key steps: discovery of semantic locations, hierarchical construction of the neighbor network, and items' popularity-based recommendation based on interpersonal similarities. The empirical results illustrate that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods (13% coverage improvement than models without introducing networks and about 5% higher than model with a call-log based network).

Manganese-enhanced MRI: Comparison of agents in the rat pancreas	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE OPEN												Mangafodipir was approved for use as an MRI contrast agent in the late 1990s for liver and pancreas imaging but it was removed from the European market for commercial reasons in 2012. Previously, preliminary work in mice and in diabetic patients showed that Mn2 + ions could be used as a contrast agent to monitor the function of insulin-producing /3-cells by acting as a calcium analogue. Clinical translation of this work was hampered by a lack of available Mn contrast agents, but both mangafodipir and Mn gluconate are currently being used in clinical trials. As a first step towards using Mn in diabetic patients to monitor treatment or disease progression, we imaged the pancreas of healthy rats using mangafodipir, Mn gluconate and Mn chloride (as a control). The hypothesis was that Mn gluconate produces pancreatic enhancement similar to that seen previously with mangafodipir and Mn chloride, with greater enhancement following glucose challenge vs saline challenge. 18 Wistar rats were imaged at 7 T and normalised plateau pancreatic enhancement over baseline was compared for saline vs glucose challenge, calculated from a sigmoid fit to the enhancement curve. For saline vs glucose challenge, mean increases in plateau height +/- sd were: 22 +/- 18% for Mn chloride, 31 +/- 29% for mangafodipir and 41 +/- 17% for Mn gluconate. A paired t-test indicated that enhancement was greater for glucose vs saline (p = 0.01) and that there was no significant difference in the percentage enhancement between any of the compounds (p > 0.2). In conclusion, all three contrast agents produced similar enhancement, with greater plateau height under glucose challenge vs saline challenge. Mangafodipir and Mn gluconate show potential for translation into a clinical study investigating beta cell imaging of the pancreas in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes.

RF and Thermal Analysis of Beam Compression Unit for a <i>W</i>-Band Gyrotron	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE												A four-section beam compression unit (BCU) with copper and aluminum nitride-silicon carbide (AlN-SiC) annular disks was proposed for a $W$ -band gyrotron. Various dimensional parameters were calculated, based on which the BCU was modeled in a high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS), and the transmission characteristics were plotted for various sets of dimensional parameters. The dimensional parameters were optimized for achieving the attenuation of more than 60 dB over 85-105 GHz. It was further examined that the hollow electron beam radius over various sections of the BCU should not lead to beam-wave interaction, and if so, it should not propagate toward the interaction cavity. For this purpose, azimuthal electric field intensities in various azimuthally symmetric modes below the operating mode were plotted against the radial coordinate in various sections of the BCU and checked for the azimuthal electric field intensity values with the range of beam radius in the corresponding section. The electric field intensity maxima should be avoided within the range of beam radius in the corresponding section. Furthermore, the transient thermal analysis of the BCU was carried out considering temperature varying thermal conductivity in two proposed models: 1) with radially constant and 2) radially varying heat loads within AlN-SiC disks to predict the maximum temperature attained in the ceramic as 76.8 C and 88.5 C, respectively, taking 8-L/min flow rate of deionized water and ten heat load pulses.

The surprisingly different quantum predictions could be tested experimentally using ultra-cold fermionic atoms in a periodically-pulsed 1D optical lattice. Similar breakdown of agreement should occur for driven quantum systems in general. Since the relativistic theory should be empirically correct, it must be used instead of the approximate non-relativistic theory to correctly study the quantum dynamics of a driven system after the breakdown time, which could lead to important contributions in a wide range of fields from atomic to molecular, chemical and condensed-matter physics.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102654	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102654													WOS:000502391000130
J	Lee, SB				Lee, Sang Bub			Influence of quenched disorder on discontinuous absorbing phase transition	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT												Influence of quenched disorder on critical behavior of the deterministic conserved threshold transfer process (DCTTP) was investigated. DCTTP is a variant of the conserved threshold transfer process modified such that active-particle hopping is deterministic and has been reported to exhibit discontinuous phase transition (Lee and Lee 2009 Phys. Rev. E 80 011106) in all considered dimensions, i.e. one, two, and four dimensions. Two disorder types were considered. First, while particle hopping on ordered sites is deterministic, hopping on disordered sites is subject to be stochastic, i.e. active particles on disordered sites hop to randomly selected neighboring sites. Second, disorder is assumed to be random dilution of lattice sites, i.e. particles cannot occupy disordered sites. The order parameter was found to be continuous for disorder of stochastic hopping, i.e. the first-order transition was rounded to the second-order transition for any small amount of disorder, whereas the transition remained first order but the critical exponent associated with the power law decrease of active-site densities varied for considerable amount of lattice site dilution. These results are consistent with predictions established for equilibrium n-vector spin systems.																			1742-5468					DEC	2019	2019	12							123201	10.1088/1742-5468/ab4bc1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/ab4bc1													WOS:000501156600001

YBaCuO bulk superconductors are fabricated by interior seeded melt growth. Because the seed crystal growth is based on a slow diffusion reaction, long-term heat treatment is required to fabricate a single crystal in order to improve the magnetic properties of the bulk YBaCuO superconductor. We fabricated a single-grain bulk YBaCuO superconductor by controlling the distance between the seed and the upper surface of the YBaCuO bulk. The magnetic levitation force and trapped magnetic field were measured for the YBaCuO superconducting bulk.

Through symbolic computation, the analytic N-soliton solutions are obtained for the system. The N-soliton solutions can be used to describe the multiple wrinkles in graphene sheets. Furthermore, wrinkle propagation and interaction are discussed. Snake-, V- and Z-like wrinkles are observed graphically by choosing the heat transmission function as three specific functions. A collision between wrinkles is elastic. Before and after the collision, wrinkle energy and propagation direction remain unchanged. But at collision points, the energy carried by the larger wrinkles will be subtracted.

It was clearly shown that quasi-equiaxed nanocrystallites of similar to 50-100 nm in diameter and nanorods of similar to 40-50 nm in diameter and up to similar to 700 nm in length can be generated with (NH4)(10)W12O41 center dot 5H(2)O and K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O as tungsten sources, respectively. Introducing Tar(2-) into the K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O reaction system effectively transformed the primary crystallites of ZnWO4 from nanorods into quasi-equiaxed nanocrystals (similar to 20-50 nm) and then nanoplates (thickness of similar to 20 nm, lateral size of similar to 200 nm) and, meanwhile, aggregated the crystallites into spheroidal clusters (similar to 2-3 mu m in diameter) with the increasing Tar(2-)/Zn2+ molar ratio up to similar to 2. Optical spectroscopy revealed that the ZnWO4 products exhibit broad-band photoluminescence (similar to 425-700 nm) through T-3(1u) -> (1)A(1g) transition of the [WO6](6-) ligand under short ultraviolet excitation and the nanorods show the best luminescence among all tested samples. Calcination at 500 degrees C may effectively remove the adsorbed Tar(2-) species and greatly improve luminescence of the samples synthesized in the presence of Tar(2-).

Based on the ballistic transport of electrons between two reservoirs across the QD, the Joule heat of the system was assumed to be generated from the Ohmic contacts between the QD and reservoirs. By using the transition rate equation, the performance of the QD refrigerator was studied with respect to the electron transmission probability and the partition ratio (i.e. the fraction of Joule heat generated in the system that releases into the cold reservoir). The analytical expression of the maximum coefficient of performance (COP) was obtained under the exoreversible working condition.

The integrated curved electrodes with the same curvature as the birdbath shell are embedded using a self-aligned process, which avoids the extra assembly process, ensures the symmetry and improves the driving capacity of the mu-BRG. The capacitive gap is defined by the sacrificial layer, and a uniform and small gap distance (2 mu m) between the curved electrodes and the birdbath shell is obtained. The mu-BRGs with a diameter of 1.2 mm and a thickness of 2 mu m have been demonstrated by employing boron-doped microcrystalline diamond films deposited using hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD). In this paper, the device structure and basic working principle of the gyroscope are described. The key steps in the fabrication process, such as isotropic wet etching of the bulk silicon for a birdbath mold, photoresist spray-coating for patterning the curved electrodes, and deposition and etching of diamond films, are considered in detail and well solved. The radial deviation of the etched birdbath mold is about 0.31% for the similar to 560 mu m radius shell and the surface roughness of the birdbath mold is favorable (Rq = 4.933 nm, Ra = 3.945 nm). The key techniques described in this paper can be applied to the fabrication of other 3D micro devices.					崔, 峰/ADE-5082-2022	Cui, Feng/0009-0009-9617-9124													0960-1317	1361-6439				DEC	2019	29	12							125004	10.1088/1361-6439/ab44fe	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6439/ab44fe													WOS:000503192300004

Monitoring LaMnO<sub>3</sub> Jahn-Teller distortion via electric-field gradient <i>ab initio</i> calculations	ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE												The electric field gradient (EFG) is studied via ab initio density functional theory calculations for the prototype LaMnO3 manganite under ferromagnetic and A-type antiferromagnetic configurations with different values of on-site Hubbard U potential correction on the Mn-3d states. It is shown that the relaxation of internal atomic positions inhibits fully activated MnO6 Jahn-Teller distortions, as determined by calculating the EFG tensor and the Jahn-Teller distortion parameter.. In fact, a strong correlation between the EFG values, especially at the La site, and the Jahn-Teller distortion was found and used to confirm the importance of an appropriate description of the electron-electron correlations when predicting the ground state properties of LaMnO3 using a GGA + U approximation for the exchange-correlation functional.

In this paper, an optical lens is designed to collect ultraviolet signal. In this paper, a corona detection method based on ultraviolet sensor and optical lens was proposed. The design of optical lens to concentrate the ultraviolet signal so as to suppress external interference was presented. By carrying out insulator corona discharge experiments, the feasibility of the proposed method was studied. Finally, a comparison and verification was made with the combination of corona discharge images collected by UV imager. Research results by this paper indicate that, when the detection distance is smaller than 5 m, and the power supply is about 700 V, the proposed corona detection method can effectively collect the ultraviolet rays generated by corona discharge, thus realizing the feasible recognition of corona discharge. Moreover, this method can feasibly reflect the changing of UV intensity with applied voltage and detection distance. The research results can provide important reference for the development and calibration of ultraviolet detection equipment.

J	Lyu, SL; Long, BW				Lyu, Songlin; Long, Bingwei			Triangle diagram in heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS G-NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS												The pion-baryon triangle diagram is inspected for a special kinematic region where the squared momentum transfer t is close to 4m2:t4m2m4/mN2<i. Instead of arguing on the ground of anomalous threshold, we investigate possible impacts on power counting. The pion can have very small energies, as opposed to m<i in the physical region, which allows all three propagators to be extremely near their mass shell and contributes significantly to the loop integral. We find that in this narrow kinematic window the static-limit approximation for the baryon propagator is invalid and the resummation of the kinetic energy is necessary. Interestingly, in contrast to low-energy two-baryon processes, this resummation of baryon recoils does not lead to overall enhancement of power counting of the diagram.

It is known that the system admits solutions which blow up in finite time and whose profiles are in a backward self-similar form of the familiar Burgers vortices.

Lift-off technique was used to prepare various testing mask patterns with dimensions ranging from 1 ?m to 15 ?m. The results of plasma etching utilizing 100?nm Al and Cu masks are compared. Radio frequency and inductively coupled pure oxygen plasma techniques were used to obtain the fine etched structures. A simple etching scheme describing the obtained results is presented for each type of plasma technique and mask type. Although the Al mask is widely believed to have outstanding properties over other metallic materials, we found that the Cu mask exhibits lower side edge etching for both types of plasma techniques. A formation of thick and crystalline copper oxide layer in contrast with thin amorphous aluminum oxide is believed to be the reason for this behavior. Consequently, the etched structures also possessed much better side wall angles which is a key parameter for micro-fabrication of boron doped diamond microelectrodes, microfluidics, sensors and microelectromechanical devices in general.

The static effects were acquired by, using the pressure dependences of these fluorescence peak positions. The static effects for the ten fluorescence peaks resulted in thermal blue shift, but the dynamic effects for all peaks except Y-7 led to thermal red shift. The observed nature of thermal shift (i.e. red or blue) of a fluorescence peak was due to competition between the static and dynamic effects. Based on an approximate treatment, the static parameter A (characterizing the static effect) and electron-phonon coupling parameter alpha' (characterizing the dynamic effect) for these fluorescence peaks were estimated in the case where therrhal shift curves from low temperature to near or higher than room temperature were not measured. Parameters A for all fluorescence peaks and alpha' for all peaks except Y-7 were comparable in sign and magnitude with those of the sharp luminescence peaks of other rare earth ions in crystals and so were deemed to be reasonable. The causes of the exception for alpha' of Y-7 spectral peak (including the very large observed thermal blue shift of this peak) remain unclear.																			0022-3697	1879-2553				DEC	2019	135								109101	10.1016/j.jpcs.2019.109101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpcs.2019.109101													WOS:000488419800034

XRD patterns showed a single YBa2Cu3O7-delta phase for all samples. The resistance versus temperature measurements showed that all samples exhibited metallic normal state behavior. The addition of Li2O3 suppressed the superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O7-delta more than Na2CO3 and K2CO3. The AC susceptibility measurements showed a decrease in T-c chi ' for Li2CO3 addition. T-c chi ' was not much affected with Na2CO3 and K2CO3 addition which was around 93-94 K for x = 0-1.0 wt%. However, T-c chi ' was very much suppressed in the Li2O3-added samples with T-c chi ' decreasing from 94 K for x = 0 to 83 K for x = 1.0 wt%. The peak temperature T-p of the imaginary part of the susceptibility chi '' shifted to lower temperatures for Li2CO3, Na2CO3 and K2CO3 addition. This indicated the intergranular coupling and flux pinning force were suppressed when alkali metal carbonate was added.

J	Muller, K				Muller, Kaitlyn (Voccola)			A REPRODUCING KERNEL HILBERT SPACE FRAMEWORK FOR INVERSE SCATTERING PROBLEMS WITHIN THE BORN APPROXIMATION	INVERSE PROBLEMS AND IMAGING												In this work we develop a new reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) framework for inverse scattering problems using the Born approximation. We assume we have backscattered data of a field that is dependent on an unknown scattering potential. Our goal is to reconstruct or image this scattering potential. Assuming the scattering potential lies in a RKHS, we find that the imaging equation can be rewritten as the inner product of the desired unknown function with the adjoint of the forward operator applied to the kernel of the imaging operator. We therefore may choose the kernel of the imaging operator such that the adjoint applied to this kernel is precisely the reproducing kernel of the Hilbert space the reflectivity function lies in. In this way we are able to obtain an alternative definition of an ideal image. We will demonstrate this theory using synthetic aperture radar imaging as an example, though there are other applicable imaging modalities i.e. inverse diffraction and diffraction tomography [1, 6]. We choose SAR as it was the motivating application for this work. We will compare the RKHS ideal imaging technique to the standard microlocal analytic ideal image from backprojection theory. Note this method requires a variation of the standard SAR data model with the assumption of a full two dimensional data collection surface as opposed to a one dimensional flight path, however we are able to perform imaging with a single frequency and avoid the approximations made in the backprojection imaging operator derivation.																			1930-8337	1930-8345				DEC	2019	13	6					1327	1348		10.3934/ipi.2019058	http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/ipi.2019058													WOS:000489305500008

Pulsating pipe flow instability perturbed by a trip wire	EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE												This study is concerned with the phenomenon of flow instability in the entrance region of a pulsating pipe flow perturbed by a trip wire at the inlet, where the flow was uniform at the core with a thin boundary layer on the wall. First of all, it is illustrated by a case without the installation of a trip wire that small disturbance developed in the accelerating phase of pulsation, which was well explained by the inflection-point instability mechanism Subsequently, one of the cases studied with the installation of a trip wire indicates that the inflection-point instability mechanism still played the key role, but the instability was promoted further upstream. On the other hand, there were cases of which the flow instability development was rather due to the viscous effect mainly which was decaying in a certain downstream region, followed by a renewal growth with irregular fluctuations.																			0894-1777	1879-2286				DEC	2019	109								109869	10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2019.109869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2019.109869													WOS:000490045700076

Polarization-dependent symmetry-breaking featuring a nonreciprocal intensity flow for different orthogonally polarized mode pairs operating in the BSW state are found. The singular state is hidden in a nonlinear system where a perfect mode-locked BSW state with a large amplitude correlation coefficient featuring reciprocal intensity flow is established for a transverse mode pair possessing particular polarization directions that are related to the intensity ratio of orthogonally polarized transverse eigenmodes. Self-organized chaos synchronization is shown to take place for such a single pair of transverse modes subjected to self-mixing modulations.																			1612-2011	1612-202X				DEC	2019	17	12							125001	10.1088/1612-202X/ab5573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1612-202X/ab5573													WOS:000499387900001
J	Pan, LS; Lou, J; Li, HY; Kang, CW				Pan, Lun Sheng; Lou, Jing; Li, Hong Ying; Kang, Chang Wei			Mass transition and mass diffusion coefficients in a diffuse interface model	PHYSICA SCRIPTA												The purpose of this paper is to determine the mass transition and mass diffusion coefficients in the diffuse interface model. By means of the thermodynamic probabilities of molecules transiting (phase change) and shifting (diffusing), the rate of mass transition and the mass diffusion flux are derived first. By comparing them with the corresponding formulas in the diffuse interface model, the two coefficients are then obtained. The mass transition coefficient is proportional to the rate of molecular unidirectional transition under the mutual equilibrium of liquid and vapor species. The mass diffusion coefficient is proportional to the rate of molecular unidirectional travel through a unit surface under the condition that two local elements at two sides of the surface are in mutual equilibrium. This diffusion coefficient can finally be expressed as the product of the Fick concentration diffusion coefficient and the mixing density besides an energy (or temperature) factor. The Fick coefficient obtained at present is reduced to the self-diffusion coefficient at the gas boundary of the binary mixing layer and becomes the Fick diffusion coefficient of gas in pure liquid at the liquid boundary. The present coefficients (including Fick coefficient) are different from the existing ones in the literature.

For thicknesses above 2.4 nm vortex configurations become the lowest energy states. However for the thickness range 1.5-2.5 nm "leaf", vortex and "C" state configurations have comparable energies and can be all stabilized as the energy barriers that separate them are substantial (209 k(B)T to 401 k(B)T) and much larger than their energy differences. Therefore in ordered arrays of such elements different states could be simultaneously present depending on the local interactions and previous history. In view of their use as tunable magnonic metamaterials the high frequency response of each configuration is micromagnetically simulated. The resonance frequencies in single elements as well as for arrays, and the localized spin wave modes that correspond to each resonance, are extracted for each of the low energy micromagnetic states.

The electrodynamic process of charged particles in plasma with a magnetic field can help analyze the formation mechanism of ionospheric electric field and current so that the ionospheric electric field intensity and current density can be simulated and studied. Furthermore, by establishing partial differential equations in magnetic dipole coordinates, electric current density in mid- and low-latitude ionosphere can be calculated by means of a series of more reasonable boundary conditions in this article. Besides, the wind drag and particles diffusion are taken into account to make the results more accurate. The electric field value fitted by the empirical model is used to verify the rationality of current density calculated indirectly. Through this theoretical model, the distribution of electric fields and currents in ionosphere has been carefully studied. In addition, several physical elements influencing the current value and direction are also studied, including external environmental factors, such as solar activity and geomagnetic index, as well as the internal factors, such as electrons and ions temperature. These works will be a great help in the future for the precise determination of ionospheric currents.					peng, yunfan/AAG-9167-2020	Sun, Liguo/0000-0002-3129-5097													0093-3813	1939-9375				DEC	2019	47	12					5324	5333		10.1109/TPS.2019.2953940	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2019.2953940													WOS:000502759400015
J	Pollock, MD				Pollock, M. D.			On scale invariance, the Milne universe and induced gravity	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS												We discuss the notion of global scale invariance, as realized in the theory of induced gravity , whereby the Newton gravitational constant GN is generated from the expectation value of a scalar field phi. Assuming the Friedmann space-time ds2=dt2-a2(t)dx2, where the radius function is of the form a=(t/t0)2/3 gamma, and a power-law field phi=phi 0tn and matter energy-density source rho m=rho otm, which imply that m=-2 gamma m/gamma being the matter adiabatic index, conditions are derived for the positivity of epsilon. In the special case of the Milne universe, defined by gamma=2/3, which is also the string equation of state, the line element is invariant under global coordinate transformations t -> t=zeta t. There is then no creation of particle-anti-particle pairs, nor, analogously in the superstring theory, of string-anti-string pairs. These results follow from the correspondence principle, the respective classical wave states propagating without amplification or attenuation. Some aspects of scale and modular invariance of the superstring are also described.																			2190-5444					DEC	2019	134	12							612	10.1140/epjp/i2019-12930-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjp/i2019-12930-5													WOS:000501202000001

A dedicated methodology for irreversible compression of Gravitational Waves Sound with high quality reconstruction	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												A dedicated method for irreversible compression of Gravitational Waves Sound with high quality recovery is proposed. The performance is tested on the sound signal which has been produced with the first gravitational wave that was detected, and on 36 theoretically generated signals. The approach is based on a model for data reduction rendering high quality approximation of the signals. The reduction of dimensionality is achieved by selecting elementary components from a redundant dictionary.

S-Ge/Si semiconductor (as known as low tensile strained Ge grown on Si substrate) has a higher carrier mobility when compared with unstrained-Ge or Si material, so that s-Ge/Si is appropriate for the production of high-speed circuit. At the same time, transformation from indirect bandgap semiconductor Ge into Pseudo-Direct bandgap semiconductor (which is also called PD-Ge) will be happen after s-Ge/Si is heavy doped, which makes LED produced of PD-Ge material perform a higher luminous efficiency because the radiative recombining probability of carriers in PD-Ge material is greatly improved compared with unstrained one. Taking the advantages referred of s-Ge/Si into account, s-Ge/Si has the potential to PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration. Carrier mobility of the semiconductor is one of the key physical parameters during the design and simulation of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integrated system. While as far as the authors are aware, carrier mobility model of s-Ge/Si is still rarely reported to date. In view of that all above, based on the E-k relation in both conduction band and valence band of s-Ge/Si material, the analytical models of physical parameters in energy band are established, and the models are verified by experiments. Then the s-Ge/Si carrier models are further established based on our band structure model, and the Monte Carlo method is used to verify our s-Ge/Si carrier mobility model. The quantificational results of our paper will help understand s-Ge/Si material physics and provide an important theoretical basis for the design of PD-Ge monolithic optoelectronic integration.

Exploring Friction with the Ancient Egyptians	PHYSICS TEACHER												We devised an activity to explore friction by testing some of the common theories on how ancient Egyptians moved the stones used to build the pyramids. The activity is suitable for a high school physics course or introductory college courses for both science majors and non-science majors. The students investigate dragging a 1-kg mass (representing a stone) on a small wooden sled under three conditions: over dry sand, using wooden rollers over dry sand, and over wet sand. This last condition has been recently proposed as a potential method used by the Egyptians. The force required to pull the sled at a constant velocity is measured and used to calculate the kinetic coefficient of friction for each of the three test conditions. Students then perform a similar activity pulling their professor across a sand volleyball court. Versions of this experiment have been done in four classes of science majors (general physics, two 2-hour lab periods) and in four classes of non-science majors (physical sciences for educators, one 2-hour lab period).																			0031-921X					DEC	2019	57	9					624	626		10.1119/1.5135794	http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.5135794													WOS:000500003600013

An asymmetry in specific heat curves and peak positions is observed for the hole- and electron-doped cuprates. Existence of a metallic phase is detected for positive t '/t for V/t <= 4J. Entropy calculation shows the system goes to a more disordered state with negative t '/t and V/t. A non-Fermi liquid behavior is revealed at low temperatures for positive t ' and small values of V .

Non-diffusive angular momentum transport in rotating <i>z</i>-pinches	JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS												The stability of conducting Taylor-Couette flows under the presence of toroidal magnetic background fields is considered. For strong enough magnetic amplitudes such magnetohydrodynamic flows are unstable against non-axisymmetric perturbations which may also transport angular momentum. In accordance with the often used diffusion approximation, one expects the angular momentum transport to be vanishing for rigid rotation. In the sense of a non-diffusive Lambda effect, however, even for rigidly rotating z-pinches, an axisymmetric angular momentum flux appears which is directed outward (inward) for large (small) magnetic Mach numbers. The internal rotation in a magnetized rotating tank can thus never be uniform. Those particular rotation laws are used to estimate the value of the instability-induced eddy viscosity for which the non-diffusive Lambda effect and the diffusive shear-induced transport compensate each other. The results provide the Shakura & Sunyaev viscosity ansatz leading to numerical values linearly growing with the applied magnetic field.

J	Sakolowski, A				Sakolowski, Andrzej			Applying Structural Mathematics in Physics: Case of Parallel Connection	PHYSICS TEACHER												Research identifies two domains by which mathematics allows learning physics concepts: a technical domain that includes algorithmic operations that lead to solving formulas for an unknown quantity and a structural domain that allows for applying mathematical knowledge for structuring physical phenomena. While the technical domain requires employing only students' technical skills, the structural domain requires activating students' algebraic reasoning and applying it to learn more about physical systems beyond evaluating formulas. Students' technical skills in mathematics do not convert into structural skills automatically, and this is perceived as an obstacle that prevents complete appreciation of physics knowledge. There can be various ways to activate or to develop students' mathematical structural domain in physics. Most common are: (a) mathematical modeling that involves experimental activities concluding with algebraic relations; (b) stimulating students to work with symbols in limiting situations; or (c) developing the understanding of physics formulas (e.g., see Ref. 5). While all these methods are valuable, students still face difficulties with transferring their structural math skills to physics, thus new attempts are made. The process of developing students' algebraic structural skills proposed in this paper is a combination of the current approaches; however, as a means of developing mathematical reasoning, a mathematical structure is used that is derived from a physics formula. More specifically, this paper presents an attempt to interpret formula for the equivalent resistance of a parallel electric circuit using the properties of a rational function. Such formulated aim reflects not only recommendations of the physics education research community but also mathematics because it guides students in how to merge mathematical knowledge with the behavior of a physical system to learn more about the system.																			0031-921X					DEC	2019	57	9					627	629		10.1119/1.5135795	http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.5135795													WOS:000500003600014

The Brukner-Taylor-Cheung-Vedral (BTCV) time-like form of the Bell-CHSH inequality [1, 2] is employed as an eavesdropping check; sequential measurements lead to an inequality identical in form to the Bell-CHSH inequality, which relies only on the measurements performed with no regard for the qubit states. We show that this form manifests naturally from the non-commutativity of observables.																			1533-7146					DEC	2019	19	15-16					1279	1293																WOS:000498906000002

Analytical iterative method for weakly interacting quantum systems	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D												In quantum physics, it is common to be confronted with some counter-intuitive behavior of a quantum system, and knowing the analytical representation of the solution can be providential. However, obtaining the analytical solution in most of the cases is a difficult task, especially when the quantum system has many states. Here, we report how an iterative method can be used to attain the analytical form of an approximate solution for weakly interacting quantum systems using a generic N-level atom as example.

J	Schlottmann, P				Schlottmann, P.			Edge singularities in the one-dimensional Bariev model	NUCLEAR PHYSICS B												Bariev's model for correlated hopping in one dimension is integrable and soluble within the framework of two nested Bethe Ansatze. For repulsive interaction and finite magnetization the low energy excitation spectrum is a two-component Luttinger liquid with conformal charges c = 1. In zero magnetic field the spectrum of spin excitations is gapped. For higher energy excitations the single-hole (single-particle) spectral functions display edge singularities that deviate from those expected from a Luttinger liquid. The system can be described as a mobile impurity coupled to the Luttinger liquid yielding an effective x-ray edge type model. Using the Bethe Ansatz solution for repulsive interaction we obtain expressions for the critical exponents for the single-particle and single-hole Green's functions in zero magnetic field.

The near-field plasmon interactions in individual silver nanowire pairs induce MPPs. The 1D PC consisting of dielectric multilayer stacks with alternating refractive indices forms a PBG in the reflection spectrum. When the position of the PBG of the 1D PC is tuned to be close to the MPPs, the MPPs and the PBG can couple together to lead to a hybrid mode within the PBG. At the hybrid mode resonance, the magnetic fields in the center of Ag nanowire pairs are enhanced to nearly 4.3 times larger than those in the nanowire pair array directly lying on a substrate.

Material safety should be considered in biomedical devices, but the effectiveness of electrospun nanofibers is limited with only the approved chemicals. Therefore, we considered the material in FDA-approved polymers and solvents and developed nanofibers using the general additives in the pharmaceutical industry, such as hypromellose, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and Gellan. The nanofiber, mainly composed of hypromellose and PVA, was applied to a local peptide drug delivery system. Electrostatically complexed Gellan and peptide were loaded in the nanofiber by co-electrospinning. The morphology of the nanofibers with different PVA blending ratios was visualized by scanning electron microscope. The nanofiber composed of only hydrophilic polymers quickly wetted in water and became a transparent gel-like lump. A drug release test of peptide-loaded nanofiber was performed resulted in 37% of initial burst release suppression with the gellan and peptide loaded nanofiber compared with solely peptide loaded hypromellose nanofiber. In addition, higher PVA blending to hypromellose was slightly effective for sustained release of peptide compared with pure peptide-loaded hypromellose nanofiber. Therefore, we suggest the potential application of hypromellose/PVA nanofiber-loaded Gellan/peptide complex to a mucosal layer drug delivery patch.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				DEC	2019	19	12					7920	7925		10.1166/jnn.2019.16860	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.16860								31196310					WOS:000473105800057

A photo-definable organic-inorganic dielectric material called polysilsesquioxane (PSSQ) has been studied in this work. The photo-definable PSSQ dielectric allows a simultaneous UV patterning and curing process. A PSSQ sample was prepared by spin-coating on a 6-in. Si wafer, pre-baking at 100 degrees C for 5 min, UV exposure, and then PGMA developing. The cured PSSQ films have a dielectric constant from 2.0 to 2.38 and dielectric loss from 0.0001 to 0.005. In addition, the 2 mu m line patterns were obtained after 10 min of UV exposure. It has been demonstrated that PSSQ dielectric materials can provide excellent process capability of simultaneous UV patterning and curing process.

J	Spalek, D				Spalek, D.			Generalization of Maxwell Stress Tensor Method for Magnetically Anisotropic Regions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS												This article comments on the Maxwell stress tensor method for force calculation in magnetically anisotropic regions. Force acting on the magnetically isotropic region can be always represented by means of Maxwell stress tensor surface integral. However, the magnetic anisotropy causes the asymmetry of Maxwell stress tensor. Subsequently, the force cannot be always evaluated by the surface integral of the Maxwell stress tensor, only. This article points out that the surface integral has to be often supplemented by the volume integral of a defined residual vector. The residual vector does not vanish in the case of anisotropy and has to be incorporated into the Maxwell stress tensor method. Appropriate examples of force evaluations for anisotropic ball levitating in the electromagnetic field are presented. The total force value is four times checked by Maxwell stress tensor modified method (for cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems), sum of physical components (Lorentz and material forces), and coenergy method, subsequently.

Two optical blockades are created at individual wavelengths of two probe fields in presence of one single strong standing-wave field. On one hand, ultra-narrow transmission windows are produced for probe pulse field 1 when probe field 2 is so strong as a controlling field in EIT configuration. The system can be designed as a phase-reverter of weak probe field 1 and can perform temporal differentiation calculation to it because a pi phase shift is created. On the other hand, the blockade at probe field 2 can be burst in two-photon resonance configuration when probe field 1 becomes strong and saturated absorption takes effect. So a two-photon switching is also expected in this standing-wave-dressed atomic system. The scheme has a potential for an all-optical transistor in quantum logical circuits.					zhang, rui/HZI-0079-2023														0306-8919	1572-817X				DEC	2019	51	12							384	10.1007/s11082-019-2066-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11082-019-2066-7													WOS:000497649500002

Analysis of emission properties of intermixed InGaN/GaN quantum wells using a concentration-dependent interdiffusion model	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D												Intermixing phenomenon that occurs in quantum structures offers an effective way to manipulate the energy bandgap profile of emitting materials. In this paper, a numerical analysis of the concentration-dependent indium interdiffusion in InGaN/GaN quantum-disk-in-nanowires light-emitting devices is presented. The numerical model couples the concentration-dependent interdiffusion equations to Schrodinger's equation to determine the effect of intermixing process on emission properties of single and double quantum well structures. The details of the developed Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) solution algorithm and its stability analysis are presented. The main model parameters are calibrated using experimental data. Simulation results show that, consistent with experimental observations, longer annealing times or higher annealing temperatures result in progressive blue shifts in the eigen-energies with strong dependence on indium concentration profile. This simulation tool provides invaluable insight into the intermixing process and helps in device design procedures.

J	Tan, J				Tan, Jing			Design and Simulation of Cloud Computing Intelligent Routing Algorithms Based on Optical Network	JOURNAL OF NANOELECTRONICS AND OPTOELECTRONICS												In the current communication technology, optical technology has been applied to the network to obtain optical network technology. Among them, optical network technology is optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), which can play a larger transmission capacity under lower energy consumption. Further breakthroughs in intelligent optical networks require improvements in routing issues. In this study, firstly, the optical network architecture is analyzed, including wavelength division multiplexing optical network and elastic optical network. Then, the routing problem in optical networks is analyzed, and the main factors affecting the routing problem are extracted. On the basis of studying the energy consumption characteristics of data centers and WDM optical networks, and considering the characteristics of cloud service configuration, evolutionary game theory and optical bypass theory are introduced to obtain an intelligent routing algorithm for cloud computing based on optical networks, and energy consumption tests are carried out on data transmission and processing. In order to reduce the overall energy consumption, the use of IP routers is reduced, and the idle data servers are shut down. Then, it is found that the total energy consumption increases slowly at different times. The energy consumption of evolutionary game theory is compared. Compared with non-evolutionary game theory, the optimized intelligent routing algorithm makes the energy consumption more stable, while reducing the use of servers can further reduce the good expenditure. The proposed algorithm is oriented to optical network, which solves the problem of low overall utilization of network resources and improves the service quality of cloud services.																			1555-130X	1555-1318				DEC	2019	14	12					1717	1724		10.1166/jno.2019.2698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jno.2019.2698													WOS:000495610700010

High performance graphene-like thinly layered graphite based visible light photodetector	OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS												In this work, the drop casting method is utilized to obtain a thin graphene-like graphite layer as a photodetection layer on a SiO2/Si substrate, and its performance is characterized to determine its potential use in commercial applications. The thin layer is formed by first synthesizing graphite soot from a butane flame before being turned into a liquid solution and drop-casted onto the substrate to form a thin graphene-like graphite film. Field emission scanning electron microscope and Raman vibrational mode analyses indicate that the fabricated graphene-like graphite layer has characteristics similar to the graphene. The graphene-like graphite photodetector demonstrates a narrow photoresponse from 530 to 680 nm, covering visible sources from green to red. The responsivity and external quantum efficiency of the device under the illumination of red laser 660 nm is found to be around 148 mA W-1 and 27.8% respectively and is faster than that reported for similar systems using graphene and reduced graphene oxide previously. A fast response time of 83.7 and 28 mu s at a modulation frequency of 1.0 and 10000 Hz respectively from the graphene-like thinly layered graphite photodetector shows potential application for the development of low-cost carbon-based photodetectors in near future.

Abrupt changes in air pressure in the vicinity of a conductor with flowing electric current	EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE												A change of thermodynamic parameters of surrounding air is experimentally investigated in the vicinity of metal conductor in which electric current flows. Substantial variations of pressure that are comparable with large meteorological variations are experimentally observed upon flowing a direct current pulse with a small amplitude and alternating currents of an industrial frequency through the conductor. Such significant and fast variations of the pressure occur at the instant the current in the conductor changes. Even current pulses with a short duration influence the pressure distinctly. Jumps of the pressure are experimentally observed in an investigated volume upon both building up the current amplitude and switching off the current pulse. These jumps are not typical for a usual cooling or heating of air mixture. It is expected that an exact correspondence between current pulses and the pressure variations makes it possible to create new technical equipment.

Conducting indium oxide films on plastic substrates by plasma enhanced reactive thermal evaporation	THIN SOLID FILMS												This work reports on low temperature deposition of conducing indium oxide films by a radio-frequency plasma enhanced reactive thermal evaporation (rf-PERTE) technique. The films were deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) without intentional heating of the substrate and at elevated temperatures up to 150 degrees C. The material stoichiometry was accurately controlled by adjusting deposition conditions including the oxygen flow, process pressure, pumping speed, and RF-power. Besides, fine turning of the critical deposition parameters during the deposition was implemented by measuring the variation of film conductance in-situ. The film morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Hall effect measurements were also performed to determine the relation between the deposition conditions and the electrical properties of the films.

J	Wang, JB; Huang, R; Wen, YH				Wang, Jin-Bo; Huang, Rao; Wen, Yu-Hua			Thermally activated phase transitions in Fe-Ni core-shell nanoparticles	FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS												Fe-Ni core-shell nanoparticles are versatile functional materials, and their thermal stabilities are crucial for their performances in operating conditions. In this study, the thermodynamic behaviors of Fe-Ni core-shell nanoparticles are examined under continuous heating. The solid-solid phase transition from body centered cubic (bcc) to face centered cubic (fcc) in the Fe core is identified. The transition is accompanied with the generation of stacking faults around the core-shell interface, which notably lowers the melting points of the Fe-Ni core-shell nanoparticles and causes even worse thermal stability compared with Ni ones. Moreover, the temperature of the structural transformation is shown to be tuned by modifying the Ni shell thickness. Finally, the stress distributions of the core and the shell are also explored. The relevant results could be helpful for the design, preparation, and utilization of Fe-based nanomaterials.

J	Wang, MQ; Lou, SQ				Wang, Mingqing; Lou, Shuqin			A feasible order-arbitrarily-tunable optical differentiator	OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS												We propose a feasible temporal filtering (or spectrum weighting) system to implement optical differentiation with arbitrarily-tunable order. Differentiation order is tuned by programming the temporal weighting mask (TWM) as power function of different exponents, not limited by the structure of the system. Assembly of the system is feasible, since the active parts are implemented by electro-optic elements and some key elements are reused between sub-systems involved in the scheme. Tuning of the system is simple, since electronically pre-stored TWMs are easy to switch among each other. The order-tunable functionality is verified by numerically testing the differentiation cases of normalized input pulse duration ranging from 0.1 to 0.4, and of differentiation order tuned from 1 to 10. Good accuracy is achieved, and measured by root mean square error lower than 0.1. Feasibilities of the system are also verified in terms of accuracy maintaining and distortion avoiding. Compared with existing methods, apart from the arbitrary order-tunable capacity and good accuracy, our proposed optical differentiator also possesses properties of good compactness and constant complexity. The proposed differentiator has unique applications on multi-peak waveform generation for optical communications and photonics-aided Radars with enhanced agility and feasibility.

Tunability of the Andreev reflection induced by the Majorana zero mode	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER												The Andreev reflection induced by Majorana zero mode (MZM) is theoretically investigated, by considering the existence of two coupling manners between the MZM and normal metallic lead, i.e., the direct coupling and the indirect coupling via a quantum dot. We find that in the noninteracting or weak-Coulomb cases, the low-bias conductance can be modulated by the interplay among the structural parameters. As a result, the conductance peak at the zero-bias limit has an opportunity to change into antiresonance in the case of appropriate structural parameters. When strong intrados Coulomb interaction is taken into account, the zero-bias conductance tends to show up as one peak with its width tightly related to the level, Coulomb strength, and the Zeeman splitting of the quantum dot. We believe that this work is helpful for ascertaining the signature of MZM in the Andreev reflection spectrum.					wang, xd/A-9986-2011; wang, xiaomin/JAO-2381-2023														0921-4526	1873-2135				DEC 1	2019	574								311658	10.1016/j.physb.2019.08.035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physb.2019.08.035													WOS:000488767900006

Impact of sensor housing geometries on transient stagnation pressure measurements in impulse facilities	EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE												The measurement of transient stagnation pressure in impulse facilities, such as shock tubes and expansion tubes, is critical due to the limited experimental time window. In the present study, we investigate the characteristic behavior of pressure sensors shielded by blunt and conical housings, and evaluate the specific influence of the housing dimensions on the stagnation pressure measurement in distinct flow conditions. Pressure signals of piezoelectric sensors were acquired and schlieren images visualizing the wave dynamics were recorded. We conducted additional numerical simulations to support our hypotheses concerning the flow inside the housings. Results indicate that the pressure signal for conical housings exhibits longer rise time and more pronounced oscillations compared to that for blunt housings. Enlarging the borehole diameter and reducing the cavity depth both shorten signal rise time but enhance overshoots. Additional experiments on the sensitivity to assembly misalignment, the effect of gelatin-filled housings and the performance of exposed sensors complete the study.

Detection of torque effects in Co/Pt via ferromagnetic resonance	AIP ADVANCES					64th Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials (MMM)	NOV 04-08, 2019	Las Vegas, NV					Charge-current-induced torque effects on the magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic/metal bilayer is interesting from the aspect of fundamental physics as well as the applications in spintronic devices. The torque-induced variation of damping constant of magnetization can be foreseen from the change of the linewidth of ferromagnetic resonance spectrum. The Oersted torque (tau Oe) and current-induced torque (tau C) are induced by charge current; while the spin-orbit torque (tau SO) and field-like torque (tau FL) are induced by spin current. However, the torque effects often were hindered due to the heating-induced artifacts. In this work, we particularly pay attention to minimize the Joule heating effects in order to investigate the intrinsic torque effects in cobalt (Co)/platinum (Pt) bilayer with an applied charge current ranging from -60 to 60 mA. In this range, the Oersted field is estimated as 0.25 Oe which is much smaller than the experimental result of Delta Hr (similar to 0.7 Oe), implying some contribution from the spin-current induced field like torque. The current-polarization-induced asymmetry of linewidth Delta W, Delta W equivalent to W+Jc-W-Jc, increases from 0 to 0.15 with Jc changing from 0 to 60 mA, which is attributed to the spin-orbit torque.

As an illustrative example, we consider the Ablowitz-Ladik system posed on a graph that is constituted by N semi-infinite lattices (edges) connected through some boundary conditions. We first show that analyzing this problem is equivalent to analyzing a certain matrix IBV problem; then we employ the unified transform method (UTM) to analyze this matrix IBV problem. We also compare our results with some previously known studies. In particular, we show that the inverse scattering method (ISM) for the integrable DDEs on the set of integers can be recovered from the UTM applied to our N = 2 graph problem as a particular case, and the non-local reductions of integrable DDEs can be obtained as local reductions from our results.																			0951-7715	1361-6544				DEC	2019	32	12					4729	4761		10.1088/1361-6544/ab36f2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6544/ab36f2													WOS:000495746700001

The impacts of group velocity dispersion (GVD) on ultrafast pulse shaping in a time-lens system based on four-wave mixing are explored in this paper. The output signals of temporal magnification and time-to-frequency conversion under different GVDs are theoretically investigated in detail. The simulation results imply that the femtosecond pulse is sensitive to GVD in propagation. GVD has an important effect on nonlinear parametric processes, which results in output signals presenting different pulse shapes and different frequency profiles. Furthermore, a model of silicon nitride waveguide with flat dispersion is proposed by finite element method and signal processing with negligible pulse distortion is realized in near-infrared region.

J	Xu, C; Hui, PM				Xu, C.; Hui, P. M.			Emergence of cooperation in finite populations under biased selection	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												We study the effects of biased selection on evolutionary games in finite populations. Biased selection is induced by including a number of invariant agents, who do not evolve, into an otherwise competing and evolving population. The invariant agents react differently when they encounter different types of variant agents, helping the cooperators to attain a higher payoff than the defectors by a difference d. The probability of a single cooperator invading and taking over a population of all defectors is evaluated based on the Moran process. When M invariant agents are introduced into the evolving population of size N, their presence helps promote the replacement of defectors by cooperators, in comparison with the case of unbiased selection with M = 0. While the prisoner's dilemma cannot sustain a cooperative population without the invariant agents, it is possible for cooperation to emerge with biased selection. We show that for a given N (M), there is a threshold of M (N) above (below) which an initial population of all defectors evolve into one of all cooperators. The dependence of the threshold on the game's payoffs, intensity of selection, and the values of M and d is studied. Beyond the prisoner's dilemma, biased selection also promotes cooperation in a bigger part of payoff parameter space corresponding to other types of games. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Then, the spatial distribution of electron number density at different moments on the north side of the explosion point generated by delayed gamma-rays and delayed beta-rays from the radioactive cloud under the influence of the geomagnetic field was calculated by solving chemical reaction kinetics equations. The impact of radio communication in the different frequency bands on the process of atmospheric ionization was also studied. The numerical results of the high-altitude nuclear explosion (120 km high and with a 1 megaton equivalent at 40 degrees N latitude) indicated that the peak of electron number density ionized delayed gamma-rays is located at a height of approximately 100 km and that of electron number density ionized delayed beta-rays is about 90 km high. After 1 min of explosion, the radio communication in the medium frequency (MF) and high-frequency (HF) bands was completely interrupted, and the energy attenuation of the radio wave in the very high-frequency (VHF) band was extremely high. Five minutes later, the VHF radio communication was basically restored, but the energy attenuation in the HF band was still high. After 30 min, the VHF radio communication returned to normal, but its influence on the HF and MF radio communication continued.																			1001-8042	2210-3147				DEC	2019	30	12							179	10.1007/s41365-019-0703-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41365-019-0703-2													WOS:000499622200001

Local Algorithms for Minimizing the Force Field for 3D Representation of Macromolecules	COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS AND MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS												The majority of problems in structural computational biology require minimization of the energy function (force field) defined on the molecule geometry. This makes it possible to determine properties of molecules, predict the correct arrangement of protein chains, find the best molecular docking for complex formation, verify hypotheses concerning the protein design, and solve other problems arising in modern drug development. In the case of low-molecular compounds (consisting of less than 250 atoms), the problem of finding the geometry that minimizes the energy function is well studied. The minimization of macromolecules (in particular, proteins) consisting of tens of thousands of atoms is more difficult. However, a distinctive feature of statements of these problems is that initial approximations that are close to the solution are often available. Therefore, the original problem can be formulated as a problem of nonconvex optimization in the space of about variables. The complexity of computing the function and its gradient is quadratic in the number variables. A comparative analysis of gradient-free methods with gradient-type methods (gradient descent, fast gradient descent, conjugate gradient, and quasi-Newton methods) in their GPU implementations is carried out.

The n-ZnO/p-Cu2O controlled current, and the p-Cu2O/n-ZnS:Mn generated hot electrons. The electrical characteristics of each junction demonstrated those of the p?n junction, and the driving voltage was divided into both the junctions. 98% of the driving voltage was applied to the hot-electron generation junction. Electroluminescence was obtained at approximately 20V, because the local electric field at the junction accelerated electrons.

In this paper, a novel multiplier-free maximum-a-posteriori-probability (MAP) detection scheme is proposed and verified in dual-polarization (DP) 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) Nyquist-WDM systems. Based on the innovative technique of approximate calculation of Euclidean distance, the competitive performance is obtained in terms of pattern-dependent impairments mitigation. Besides, the computational complexity (CC) is drastically reduced to about 34%, as the multiplier of the proposed MAP detection is completely removed. Comprehensive simulation results of triple-carrier Nyquist DP 16-QAM demonstrate that the MAP scheme could effectively mitigate the tight filtering and fiber nonlinearity impairments with much lower CC, i.e., achieve desirable SE and nonlinearity tolerance in long-haul transmissions. In addition, a 1.1 dB reduction of the required OSNR and 2.6 dB launch power range extension are observed in the triple-carrier 480 Gb/s Nyquist DP 16-QAM back-to-back and 700 km transmission experiments, respectively. The advantages of the proposed low-complexity MAP scheme make it a preferable impairment mitigation technique for practical Nyquist-WDM systems.

The total energy of N-doped nanoribbons is the same as that of the pristine graphene nanoribbons, irrespective of the edge hydrogenation, and gradually decreases with increasing nanoribbon width. We also found that the edge hydrogenation decrease and increase the stability of the N-doped graphene nanoribbons with armchair and zigzag edges, respectively.

We find the sell-side security analysts' recommendation revisions (both upgrade and downgrade) do have large-size trades trend effect which means that the large-size trades have persistent change (being larger or smaller) after the recommendation revisions; the downgrade revisions have much greater impacts on large-size trades. We further analyze the large-size trades' power-law behaviors and the relaxation exponents show that downgrade recommendation revisions have greater impacts on the large-size trade than the upgrade recommendation revisions. The downgrade recommendation revisions have greater impacts on selling order of large-size trades relative to buying orders of large-size trades while the results do not give the consistent evidence that the upgrade recommendation revisions have greater impacts on the buying orders of large-size trades.																			0219-4775	1793-6780				DEC	2019	18	4							1950018	10.1142/S0219477519500184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219477519500184													WOS:000498068200002

J	Zhang, P				Zhang, Peng			Study on EEBS for linewidth imaging by a Monte Carlo method	RESULTS IN PHYSICS												A systematic analysis about the influences of electron beam focusing on scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging for silicon (Si) trapezoidal lines was performed based on a sophisticated Monte Carlo (MC) simulation program. It was found that the focus position and the aperture angle highly affect the final quality of SEM imaging. The effective electron beam shape (EEBS) is hence suggested as the broadening function to overcome this issue for theoretical analysis, rather than the widely-used Gaussian profile. However, EEBS is hardly acquired due to it strongly depends on both the sample topography and the electron beam focusing condition, which make it is impossible to be applied in practical analysis. An approach is proposed to find a best-fit traditional Gaussian profile, which can optimally replace the EEBS in the case of the same sample structure and experimental condition for establishing a database of the parameter in traditional Gaussian profile. Experimenters will benefit from this database to obtain true line-scan profiles for accurate gate linewidth measurement. This investigated result could greatly improve the accuracy of linewidth measurement.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102712	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102712													WOS:000502391000187

The proposed MPF using directly modulation-based optical source is more flexible and simple than using an external modulation-based optical frequency comb source. A theoretical model describing the principle of the proposed MPF is derived, which is confirmed by experimental results. Under different modulation and injection parameters, we present a numerical simulation of the frequency response of the proposed MPF. With no discernible tones, the proposed MPF is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept experiment. A single passband is achieved, which can be continuously tuned from 1 to 30 GHz. Further, self-phase modulation is explored in the optical domain to broaden the spectrum of gain-switched optical pulses and narrow down the bandwidth of the MPF passband.

The abnormal degradation and leakage current induced by hot carrier stress on the front gate are observed. The reason is that the silicon nanoclusters formed by silicon ion implantation can capture a large number of hot electrons during the stress. The effect of silicon ion implantation depth on this anomalous degradation is also investigated. Implantation closer to the interface of top silicon and buried oxide layer leads to more metastable traps and thus to varying degrees of degradation.																			0026-2714					DEC	2019	103								113509	10.1016/j.microrel.2019.113509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microrel.2019.113509													WOS:000500386300008

Nickel-based superalloy was used with two types of processing states: the original forged sample and the sample under the standard T1 heat treatment. At room temperature and a loading force of 10 N, the average friction coefficient of the T1 heat-treated specimen is 0.61, which was lower than that of the forged sample (0.78). The wear rate of this specimen was also lower than that of the forged sample at the same temperature and loading force. Thus, T1 heat treatment can significantly improve the wear resistance of the alloy because of gamma' phase and carbides. The wear rate was the minimum at 550 degrees C and increased again at 750 degrees C dominated by the formation and flake-off of the oxide film.

J	Cho, Y; Chang, HS				Cho, YoungJoon; Chang, Hyo Sik			Change in atomic layer deposited Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> passivation characteristics by ozone concentration	THIN SOLID FILMS												We investigated the effect on passivation performance of ozone-based Al2O3 thin films grown by atomic layer deposition due to the increase in ozone concentration; ozone concentration was varied from 150 g/Nm(3) to 330 g/Nm(3). We found that the carrier lifetime and implied open-circuit voltage (iV(oc)) increased as the ozone concentration increased in the as-deposited condition. Although the passivation performance after annealing also improved and had a maximum value in the low ozone concentration region (<250 g/Nm(3), 17 wt%), it showed a reverse trend compared to the as-deposited sample in the high ozone concentration region (>250 g/ Nm(3)) as the ozone concentration increased. The maximum values of carrier lifetime and iV(oc) obtained in the low ozone concentration region are 1.4 ms and 656 mV, respectively. The improved values in the low ozone concentration region are attributed to a decrease in carbon and increase in hydrogen at the Al2O3/Si interface after forming gas annealing. As a result, the interfacial trap density in the low ozone concentration region was enhanced than that of the high ozone concentration region after annealing.

The constrictions are S-shaped superconducting weak links fabricated on YBCO thin films. The constrictions show a measurable superconducting current flowing through them. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were used to determine the critical current I-C of the constrictions at 77 K. The width of the constrictions was determined at the narrowest point using SEM (scanning electron microscope). Three micron-sized constrictions were fabricated with a width of 2.88 mu m, 1.72 mu m, and 1.69 mu m and a length of 5 mu m. Based on the width and length of these constrictions in relation to the coherence length (xi) of the YBCO, these constrictions should conduct supercurrent by Abrikosov vortices. The SEM images show that the femtosecond laser heats the samples beyond the geometric boundary, damaging some of the superconductive phases of the YBCO constrictions. As a result, the constrictions conduct current by one-dimensional depairing.

Although the presence of concentration of calcium ions is known to work as a trigger for the Cx functionality, the structural changes induced by calcium binding still need to be well elucidated. In this computational study, we have explored the structural effects promoted by Ca2+ on both the wild type (Cx26WT) and on two post-translationally modified Connexin 26 (Cx26): Cx26E42-47 gamma, which contains two glutamates (E42 and E47) that are gamma-carboxylated and Cx26R75m, where a key arginine (R75) is N-monomethylated. These modified amino acids, whose forcefield parameters have been developed in this work, alter Cx26 structure around the Ca(2+)coordination site. Structural changes were assessed from the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We observed a strict relation between the chemical properties of the post-translational modifications and significantly different responses of Cx26 to Ca2+-binding, while charge-adding modifications have destabilising effects upon calcium coordination, the uncharged ones share the same structural properties of the wild-type counterpart. Overall, these findings suggest the critical role of the electrostatic network flanking the Ca2+ coordination site in maintaining the native tertiary and quaternary structures.

Switching the charge transfer characteristics of quaterthiophene from p-type to n-type <i>via</i> interactions with carbon nanotubes	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Carbon nanotube-based semiconductors are of great interest for optoelectronic applications at the nanoscale. The present study investigates the structural, optoelectronic and charge transport properties of non-covalent complexes formed between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and quaterthiophene (4T) by employing dispersion-corrected density functional methods. The effect of different functionals viz., B97-D, B3LYP-GD3 and omega B97X-D on the properties of endo- and exohedral complexes is examined. The endohedral complex (4T@CNT) is found to be energetically more stable than the exohedral one (4T-CNT). Electronic properties such as the ionization energy, electron affinity and energy gap between the frontier molecular orbitals of the CNT are not significantly changed by the adsorption or the encapsulation of 4T. Contrary to the p-type characteristics of 4T, its complexes formed with CNTs exhibit n-type characteristics due to the higher electron mobility than the hole mobility. Among the endo- and exohedral complexes, the former one shows the highest electron mobility of 3.79 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The absorption properties of all the systems were studied by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). It is found that the complexes undergo several charge transfer transitions in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The above results unequivocally suggest that the charge-transfer characteristics of 4T can be altered on forming complexes with CNTs.

We show that the chemical environment plays a critical role in determining the interfacial reconstruction and charge redistribution at the metal/oxide interfaces.

We first show that the eigenvalue equation corresponding to the momentum-space Hamiltonian H = -(1 + beta p(2))d/dp(1 + beta p(2))d/dp+g(g - 1)beta(2)p(2) - g beta, which is associated with some one-dimensional models with minimal length uncertainty, can be solved by the unitary representations of the Lie algebra su(2) if g is an element of {1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, ...}. We then apply this result to spectral problems for the non-relativistic harmonic oscillator as well as the relativistic Dirac oscillator in the presence of a minimal length and show that these problems can be solved solely in terms of su(2).

Dependencies of threshold voltage, ON-current, OFF-current and subthreshold slope of ultra-thin body germanium-on-insulator MOSFETs on three different BOX dielectrics are examined by employing well-calibrated Synopsys TCAD. The variation of threshold voltage and ON-current becomes less sensitive with high-k BOX dielectrics whereas smaller variation of OFF-current is observed for the device with low-k BOX dielectrics. The subthreshold slope remains almost unaltered for all BOX dielectrics. Furthermore, a positive substrate bias is found to suppress variability of digital performance parameters of GeOI p-MOSFETs.																			0946-7076	1432-1858				MAY	2020	26	5					1605	1611		10.1007/s00542-019-04701-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00542-019-04701-y		NOV 2019											WOS:000499216300002

Here, the energetics and migration properties of Zn-i have been studied in ion implanted ZnO using a new approach based on the Li marker diffusion. Specifically, ZnO single crystals were implanted with 3.2 keV/amu B and BF2 ions and the release of Zn-i from the implanted regions during annealing was correlated with the advance of the characteristic Li depleted region into the bulk of the samples. Using this methodology, we calculate the activation energy of 1.45 eV to govern the process for B implants. Assuming that the migration energy of Zn-i to be of similar to 0.6 eV, as discussed previously in literature, a barrier for releasing Zn-i from the implanted region may be estimated as similar to 0.8-0.9 eV. Meanwhile, in the BF2 implanted samples, the migration of Zn-i is less efficient, as interpreted from the Li redistribution features in these samples; in particular, it is argued that Zn-i may be trapped by defect complexes related to the presence of F.

Basal plane anisotropy in Ce<sub>2</sub>RhIn<sub>8</sub>	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We report on the measurements of the magnetization and heat capacity of the tetragonal heavy-fermion compound Ce2RhIn8, dependent on the direction of the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the c axis. A notable anisotropic magnetization component having a fourfold symmetry has been observed in the antiferromagnetic state in low fields. The angular dependence of the heat capacity does not indicate any additional phase which implies that the observed magnetization anisotropy is an intrinsic property of Ce2RhIn8. A clear angular dependence of magnetic phase boundaries on the applied magnetic field has been also revealed. A possible interpretation of these results is discussed in the context of previously reported studies of magnetic structures in Ce2RhIn8.

We also present a structured Pade approximation scheme in the momentum space to determine g(r). The calculated g(r) for distinguishable particles interacting with Lennard-Jones and hard-sphere potential in various attempted schemes of approximation of the diagrammatic series compares very well with the results of path-integral Monte Carlo simulation.

For a free scalar in the adiabatic vacuum in de Sitter space the EE is known to remain low, scaling as the surface area of the region. Here, we study the evolution of entanglement after the universe transitions from de Sitter to flat space. We concentrate on the case of a massless minimally coupled scalar. We find numerically that, after the de Sitter stage ends, the EE and the enyi entropy rapidly grow and saturate at values obeying the volume law. The final state of the subsystem (region) is a partially thermalized state reminiscent of a generalized Gibbs ensemble. We comment on application of our results to the question of when and how cosmological perturbations decohere.

J	Kitai, AH				Kitai, Adrian H.			Seamless ultrathin rear projection display	JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION DISPLAY												A new architecture for a thin (2-cm depth) rear projection display is described. In order to achieve this small depth, a very high density of rear projectors is used. Three prototype displays using rear projectors on both 5- and 2-cm pitch arrays are described. The displays can achieve an effective screen pixel pitch of as small as 0.5 mm, which makes this technology competitive in terms of resolution with fine pitch LED displays; however, orders of magnitude fewer LEDs are required: Each rear projector requires only one white LED and a color liquid crystal light modulator. In the three prototypes, the projector light modulators utilize 101-cm (40 in.), 80-cm (31.5 in.), and 60-cm (24 in.) diagonal liquid crystal display glass. To minimize cost, no lenses are utilized for the rear projectors. An RGB LED array may augment the projector array, which provides a low resolution component of the image onto which the high resolution component is superimposed by the projector array. Edge gaps between active areas on adjacent LCD glass units are completely eliminated by the rear projection approach enabling low profile wall-size seamless displays. Display contrast depends on rear projection screen design.

By reducing off-current, on-current decreases too in compare to MOSFET transistors. Researchers are trying to reduce-off-current so that a minimum decrease in on-current occurs.

Using the potential distribution, the tunneling drain current is derived analytically by integrating the band-to-band tunneling generation rate over the device volume. The all-clear proposed that analytical models are validated via numerical results obtained from device simulations in SILVACO ATLAS software based on a non-local band-to-band tunneling model.

Owing to hybridization of the electromagnetic and sound waves near the resonance frequency of an atom, there arise the two branches of excitations in which the electromagnetic oscillations transform into the sound oscillations and vice versa. It is shown that under hybridization the crucial role is played by the dipole-dipole interaction, which leads to a substantial increase in the repulsion between the branches of the spectrum.

The influence of the change of the ferroelectric configuration on the magnitude of the tunnel current can be enhanced in the junctions with different Thomas-Fermi screening lengths in the central layer and external electrodes as well as in the junctions in which the resonant states in the central layer are located near the Fermi level in the source electrode or near the band edge for electrons of minority spin in the drain electrode.

The proposed SiC IGBT features a deep current storage layer and a floating p-grid. Compared to the conventional SiC IGBT, the current storage layer significantly improves conductivity modulation in the device, and results in improved conduction characteristics (i.e. lower V-ON). However, a mere deep CSL leads to an appreciable degradation in the device breakdown voltage (BV). The floating p-grid in the proposed IGBT effectively clamps this rise of electrical field, and thus achieves an uncompromised BV. Detailed study reveals that the alignment of the p-grid to the top structure does not have obvious influence on the device performance, which makes the structure easy to implement. Switching characteristics of the IGBTs are also studied, and the E-OFF-V-ON trade-off of the proposed SiC IGBT is much better than the conventional IGBT. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

Convergence of <i>hp</i>-Streamline Diffusion Method for Vlasov-Maxwell System	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL TRANSPORT												In this paper we study stability and convergence for hp-streamline diffusion (SD) finite element method for the, relativistic, time-dependent Vlasov-Maxwell (VM) system. We consider spatial domain and velocities The objective is to show globally optimal a priori error bound of order for the SD approximation of the VM system; where is the mesh size and is the spectral order. Our estimates rely on the local version with h(K) being the diameter of the phase-space-time element K and p(K) the spectral order for K. The optimal hp estimates require an exact solution in the Sobolev space Numerical implementations, performed for examples in one space- and two velocity dimensions, are justifying the robustness of the theoretical results.

Exchange corrections for inelastic electron scattering rates in condensed matter	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												A method is presented for quantifying quantum-mechanical exchange effects within the dielectric theory of electron scattering, the prevailing model for electron energy losses in condensed-matter systems. The approach utilizes a uniquely symmetric view of direct and exchange scattering events along with a generalized interference phase to account physically for the reduced scattering rates required by the Pauli exclusion of final-state fermions with corresponding spin, energy, and momentum. It is found that existing implementations either neglect or substantially overestimate the impact of exchange interference for condensed materials with broad optical loss spectra due to mathematical approximations or physical assumptions which are largely avoidable. The results suggest that the impact of exchange may alter inelastic scattering cross sections by between 10% and 20% for incident energies below 200 eV, a critical energy range for current investigations in electron and photoelectron spectroscopies.																			2469-9950	2469-9969				NOV 26	2019	100	18							184311	10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184311													WOS:000498848800001

Triple-coincidence experiment to study the correlated electron emission in the collision-induced double electron loss of He<SUP>-</SUP>	PHYSICAL REVIEW A												The double electron loss (DEL) from He has been investigated in collisions with He atoms at 300-keV impact energy and at electron energies that satisfy the cusp condition; i.e., the corresponding electron velocities match the projectile's velocity. In a time-of-flight experiment the energies of both electrons have been determined by detecting triple coincidences between the two electrons and the outgoing He+ ion. The coincidence yield shows a peak as a function of the electron energies at the expected cusp position, providing evidence for the existence of the two-electron cusp [L. Sarkadi and A. degrees Than, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 133201 (2008)] in DEL.

Probing internal electric fields of <i>π</i>- and <i>σ</i>-hole bonds	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY												pi- and sigma-holes are nonnuclear molecular regions of positive electric potential, which make non-covalent interactions with negative sites, for example, lone pairs of molecules containing nitrogen or oxygen, the so called pi- and sigma-hole bonds. We investigate these bonds locally using a probe programmed as a virtual molecule. Unlike the hydrogen bond, electric fields are detected having strengths that are different from the sum of the separated parts, meaning that molecular electrostatic potential surfaces analysis of the different parts are not enough to analyze the bonds. Based on an application of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which states that intermolecular bonds are fully described by Coulombian interactions (electrostatic plus polarization), we connect the electric field strength with the bond strength measured in experiments, so that it can be considered as a quantifier for the bonds.

Investigations toward highly absorbing particulate aerosols with minimal total scattering in the UV spectral region	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND APPLICATIONS												In this computational and experimental study, we investigate appropriate available particulate materials dispersed as aerosols using two in-situ methods of dispersal in a search for maximal absorption and minimal scattering, with an objective of obtaining less than one percent total scattering in the UV spectral region (300?400?nm). Fifteen commercial carbon nano-particulate materials have been investigated and categorized according to their extinction efficiencies and scattering percentages when measured in-situ. The extinction efficiencies were measured both in liquid suspensions, which allows various mechanisms for particle separation, and in-situ. The size distributions were produced, and the corresponding scattering percentages of the extinction efficiencies were calculated, using the discrete dipole?dipole approximation theory. This study shows that high efficiency particles with no more than a few percent total scattering could be aerosolized in-situ in the UV spectral region.																			0920-5071	1569-3937				NOV 22	2019	33	17					2273	2286		10.1080/09205071.2019.1676829	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09205071.2019.1676829													WOS:000498465800002

Plasma Source for Bipolar Electron-Optical System	RUSSIAN PHYSICS JOURNAL												The paper presents the experimental study of pulsed plasma source with hollow cathode intended for bipolar electron-optical system with open-boundary plasma. The proposed configuration of the plasma source includes two ring-shaped discharge cells based on plasma thruster technology. The plasma source can operate both in a low-current high-voltage mode and a high-current low-voltage mode. The main attention is paid to the highcurrent mode which is similar to the glow discharge positive column. It is found that along with the discharge in closed electron drift the ignition of additional, non-self-sustained hollow cathode discharge with electron oscillation is possible, thus considerably reducing the voltage of the closed-drift discharge. Current-voltage characteristics of the high-current discharge are measured for these conditions. Using the double probe technique, the local plasma parameters are measured together with their spatial distribution in the discharge region. The maximum plasma density along the plasma source axis is (6.5-6.8)center dot 10(12) cm(-3).

In this paper, we propose nanolayer-embedded compact pseudo-photonic crystals (PPCs) that enable strong interaction between ultrathin nanolayers and photonic crystal modes. In typical two-dimensional slab photonic crystals, the transverse-magnetic (TM) photonic crystal bandgap is not well formed, making it difficult to operate the TM photonic crystal waveguide modes. However, by utilizing the low-frequency TM PPC bands, a long propagation TM waveguide mode, a slow TM waveguide mode, and a TM photonic bandgap are all readily available. In particular, the insertion of a nanometer-thick low-refractive-index layer in the vertical center of TM PPC waveguide can localize the electric fields tightly in nanometer space, causing strong field interaction with the inserted nanolayer material. Using the TM slow light near PPC band edges, field interaction with the nanolayer is significantly enhanced. We can also realize nanolayer-embedded high-quality-factor (Q-factor > 10(4)) PPC cavities using the TM PPC bandgap. We believe that the proposed TM PPCs will play an important role in the strong interaction of ultrathin nanolayer materials with photonic crystal modes.

Reynolds number dependence of velocity gradient skewness in a renormalized scheme of fluid turbulence	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL												We obtain the behavior of skewness of the longitudinal velocity gradient with respect to the Reynolds number of a turbulent fluid from the incompressible Navier?Stokes dynamics. This is achieved in a renormalized scheme incorporating a von Karman interpolation function between the production and inertial ranges together with an interpolation between the inertial and dissipation ranges. The corresponding second- and third-order renormalized moments of the longitudinal velocity gradient and the resulting skewness values are found to depend on the Reynolds number in nontrivial fashions. For intermediate and moderately high Reynolds numbers, the skewness value does not exhibit any scaling behavior with respect to the Reynolds number. Instead, the skewness value remains bounded for any Reynolds number and it approaches a constant value for infinitely high Reynolds numbers. In the same scheme, we also incorporate another interpolation function between the production and inertial ranges coming from energy balance equation and inputs from renormalization-group analysis. We find exact agreement between the asymptotic values of skewness at high Reynolds numbers while the skewness values are in the same neighborhood in the finite Reynolds number (non-universal) regime.

These compounds contain Cp (cyclopentadienyl) as a ligand, and M can be Cr, Mo or W. Their main electronic transitions were calculated and the results are in good agreement with the experimental data. This allows the assignment of some bands whose origin was not clear. In all the cases, the carbonyls and Cp groups restrict the symmetry. The molecular orbitals that would be involved in M-M bonding interact strongly with the carbonyls and show unusual shapes and occupations. The strongest electronic bands are caused by sigma ->sigma* transitions in most of the molecules containing CpM(CO)(3) groups, whereas in molecules such as Cp(CO)(2)M equivalent to M(CO)(2)Cp the most intense bands are produced by pi ->pi* transitions. The origin of other bands is now explained. The effect of the solvent on the electronic transitions and the use of EOM-CCSD method in some compounds were also checked.																			0026-8976	1362-3028				JUL 2	2020	118	13								10.1080/00268976.2019.1692153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2019.1692153		NOV 2019											WOS:000497864100001

Gas stuffing of grain boundaries is widely used to strengthen conventional polycrystalline TiN and TaN barriers. Alternatively, a self-formed MnOx layer derived typically from sputter-deposited Cu(Mn) alloy film is a viable barrier. However, vacuum plasma generated during Cu(Mn) deposition tends to damage porous dielectric materials. Thus, this study combines the two approaches, proposing a strategy to enhance reliability of copper/porous carbon-doped organosilica (p-SiOCH) metallization systems using nitrogen stuffed p-SiOCH and bias-filter sputter deposited Mn2O3. An ultrathin (1-4 nm) Mn2O3 film, deposited by reactive sputtering with a biased-filter mechanism on nitrogen-stuffed p-SiOCH (p-SiOCH(N)), was proposed as a barrier layer to prevent Cu from diffusion. Electrical properties of the samples were evaluated by capacitance-voltage and current density-electric field measurements. The bias-filter mechanism eliminated plasma damage of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. Furthermore, stabilization annealing converted Mn2O3 to Mn2O3-x(N) (manganese sub-oxynitride), giving the highest barrier performance for the Cu metallization layer, while maintaining the pristine dielectric properties of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. The Cu/Mn2O3-x(N)/p-SiOCH(N) structure also exhibited extremely low leakage currents after reliability tests, indicting their applicability to Cu metallization.

J	Kimmel, S; Kolkowitz, S				Kimmel, Shelby; Kolkowitz, Shimon			No-go bounds for quantum seals	PHYSICAL REVIEW A												We investigate the feasibility of quantum seals. A quantum seal is a state provided by Alice to Bob along with information that Bob can use to make a measurement, "break the seal," and read the classical message stored inside. There are two success criteria for a seal: the probability Bob can successfully read the message without any further information from Alice must be high, and if Alice asks for the state back from Bob, the probability Alice can tell if Bob broke the seal without permission must be high. We build on the work of Chau [Phys. Rev. A 75, 012327 (2007)], which gave optimal bounds on these criteria, showing that they are mutually exclusive for high probability. We weaken the assumptions of this previous work by providing Bob with only a classical description of a prescribed measurement, rather than classical descriptions of the possible seal states. We show that this weakening does not affect the bounds but does simplify the analysis. We also prove upper and lower bounds on an alternative operational metric for measuring the success criteria.

Graphene thermal break-down induced by anharmonic bending mode	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER												A novel approach is proposed allowing us to prove, self-consistently, that free-standing graphene reaching a certain temperature loses its mechanical stability resulting in abrupt breakdown, which can be interpreted as melting. Our study is based on the idea of the crucial role of the anomalously soft bending 'sound' mode in the jump transition of graphene from the state with relatively small bending fluctuations to a state with fluctuations close in amplitude to the graphene lattice constant. The acme of the developed theory is in establishing a quantitative relationship connecting the graphene elastic moduli of second, third (negative!), and fourth orders at the melting temperature T-m that permits us to calculate T-m.

Having specified the statistics that governs extremal black holes, we study its effect on those quantities. Here, the role of statistics is to assign a statistical weight to the configurations of certain fixed number of black holes. We borrow these weights from Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac, classical and infinite statistics.

And with the structural feature size of the ILGP decreasing from tens of microns to microns and even sub-microns, the diffraction dispersion phenomenon will inevitably become a prominent problem in research and design of non-dispersion elements. Nevertheless, under the broadband light source illumination, the analysis of the dispersion characteristic of diffraction spectrum of the microstructure array has not been reported in detail. Therefore a theoretical model of micro-optical element with a typical one-dimensional rectangular phase grating (RPG) and a widely used white LED source is established in this paper. The dispersion characteristic of the diffraction spectrum is studied, that is, with the increase of period of the RGP or the cone angle of incident beam, the dispersion of diffraction spectrum weakens. Dispersion parameter C and its formula are proposed, which can precisely measure the chromatic dispersion degree of the diffraction spectrum. Furthermore, the boundary criterion point of non-dispersion C = 0.3 is given explicitly. It is explored that no matter whether the cone angle of incident beam or the RPG period increases, the non-dispersion output light can be obtained only by matching the two parameters to make the dispersion parameter C less than 0.3. Then an RPG sample, of which the structural parameters are consistent with the designed ones, is fabricated by using micro-nano processing technology. By changing the cone angle of incident beam, the luminance and the chromaticity coordinates of the diffraction beam are tested. The analyses of the test results of the fabricated RPG sample show that the spectrum dispersion regularity is in accord with the theoretical analysis. The consistency verifies the correctness of dispersion parameter C, its formula and the non-dispersion boundary criterion point. The dispersion parameter C and non-dispersion boundary criterion point presented in this paper provide a guidance for analyzing the dispersion characteristics when the structural parameters of the integrated light guide plate and other broadband micro-optical element are designed.					xu, ping/KSM-3277-2024; zhang, xu/GYE-3558-2022														1000-3290					NOV 20	2019	68	22							224203	10.7498/aps.68.20190716	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190716													WOS:000499091000011

These universal entropy relations have some geometric and CFT understanding, which may provide further insight into the quantum physics of black holes. In this paper, we present the leading order of black hole entropy sum relations under the quantum corrections. It is found that the modified entropy sum becomes mass-dependent for some black holes in asymptotical (A)dS and flat space-times.

In this paper, a two-dimensional phase-sensitive detector for the high-precision demodulation of 2D spatial amplitude-modulated signal is proposed. In this paper, we introduce the principle of extracting modulating signals from 2D amplitude modulated images by using 2D phase-sensitive detector, and simulate its ability to suppressing noise and extracting signal from the amplitude-modulated images buried in noise. In order to eliminate the influence of grid image generated by metal wire mesh sandwiched between two layers of glass on the detection of shielding glass defects, the methods of filtering in the frequency domain, rectifying plus filtering and two-dimensional phase sensitive detector are used to demodulate the mesh amplitude-modulated image, and the effects of extracting defects and suppressing noise are compared with each other. The principle and experimental results of defect detection of ordinary glass by using external carrier are also provided. The simulation results and the detection results show that the two-dimensional phase-sensitive detector can be used to demodulate spatial two-dimensional amplitude-modulated image produced by optical modulators to extract two-dimensional measurement signals. The 2D phase-sensitive detector can greatly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the output image, increase detection accuracy and the ability to extract modulating signals from the amplitude-modulated image buried in noise.

J	Yan, J; Wei, MM; Xing, YX				Yan Jie; Wei Miao-Miao; Xing Yan-Xia			Dephasing effect of quantum spin topological states in HgTe/CdTe quantum well	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												HgTe/CdTe quantum well is a typical two dimensional topological material which supports the helical edge states and quantum spin Hall effect that is imposing in applying of spin electronic devices. The special plateau valued with 0.25 h/e(2) of nonlocal resistance in H-shaped four terminal devices can be used as the fingerprint of quantum spin Hall effect. Based on the HgTe/CdTe quantum well, with the aid of nonequilibrium Green's function theory and multi-terminal Landauer-Biittiker formula, we calculate the nonlocal resistance and study the dephasing effect of spin topological states in the presence of exchange field and external magnetic field. It is found the dephasing processes play a role completely different from exchange field and external magnetic field. The latter destroy time reversal symmetry and change the width and relative position of topological gap, but do not influent the topological stability of helical edge states. In the contrary, dephasing processes don't change the width and relative position, however, they broke the topological stability. We consider two kinds of dephasing: normal dephasing and spin dephasing. In the first kind, the carriers lose only the phase memory while maintaining the spin memory. In the second kind, the carriers lose both phase and spin memories. Because of the spin locking properties, normal dephasing almost have no influence on the helical edge states. While the spin dephasing will induce spin flip backscattering and finally destroy helical edge states seriously.

J	Zhang, BF; Zhu, K; Wu, H; Hu, HF; Shen, Z; Xu, J				Zhang Bai-Fu; Zhu Kang; Wu Heng; Hu Hai-Feng; Shen Zhe; Xu Ji			Numerical study of metallic semiconductor nanolasers with double-concave cavity structures	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												Metallic semiconductor nanolaser, as an ultra-small light source, has been increasingly attractive to researchers in last decade. It can have wide potential applications such as in photonic integrated circuits, on-chip interconnect, optical communications,etc. One obstacle to miniaturization of the laser size is that the loss increases rapidly with the cavity volume decreasing. In previous studies, a type of Fabry-Perot cavity with capsule-shaped structure was investigated and demonstrated both numerically and experimentally, showing that its cavity loss is reduced dramatically in contrast to the scenario of conventional rectangular cavities. However, when the cavity size is reduced down to nanoscale, capsule-shaped structure surfers high loss. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, a novel type of double-concave cavity structure for metallic semiconductor nanolaser in a 1.55 mu m wavelength range is proposed and numerically studied. The proposed structure consists of InGaAs/InP waveguide structure encapsulated by metallic clad, and has a cylindrical reflection end face and concave curved sidewalls. The cylindrical reflection end face can push the resonant mode into the cavity center and reduce the optical field overlap with metallic sidewalls, which can reduce the metallic loss. The curved-sidewalls topologically reduce the electric field component perpendicular to the sidewalls, and thus reducing the plasmonic loss. By optimizing the waist width of the double-concave cavity structure, the radiation loss can be effectively reduced, resulting in the improvement of cavity quality factor and the decrease of threshold current. Finite-difference time-domain simulations are conducted to investigate the properties of the proposed cavity structures such as resonant mode distribution, cavity quality factor, confinement factor, threshold gain and threshold current in this paper. The numerical results show that the double-concave cavity laser with cavity volume as small as 0.258 lambda(3) increases 24.8% of cavity quality factor and reduces 67.5% of threshold current, compared with the conventional capsule-shaped one, demonstrating an effective improvement of metallic nanolaser. With those advantages, the proposed structure can be used for realizing the ultra-small metallic semiconductor nanolasers and relevant applications.																			1000-3290					NOV 20	2019	68	22							224201	10.7498/aps.68.20190972	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190972													WOS:000499091000009
J	Zhang, ZH; Yu, XD; Li, HP; Han, K				Zhang Zhao-Hui; Yu Xiao-Dong; Li Hai-Peng; Han Kui			Effect of alkane chain length on tribological properties of straight chain alkane liquid film	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												How to overcome the friction between the micro components has become a key point of the successful operation of the micro/nano-electric mechanical systems. The understanding of the friction mechanism of the alkane liquid film confined between two substrates is important when the friction law on a macro/nano scale is not applicable. In this work, the molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the effect of the chain length on the friction properties of the liquid films that are confined between two golden substrates. There are seven pure alkane liquid films that are composed of one molecule CnH2n + (2)(n = 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18), and six mixed alkane liquid films that are composed of two molecules C6H14/CnH2n + (2)(n = 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18) with a ratio of 1:1. The results show that the friction force and the coefficient of friction of pure alkane liquid films both increase as the chain length increases when the carbon atom number is less than 12, whereas the friction property keeps stable when the carbon atom number of the alkane molecule is greater than 10 and the pure hexadecane liquid film has the largest friction force. In the mixed films, the addition of short chain alkane molecules can strengthen the friction, and the hexane/dodecane mixed film has the maximum friction force. The short chain molecule dilutes the C8H18 film and C10H22 film which cause the friction force to decrease. During the sliding progress, the formation of solid-like high density-packet layers is the main reason for the friction reduction. When no solid-like layer or just one solid-like layer is formed at the interface of golden base, the liquid alkane film is liquid-like and its viscosity becomes much larger than that in the normal state, which leads to high friction force. The short chain molecules reduce the density of the solid-like layers, which causes the film to transform from solid-like state to liquid state, thus resulting in the increase of friction. The friction property mainly depends on the layered structure, and the interaction between the golden surface and liquid film contributes to the friction. This study helps to understand the friction mechanism of ultra-thin liquid films.

It is found that the derivative of output curves increases with the increase in drain voltage (V-ds) in ohmic region because of the raised potential minima in the channel, which is not seen in SITs with a relatively long fin width. The influence of the gate voltages (V-gs) and V-ds on electric potential in the channel is demonstrated by evaluating the contribution of V-gs and V-ds, expressed through two coefficients alpha and beta. The ratio of alpha to beta increases up to 31.1 from 16.3 with decrease in the fin width from 0.9 to 0.5 mu m, showing a higher dependency of the potential minima on V-gs and the fin width. The voltage gain expressed by alpha/beta is 14.9 dB for the GaN SIT with a fin width of 0.5 mu m.

J	DeGracia, DJ; Taha, D; Anggraini, FT; Huang, ZF				DeGracia, Donald J.; Taha, Doaa; Anggraini, Fika Tri; Huang, Zhi-Feng			Nonautonomous dynamics of acute cell injury	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												Medical conditions due to acute cell injury, such as stroke and heart attack, are of tremendous impact and have attracted huge amounts of research effort. The biomedical research that seeks cures for these conditions has been dominated by a qualitative, inductive mind-set. Although the inductive approach has not been effective in developing medical treatments, it has amassed enough information to allow construction of quantitative, deductive models of acute cell injury. In this work we develop a modeling approach by extending an autonomous nonlinear dynamic theory of acute cell injury that offered new ways to conceptualize cell injury but possessed limitations that decrease its effectiveness. Here we study the global dynamics of the cell injury theory using a nonautonomous formulation. Different from the standard scenario in nonlinear dynamics that is determined by the steady state and fixed points of the model equations, in this nonautonomous model with a trivial fixed point, the system property is dominated by the transient states and the corresponding dynamic processes. The model gives rise to four qualitative types of dynamical patterns that can be mapped to the behavior of cells after clinical acute injuries. The nonautonomous theory predicts the existence of a latent stress response capacity (LSRC) possessed by injured cells. The LSRC provides a theoretical explanation of how therapies, such as hypothermia, can prevent cell death after lethal injuries. The nonautonomous theory of acute cell injury provides an improved quantitative framework for understanding cell death and recovery and lays a foundation for developing effective therapeutics for acute injury.																			2470-0045	2470-0053				NOV 19	2019	100	5							052407	10.1103/PhysRevE.100.052407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.052407								31870014					WOS:000498061200004

This phenomenon is caused by the well known Mould effect and is explained by a supply of momentum from the container, causing an upwards kick. Here we introduce a theory that allows for dynamic fluctuations of the chain and compare with corresponding simulations and experiments. The predictions for the chain velocity and fountain height agree well with experiments. We also explore the underlying mechanism for this momentum transfer for different chain models and find that it depends subtly on the nature of the chain as well as on the container.

Most PL studies use conventional lamp light sources whose spectral distribution is filtered with a monochromator, but this results in a still impure spectrum with a low spectral intensity. Tunable dye lasers offer a tunable light source which cover the desired excitation wavelength range with a high spectral intensity, but their operation is often cumbersome. Herein, the design and properties of an improved dye-laser system which is based on a Q-switch pump laser are presented. The high peak power of the pump provides an essentially threshold-free lasing of the dye laser, which substantially improves the operability. It allows operation with laser dyes, such as Rhodamin 110 and Pyridin 1, which are otherwise on the border of operation of the laser. The system allows to cover the 540-730 nm wavelength range with four dyes. In addition, the dye laser output pulses closely follow the properties of the pump, which directly provides a time-resolved and tunable laser source. The performance of the system by measuring the PL map of a HiPco SWCNTs sample is demonstrated.

The model is solvable in any spatial dimension and shares some commonalities with the p + ip Richardson-Gaudin fermionic model, such as a third-order quantum phase transition. However, contrary to the fermionic case, in the bosonic model the transition separates a gapless fragmented singlet pair condensate from a pair Bose superfluid, and the exact eigenstate at the quantum critical point is a pair condensate analogous to the fermionic Moore-Read state.

Two-Particle Scattering and Resistivity of Rashba Electron Gas	PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS												The electrical resistivity of a 2D electron gas that results from two-particle collisions and strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling is calculated. When combined with impurity scattering, the two-particle correction to the resistivity is proportional to the square of temperature T if only the lower helicity band is filled, but the T2 term vanishes if the Fermi level is above the Dirac point. If only the electron-electron scattering is present, the resistivity is proportional to T4ln|EF/T| below and above the Dirac point, but this term vanishes at the point itself.

The starting materials including Na2CO3, CuO, TiO2 and Nb2O5 were mixed by ball milling for 24 hours with stoichiometry, calcined at 950 degrees C for 24 hours and were doped with (0-2.0 vol%) MgO, Al2O3 and ZrO2 nanopowders. Then, the mixed powder was pressed into a disc shape. The green bodies were sintered at 975-1025 degrees C for 10 hours. Phase formation was investigated by XRD and microstructure by SEM. The body-centered cubic perovskite-related structure of space group Im-3 and small amount of second phase were detected. The normal grain growth is observed and shown rectangular grain shape. Density of the sintered samples was measured by Archimedes's method using distilled water as the fluid medium. The highest density of NCTNO and NCTNO/Al2O3 ceramics were found at 1025 degrees C sintered temperature and 1000 degrees C for NCTNO/MgO and NCTNO/ZrO2 samples. Dielectric constant of the samples was examined using an LCR meter and the mechanical properties of samples were investigated by Vickers microhardness tester. The addition of nanopowders can be improved the mechanical property and 1.0 vol%ZrO2 doping sample showed the highest the dielectric constant.																			0015-0193	1563-5112				NOV 18	2019	552	1			SI		159	164		10.1080/00150193.2019.1653092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00150193.2019.1653092													WOS:000600728000017

If, however, instead of swatting we could magnify our view and experience the world in slow motion we would be privy to a world-class ballet full of graceful figure-eight wing strokes, effortless pirouettes, and astonishing acrobatics. After watching such a magnificent display, who among us could destroy this virtuoso? How do flies produce acrobatic maneuvers with such precision? What control mechanisms do they need to maneuver? More abstractly, what problem are they solving as they fly? In this article and the associated video presentation of my invited lecture from the 71st Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics, I describe the challenges associated with answering these questions, our attempts to investigate them, and, through various demonstrations depicted in the video, qualitatively illustrate the mechanisms used by these insects to achieve these astonishing behaviors.

The effect of BTNb on the phase formation, mechanical, dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties was investigated and discussed. All ceramics have a single perovskite phase. The data also revealed that there was a transformation from rhombohedral (x = 0.00) to mixed tetragonal/rhombohedral phases (0.02 <= x <= 0.04.), then to tetragonal-rich phases at x = 0.06. Microstructure analysis also indicated that the BTNb affected the morphology of the microstructure, where the average grain size decreased with increasing BTNb content. The BTNb doping produced an enhancement of mechanical properties, HV and HK increased with increasing BTNb content and reached the maximum values of 6.28 GPa, 5.51 GPa for x = 0.04 sample, respectively. The improvement of the properties was related to the change in microstructure. Furthermore, dielectric enhanced with increasing BTNb content, which reached a maximum value of 5439 for the x = 0.06 sample. However, the BTNb doping produced slimmer P-E loops which decreasing of P-r and E-c values. Meanwhile, the undoped BNKT displayed a highest piezoelectric coefficient, d(33) of 198 pC/N.

In this paper, with Floquet engineering by a combination of high-frequency drives and resonant drives, we propose a way to realize nontrivial topological phases protected by a Z(2) x Z(2) symmetry only in the presence of a Z(2) symmetry, using a robust emergent Z(2) symmetry induced by the resonant drives. Moreover, the symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are switchable between nontrivial and trivial phases only by the direction of a static transverse field, and even perturbations on the resonant drive can be utilized to realize richer SPT phases. We also discuss the real-time dynamics of the model, and find that which topological phases the system lies in can be distinguished by a period doubling of a nonlocal order parameter, as with discrete time crystals. A realization or a control of nontrivial SPT phases without the required symmetries by resonant drives, proposed in this paper, would shed a light on the observation of topological phenomena in nonequilibrium setups.

The columbite of CoNb2O6, NiNb2O6, and ZnNb2O6 and wolframite ZrTiO4 were weighed and introduced into the batch calculation. The dielectric constant of the samples showed a maximum dielectric constant at y = 0.2 for all systems, while the transition temperature decreased with increasing relaxor compounds in the system. In addition, the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of the ceramic systems also changed significantly with the relaxor materials content, and reached maximum around y = 0.2-0.3. These results clearly showed the significance of relaxor materials content in controlling the electrical properties of the PZT-PXN ceramic systems.

J	Xu, L; Zhang, CL; Huang, YF				Xu, Li; Zhang, Caili; Huang, Yanfang			Thermospin effects in a T-shaped spin valves with spin-flip scattering	PHYSICS LETTERS A												With the help of the nonequilibrium Green's function technique, we theoretically analyze the thermospin property through a typical T-shaped spin valve with spin-flip scattering in the linear regime. The influences of spin-flip coefficient of interdot lambda, spin-flip coefficient of intradot eta and interdot hopping coefficient t + delta(sigma) Delta t on thermospin property are discussed. As interdot hopping coefficient t is equal to energy level epsilon, the spectrum of G(s) shows Fano-like effect with epsilon variation. Antiresonance position of G(s) is almost unchanged and its width becomes narrower with epsilon increasing. Spin thermopower S-s is close to the maximum of the peak and charge thermopower S-c is equal to zero for t = epsilon. As a result, the pure spin thermopower S-s can be obtained, which means that a pure spin current may be produced by a temperature gradient in our system. It is found that spin figure of merit ZT(s) can reach a considerable value by adjusting key parameters of the system, such as Delta t, beta, alpha, phi. The typical T-shaped spin valve can be treated as a stable thermospin battery which allows to convert the heat energy to spin voltage, thus produces the pure spin current in the device.

Extraction of the short-range defect potential parameters from available experimental data on the graphene resistance	FULLERENES NANOTUBES AND CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES												We consider a problem of obtaining information about the scattering potentials of the monolayer graphene sample using available experimental data on its resistance. For this purpose, we study theoretically the dependence of graphene resistance on Fermi energy having in mind to compare it with experimental data where super-high mobility electrons in suspended graphene samples without chemical doping were investigated. As far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the Coulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering potentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The empty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical shortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage of the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We consider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit formulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution of this scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function of the Fermi energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results are consistent with experiment, where the resistance was measured as a function of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene. This fact gives a possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the basis of the available experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with the gate voltage controlled Fermi level position. It is clear to be very important for applications.																			1536-383X	1536-4046				MAR 3	2020	28	3			SI		229	232		10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686624		NOV 2019											WOS:000497025100001

An experimental extrinsic peak in the Raman spectra near 650 cm(-1) is observed in codoped nanocrystals. We analyze the origin of this peak and find that it can be best explained by the presence of B-P bonds, which are located near the surface of the nanocrystal.

While Cd0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 orders ferromagnetically at 129 K (T-C), Zn0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 displays complex antiferromagnetic order at T-N = 20 K. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in the vicinity of the magnetic transition has been estimated in terms of isothermal magnetic entropy change (Delta S-m). The maximum values of Delta S-m for Cd0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 and Zn0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 are about -4.2 J/kg K and -3.4 J/kg K respectively at 133 K and 48 K for a field change from 0 to 70 kOe. Electrical resistivity shows Mott variable range hopping behaviour below 50 K. Large positive thermoelectric power values are observed below 300 K in both Cd0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4 and Zn0.9Cu0.1Cr2Se4.

Partnered with Clarivate Analytics and the Higher Education Press, the Chinese Academy of Engineering launched an annual project, aiming to identify engineering research and development frontiers. For engineering research, we determine the candidate hotspots mainly based on data analysis of highly cited papers in the Web of Science Core Collection and select the fronts based on expert research and judgment. The research hotspots are selected from topics clustered through co-citation analysis, which are based on four topic indicators including the number of core papers, total citations, average publication year of core papers, and the percentage of consistently cited publications. It is thus crucial to design proper strategies for hotspot selection. We compared the performance of several hotspot selection strategies and found that the proposed mixed selection strategy performs best. The strategy was used in the 2018 project and led to an improved edition. We present an overall comparison of the performance of the top 10 countries or regions in engineering research fronts based respectively on the number of first author core papers and the citation number per paper of core papers. We believe that our experience obtained from the implementation of the Engineering Fronts project can be used as reference for other similar bibliometric projects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Compared with the conventional cell method, the advance of the proposed adaptive method originates from the so-called node weight correction procedure by using a patch-recovery technique, which corrects the local constitutive relations and in turn mitigates the error source that results from the discretization of constitutive equations. Furthermore, the proposed method has been extended to general curvilinear grids, in which the construction of the local constitutive matrix is derived by using differential geometry. Finally, we have demonstrated by theoretical analysis and numerical results that the proposed strategies can achieve a high-order convergence as well as high-efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Theoretical investigation of von Braun and von Braun-like reactions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY												The von Braun reaction, discovered at the dawn of the past century, consists of the reaction between a tertiary amine and cyanogen bromide. It leads to the cleavage of a CN bond with the formation of an N-dialkylcyanamide and an alkyl bromide and has been extensively used in organic synthesis. A detailed in silico study (PCM/density functional theory [DFT]/B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) calculations) of this venerable reaction has shown that in the first stage a zwitterionic adduct with a multibonded bromine atom is formed. The widely accepted mechanism involving an S(N)2 reaction occurs in the second step, thus accounting for its selectivity. Quantum chemical calculations were performed for the von Braun-like reactions in systems formed by cyclic tertiary amines (N-alkyl azetidines). In these cases, the first stage is almost the same as in the classical von Braun processes, and selective S(N)2 mechanisms can occur in the second step.					wright, karen/KHZ-1452-2024; Lisovin, Anton/M-4091-2019; Kletskii, Mikhail/A-8655-2014; Kurbatov, Sergey/F-7734-2018; Burov, Oleg/A-8428-2014	Kletskii, Mikhail/0000-0002-6567-7026; COUTY, Francois/0000-0002-2296-5343; Burov, Oleg/0000-0002-7704-033X; Lisovin, Anton/0000-0001-7788-288X; Kurbatov, Sergei/0000-0002-8886-5222													0020-7608	1097-461X				FEB 5	2020	120	3							e26088	10.1002/qua.26088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qua.26088		NOV 2019											WOS:000496702200001

B.; Mushnikov, N., V			Compositional genesis of ferromagnetism in alloys PrNi<sub>2-<i>x</i></sub>Co<i><sub>x</sub></i>	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												The structure and magnetic properties of PrNi2-xCox alloys are investigated over the entire concentration range 0 <= x <= 2. It is shown that there is a continuous series of disordered solid solutions with a structure of the MgCu2 type. In all alloys, cobalt atoms have a magnetic moment mu(Co) = 0.5 mu(B). The ground magnetic state of the alloys depends on the composition. In the range 0 <= x <= 0.2, alloys are paramagnetic at a temperature T = 2 K, in the alloys with 0.4 <= x <= 0.8, ferromagnetic order occurs in clusters of cobalt atoms due to the exchange interaction of Co - Co. Their magnetization in small magnetic fields is realized via turnabout, by 180 degrees, of the magnetic moments of individual clusters. In the alloys with 1.0 <= x <= 2.0, the long-range ferromagnetic order is established. The processes of technical magnetization reversal in them are effected via the motion of domain walls and rotation of the vectors of spontaneous magnetization. In all alloys, magnetic saturation is not achieved at T = 5 K even in a magnetic field of 200 kOe, which is associated with a large splitting of the ground J multiple of Pr3+ ions by the crystal field. Numerical calculations of the magnetization curves are performed. In the approximation of the independence of the parameters of the crystal field on the concentration, a satisfactory agreement between the calculated and experimental curves was obtained.

Comparable nuclear and electronic energy loss effect of Au<SUP>2+</SUP> irradiation on structural, surface morphological, optical and phonon properties of Al:ZnO thin films	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS												Al-doped ZnO (Al:ZnO) thin films of average thickness similar to 400 nm were grown on silicon substrates. The annealed films were irradiated using 6 MeV Au2+ ions at varying ion fluence. The residual structural, morphological, phonon and optical properties due to the comparable elastic and inelastic collision have been studied. The pristine films stabilize in hexagonal wurtzite structure which remained invariant after irradiation. However, the crystalline size decreases with increasing ion fluence. The compressive microcrystalline stress for pristine films converts into tensile with increasing the ion beam fluence. AFM micrographs indicate a smooth and dense surface micromorphology. The irradiated films with increasing ion fluence become rough and cluster formation takes place after irradiation. The optical band gap estimated from absorption spectra decreases with increasing ion fluence. In the Raman spectra, two significant phonon modes E-2(High) and E-1(LO) have been observed at room temperature. The structural and optical properties of films almost remain invariant up to ion beam irradiation fluence (similar to 1 x 10(13) ions/cm(2)) and start declining at higher fluence.					bajpai, Parmendra/H-4039-2016; Patel, Shiv/ABF-3507-2020	Patel, Shiv P./0000-0002-5803-0216; Ghosh, Koushik/0000-0002-3208-1015													0168-583X	1872-9584				NOV 15	2019	459						22	28		10.1016/j.nimb.2019.08.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nimb.2019.08.014													WOS:000491302700004

We determined the concentrations of Be-10 and Be-9 in samples pretreated following two procedures: acidification before (procedure A) and after (procedure B) removal of particles. The Be-10 and Be-9 concentrations spanned wide ranges. Concentrations in procedure A samples were higher than those in procedure B samples. The Be-10/Be-9 ratios fell within a narrow range, and values from CRREL (about 8.5 x 10(-9)) and Barrow (about 7 x 10(-9)) were of the same order of magnitude.

For the sample with x = 0.7, the Ni-O bond lengths decrease uniformly with decreasing temperature, and the atomic displacement parameters are similar to those for x = 1/3. In contrast, for the sample with x = 0.9, the out-of-plane Ni-O bond length shows a sharp thermal contraction in the high-temperature region, which is suggestive of changes in the orbital occupation accompanied by the development of checkerboard-type charge correlations. Furthermore, the x = 0.9 sample is characterized by a large atomic displacement parameter for the apical O atoms along the out-of-plane direction, which is interpreted as the existence of two types of Ni3+ sites with different orbital occupancies. The distinct difference between the x = 0.9 sample and the lower-concentration compounds should be related to the development of checkerboard-type charge ordering in the metallic matrix and possible orbital ordering at the Ni3+ sites at x similar to 1 in the hole-doped layered nickel oxides.

Mirror nuclei of 1<i>n</i>/2<i>n</i> halo systems as 1<i>p</i>/2<i>p</i> emitters	PHYSICAL REVIEW C												Background: The advent of radioactive ion beams has helped considerably to explore exotic decay modes like proton radioactivity in extremely proton-rich nuclei lying on or beyond the proton drip line. Recently, an experimental study was reported on the structural properties of proton-rich nucleus O-11. Interestingly, O-11 is the mirror nucleus of the widely studied 2n halo system Li-11. In addition, O-11 formed in the experiment was identified through its decay by 2p emission. A similar kind of interdependence between neutron halo and its mirror counterpart for 2p emission was reported [Charity, Elson, Komarov, Sobotka, Manfredi, and Shane, J. Phys.: Conf series 420, 012073 (2013)]. Purpose: To study and analyze whether the mirror nuclei of known 1n/2n halo systems are 1p/2p emitters. Method: The preference for the mirror nuclei of 1n/2n halo systems for 1p/2p emission over the other (2p/1p emission) is studied by Q-value systematics and potential energy minimization using a cluster-core model. The half-lives of the mirror nuclei of neutron halo systems were determined using a recently proposed empirical formula [Sreeja and Balasubramaniam, Eur. Phys. J. A 54, 106 (2018); Sreeja and Balasubramaniam, Eur. Phys. J. A 55, 33 (2019)]. Results: Among the mirror nuclei of 1 n halo systems, N-11 (the mirror of Be-11) and F-15 (the mirror of C-15) were found to have a preference for 1p emission over 2p emission by Q-value systematics. The potential energy surface analysis supported the result where both N-11 and F-15 were found to be ground-state 1p emitters. The trend got changed with an increase in angular momentum where the minimum in potential shifted from 1p to 2p cluster. Moreover, the half-life calculation matches with the result obtained from Q-value systematics. Conclusion: For the 2n halo systems, all the studies made indicate that the respective mirror nuclei have a preference for 2p emission. A similar conclusion cannot be drawn for the mirror nuclei of In halo systems except for N-11 and F-15, which were found to be ground-state 1p emitters. All the remaining mirror nuclei of In halo systems prefers 2p emission as favorable decay mode than the expected 1p emission. The empirical formula can be used as a good tool to evaluate half-life values of proton emitters provided the Q values are known with desirable accuracy.

Josephson effect in superconducting junctions with a semiconducting barrier containing metallic nanoclusters	PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS												The Josephson effect in the array of superconducting nano-bridges (short circuits) connected in parallel within the intermediate semiconductor layer with metallic (M) nanoclusters (Sm(M)), separating two superconducting plates (S) in the presence of applied parallel dc magnetic field is considered basing on the generalized Ferrell-Prange model. This model seems to be relevant for understanding of the unusual Josephson critical current dependence, I-c(H), on applied parallel magnetic field in a S-Sm(M)-S type planar Josephson junction (MoRe-Si(W)-MoRe). Lack of the typical Fraunhofer type I-c(H) dependence for this type Josephson junctions is related with a discrete Josephson current flow through the set of parallel metallic nanobridges (or resonant-percolation trajectories) formed by M-nanoclusters within the semiconductor (Sm)-intermediate layer.

J	Li, CY; Sun, QJ				Li, Chuan-Yao; Sun, Qi-Jia			Influence of coarse toll on the dynamic properties of traffic flow in a single-entry traffic corridor	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												In this paper, we investigate the effects of coarse toll on the user equilibrium (UE) state in a single-entry traffic corridor with early and late arrivals from analytical and numerical perspective. Unlike previous studies on traffic tolls, the flow congestion model is used to take into account the dynamic propagation of traffic flow. The LWR (Lighthill-Whitham-Richards) model and the Greenshields' velocity-density function are used to describe the dynamic properties of traffic flow. The quasi-analytic solutions of the three possible cases in UE due to different charges are derived. Both analytical and numerical results indicate that rarefaction waves and shock waves appear in the corridor under the coarse toll. The three-dimensional evolution diagrams of traffic flow and space-time diagrams illustrate that the introduction of course toll lets flow patterns more complicated. This extends the knowledge given by the classical bottleneck model. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the interplay between quench protection and coil quench needs to be considered from the earliest stage of the design. For this purpose, a method using Cryosoft code is presented in this paper. Based on the quench protection electric circuit, the current and voltage evolution of the quench protection circuit and the temperature and normal zone evolution of the superconducting coil all can be obtained with this method. By studying the allowable action time for the quench protection associated with the operating current, the quench voltage threshold and the resistance of the dump resistor are determined, which is 0.4 V and 0.3 Omega. The differences of the voltage evolutions obtained with different kinds of dump resistor connections are also studied. The results show that it is better to have the dump resistor directly connected to the coil than with a switch. The advantage of this method is its integration and comprehensiveness and can be used in the design procedure of different kinds of magnets.					zheng, J.X/GYI-9506-2022														0921-4534	1873-2143				NOV 15	2019	566								1353523	10.1016/j.physc.2019.1353523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physc.2019.1353523													WOS:000492679000004

By controlling and adjusting the concentrations of sodium sulfide electrolyte to be 0.1 M, 0.5 M, 1.0 M and 1.5 M, respectively, the morphologies of copper sulfide nanosheets (average size, thickness or density of sharp edges) could be well tailored and be more optimized for applications in field emission (FE). As the results showed, for optimal nanostructure of such copper sulfides nanosheet arrays, its turn-on field could be lowered to 2.0 V/mu m and the field emission current density would reach up to 4.1 mA/cm(2) under an applied field of 6.4 V/mu m, and also it can exhibit excellent field emission stability, with a degradation lower than +/- 4% and a huge field enhancement factor of 8327.					li, Yunfan/HZJ-8983-2023														1369-8001	1873-4081				NOV 15	2019	103								104641	10.1016/j.mssp.2019.104641	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mssp.2019.104641													WOS:000483376900024

Competition games between teams vying for common resources under consensus dynamics on networks	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												Dynamics on complex networks and associated games have numerous practical applications for a wide range of fields. The analyses addressed in the literature frequently consider game frameworks defined between the individual nodes within a given network. However, many real situations are related to teams of agents which are external to the network but that compete over the state of the network elements. In this paper we carry out an analytical and numerical analysis of games played between two teams that compete to maximize their benefits from the resources of the same population, whose elements form a network. This population could be a group of voters in an election, a set of potential clients within a given market, or a certain species in an ecosystem, whose state favourable to one of the teams (political opinion, volume of purchases or pollination, for example) must be maximized. The dynamics of the state of each node of the network is given by a consensus function, and the steady state depends on the network structure and the external action of each team. We have found an optimal analytical solution for the team's actions that maximize its benefit, when the network of connections with the population is fixed and equal for both teams. Additionally, we find analytically the optimal network of connections from the team agents to the population so that the achievable payoff for said optimal action is maximum over all alternative networks. Finally, we consider the case of a game played on subsets of the general population by each of the two competing teams, ultimately leading to a Nash equilibrium. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Prompt neutron multiplicity distributions inferred from γ-ray and fission fragment energy measurements	PHYSICAL REVIEW C												We propose a novel method to extract the prompt neutron multiplicity distribution, P(nu), in fission reactions based on correlations between prompt neutrons, gamma rays, and fragment kinetic energy arising from energy conservation. In this approach, only event-by-event measurements of the total gamma-ray energy released as a function of the total kinetic energy (TKE) of the fission fragments are performed, and no neutron detection is required. Using the CGMF fission event generator, we illustrate the method and explore the accuracy of extracting the neutron multiplicity distribution when taking into account the energy resolution and calibration of the energy measurements. We find that a TKE resolution of under 2 MeV produces reasonably accurate results, independent of typical gamma-ray energy measurement resolution.

We adopted an improved experimental method based on the Kr+ ion implantation of the target Si substrate at low 40 keV energy and using the generated Kr-peak in the backscattered RBS spectra as reference to extract both the energy loss and the energy loss straggling for He+ ions crossing the Bi thin film. The obtained experimental stopping power values were found in good agreement with those generated numerically via SRIM-2013 and CasP 5.2 computer codes. They are also showed to be consistent with previously reported stopping data within the He+ ion energy region mainly below 1.5 MeV, which are thus extended them to higher incident energies. Finally, the relevance of collisional straggling values predicted by Bohr's and Bethe-Livingston's theories for describing the determined experimental straggling data was discussed by invoking two main additional contribution effects due to target thickness inhomogeneity and ion charge exchanges included in the Yang semi-empirical formula.					ammi, hakim/HTQ-0983-2023	ammi, hakim/0000-0002-4926-8038; dib, amel/0000-0003-0113-2745; Mammeri, Ster/0000-0002-4306-2442													0168-583X	1872-9584				NOV 15	2019	459						15	21		10.1016/j.nimb.2019.08.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nimb.2019.08.017													WOS:000491302700003

The matter-light system in the microcavity is described in a two-dimensional many-particle interacting model. In the thermal equilibrium limit, a set of self-consistent equations determining the condensate order parameters is derived by adapting the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation. Analyzing the condensate order parameters and momentum distributions of the exciton and photon densities, a detail phase structure of the exciton-polariton system has been released. At zero temperature, above a critical density, depending on the Coulomb interaction, one finds all possible condensate phases of the exciton-polariton systems including excitonic-BEC, excitonic-BCS, polaritonic-BEC, polaritonic-BCS, and photonic BEC states. A whole regime of the condensation states is decreased if increasing the detuning parameter. The complex BCS-BEC crossovers of the condensation states are also addressed in the influence of thermal fluctuations and excitation deturning.

Characterization of ZnO:Ni thin films deposited by the spin coating method	MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING												ZnO:Ni thin films with Ni content of 0, 3, 5 and 7% were deposited onto ITO/glass substrates using the spin coating method. The deposited films were characterized for their structural, photoluminescence and electrical properties by respectively X ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and the four points probe techniques. XRD patterns showed that the deposited films were polycrystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The absence of the Ni related diffraction peaks reflected the substitution of Zn atoms by Ni atoms in the ZnO lattice. The variation of both lattice parameters and crystallite size, as a function of Ni content, indicated that the Ni doping enhance the structural properties of the deposited films. In Raman spectra, the band at 667.9 cm(-1) appeared for doped samples, was attributed to the Zn sites occupied by Ni atoms in the ZnO lattice. In PL spectra, the decrease of the UV band emission intensity, as a function of Ni content, was attributed to Ni ions doping. The concentration of deep level defect such as Zn-i,V-zn and V-o, decreased as a function of the Ni content. The electrical resistivity increase correlated with the increase of the of Ni3+-related impurity concentration which behaves as a source of free electrons for n-type conduction.

The present work explores the method of decoupling the anisotropic MPs directly for bulk soft FSMs. The small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were performed on the [1 0 0]-oriented alloys Fe1-xGax (Galfenol) under a series of magnetic fields. Those two-dimensional (2D) SANS patterns were decomposed and reconstructed by the spherical harmonic approaches. The scattering intensities, which are respectively decomposed into isotropic and anisotropic components, show clearly the pathway of three types of magnetic domains. The 90 degrees domain process is thus quantified directly in the bulk Galfenol. The evolution trend for the domain process is consistent with that for the lattice strain and magnetization responses, which has been respectively evidenced by the in-situ neutron diffraction and initial magnetization measurement. Meanwhile, the quantitatively addressed domain process agrees well with the simulated results by the energy-based domain rotation modelling. These observations indicate that the anisotropic magnetization processes correlate tightly with the lattice strain response, which are of significant importance for the understanding and design of large magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS). The present approach provides a quantitative method for decoupling the magnetization processes, which would be also applicable to other ferromagnetic systems besides Galfenol. This may help the understanding of MFIS mechanism and development of new FSMs.					Zhang, Changsheng/J-2409-2012														0304-8853	1873-4766				NOV 15	2019	490								165495	10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165495													WOS:000475764000006

Elastic continuum stiffness of contractile tail sheaths from molecular dynamics simulations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Contractile tails are key components of the biological nanomachinery involved in cell membrane puncturing, where they provide a means to deliver molecules and ions inside cells. Two intriguing examples of contractile tails are those from bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin. Although the two systems are different in terms of biological activity, they share a fascinatingly similar injection mechanism, during which the tail sheaths of both systems contract from a so-called extended state to around half of their length (the contracted state), accompanied by release of elastic energy originally stored in the sheath. Despite the great prevalence and biomedical importance of contractile delivery systems, many fundamental details of their injection machinery and dynamics are still unknown. In this work, we calculate the bending and torsional stiffness constants of a helical tail sheath strand of bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin, in both extended and contracted states, using molecular dynamics simulations of about one-sixth of the entire sheath. Differences in stiffness constants between the two systems are rationalized by comparing their all-atom monomer structures, changes in sheath architecture on contraction, and differences in interstrand interactions. The calculated coefficients indicate that the T4 strand is stiffer for both bending and torsion than the corresponding R2-pyocin strands in both extended and contracted conformations. The sheath strands also have greater stiffness in the contracted state for both systems. As the main application of this study, we describe how the stiffness constants can be incorporated in a model to simulate the dynamics of contractile nanoinjection machineries.

Small-amplitude collective modes of a finite-size unitary Fermi gas in deformed traps	PHYSICAL REVIEW A												We have investigated collective breathing modes of a unitary Fermi gas in deformed harmonic traps. The ground state is studied by the superfluid local density approximation (SLDA) and small-amplitude collective modes are studied by the iterative quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). The results illustrate the evolutions of collective modes of a small system in traps from spherical to elongated or pancake-shaped deformations. For small spherical systems, the influences of different SLDA parameters are significant, and, in particular, a large pairing strength can shift up the oscillation frequency of collective modes. The transition currents from QRPA show that the compressional flow patterns are nontrivial and dependent on the deformation. Finally, the finite-size effects are demonstrated to be reasonable when progressing towards larger systems. The hydrodynamical results of collective frequencies can be reproduced by SLDA-QRPA with reduced pairing strengths. Our studies indicate that experiments on small and medium systems are valuable for understanding effective interactions in systems with varying sizes and trap deformations.

In this work, we investigated a number of pathways for both heterocoupling and homocoupling reactions and estimated the solvated energy barrier heights. According to the results of our density functional theory (DFT)-based computations, the heterocoupling reaction (C6F5)MgF + C6F6 is a single-step process. We have also studied the (C6F5)MgF + (C6F5)MgF homocoupling reaction with an aryne intermediate. In this particular reaction, a carbon-carbon bond is formed between two nucleophilic carbon centers in a chemically predictable way. The final product, (C12F9)Mg2F3, retains even stronger nucleophilic activity than that of the starting (C6F5)MgF reagent. A very surprising result of our calculations is that this homocoupling of two nucleophilic centers is spontaneous in THF solvent.

We examined the effective mass for the Al2O3/NiO nanoheterostructure material through polarization in the dielectric study. The mean optical effective mass was calculated to be m(opt)*, = 5.69645 X 10(-20) m(op)/m(0) in the UV-visible region (1 x 10(6) to 5.4 x 10(6) Hz). From the group and phase velocity values, we observed that Al2O3/NiO is an anisotropic material. The electron spin-orbit energy splitting associated to electron in the valence band was identified using the Gaussian-confining 3D potential under normalized angular momentum (n, 1 = 0, 1, 2, 3). The 1S (S-1(1/2)) and 2S (S-2(1/2)) orbital ionization energies were calculated to be -6.08 and -5.99 eV for AlO3/NiO. The orbital ionization energies were established from the Bohr radius a(B) = 5.29 X 10(-11) m and donor Rydberg constant R-y = 1.097 x 10(7) m(-1) of the identical hydrogen atom.

Interplay of spin and mass superfluidity in antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates and bicirculation vortices	PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH												This paper investigates the coexistence and interplay of spin and mass superfluidity in antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). The hydrodynamic theory describes the spin degree of freedom by equations similar to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert theory for bipartite antiferromagnetic insulators. The variables in the spin space are two subspins with absolute value h/2, which play the role of two sublattice spins in the antiferromagnetic insulators. As well as in bipartite antiferromagnetic insulators, in antiferromagnetic spin-1 BEC there are two spin-wave modes: One is a gapless Goldstone mode and the other is gapped. The Landau criterion shows that in limit of small total spin (two subspins are nearly antiparallel), the instability of supercurrents starts from the gapped mode. In the opposite limit of large total spin (two subspins are nearly parallel), the gapless modes become unstable earlier than the gapped one. Mass and spin supercurrents decay via phase slips, when vortices cross streamlines of the supercurrent. The vortices participating in phase slips are nonsingular bicirculation vortices. They are characterized by two topological charges, which are winding numbers describing circulations of two angles around the vortex axis. The winding numbers can be half-integers. A particular example of a half-integer vortex is a half-quantum vortex with the superfluid velocity circulation h/2m. However, the superfluid velocity circulation is not a topological charge, and in general the quantum of this circulation can be continuously tuned from 0 to h/2m.

In this study we use light turbidity data due to density-induced refractive index fluctuations to obtain critical amplitudes from image analysis. In order to bring hydrogen (H-2) very close to its critical point, we place the sample cell under weightlessness using a magnetic levitation device. Images of an H-2-filled cell are taken near its critical temperature of 33 K by illuminating the cell with three different filters. We fit the turbidity data to a theoretical expression that allows us to estimate the critical amplitudes of isothermal compressibility and fluctuation correlation length. The values of isothermal compressibility and correlation length obtained from turbidity fitting are compared against literature values. Our data analysis shows a large sensitivity of the fitting parameters to the refractive index value and to even minute density deviations from criticality.

Impact of POD modes energy redistribution on flow reconstruction for unsteady flows of impulsively started airfoils and wings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS												Obtaining accurate solutions of unsteady flows during the design process of an aircraft can be a highly demanding task. Reduced basis methods (RBM) are commonly used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom while preserving high accuracy. RBM based on Proper Othogonal Decomposition (POD) have been extensively used but limitations exist with unsteady problems, where the temporal nonlinear dynamics of the flow needs to be addressed carefully. The accuracy in reconstructing nonlinear unsteady flows by means of RBM for a specific class of impulsively started lifting bodies is addressed. The snapshot POD approach and the recent Spectral POD will be comparatively studied to assess their capacity to reconstruct unsteady flows. The periodic motion past a cylinder will be considered as a benchmark test while the impulsive start of a 2D three-element airfoil and a 3D wing in high-lift configurations will be considered as use cases.

Given a regular energy level E > min V, we consider L-2-normalized eigenfunctions, u(h), of the Schrodinger operator P(h) = -h(2)Delta(g)+V - E(h) with P(h)(uh) = 0 and E(h) = E+o(1) as h -> 0(+). The well-known Agmon-Lithner estimates [5] are exponential decay estimates (i.e. upper bounds) for eigenfunctions in the forbidden region {V > E}. The decay rate is given in terms of the Agmon distance function d(E) associated with the degenerate Agmon metric (V - E)+g with support in the forbidden region. The point of this note is to prove a reverse Agmon estimate (i.e. exponential lower bound for the eigenfunctions) in terms of Agmon distance in the forbidden region under a control assumption on eigenfunction mass in the allowed region {V < E} arbitrarily close to the caustic {V = E}. We then give some applications to hypersurface restriction bounds for eigenfunctions in the forbidden region along with corresponding nodal intersection estimates.																			1424-0637	1424-0661				JAN	2020	21	1					303	325		10.1007/s00023-019-00867-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00023-019-00867-3		NOV 2019											WOS:000496224900002

Specifically, on the basis of the existence of a categorical adjunction between the category of quantum event algebras and the category of presheaves of variable Boolean event algebras, we establish a twofold complementarity scheme consisting of a generalized/global and a restricted/local conceptual dimension, where the latter conception is subordinate to and constrained by the former. In this respect, complementarity is not only understood as a relation between mutually exclusive experimental arrangements or contexts of comeasurable observables, as envisaged by the original conception, but it is primarily comprehended as a reciprocal relation concerning information transfer between two hierarchically different structural kinds of event structure that can be brought into partial congruence by means of the established adjunction. It is further argued that the proposed category-theoretic framework of complementarity naturally advances a contextual realist conceptual stance towards our deeper understanding of the microphysical nature of reality.																			0020-7748	1572-9575				DEC	2019	58	12					4208	4234		10.1007/s10773-019-04292-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10773-019-04292-4		NOV 2019											WOS:000496232500004

XRD analysis results show that all samples are a single-phase perovskite structure; XRD refinement demonstrates that La0.50Ca0.35MnO3 is a single phase with the space group Pbnm. When x = 0.15, the variation of magnetization versus temperature in a magnetic applied field of the sample indicates that La0.5Ca0.35MnO3 is converted from a ferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic phase. The Curie temperature (Tc) of the sample increases with the concentration of vacancy doping. The value of Tc increases from 209.5 to 242.1 K when x increases from 0 to 0.15. The Arrott plot indicates that the phase transition occurring in the sample is a secondary phase transition.

The multi-polar coordinate change method is used to deal with semicircular sag at the boundary position.

Based on the boundary conditions, the integral equations are established. The analytical expressions of the dynamic stress concentration coefficient and electric field intensity concentration coefficient are obtained. By analyzing the order of the guided wave, the physical parameters of the medium, the distance between the center of a circular inclusion, the location of a semicircular depression and a circular inclusion and the radius of the semicircular depression, the dynamic stress concentration factor and electric field intensity concentration factor are analyzed and compared with the existing literature in calculating example.

Anomalous phase shift in a Josephson junction via an antiferromagnetic interlayer	PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH												The anomalous ground-state phase shift in superconductor/antiferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling is predicted and numerically investigated. It is found to be a consequence of the uncompensated magnetic moment at the superconductor/antiferromagnet interfaces. The anomalous phase shift exhibits a strong dependence on the value of the spin-orbit coupling and the sublattice magnetization with the simultaneous existence of stable and metastable branches.

The UV light was only used to generate active species from NH3, not to irradiate the substrate. To determine the effect of the active species on the deposition process, SiNx:H films were deposited via chemical vapor deposition and their refractive index and composition ratio were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the highly reactive species generated from UV-light-irradiated NH3 enabled the deposition of nitrogen-containing films between 30 degrees C and 450 degrees C. N/Si ratio and refractive index of approximately 1.33 and 1.9-2.0, were obtained for a SiNx:H film deposited at 350 degrees C and 450 degrees C, respectively.

Vertical spikes of beam size and centroid have been observed occasionally and randomly during high current operations. These spikes are believed to be caused by ion instabilities associated with vacuum activity localized in the ring. With the functionality of gated beam position monitor (BPM), the newly developed technique utilizes turn-by-turn (TBT) data to detect beam centroid glitches. Whenever one turn trajectory deviates from a predefined window, a global control event is generated to trigger an online TBT data acquisition. The data acquisition is synchronized for all BPMs around the ring. In the meantime, the bunch-by-bunch (BxB) data, which is acquired from a single dedicated feedback BPM, has also been collected for analyzing possible coupled bunch instabilities (CBI). In addition to CBI caused mainly by ion bursts, other types of fast transient motions, such as, the top-off residual disturbance and fast orbit disturbance, have been captured with the new tool. The sources of the glitches can be approximately localized with the synchronized TBT data from multiple BPMs around the ring.

Strong magnetoelastic effect in CeCo<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Fe<i><sub>x</sub></i>Si as Neel order is suppressed	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												A very strong magnetoelastic effect in the CeCo1-xFexSi alloys is reported. The strength of the magnetostrictive effect can be tuned upon changing x. The moderate low-temperature linear magnetostriction observed at low Fe concentrations becomes very large (Delta L/L(16T, 2K) = 3 x 10(-3)) around the critical concentration x(c) approximate to 0.23 at which the long-range antiferromagnetic order vanishes. Upon increasing doping through the nonmagnetic region (x > x(c)), the magnetostriction strength gradually weakens again. The interplay between magnetic order and the Kondo screening appears to cause an enhanced valence susceptibility slightly changing the Ce ions valence, ultimately triggering the large magnetostriction observed around the critical concentration. Previous studies of the evolution of the lattice parameters with x as well as magnetization and x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements support this hypothesis.

Complex conductivity of monolayer graphene and Zitterbewegung	FULLERENES NANOTUBES AND CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES												A recently derived formula for complex conductivity of monolayer graphene is analyzed. We show that the real and imaginary parts in this formula obey the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations, which are a good test for validity of the formula for complex conductivity of monolayer graphene. We consider also an additional test for this formula, sensitive to the integral characteristic of the conductance such as the famous f-sum rule. We write it in the two dimensional form and show that it fulfils identically if we admit the cyclotron mass as an effective one and take the principal value of the integral. We find a deep relation between the graphene complex optical conductivity singularities and electrons Zitterbewegung (ZB) in graphene with frequency omega(ZB). Namely, the value of ZB frequency is related with the recently found magnitudes of the inductance L and capacitance C by Thomson's formula, that is, omega(ZB) = 1/root LC.																			1536-383X	1536-4046				MAR 3	2020	28	3			SI		226	228		10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686621	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686621		NOV 2019											WOS:000495834400001
J	Hart, O; Haroche, M; Castelnovo, C				Hart, Oliver; Haroche, Marianne; Castelnovo, Claudio			Long-range Coulomb interactions and nonhydrodynamic behavior in thermal quenches in spin ice	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												When spin ice systems undergo a sudden thermal quench, they have been shown to enter long-lived metastable states where the monopole excitations form so-called noncontractible pairs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 107201 (2010)]. While the nature of these states is well understood, the dynamical mechanisms underpinning their formation remain largely unexplored and are the subject of this study. We find that the long-range tail of the Coulomb interactions between monopoles plays a central role by suppressing the monopole-assisted decay of noncontractible pairs with respect to monopole-antimonopole annihilation. In conjunction with low final quench temperatures, where the system enters a nonhydrodynamic regime in which the monopoles effectively move at terminal velocity in the direction of the local force acting on them, the interactions lead to a metastable plateau that persists in the thermodynamic limit. This is a remarkable phenomenon, reminiscent of jamming and some instances of glassiness: A transient modification of the short-time dynamics of the system allows it to enter a metastable state whose lifetime can easily be astronomically large at (experimentally relevant) low temperatures. We demonstrate this using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field population dynamics theory, and we provide an analytical understanding of the mechanisms at play. When the interactions between monopoles are truncated to finite range, the metastable plateau reduces to a finite size effect. We derive the finite size scaling behavior of the density of noncontractible pairs in the metastable plateau for both short- and long-range interactions and discuss the experimental implications of our results.

Expanding the Capability of Microwave Multiplexed Readout for Fast Signals in Microcalorimeters	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS												Microwave SQUID multiplexing has become a key technology for reading out large arrays of X-ray and gamma-ray microcalorimeters with mux factors of 100 or more. The desire for fast X-ray pulses that accommodate photon counting rates of hundreds or thousands of counts per second per sensor drives system design toward high sensor current slewrate. Typically, readout of high current slewrate events is accomplished by increasing the sampling rate, such that rates of order 1MHz may be necessary for some experiments. In our microwave multiplexed readout scheme, the effective sampling rate is set by the frequency of the flux-ramp modulation (fr) used to linearize the SQUID response. The maximum current slew rate between samples is then nominally Phi(0)f(r)/2M(in) (where M-in is the input coupling) because it is generally not possible to distinguish phase shifts of > pi from negative phase shifts of < -pi. However, during a pulse, we know which direction the current ought to be slewing, and this makes it possible to reconstruct a pulse where the magnitude of the phase shift between samples is > pi. We describe a practical algorithm to identify and reconstruct pulses that exceed this nominal slew rate limit on the rising edge. Using pulses produced by X-ray transition-edge sensors, we find that the pulse reconstruction has a negligible impact on energy resolution compared to arrival time effects induced by under-sampling the rising edge. This technique can increase the effective slew rate limit by more than a factor of two, thereby either reducing the resonator bandwidth required or extending the energy range of measurable photons. The extra margin could also be used to improve crosstalk or to decrease readout noise.

We demonstrate the topological bound state and spinful Majorana nature of the bulk gapless zeroth LLs in the singlet and triplet cases, respectively. Strain along certain directions can induce two topologically distinct phases in the bulk, with zeroth LLs localized at the interface. These modes are unstable toward ferromagnetism for 2D-S cases.

Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in metals: A diagrammatic approach	PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH												We develop a formalism to study the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) response in metals based on the diagrammatic expansion for its cross section. The standard approach to the solution of the RIXS problem relies on two key approximations: short-range potentials and noninteracting conduction electrons. However, these approximations are inaccurate for charged particles in metals, where the long-range Coulomb interaction and dynamic screening effects are very important. In this work, we study how to extract important information about collective excitations in the Coulomb plasma, plasmons, and electron-hole pairs from RIXS data. We find that single- and multi-plasmon excitations can easily be distinguished by positions of the corresponding peaks, singularities, and their intensities. We also discuss the hybrid processes, where plasmon emission is accompanied by excitation of electron-hole pairs and study how they manifest themselves.

Effect of base-state curvature on self-excited high-frequency oscillations in flow through an elastic-walled channel	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS												We investigate the development of flow-induced small-amplitude high-frequency oscillations occurring in a rigid fluid-conveying channel with a section of the upper wall replaced by a taut elastic sheet. We consider an axially nonuniform base state, caused by a negative transmural pressure (internal minus external), which results in the sheet bending inward, and then examine the evolution of oscillatory perturbations about this state. Due to the curvature of the base state, any normal displacement of the sheet will lead to a change in the axial stretching of the sheet, which is an order of magnitude higher than would be the case for perturbations to a uniform sheet. This stretching provides an additional restoring force that can be dominant. We derive a modified tube law to describe the wall mechanics with this additional effect and combine it with an existing fluid model to obtain a complete description of the system. At leading order, we obtain a one-dimensional eigenvalue problem for the frequencies and mode shapes of the oscillatory perturbations. The nonlinear interaction between the perturbations and the base-state curvature manifests itself as an additional integral term in the eigenvalue problem, corresponding to the total axial stretching in the wall. The normal modes are neutrally stable at leading order, and their slow growth or decay is determined by considering the global energy budget of the system. The stability of the system can be expressed in terms of a critical Reynolds number of the mean flow through the channel. We explain the behavior of the system as two key dimensionless parameters F and K are varied. These quantify the dimensionless axial tension and base-state curvature effects, respectively. Numerical simulations are used to identify distinct flow regimes in parameter space, which we explore further in detail using asymptotic analysis. This reveals that at large K, i.e., strong base-state curvature effects, the leading-order axial profiles of the modes are forced to adjust in order to eliminate the need for significant stretching in the wall. This has the effect of stabilizing both the fundamental and, to a lesser extent, the first harmonic modes, which results in the first harmonic becoming the most unstable mode.

These films might be useful to shape field distributions in passivation stacks or as dielectrics in passive components of integrated circuits such as capacitors. It is shown how such a system can be realized with commercially available materials and simple tools and how they can be significantly improved by adapting the processing techniques applied. The improved electric and dielectric properties are related to changes in the microstructure of the films caused by the different processing conditions. The experiments show that the films possess sufficiently stable properties from room temperature up to 150 degrees C, which enable them to be used in devices. Finally, a model is proposed for the dielectric breakdown of the films that gives a direction for the further improvement of such material systems.

Generation of various classes of entangled states in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate under the influence of interatom collisions	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A												In this paper, we generate some new classes of entangled states of a bimodal Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a pair of tunnel-coupled BEC, in the presence of two- and three-body elastic as well as mode-exchange collisions. The Hamiltonian of the considered system is very complicated, moreover, it can be fortunately transformed into a simple form using a two-mode displacement operator. After introducing the general form of the time evolved state, various classes of entangled states are generated. Indeed, the influence of different orders of tunneling strengths on the generated entangled states has been studied. Depending on the tunneling strength constants, two-, three-and four-partite entangled states are generated, all of which are superposition states of macroscopic number of BEC atoms. Considering three-particle collision dramatically changes the generated entangled states. Moreover, in particular cases, the resulted states are non-entangled. Also, we show that tunneling and collisional interactions can be manipulated to generate a pair of atomic entangled coherent states (quasi-Bell states). In addition, it is observed that the degree of entanglement for two-partite entangled states can be tuned via the number of BEC atoms, i.e. the corresponding concurrences tend to their maximum value by increasing the atoms in both modes of system.

Considering the suitable Born-Mayer- Huggins (BMH) interaction potential, the renormalized phonon spectrum, RPDOS and generalized phonon density of states (GPDOS) of the La2-xSrxCuO4 layered superconductor have been numerically analyzed and it was found that these quantities depend on doping concentration, anharmonicities, and temperature. The results are compared with the inelastic neutron scattering experimental data of GPDOS for La2-xSrxCuO4 and are found in good agreement. The ratio of deviation in GPDOS to GPDOS at critical temperature (T-c = 37.5 K) shows the implicit difference at T-(55 K) > T-c > T-(20 K). The impact of defects, anharmonicities, and electron-phonon interactions in the cuprate superconductors virtually modify the scenario of GPDOS and affirm a large number of exotic peaks in the spectrum.

J	Jia, XF; Chen, WH; Ding, B; He, L				Jia, Xiaofei; Chen, Wenhao; Ding, Bing; He, Liang			Noise test method for dual-gate MOSFET device	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B												In recent years, with the development of mesoscopic physics and nanoelectronics, the research on noise and testing technology of electronic components has been developed. It is well known that noise can characterize the transmission characteristics of carriers in nanoscale electronic components. With the continuous shrinking of the device size, the carrier transport of nanoscale MOSFET devices has been gradually transformed from the traditional drift-diffusion to become the quasi-ballistic or ballistic transport, and its current noise contains granular and thermal noise. The paper by Jeon et al. [The first observation of shot noise characteristics in 10-nm scale MOSFETs, in Proc. 2009 Symp. VLSI Technology (IEEE, Honolulu, 2009), pp. 48-49] presents the variation relation of 20 nm MOSFET current noise with source-drain current and voltage, and its current noise characteristic is between thermal noise and shot noise, so 20 nm MOSFET current noise is shot noise and thermal noise. The paper by Navid et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 101 (2007) 124501] shows through simulation that the 60 nm MOSFET current noise is suppressed shot noise and thermal noise. At present, the current noise has seriously affected the basic performance of the device, thus the circuit cannot work normally. Therefore, it is necessary to study the generation mechanism and characteristics of current noise in electronic components so as to suppress device noise, which can not only realize the reduction of device noise, but also play a positive role in the work-efficiency, life-span and reliability of electronic components.

The copper sheets before and after coating were, respectively, injected as charge into the low-density polyethylene (LDPE), the space charge accumulation in LDPE was tested by the thermally stimulated current (TSC), and the trap level of the dielectric was calculated by the TSC curve. The results show that the work function improves after the modification of the electrode material, the space charge accumulation in LDPE decreases, and the trap level of the polymer reduces. Because of the oxygen vacancies, the titanium coating electrode has significant suppression on the charge injection in LDPE under 30 kV/mm and the tungsten shows excellent inhibition under 70 kV/mm.																			0217-9849	1793-6640				NOV 10	2019	33	31							1950388	10.1142/S0217984919503883	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217984919503883													WOS:000496735100010

The shift of the G and 2D lines is correlated to two different factors. Before performing annealing treatment or annealing under low temperature, the electron transfer on graphene surface is dominated by nonuniform strain effect. As the annealing treatment is enhanced, however, a suitable annealing treatment can eliminate the nonuniform strain effect where the relative work function (WF) between graphene and metal becomes a main factor to determine electronic transfer. Moreover, it is confirmed that the optimized annealing treatment can also decrease effectively the structural defect and induced disorder in graphene due to metallic contacts.																			0217-9849	1793-6640				NOV 10	2019	33	31							1950384	10.1142/S0217984919503846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217984919503846													WOS:000496735100006

The solutions depend on shifted partition numbers and are parametrized in terms of values of zeta-function at pairs of positive numbers greater than 2.

J	Qi, H; Onofrio, R				Qi, Hang; Onofrio, Roberto			Black hole production at lepton colliders	PHYSICS LETTERS B												Production of black holes has been discussed in a variety of extensions of the Standard Model, and related bounds have been established from data taken at the Large Hadron Collider. We show that, if the Higgs particle has a fully gravitational content via the equivalence principle, enhanced cross-sections of black holes at colliders should be expected within the Standard Model itself. The case of black hole production by precision measurements at electron colliders is discussed. The Coulomb repulsion strongly suppresses the related cross-section with respect to the one based on the hoop conjecture, making the possible production of black holes still unfeasible with current beam technology. At the same time, this suggests the reanalysis of the bounds, based on the hoop conjecture, already determined in hadronic collisions for extra-dimensional models. (C) 2019 The Authors.

J	Ygael, T; Davidson, A				Ygael, Tomer; Davidson, Aharon			Mini-superspace universality and no-scale quantum cosmology	PHYSICS LETTERS B												We prove that, at the mini superspace level, and for an arbitrary Brans-Dicke parameter, one cannot tell traditional Einstein-Hilbert gravity from local scale invariant Weyl-Dirac gravity. Both quantum mechanical cosmologies are governed by the one and the same time-independent single-variable Hartle-Hawking wave function. It is only that its original argument, the cosmic scale factor a, is replaced by alpha phi (phi being the dilaton field) to form a Dirac in-scalar. The Weyl vector enters quantum cosmology only in the presence of an extra dimension, where its fifth component, serving as a 4-dim Kaluza-Klein in-scalar, governs the near Big Bang behavior of the wave function. The case of a constant Kaluza-Klein in-radius is discussed in some detail. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Specific surface area and neutron scattering analysis of water's glass transition and micropore collapse in amorphous solid water	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B												Physico-chemical instability is commonly associated with the amorphous state, and the understanding of instability mechanisms (e.g. the glass transition) involved is essential in designing pharmaceutical products. The glass transition of bulk water might occur at 210 K [Oguni et al., T. Phys. Chem. B 115 (2011) 14023] but it was recently proposed that the glass transition of water could happen around 121 K [C. R. Hill et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016) 215501]. Note that molecular self-inclusions in a glassy water show relaxation features that are characteristically different from those observed in thermodynamically stable, crystalline solids with inclusions. Here we point out some doubtful results and calculations in Hill et al.'s work [C. R. Hill et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016) 215501] which was based on the small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements. We also made some remarks about the possible mistakes in their previous works [C. Mitterdorfer, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 16 (2014) 16013] considering the calculation of the specific surface area. The latter is crucial to the doubtful fixing of the glass transition temperature in Hill et al.'s work [C. R. Hill et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016) 215501].

In the simplest two-dimensional case, which corresponds to a low elevation of the source and receiver with respect to building roofs, agreement of the results of the analysis and numerical calculations of the shape of the received pulse is demonstrated in the case of a single reflection of the pulse from building walls. The dependence of the pulse duration on various factors is analyzed with allowance for multiple reflections and diffraction by the roofs of urban structures.

Reflection and Refraction of Harmonic Plane Acoustic Waves by a Plane Interface of Media with Arbitrary Acoustic Properties	RADIOPHYSICS AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS												We propose universal formulas for the amplitudes of longitudinal and transverse plane acoustic waves, which are reflected and refracted by a plane interface of two media. The formulas are valid for liquid and gaseous media, as well as for elastic isotropic media. Advantages of these formulas are their relative clarity compared with the well-known and commonly accepted formulas, as well as a possibility to pass over from one scattering problem to another by simply replacing the corresponding wave numbers. Despite the well-known methods which are used in the calculations and rather have a methodical character, we manage to find a new type of surface waves at the interface of elastic media. These waves are characterized either by ratios of the wave numbers of transverse waves and densities, or by only the wave numbers of longitudinal waves and the ratio of the densities of media.																			0033-8443	1573-9120				SEP	2019	62	4					257	266		10.1007/s11141-019-09974-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11141-019-09974-x		NOV 2019											WOS:000495204200005

An exact analytic solution for the reduced dynamics of a two-level system in this model has been obtained. It is shown that the initial correlations can improve the coherence in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. Moreover, the performance of weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal can further enhance the coherence. Remarkably, the system's coherence approach to a steady value in the long time limit. This phenomenon of "coherence trapping" originates from the fact that the quantum measurement reversal functions as a coherent driving and retrieves the coherence.																			0020-7748	1572-9575				JAN	2020	59	1					159	165		10.1007/s10773-019-04305-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10773-019-04305-2		NOV 2019											WOS:000495036100001

This article explores an area efficient 40 Gb/s configuration of passive element free current mode decision module implemented in 90 nm CMOS technology. The simulation using Cadence Virtuoso platform is carried out at a power supply of 1.2 V along with a clock frequency of 40 GHz and pseudo random bit sequence data input of (2(7) - 1) having 1 ns bit period. The device foot print of entire arrangement is (76 x 23) mu m(2), which reads a power dissipation, delay, PDP, peak-to-peak jitter and RMS jitter of 7.02 mW, 198.1 ps, 1.391 pJ, 58.00 ps and 13.12 ps respectively.

Critical point in a holographic defect field theory	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS												We study a holographic gauge theory dual to the D3/D5 intersection. We consider a pure gauge B-field flux through the internal two-sphere wrapped by the probe D5-brane, which corresponds to a non-commutative configuration of adjoint scalars. There is a domain wall separating the theory into regions with different ranks of the adjoint group. At zero temperature the theory is supersymmetric and at finite temperature there is a critical point of a second order phase transition.

The main attention was paid to the determination of the mechanism of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation. The well-resolved quadrupole structure of the Cu-63.65 NMR spectrum allowed us to investigate the kinetics of nuclear magnetization recovery for both Cu isotopes.

A Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) numerical simulation was realised at a Reynolds number of with respect to the slot jet width. The topological characteristics of the flow were also analyzed using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method. It was therefore possible to propose a sequence of flow topologies (four distinct flow states) during the changeover phenomenon of the impinging slot jet. The results show that the asynchronous phenomenon of the impinging slot jet seems to be related to the transitional characteristics of the jet flow. The flow topology of the most stable and energetic states (top and bottom jet flow states) creates a pressure imbalance inside the area of interest, resulting in the appearance of two transitional flow states. For the top or bottom impinging jet flow states, the jet remains in a relatively stationary position and the flow in the area of interest is quasi-two-dimensional. However, during the rapid changeover of the jet between these two states, small vortex structures prevail inside the area of interest for the centre jet states.																			1061-8562	1029-0257				NOV 26	2019	33	10					421	436		10.1080/10618562.2019.1686141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10618562.2019.1686141		NOV 2019											WOS:000494596700001

To obtain time resolved measurements of the CAJ propagation, a high-resolution spatial spectroscopy technique was implemented. Measurement results show a weak dependence on discharge current magnitude. The CAJ propagation corresponds well with a Taylor-Sedov blast-wave model, with an explosive yield similar to 0.5% of the arc energy. At 0.25 mu s after discharge ignition the instantaneous speed of the CAJ is similar to 5 km s(-1) and after 1 mu s the CAJ slows to a sonic speed. These results imply that the CAJ is effective for flow manipulation when operated at single pulse durations of several micro-seconds.

J	Yang, JY; Gotoh, T; Miura, H; Watanabe, T				Yang, Jingyuan; Gotoh, Toshiyuki; Miura, Hideaki; Watanabe, Takeshi			Intermittency of an incompressible passive vector convected by isotropic turbulence	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS												The intermittency of an incompressible passive vector convected by homogeneous isotropic turbulence is studied by comparison with that of the velocity and passive scalar. This is used to explore the physics underlying the differences in statistical properties between the velocity vector and passive scalar. Direct numerical simulations with grid points of 1024(3) and two types of forcing method are performed at Reynolds numbers of Re-lambda similar to 200, 300, and 400. It is found that the probability density function (PDF) of the passive vector is wider than Gaussian. The PDFs of the logarithm of the dissipation rates of the kinetic energy, for the velocity and passive vector, are close to each other and well approximated by the log-normal distribution. Unlike the pressure PDF, which is negatively skewed, the PDF for the pseudopressure P(q) is nearly symmetric. Visualization results show that the pseudoenstrophy Omega(w) for the passive vector is close to sheetlike, similar to the case of the passive scalar, while the enstrophy is tubelike. The scaling exponents of the passive vector moments are found to be anomalous, nonuniversal at high order, and intermediate between the velocity and passive scalar for the order p >= 4. The pseudopressure tends to reduce the extreme events, while the linearity of the fundamental equation leads to stronger intermittency.

J	Huan, L; Hui, X				Huan, Luo; Hui, Xiao			Analysis of broadening mechanism of ionospheric echo spectrum and spectrum sharpening method	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												High-frequency sky wave detection equipment must rely on the ionosphere as the propagation medium in the early warning and sea state remote sensing tasks. The ionosphere is time-varying and unstable, which will change the characteristics of the high-frequency electromagnetic wave propagating through it, resulting in the broadening of the echo spectrum, thus seriously affecting the detection of targets and the inversion of sea state parameters. The reason and mechanism of the echo spectrum expansion are analyzed in detail from the dispersion effect, phase contamination and multimode propagation. The bandwidth of the dispersion effect is different from that of the high frequency detection equipment. When the bandwidth of the sky wave equipment is 3-30 MHz, the bandwidths of the dispersion effect are 41.6-57.4 kHz and 0.17-10.8 MHz. The multi-quasiparabolic ionospheric model is used to discuss the frequency selection measures to avoid multimode propagation. The modulation process of ionospheric contamination to echo is studied theoretically. It is shown that the nonlinear phase contamination will cause the energy of echo to diffuse in frequency domain and to be unable to accumulate. To solve the problem of phase contamination which is difficult to solve in practice, a contamination correction method without estimating the instantaneous frequency of the echo is proposed. In the method the consistency principle of signal subspace and signal frequency vector expansion space is used, and therefore the phase contamination term can be well estimated. Based on the real data, the contamination correction results from the proposed method, phase gradient autofocus method, maximum entropy spectral analysis method and time-frequency processing method are given. The results show that the new method is a better method and can effectively sharpen the broadened echo spectrum.

J	Li, CX; Shi, ZX; Zhuang, LY; Ye, XM				Li Chun-Xi; Shi Zhi-Xian; Zhuang Li-Yu; Ye Xue-Min			Effect of surfactants on thin film spreading under influence of surface acoustic wave	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												For the spreading of thin and free film of a partially wetting liquid with insoluble surfactant under the influence of surface acoustic wave, the dimensionless evolution equations governing the spreading dynamics are derived. The evolution equations contain the film thickness and the surface concentration of insoluble surfactant. Assuming that the thickness of the thin film is much smaller than the wavelength of sound in the liquid, the sound leaking off the surface acoustic wave cannot be sustained in the liquid film, and the acoustic radiation pressure and attenuation of the acoustic wave in the solid are both weak. Then the films spreading under different physical mechanisms are observed by numerical simulation. The results show that the surface acoustic wave drives the liquid film to spread and move. When the capillary stress is weak and the liquid film spreading is mainly controlled by the drift induced by surface acoustic wave, the spreading process consists of rapid spreading stage and balancing stage, and the Marangoni effect caused by uneven distribution of surfactant makes the liquid film spread faster in the first stage. When the capillary stress and the drift jointly dominate film spreading, the spreading process contains three stages, i.e. spreading stage, contracting stage and balancing stage. The effect of surfactant accelerates the spreading process, but the existence of contracting stage makes it take longer for the film to reach equilibrium. In addition, the disjoining pressure used in this paper promotes the liquid film spreading, as well as the Marangoni effect. As the correlation coefficient between disjoining pressure and surfactant concentration, a, and the Marangoni number, M, increase, the maximum thickness and the spreading radius of liquid film change faster.																			1000-3290					NOV 5	2019	68	21							214703	10.7498/aps.68.20190791	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190791													WOS:000496172100020
J	Ma, MY; Wu, H; Chen, Z				Ma Ming-Yu; Wu Han; Chen Zhuo			Polarization state of second harmonic generation in split ring resonator based meta-molecule	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												In this paper, we study the second harmonic generation (SHG) from the stero-stacked meta-molecules consisting of two vertically stacked split ring resonators (SRRs) that resonate at the fundamental wavelength. When pumped by the linearly polarized incident wave with the electric field direction along one of the SRRs' arms, the meta-molecules emit the SHG that can have two non-zero orthogonal electric field components, provided that the top SRR and the bottom SRR are not arranged in mutually parallel or anti-parallel manner. Due to the strong coupling between the two SRRs, the plasmonic properties of the stero-stacked meta-molecules could be tuned by varying the twist angle between the two SRRs. In this process, we demonstrate that the amplitudes of the two orthogonal SHG field components, and the phase difference between these two components can be varied with changing the twist angle between two SRRs. Based on the concept of the light polarization, different polarization states can be achieved by changing the differences in phase and amplitude between the orthogonal field components. Therefore, the twist angle dependent amplitudes of and phase difference between two orthogonal SHG field components can be used to manipulate the polarization states of the emitted SHG. For the stero-stacked meta-molecules with a fixed twist angle of 60 degrees, elliptically, near-circularly andnear-linearly polarized SHG emission can be obtained at different fundamental wavelengths. In addition, for the fundamental wave with a fixed wavelength of 1500 nm, the stero-stacked meta-molecules with different twist angles are demonstrated to be able to emit SHG with elliptical andnear-linear polarization states.																			1000-3290					NOV 5	2019	68	21							214205	10.7498/aps.68.20190837	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190837													WOS:000496172100010

It is shown that thermal annealing at the temperature of healing defects does not change the structure of both kinds of the investigated pseudo spin valves and improves magnetoresistance. The high-temperature annealing at 750 K leads to the formation disordered solid solution Ag(Co) based on fcc-Ag lattice and affects not only the magnetoresistive curve shape in perpendicular orientation of the magnetic field but also its sign in the case of Co(5)/Ag(d(Ag))/Py(5)/Sub pseudo spin valve.

The Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the evolved descents of the most massive, extremely hot (temperatures up to 200000 K) and very luminous (10(5) L-circle dot - 10(6) L-circle dot) O stars, with 25M(circle dot) - 30M(circle dot) solar mass for solar metallicity. The WR stars possess very strong stellar winds, which have velocities up to 3000 km/s and wind mass loss rate 10(-5) M-circle dot a year. These winds are observed in the broad emission line profiles (sometimes, even P-Cygni profiles) of WR spectra in the optical and UV range. Actually, these winds are so strong that they can peel the star and convert it into a nude nucleus without envelope. It has been found that three bright galactic stars located at Cygnus region have broad strong emission bands, rather than absorptions lines, superposed on the typical continuum of hot stars. In 1930 Beals correctly identified these features as emission lines produced by high ionized elements such as helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The physical factors which can affect the evolution of WR stars are explored in this paper. These physical factors include stellar mass, initial velocities, orbital periods, metallicities, etc. According to the equations for angular momentum transfer and chemical element diffusion, we can ascertain how these physical factors influence the evolution of WR stars and the mixing of chemical elements in WR stars. The result indicates that massive stars with high initial velocities and metallicities have strong stellar winds and be prone to producing WR stars. In contrast with the counterpart with high metallicities, it is hard for the single star with low metallicity to generate WR star due to weak wind. However, the star with very high initial velocity and low metallicity can form chemical homogenious evolution. The star has an enlarged convective core and a very thin hydrogen envelope and it can also generate WR star. The component in the binary system with short orbital period can transfer mass to the companion star through Roche lobe overflow, and this physical process can produce WR star under the condition of low metallicity. Furthermore, mass removal due to Roche lobe overflow reduces the temperature of stellar convective core and rate of nuclear reaction. It is shown that mass metallicities of chemical elements including He-4, C-12, F-19, Ne-22, Na-23, Mg-25 in the primary star are higher than those in the single stars, whereas mass metallicities of chemical elements including H-1, N-14, O-16, Ne-20, and Al-26 are lower than those in the single counterparts. In a word, the conditions for massive stars with high initial velocities and metallicities in the binary system with short orbital period favor the formation of WR stars.																			1000-3290					NOV 5	2019	68	21							219701	10.7498/aps.68.20191040	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20191040													WOS:000496172100035
J	Zhang, SH; Shao, M; Zhang, SZ; Zhou, JH				Zhang Shu-He; Shao Meng; Zhang Sheng-Zhao; Zhou Jin-Hua			Light rays in Fourier domain	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												Establishing a universal model to characterize the relationship between light rays and optical waves is of great significance in optics. The ray model provides us with an intuitive way to study the propagation of beams as well as their interaction between objects. Traditional ray model is based on the normal of a beam wave front. The normal vector is defined as the direction of ray. However, it fails to describe the relationship between light ray and optical wave in the neighborhood of focus or caustic lines/surface since light ray in those regions are no longer perpendicular to the wavefront. In this work, the ray model of a light beam is built according to its Fourier angular spectrum, where the positions of rays can be determined by the gradient of the phase of the Fourier angular spectrum. On the other hand, the Fourier angular spectrum of a light beam can be reconstructed through the ray model. Using Fourier angular spectra, we construct the ray model of two typical beams including the Airy beam and the Cusp beam. It is hard to construct ray model directly from the optical field of these beams. In this ray model, the information about ray including direction and position involves the propagation properties of light beams such as self-accelerating. In addition, we demonstrate that the optical field of the focused plane wave can be reconstructed by the ray model in Fourier regime, and the optical field in spatial domain can be obtained by inverse Fourier transform. Simulation results are consistent with the results from Debye's method. Finally, the high-dimensional ray model of light beams is elaborated in both spatial and spectral regime. Combined with focused plane wave, Airy beam and rays in quadratic gradient-index waveguide, our results show that the ray model actually carries the information about optical field in both spatial and Fourier domain. Actually, the traditional ray model is just a spatial projection of the high-dimensional ray model. Hence, when traditional ray model fails at the focus or caustic lines/surface, it is able to obtain the spectrum of the corresponding optical field from the Fourier domain, and then obtain the field distribution in spatial domain by inverse Fourier transform.

In this paper, the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions on the bottom surface of the small-sized PILGP are presented. The two-dimensional micro-prism expressions make the micro-prisms spread out on a two-dimensional scale of the bottom surface of the PILGP. By fitting and analyzing a large number of simulation data, the relationship expressions between the coefficients of the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions and the structural parameters of the PILGP are established. The above expressions are directly applied to the two-dimensional distribution design of micro-prism on the bottom surface of small-sized PILGPs with different structural parameters. Without the help of the designers' experience and the multiple simulations of the software, the average value of luminance uniformity in the partial integrated BLMs is obtained to be 84.94%. The simulation results show that the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions and coefficient relation-expressions presented in this paper have important application value. Take the 5-inch partial integrated BLM for example. The two-dimensional distribution of the micro-prism on the bottom surface of the PILGP with high luminance uniformity can be obtained directly by using the above expressions. By fine-tuning the coefficients of two-dimensional micro-prism expressions, calculated by the coefficient relation-expressions, the utilization of light energy, illuminance uniformity and luminance uniformity of the partial integrated BLM respectively reach 90.69%, 88.02% and 92.17%, which meet the practical requirements. The optimization and design time of the partial integrated BLM are both greatly saved. Further, the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions on the bottom surface of the PILGP are analyzed and the physical mechanism is explained reasonably. This work is of significance for the distribution design of the microstructures on the surface of the LGP.					zhang, xu/GYE-3558-2022; xu, ping/KSM-3277-2024														1000-3290					NOV 5	2019	68	21							218501	10.7498/aps.68.20190854	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190854													WOS:000496172100032

In order to solve the problem of inner magnetic pole etching in anode layer Hall plasma thruster, the effect of anode magnetic shield on inner magnetic pole etched in anode layer Hall thruster is studied by combining particle simulation PIC with sputtering simulation. The magnetic shielding of anode changes the distribution of magnetic field configuration on the surface of the anode, and improves the magnetic mirror ratio of the magnetic mirror field of the thruster to the magnetic field width of the positive gradient on the central axis. The ratio of the magnetic mirror is 1.4 times that of the original one, and two additional saddle magnetic fields are added on both sides of the original saddle magnetic field region. It not only is conducive to confining electrons and improving the ionization rate of working gas, but also keeps a certain distance between the anode and the high temperature electron region, which provides the reliable reference data for the design of high power Hall plasma thruster. When the discharge voltage is 900 V and the working pressure is 2 x 10(-2) Pa, the simulation results show that after the anode is shielded by the magnetic shield, the energy range of most of the incident ions on the inner magnetic pole is 40-260 eV, which is 100 eV lower than the energy range 40-360 eV in the case without shielding the anode. The probability distribution of particle energy without magnetically shielding the anode between 260 eV and 600 eV is obviously higher than that of ion energy with magnetically shielding the anode. The maximum probability distribution of cosine value of incident angle is extended from a small range near 0.1 (incident angle 84 degrees) to a large range of 0.1-0.45 (incident angle 84 degrees-63 degrees). The magnetic shielding makes the incident ions disperse on the surface of the inner magnetic pole, which is helpful in reducing the etching of inner magnetic pole. The maximum etching rate of inner magnetic pole after the anode has been magnetically shielded is reduced from 16 x 10(-10) m/s to 6.1 x 10(-10) m/s, which is 2.62 times lower. The comparison of simulation results with experimental results in the case without magnetically shielding the anode shows that they are in good agreement.																			1000-3290					NOV 5	2019	68	21							215202	10.7498/aps.68.20190654	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190654													WOS:000496172100023
J	Zhou, BR; Tan, YD; Shen, XJ; Zhu, KY; Bao, LP				Zhou Bo-Rui; Tan Yi-Dong; Shen Xue-Ju; Zhu Kai-Yi; Bao Li-Ping			Mechanism of contrast-enhancement in ultrasound-modulated laser feedback imaging with ultrasonic microbubble contrast agent	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												Ultrasound-modulated optical imaging technology is a new type of biological tissue optical detection technology, and sensitive to the change of scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient of biological tissue. This technology is a non-ionizing and non-invasive pathological detection method, which has great potential application in early detection of cancer. However, ultrasound-modulated optical imaging technology is insufficient in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and imaging contrast. Frequency-shifted laser feedback technology with microchip laser is a new type of highly sensitive interference technology, whose gain coefficient for weak optical signal can reach 10(6). This technology can greatly improve the SNR of imaging. Combined with the high sensitive laser feedback technology, the ultrasound-modulated laser feedback technology is proposed. The SNR of this technology is better than that of the traditional ultrasound-modulated optical imaging technology. The increase in SNR can achieve greater depth of detection in biological tissue imaging, but there is no significant improvement in imaging contrast. In order to improve the contrast of biological tissue imaging and achieve high resolution imaging of thick biological tissue, we use ultrasound microbubble contrast agent in ultrasound-modulated laser feedback imaging technology. We establish a Monte Carlo photon transport model with microbubbles in order to study the mechanism of contrast enhancement in ultrasound-modulated laser feedback imaging with microbubbles. Finally, we establish an experimental system to verify the correctness of the simulation results. Experimental and simulation results show that in the transparent solution, the ultrasonic microbubble contrast agent can enhance the ultrasound-modulated laser feedback signal and generate harmonic modulation, which can improve the imaging contrast by detecting the enhancement of the fundamental and harmonic signals of the feedback. In the scattering medium, the ultrasonic microbubble contrast agent can significantly attenuate the ultrasound modulated laser feedback signal, and the imaging contrast can be improved by detecting the attenuation of the fundamental and harmonic signal.																			1000-3290					NOV 5	2019	68	21							214304	10.7498/aps.68.20190770	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190770													WOS:000496172100017

J	Harvey, AH				Harvey, Allan H.			Influence of Isotopologue Dipole Moments on Precision Dielectric-Constant Measurements	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY												Measurements of the relative permittivity (static dielectric constant) of fluids such as methane have been interpreted with the assumption of zero dipole moment. This assumption is not strictly true, due to the presence of isotopologues with small, nonzero dipole moments. We investigate the significance of this effect by analyzing the effect of the dipole of CH3D on the static dielectric constant of methane. It is found that the isotopologue effect is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty of the best existing measurements. Similar estimates for other compounds such as H-2 and CO2 produce even smaller effects. Therefore, the interpretation of these measurements with a dipole moment of zero remains valid.

Drift-diffusion processes resulting from elimination of fast variables under inhomogeneous conditions	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												The problem of eliminating fast-relaxing variables to obtain an effective diffusion process in position is solved in a uniform and straightforward way for models with velocity a function jointly of position and fast variables. A more unified view is thereby obtained of the effect of environmental inhomogeneity on the motion of a diffusing particle, in particular, whether a drift is induced, covering both passive and active particles.

As a prototype, we study effective spins induced in an impunity sites doped AKLT model by constructing the exact ground state in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We characterize their responses to external fields by studying an extended Zeeman interaction. We also study the antiferromagnetic bond-alternating Heisenberg chain with defect structures. For this model, an MPS representation similar to that for the AKLT model, "a uniform MPS with windows," is constructed, and it gives a good approximation of the ground state. We discuss the trade-off relation between the window length and the precision of the MPS ansatz. The effective exchange interaction between the induced spins is also investigated by using this representation.

As a consequence, we obtain an upper bound on the covariance between two [0, 1]-valued functions depending on the configuration of the random interlacements on F and F + x, respectively.

In the study, the following variables are alternated: high-speed steel (HSS) vs. hard metal (HM), and with and without the assistance of high-density electropulses. The corrosion rates are determined using comparative studies such as gravimetric analysis, salt spray chamber test, electrochemical polarization curve techniques (PC), and linear polarization resistance (LPR). Differences in surface microhardness were evaluated by applying optical microscopy and planimetric procedures. Specimens subjected to electropulses and turned with HM reported greater reductions of corrosion rates. Changes in corrosion behavior can be explained in terms of grain shape factor h variation. The present study demonstrates that electropulsing affects the corrosion behavior of AISI/SAE 1045 steel after the turning process.

The upper age limit of reconstruction is not determined because tenocytes from old individuals have less proliferative ability than young ones. Dexamethasone is commonly used to deal with musculoskeletal disorder with dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward tenocytes. Ascorbic acid is essential for tenocytes culture and collagen secretion and can alleviate the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone. In the current study, a microfluidic platform was used to screen the best dexamethasone and ascorbic acid combination treatment for tenocytes from young and old donors because it has been proven to provide a high throughput analysis platform. Comparison of their proliferation under three concentrations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone was performed. Tenocytes proliferation among young and old donors was also measured when exposed to nine combinations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone. The result confirmed the differences in cells proliferation when hamstring tenocytes from different ages of donors are exposed to different concentrations of dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. Tenocytes from old donors are not always more susceptible to dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. An optimal dose of ascorbic acid in decreasing the cytotoxic effect of dexamethasone can be screened by a high throughput microfluidic platform.

Our study aimed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the CAD/CAM-based template for maxillary orthognathic surgery using dry skulls. After reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual skull model, a surface-based surgical template for Le Fort I osteotomy was designed and fabricated using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology. To determine accuracy, the deviation of the template between the planned and the actual position and the fitness of the template were evaluated. The mean deviation was 0.41 +/- 0.30 mm in the medio-lateral direction, 0.55 +/- 0.59 mm in the antero-posterior direction, and 0.69 +/- 0.59 mm in the supero-inferior direction. The root mean square deviation between the planned and the actual position of the template was 1.21 +/- 0.54 mm. With respect to the fitness of the template, the mean distance between the inner surface of the template and the underlying bone surface was 0.76 +/- 0.24 mm. CAD/CAM-based templates showed precise positioning and good fitness. These results suggest that surface topography-based CAD-CAM templates can be considered as an alternative solution in replacing the traditional intermediate splints for the transfer of surgical plans.																				2076-3417				NOV 2	2019	9	22							4928	10.3390/app9224928	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9224928													WOS:000502570800205
J	Kajiya, D				Kajiya, Daisuke			An agar sandwich method for patterning transparent conducting oxides	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS												Transparent electrodes are frequently used to drive opto-electronic devices, and the patterning of these electrodes is essential. The present work demonstrates a facile means of removing transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) from a glass substrate in selected areas. When agarose gel (agar), a material typically used in desserts, is sandwiched between two TCO-coated glass substrates and connected to a dry cell, the TCO is removed from the glass at the agar stamping area within 2 min. This method allows etching of TCOs using acid-free, inexpensive, and readily available starting materials. Analyses by optical microscopy, transmission spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that this etching occurs as a result of reduction of the TCO in conjunction with the electrolysis of water at the interface between the TCO and agar surfaces. Using this technique, high-throughput patterning of TCOs with an edge resolution of several micrometres was achieved. Furthermore, the shape of the agar template can be readily changed simply by cutting the agar using scissors. Therefore, this method provides a useful means for both researchers and students to easily fabricate patterned substrates for use in electronics and related technologies.

The proposed system approximates the physical movements of a real vehicle using a proportional derivative (PD) servo which estimates proper torques for wheels and controls a vehicle's acceleration based on the conditions of the given trajectory. To avoid expensive simulation calculation, the input trajectory is segmented and compared to the optimized trajectories stored in a path library. Based on the similarity of the curve shape between the input and simulated trajectories, an iterative search method is introduced to generate a physically derivable trajectory for convincing simulation results. For an interaction with other objects in the virtual environment, the surface of the vehicle is subdivided into several parts and deformed individually from external forces. As demonstrated in the experimental results, the proposed system can create diverse traffic scenes with multiple vehicles in a fully automated way.

Excess thermodynamic properties: excess molar volume, excess isentropic compressibility, excess isothermal compressibility, excess free length, excess isobaric thermal expansion coefficient, excess ultrasonic velocity and refractive index deviations are computed and fitted with Redlich-Kister polynomial equation to obtain the binary coefficients and the standard deviations. The existence of specific interactions in the mixture is revealed by excess properties, and further supported by partial molar properties. FTIR analysis ascertains the dominance of packing effect in the studied mixtures. Prediction of refractive index for the mixtures and pure components is done by several mixing rules with the estimation of relative errors.

Forced autoionisation in the Yb 6<i>snd</i> series	MOLECULAR PHYSICS												We have observed the conversion of a level perturbing the Yb series into a forced autoionisation resonance by the application of a static field. The perturbing level is barely visible in the zero field excitation spectrum, leading us to expect the forced autoionisation resonance to be manifested as a dip in the spectrum as a Fano 0 feature. Instead, we observe a pronounced peak with a 3. As shown by a quantum defect theory analysis, the zero field spectrum is consisitent with 3. The apparent discrepancy arises from the combination of the rapid radiative decay of the perturbing level, the weakness of the configuration interaction and the discreteness of the zero field spectrum.

In this study, the tensile behavior of a steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was evaluated in the joint of a modular flexural member. The modular specimen was fabricated with a 400 mm joint, and an integral specimen was fabricated with the same specifications as the modular specimen, without a joint. The largest crack width of the integral specimen was measured at the center of the beam, and that of the modular specimen was measured at the discontinuity interface. The maximum crack width of the modular specimen was greater than that of the integral specimen. The strain of the steel reinforcement was estimated using the measured crack width and six formulas for evaluating the crack width. The estimated strain of the modular specimen was higher than that of the integral specimen, and the deformation of the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was accelerated with the increasing load. Therefore, the tensile load was concentrated at the discontinuity interface in the modular specimen, and the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was likely to yield earlier than the integral specimen.

Three-dimensional visualization of information is expected to facilitate visual search for radiologists. However, as the differences in user performance, depending on radiologist experience, have not yet been assessed for real three-dimensional images, it is difficult to estimate the usability of new visualization systems for radiologists with different amounts of professional search experience. In this study, we aimed to determine how three-dimensional visual search is affected by radiologist experience and the physical properties of stimuli. Radiologists, residents, and medical students accomplished visual search tasks with varying set sizes and target-distractor similarities. Search items were presented on multiple display planes and image manipulation was conducted using a computer keyboard. We compared the search outcome and strategy among three groups of participants. All three groups submitted a similar number of correct responses depending on target-distractor similarity. However, in contrast to radiologists and residents, it took a considerably longer time for students to find the targets. The major differences were evident in search strategy when comparing the image manipulations of radiologists with those of residents and students. Our results demonstrated that experienced radiologists' search performance benefited from seeing the entire three-dimensional view of an image, whereas residents and students focused instead on reducing the amount of information and searched in a selective manner. These findings should be taken into account when planning the implementation of new workstations with three-dimensional visualization in radiology.

J	Shao, CP; Li, HY; Wang, Z; Fang, JY				Shao, Cuiping; Li, Huiyun; Wang, Zheng; Fang, Jiayan			A Generic Block-Level Error Confinement Technique for Memory Based on Principal Component Analysis	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Nanoscale CMOS technology has encountered severe reliability issues especially in on-chip memory. Conventional word-level error resilience techniques such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC) suffer from high physical overhead and inability to correct increasingly reported multiple bit flip errors. On the other hands, state-of-the-art applications such as image processing and machine learning loosen the requirement on the levels of data protection, which result in dedicated techniques of approximated fault tolerance. In this work, we introduce a novel error protection scheme for memory, based on feature extraction through Principal Component Analysis and the modular-wise technique to segment the data before PCA. The extracted features can be protected by replacing the fault vector with the averaged confinement vectors. This approach confines the errors with either single or multi-bit flips for generic data blocks, whilst achieving significant savings on execution time and memory usage compared to traditional ECC techniques. Experimental results of image processing demonstrate that the proposed technique results in a reconstructed image with PSNR over 30 dB, while robust against both single bit and multiple bit flip errors, with reduced memory storage to just 22.4% compared to the conventional ECC-based technique.

The results show that the decay rate of the WTDs of the cavity for short and long time limits can be effectively tuned by the driving external field Rabi frequency, the frequency of the cavity photon, and the detuning between the microwave driving frequency and the energy-splitting of the DQDs. The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction. This also demonstrates that the effect of the DQDs can be replaced a thermal reservoir when the rate difference of a photon absorbed and emitted by DQDs is larger than zero; otherwise, it is irreplaceable. The results deepen our understanding of the statistical properties of photon emission counting. It has a promising application in the construction of nanostructured devices of photon emission on demand and of optoelectronic devices.

Andrzej Bachowicz using an obstacle lighting lamp that is currently in production. The developed simulation model, which has been verified experimentally, was used to determine the influence of changes in meteorological parameters on the temperature distributions on the surface of the lamp. It will be used in the future to optimize the geometry of the heat sink used in the lamp in terms of electricity consumption and thermal resistance. It is planned to extend the application of the lamp under difficult climatic conditions. Abstract The article presents the results of experimental and theoretical works aimed at determining the distribution of heat emitted by an obstacle lighting lamp. These kind of lamps are commonly applied as a warning for air traffic vehicles. There is a need for lighting devices with various intensities, whose application depends on the location and operating conditions. The overall aim of the author's work is to develop a computer model that would enable us to conduct research aimed at determining the optimal parameters of lamp operation without the need to build many physical models. Measurements of heat emitted by a currently manufactured lamp were made, and based on these, a numerical model of the lamp operating under laboratory conditions was developed. The considered lamp has two heat sources, one of which is light-emitting diodes (LEDs), while the other heat source consists of stabilizers and other elements of the lamp power supply system. After positive experimental verification of the numerical model, theoretical analyses of heat emission under various meteorological conditions were carried out, while the values of ambient temperature and airflow velocity were changed; then, the influence of these parameters on the temperature distribution on the surface of the lamp was determined.

First, a single-frequency continuously tunable 780.2 nm laser of more than 600 mW from second-harmonic generation (SHG) by a 1560.5 nm laser can be achieved. Then, a 250 mW light at 852.3 nm is generated and achieves an overall conversion efficiency of 4.1% from sum-frequency generation (SFG) by mixing the 1560.5 nm and 1878.0 nm lasers. The continuously tunable range of 780.2 nm and 852.3 nm are at least 6.8 GHz and 9.2 GHz. By employing this laser system, we can conveniently perform laser cooling, trapping and manipulating both rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms simultaneously. This system has promising applications in a cold atoms Rb-Cs two-component interferemeter and in the formation of the RbCs dimer by the photoassociation of cold Rb and Cs atoms confined in a magneto-optical trap.

Successive micro photographic images are recorded, then subsets of the images are column averaged and the resulting 1D profiles arc cross correlated. Factors that limit the correlation resolution are examined and methods for achieving millipixel level repeatability are discussed. Key to high resolution correlation of MEMS motion were low image noise and high stun of square of subset intensity gradients (SSSIG), a measure of image contrast. Using this correlation algorithm, the motion of MEMS thermal actuators was measured. Sub nm resolution was achieved using a wide range of image subsets, with measured standard deviations as low as 0.10nm (0.6 millipixels).

J	Ahmad, S; Arshad, MJ				Ahmad, Sarfraz; Arshad, Muhammad Junaid			Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP: Rapid Bandwidth Utilization after Fast-Recovery Phase	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												The purpose of this study is to enhance the performance of Multistream Fast Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keeping in view the recent web-based applications that are being deployed on long-range, high-speed, and high-bandwidth networks. To achieve the objective of the research study, a congestion control after fast-recovery module for congestion control scheme of Multistream Fast TCP is proposed. The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Consequently, Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP consumes the available network bandwidth in lesser time and increases the throughput and goodput. The proposed module enhanced the performance of the transport layer protocol. Our findings demonstrate the performance impact in the form of a decrease in the convergence time to consume the available network bandwidth and the increase in the throughput and the goodput.

The dominant conduction mechanism in fabricated MIM diode was analyzed using temperature dependent current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in temperature range 323-403 K. Schottky emission, Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) and Poole-Frankel (P-F) conduction mechanisms were tested by analyzing the I-V data according to these theories. P-F emission and Schottky emission conduction mechanisms were found to be dominant conduction mechanisms in low and high applied electric field range respectively. The Schottky emission mechanism was further studied in detail by plotting the Ln(I/T-2) Vs V-1/2 and Ln(I/T-2) Vs 1000/T plots at different applied fields and temperatures respectively. The dielectric constants were extracted from the conduction plots at various temperatures and were found to be close agreement with experimental dielectric constant of Lu2O3 (11).

Optical properties of gyrotropic polygonal chiral thin films	OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS												The effect of gyrotropy on optical response of dielectric polygonal chiral thin film was reported using transfer matrix method. The influence of gyrotropy was studied on selective transmission and reflection spectra for polygonal chiral thin films at different void volume fractions and oblique incident angles of light. The results revealed that the Bragg regimes and outside Bragg regimes of polygonal chiral thin films were affected by high induced gyrotropy.

J	Baek, YJ				Baek, Yoo-Jin			On Non-Completeness and G-Equivariance	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.																				2076-3417				NOV	2019	9	21							4692	10.3390/app9214692	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9214692													WOS:000498058600217

In the present work, Monte Carlo simulations of the measurement are performed. Then, the cathode signals are rebuilt using the anode and grid signals of the GIC. Finally, the experiment data are re-analyzed to obtain new results with smaller uncertainties especially for the B-10(n, t2 alpha) three-body reaction.

Axial segregation in crystal growth from a thin melt layer	JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH												During a crystal growth from a thin melt layer, the transport of dopant occurs mostly by diffusion. One can describe the dopant distribution by simplified analytical equations, as, for example, those previously obtained by Tiller. We performed numerical 2D axi-symmetric computations of heat and mass transfer in a thin melt layer (0.05 < h/d < 0.2), in order to find the limits of the validity of such approaches. Sb doped Ge, in a cylindrical volume with a diameter of 200 mm, was used as a model material. Compared with the heat transfer, the mass transfer was found to be much more sensitive to residual convection. Some restrictions in the application of the analytical equations for the description of the experimental data are revealed and necessary recommendations to improve the results are made. In order to provide the uniform axial dopant distribution in the very last portion of the ingot, too, it is necessary to vary the rate of solidification by changing the cooling rate with time.

To prevent such undesirable ecological shift, we propose a new control approach based on the synthesis of the reduced stochastic sensitivity of equilibrium regime. Key points of this approach are demonstrated for the conceptual Ricker-type population model combining the Allee effect, delay, and random disturbances. This bistable population model possesses coexisting attractors corresponding to persistence and extinction regimes. To stabilize the persistence regime, feedback regulators are constructed to minimize the stochastic sensitivity of the equilibria.

The global parameters of the spin-orbit and imaginary parts of the potential as well as surface absorption independent on neutron-proton asymmetry and increased diffuseness at large neutron excess were used in the calculations. The suitability of the global parameters to predict the evolution of the neutron single-particle structure of nuclei near the neutron drip line was investigated. The following results are in agreement with the available experimental data: the reduction of the particle-hole energy gaps, the degeneration of the 1f7/2 and 2p states and then a change in the 1f7/2 level sequence and more rapid reduction of the 2p-splitting in comparison with the 1f-splitting with Z decreasing.

Existence of stationary fronts in a system of two coupled wave equations with spatial inhomogeneity	NONLINEARITY												We investigate the existence of stationary fronts in a coupled system of two sine-Gordon equations with a smooth, 'hat-like' spatial inhomogeneity. The spatial inhomogeneity corresponds to a spatially dependent scaling of the sine-Gordon potential term. The uncoupled inhomogeneous sine-Gordon equation has stable stationary front solutions that persist in the coupled system. Carrying out a numerical investigation it is found that these inhomogeneous sine-Gordon fronts loose stability, provided the coupling between the two inhomogeneous sine-Gordon equations is strong enough, with new stable fronts bifurcating. In order to analytically study the bifurcating fronts, we first approximate the smooth spatial inhomogeneity by a piecewise constant function. With this approximation, we prove analytically the existence of a pitchfork bifurcation. To complete the argument, we prove that transverse fronts for a piecewise constant inhomogeneity persist for the smooth 'hat-like' spatial inhomogeneity by introducing a fast-slow structure and using geometric singular perturbation theory.

The absorption coefficient reached 0.15 cm(-1), and transmission in the medium was restored during 15-35 ns for phosphate glass and 5-10 ns for silicate glass. The physical bases of this effect of the appearance and relaxation of absorption in glasses have not been previously presented. An analysis of the experimental data showed that the absorption jump is due to the fast population of the I-4(11/2) level of Nd3+ ions in glasses when nonlinear processes occur in the SSSF channel such as stimulated Raman scattering and broadening of the laser pulse spectrum. The relaxation time of the population at the I-4(11/2) level and the restoration of transmission in glasses after the termination of the laser pulse are determined by the characteristic sizes of the Nd3+ ions excitation regions arising in the samples upon interference of the laser and scattered radiation, as well as the thermophysical characteristics of the glasses.

The Han-Kobayashi (HK) scheme is an extensively studied coding scheme for the K-user interference channel (IC). Simple HK schemes are HK schemes with Gaussian signaling, no time sharing and no private-common power splitting. The class of simple HK (S-HK) schemes includes the TIN scheme and schemes that involve various levels of interference decoding and cancellation at each receiver. For the 2-user GIC, simple HK schemes are sufficient to achieve all known sum capacity results-sum capacity under mixed, strong and noisy interference conditions. We derive channel conditions under which simple HK schemes achieve sum capacity for general K-user Gaussian ICs. For the K-user GIC, these results generalize existing sum capacity results for the TIN scheme to the class of simple HK schemes.

Our calculations show that the disorder is manifested in two aspects in the cubic phase, namely, the disorder of orientation and rotation of organic groups. Organic groups of [CH3] and [NH3] in cubic crystals can easily rotate around its C-3 axis. At the same time, [CH3NH3](+) organic groups can also orient to different spatial directions due to the weak interactions between organic group and inorganic frame. Our results show that its possible phase transition path starts from the deviation of organic groups from the crystal c-axis. Its structural transition changes from disordered cubic phase to hydrogen-only disordered tetragonal structure in the process of decreasing symmetry. The disordered high temperature cubic phase can be expressed as a statistical average of substructures we rebuilt. The electrostatic repulsive force between adjacent organic groups triggers out the formation of low temperature phase on cooling.																			1674-1056	1741-4199				NOV	2019	28	11							116105	10.1088/1674-1056/ab478d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-1056/ab478d													WOS:000496475900001

To solve this problem, the effects of immunization probability on the maximal infected density and the average infected density are investigated, and it's found that large immunization probability will depress the maximal infected density sharply. Moreover, it's proved that small immunization probability is of great importance, which could not only reduce the cost of immunization at low risk but also decrease the outbreak risk of the next year by making the average infected density larger in the current year. Besides, a generalized immunization strategy is presented, which makes the immunization strategy easy to carry out and meanwhile keeps the maximal and the average infected density almost as good as those in the original dynamic immunization strategy. Moreover, the control effects in eight real networks are also investigated, which proves the usefulness of the modified dynamic immunization strategy. Our work proves the usefulness of the heterogeneous distribution of immunization probability and may present theoretical guidance for the government and the public to control the recurrent epidemic outbreaks.

We start from weak microwave pulses which lead to only trivial pyroelectric peak response. However, when the microwave pulses become intense, the normally expected pyroelectric signal seems to be suppressed and the sign of the voltage signal can even be completely changed. Analysis indicates that while the traditional pyroelectric model, which is a linear model and works fine for our data in the small regime, it does not work anymore in the large signal regime. Since the small-signal model is the key foundation of electromagnetic-wave sensors based on pyroelectric effects, such as pyroelectric infrared detecters, the observation in this work suggests that one should be cautious when using these devices in intense fields. In addition, the evolution of detector signal with respect to excitation strength suggests that the main polarisation process is changed in the large signal regime. This is of fundamental importance to the understanding on how crystalline solids interact with intense microwaves. Possible causes of the nonlinear behaviour is discussed.

Based on the comparison result, we present a general model for the 747 curves as a function of linear density. The new proposed model not only improves the accuracy but also extends the applicable scope of the fitting. With the model, we also demonstrate the optimal combinations of track density and linear density for maximizing the off-track-capability (OTC) and squeeze-to-death (S2D), as well as their maximums as a function of areal density.																			0018-9464	1941-0069				NOV	2019	55	11							3002410	10.1109/TMAG.2019.2932702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2019.2932702													WOS:000493280000001
J	Chen, X; Song, DY; Tong, ZR; Zhang, WH				Chen, Xue; Song, Dianyou; Tong, Zhengrong; Zhang, Weihua			Tunable and reconfigurable microwave photonic filter based on Fourier domain optical processor and cascaded fiber rings	LASER PHYSICS												A tunable and reconfigurable microwave photonic filter (MPF) based on a Fourier domain optical processor (FD-OP) and cascaded fiber rings is proposed and demonstrated. A stable and multiple wavelengths source can be realized by using a broadband source and a waveshaper. The multiple wavelengths source with different wavelength spacings is achieved by programming the waveshaper. Two fiber rings of the same structure are cascaded together to achieve a high main sidelobe suppression ratio (MSSR) and a high Q factor. The FD-OP is induced to add additional phase shifts to achieve tunability. When the number of taps is 60, by introducing cascaded two-fiber rings and the FD-OP, the MSSR is 59.356 dB, the maximum Q factor is 470.895 and the 3dB bandwidth of the filter is 0.019 GHz. The simulating results show that the center frequency continuously tuned from 4.47-13.41 GHz. The tunability and reconfigurability of the MPF are well realized.

At finite temperature T, we find that the Bose condensation of nonideal bosons in three-dimensional isotropic harmonic traps is the two-step condensation. In other words, for a fixed particle number there are two transition temperatures. The first transition temperature is the standard critical temperature . The second transition temperature is the critical temperature , which is smaller than and is determined by the minimum of the curve of condensate fraction versus temperature. The boson system undergoes a first-order phase transition from the normal state to the Bose condensed state.																			1742-5468					NOV	2019	2019	11							113101	10.1088/1742-5468/ab4985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/ab4985													WOS:000499896800001

The sand samples were seven famous beaches in Gangwon-do and were placed into a high-purity germanium detector (HPGe) using with an electric field, which is a semiconductor detector and subjected to a precision analysis of the gamma-rays emitted from the radionuclides in the sand by using a multichannel analyzer (MCA). To measure the concentration of the radionuclides, we obtained a spectrum by analyzing the gamma-rays emitted from the radionuclides for a measurement time of 8,000 seconds. The results show that of all the radionuclides, Tl-208 had the highest radioactivity at five of the seven beaches which K-40 had the highest radioactivity at the other two beaches. In conclusion, the radionuclides that were detected in the coastal sand samples from South Korea's East Coast are natural radionuclides; however, they can affect of the human body internally. Therefore, the radioactivity levels need to be reduced and to be investigate further.

In inverted OPVs, the top anode must have a high work function to match the highest occupied molecular orbital level of a p-type organic semiconductor. Therefore, a functional interlayer with a high work function is inserted between the light-absorbing layer and anode. OPVs with a dual-anode buffer layer have been reported to exhibit a superior performance than those with a single-anode buffer layer. Herein, the device performance of inverted OPVs with a poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester light-absorbing layer and dual-anode buffer layer of MoO3 and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) is investigated. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPV with the HAT-CN/MoO3/Al anode system is lower than that with the conventional MoO3/Al anode system. However, the PCE of the OPV with MoO3/HAT-CN/Al is slightly higher than that with MoO3/Al. The change in the device performance by varying the deposition sequence of HAT-CN and MoO3 is discussed based on the built-in potential.

We demonstrate that the gauge invariant transition amplitudes for the bare-bare transitions, which is the case in the majority of experiments, are identical to the conventional results with the velocity form interaction Hamiltonian. Under the electric dipole approximation, the gauge invariant formalism derives the modified length form interaction Hamiltonian in any gauge. We propose a simple experiment that one can perform to verify our prediction. On the other hand, the gauge invariant transition amplitudes for the dressed-dressed transitions, which is the case in the Lamb shift experiment, are identical to the conventional results with the length form interaction Hamiltonian. There is no preferred gauge in the calculations of transition amplitudes. The present investigation resolves the long-standing A?p?r?E?<i controversy and clarifies the prevailing misconception in the literature.

Radiation effect on the UV-green thermally stimulated luminescence emission of a natural Na-rich aluminosilicate	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY												This paper reports on the thermoluminescence (TL) emission (from 250 to 500 nm) of a 10 Gy irradiated natural Na-rich aluminosilicate from Minas Gerais (Brazil), previously characterized by Raman spectroscopy and differential thermal analysis techniques. 3D-TL spectrum of the analyzed sample displays a complex glow curves with five different emissions bands peaked at 290, 380, 420, 460 and 500 nm that could be associated with structural and point defects. The UV-blue emission bands have the following characteristics: (i) the 290 run waveband could be due to defects-sites by the presence of Na ions; (ii) the 380 nm band, caused by intrinsic defects in the lattice (i.e. Non-Bridging Oxygen Hole Centers (NBOHCs), [AlO4]degrees centres, alkali planar defects and Oxygen Defect Centers (ODCs), among others); (iii) the 420 nm waveband, linked to the recombination on a centre formed from a hole-oxygen atom adjacent to two aluminum atoms (Al-O-Al) and Al-O-Si complexes; (iv) the 460 nm band, associated with the presence of Ti4+ in the plagiclase crystal lattice. The green waveband could be linked to de-excitation of Mn2+ ions. The estimation of the activation energy (E-a) from the 10 Gy-induced TL glow curves analyzed by means of the initial rise method display linear regressions with acceptable r coefficients (r > 0.977) that reveal three groups of components with traps at different depth in the crystal lattice of the albite with Ea values in the range of 0.5-0.64 eV.

J	Cui, W; Gao, L				Cui, Wei; Gao, Liang			Development of a parameterization image stitching algorithm for ultrashort throw laser MEMS projectors	JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION DISPLAY												We present a novel design of a parameterization image stitching algorithm for ultrashort throw laser MEMS projectors. The resultant method allows the use of projectors with short or even long throw ratios to achieve ultrashort throw projection through a parameterized algorithm to stitch multiple images into one single frame, alleviating the trade-off between the resolution and frame rate in conventional laser MEMS displays. To evaluate the effectiveness, we construct a test system that consists of three off-the-shelf projectors with a throw ratio of 1.3 and three planar reflective mirrors. Using our method, the integrated system yields an ultrashort throw ratio of 0.26, greatly reducing the projection distance from 12 to 2.6 ft for the 120-in. screen in diagonal. Moreover, our algorithm can be fine-tuned to correct for image distortion, intensity variation, and edge mismatch induced by two-axis light beam steering, thereby further improving the image quality.																			1071-0922	1938-3657				NOV	2019	27	11					708	714		10.1002/jsid.794	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsid.794													WOS:000498966700006

The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in bulk MgB<sub>2</sub>:(La,Sr)MnO<sub>3</sub> superconductor-ferromagnetic nanocomposites	LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS												The results of studying the transport characteristics of the MgB2:La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) nanocomposite with a 3:1 volume content of components are presented. The experiments have shown that the temperature behavior of resistance of bulk MgB2:LSMO samples during the transition to the superconducting state is described by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) model for 2D superconductors. The observed features of the transport properties are most likely due to two characteristic spatial scales in the system: 1) a significant difference between the geometrical dimensions of the constituent components (micrometer-sized MgB2 particles and LSMO nanoparticles), and 2) the coherence length of the triplet superconducting state of half-metal manganite LSMO contacting with MgB2. Resistive losses in such nanostructures are due to the flow of current through ferromagnetic LSMO nanogranules that cover MgB2 microgranules. As temperature decreases, the BKT transition occurs in 2D (surface) superconducting LSMO layers.																			1063-777X	1090-6517				NOV	2019	45	11					1156	1160		10.1063/10.0000047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/10.0000047													WOS:000499998800003

J	De Gregorio, P				De Gregorio, Paolo			On the Definition of Energy Flux in One-Dimensional Chains of Particles	ENTROPY												We review two well-known definitions present in the literature, which are used to define the heat or energy flux in one dimensional chains. One definition equates the energy variation per particle to a discretized flux difference, which we here show it also corresponds to the flux of energy in the zero wavenumber limit in Fourier space, concurrently providing a general formula valid for all wavelengths. The other relies somewhat elaborately on a definition of the flux, which is a function of every coordinate in the line. We try to shed further light on their significance by introducing a novel integral operator, acting over movable boundaries represented by the neighboring particles' positions, or some combinations thereof. By specializing to the case of chains with the particles' order conserved, we show that the first definition corresponds to applying the differential continuity-equation operator after the application of the integral operator. Conversely, the second definition corresponds to applying the introduced integral operator to the energy flux. It is, therefore, an integral quantity and not a local quantity. More worryingly, it does not satisfy in any obvious way an equation of continuity. We show that in stationary states, the first definition is resilient to several formally legitimate modifications of the (models of) energy density distribution, while the second is not. On the other hand, it seems peculiar that this integral definition appears to capture a transport contribution, which may be called of convective nature, which is altogether missed by the former definition. In an attempt to connect the dots, we propose that the locally integrated flux divided by the inter-particle distance is a good measure of the energy flux. We show that the proposition can be explicitly constructed analytically by an ad hoc modification of the chosen model for the energy density.

The technique is motivated by the study of the so-called generalized Maxwell operators, which are constructed as conformally invariant differential operators in the framework of Clifford analysis. We firstly show that solutions of the classical Maxwell equations are equivalent to null solutions of the generalized Maxwell operator, then a direct decomposition and a partially orthogonal polynomial basis for the space of homogeneous polynomial null solutions of the generalized Maxwell operator are provided. At the end, a basis of homogeneous polynomial solutions for the source-free Maxwell equations on a bounded time-space domain is given.

The joining by vulcanization of the conveyor belts allows to obtain superior performances, but it has been found that at the vulcanizing joint of the conveyor belts, there is a "bell"-type defect. This type of defect can cause the quick removal of the conveyor belts from use; thus, within this paper, we realized the constructive optimization of vulcanization installations using the finite element method (FEM). Thus, the FEM analysis was performed for the installation used at the present time, which has four spacers for stiffening, moving to the next stage to a stiffening system with seven spacers and, in the last stage, it was proposed to use a stiffening plate. The joined conveyor belts were of type ST 2000, and by the constructive optimization of the vulcanizing press type DSLQ, the bell-type defect was greatly reduced. Also, an analysis of the effects that the constructive optimization of the vulcanization installation has on the resistance to extraction of the metallic insert from the rubber matrix of the costs determined by the proposed constructive modifications, has been performed.																				1996-1944				NOV	2019	12	21							3607	10.3390/ma12213607	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma12213607								31684147					WOS:000502798800148

We describe the set of all such constraints and show that it equals the set of averages of all probability measures absolutely continuous with respect to the standard measure on the phase space (with the exception of the measure concentrated on the empty configuration). We also investigate how the set of constrains relates to the domain of the microcanonical thermodynamic limit entropy. We then show that, for fixed constraints, the parameters of the corresponding grand canonical distribution converge, as volume increases, to the corresponding parameters (derivatives, when they exist) of the thermodynamic limit entropy. The results hold when the energy is the sum of any stable, tempered interaction potential that satisfies the Gibbs variational principle (e.g. Lennard-Jones) and the kinetic energy. The same tools and the strict convexity of the thermodynamic limit pressure for continuous systems (valid whenever the Gibbs variational principle holds) give solid foundation to the folklore local homeomorphism between thermodynamic and macroscopic quantities.																			0022-4715	1572-9613				NOV	2019	177	3					485	505		10.1007/s10955-019-02374-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10955-019-02374-5													WOS:000495079700005

The composites of the microcapsules and EVA were prepared by incorporating the microcapsule nanoparticles into ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), respectively. To further understand the intrinsic correlation between microcapsule fillers and EVA matrix, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was introduced to qualitatively analyze the contribution of microcapsule fillers on improving compatibility and mechanical properties of the EVA matrix. The compatibility of microcapsule nanoparticles with EVA matrix were detected in sequence through SEM, DSC and tensile strength tests. And the combustion, thermal behavior and flame retardance were also characterized by TG analyses as well as LOI and UL-94 level. As a result, the MAH@MF filler had the best performances in improving the flame retardancy and mechanical properties among the microcapsule fillers, attributed to high compatibility of the MAH@MF and EVA matrix, which made uniform distribution of the MAH@MF filler due to the reciprocity of triazine functional ring with vinyl acetate linkages.					xu, sheng/KMX-9932-2024														1533-4880	1533-4899				NOV	2019	19	11					7476	7486		10.1166/jnn.2019.16635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.16635								31039916					WOS:000475752300080

The cathode voltage falls, electric fields in the discharge plasma, and gas temperatures are determined, and the intensities of spectral lines and bands are measured. The obtained data are used to calculate the effective vibrational temperatures of different excited states. These data can further be used to develop approaches for theoretically describing the processes occurring in atmospheric-pressure discharges in air where the action of a glow discharge on a solution leads to the chemical activation of the solution and facilitates homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation-reduction reactions, which have various technological applications, from nonchemical cleaning of water from organic and inorganic impurities to sterilization of solutions and medical materials.																			1063-780X	1562-6938				NOV	2019	45	11					1005	1010		10.1134/S1063780X19110035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1063780X19110035													WOS:000496121400003

Evidence of the Excitation of Mn<SUP>2+</SUP> Spin-Dependent Photoluminescence in Manganese-Doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnets	APPLIED MAGNETIC RESONANCE												Mn2+ ions in yttrium positions have been studied by means of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) via Mn2+ spin-dependent emission in manganese-doped yttrium aluminum garnet crystals. It was shown that the intensity of photoluminescence excited by circularly polarized light depends on the population of the spin sublevels of the Mn2+ ground state and therefore can be used to study the ODMR. EPR measurements have confirmed that Mn2+ ions in the crystals under study occupy preferentially dodecahedral positions in the YAG lattice. Observation of forbidden transitions in the ODMR spectra has proved that the observed ODMR signals belong to Mn2+. Thus the wavelength dependence of the ODMR amplitude reveals the emission band of Mn2+ ions at dodecahedral positions in YAG:Mn.

This regime of carrier densities causes other theories, such as BCS and Migdal-Eliashberg theory, to violate their assumption of a small Debye window. We investigate the application of DFM to the linear dispersion of single layer graphene. We derive the gap equation of DFM for a Dirac cone and calculate the critical temperature as a function of carrier density. This is done using an interaction potential that utilizes the Random Phase Approximation dielectric function and thus allows for plasmonic interactions. Our results show a significantly different behaviour of the critical temperature as a function of carrier density when compared to the BCS result. Thus, we find the DFM approach to be better suited when considering graphene systems at low carrier densities.

J	Ferrari, L				Ferrari, Loris			Why pushing a bell does not produce a sound	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS												The difference between "beating" and "pushing" results in the perception that a push just makes an object move as a whole, while a beat also produces a sound. Through a detailed analysis of the physics underlying such everyday experiences, we identify the strength, the duration, and the softness of the applied contact force as the main (measurable) characteristics that mark such a difference. The strength determines the final velocity Delta v achieved by the body. The duration 2 tau corresponds to the time tau (l) the sound takes to cross the body. The softness gamma (a positive exponent) results from the shape in time of the contact force. These three elements make up the formula for the intensity of the sound produced. The relevant role of the softness is stressed and specific values are calculated for a thin metallic bar, which is chosen as the simplest possible model system.																			0002-9505	1943-2909				NOV	2019	87	11					901	909		10.1119/1.5124976	http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.5124976													WOS:000491352400007

Indeed, they know new applications and improved performances even fabricated at low temperatures by low-cost solution-process and printing technologies. Nonetheless, some critical aspects remain to be improved, such as organic semiconductor (OSC) patterning and the control and alignment of organic crystal growth in the desired location and direction. Herein, a new controlled OSC solution-growth processing, which directly occurs within planar electrodes patterning, is reported. A capillary-driven flow occurs in air-opened microchannels and then confines the OSC solution before growing these crystals in the desired region and direction. 1) The modeling, 2) fabrication, 3) experimental functionality of such capillary-driven flow techniques, and 4) growth of OSC single-colored crystals in situ integrated planar device electrodes are reported. Polarized optical images show large crystal growth (i.e., >100 mu m) of typical pi-conjugated small molecules (diF-TES-ADT and C8-BTBT). By such a technology, benefits from both 1) the meniscus-guided coating mechanisms and 2) advantages of maskless and noncontact digital printing technologies are taken. Finally, these results visualize the directional control of OSC single-crystal growth in a printing-compatible (dispensing, inkjet) route in a reliable and reproducible way.

For axially symmetric vector potentials, A= A(s,z)(phi) over cap, it is the magnetic flux that plays a central role in both interference experiments (as in the Aharonov-Bohm effect) and in bound state spectra for a particle constrained to move in a circle. The flux dependence is evident in various configurations, and we have chosen two applications to highlight the non-local nature of the quantum mechanical magnetic field dependence: A finite solenoid and a Dirac string with a non-zero radius. The finite solenoid is interesting because it represents the actual experimental apparatus for measuring the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The Dirac string provides an electric charge quantization mechanism that depends on where the quantization argument is applied, yielding different fundamental charge units for different locations.																			0002-9505	1943-2909				NOV	2019	87	11					862	867		10.1119/1.5124814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.5124814													WOS:000491352400002

Similar analysis has been performed for systems of equations without coupling delay and for an arbitrary bias current.

Control of airflow in ventilation systems using embedded systems on microcontrollers	MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS												This paper describes the development of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for regulation of the airflow in a ventilation system. The flow was adjusted by controlling the speed of the fan installed in the system. The PID control algorithm was developed for an embedded system in an Atmega 2560 microcontroller contained in an Arduino Mega development kit, where the airflow rate was detected by a Hall-effect sensor that generated a pulsed signal at a frequency proportional to the speed of the fan. Simulation results were used to parameterize the control algorithm, minimizing the benchtop development time. Full details of the procedure are presented in order to assist future PID proposals involving embedded systems in microcontrollers.

The experimental results identify the encapsulation of single, double and triple cores in a flow-focusing microchannel arising from the competition among the inertial force of inner phase, the shear force of outer phase fluid, and the interfacial tension. In addition, the solid-core encapsulation of double emulsion in flow-focusing microchannel is either in the stable state or in the transition state, depending on the flow rates of inner and outer phase fluid. The stable microencapsulation includes the stable single-core, double-cores and triple-cores encapsulation states, while the transition microencapsulation includes the single-double-cores and double-triple-cores transition encapsulation state. Irrespective of encapsulation state, the solid-core encapsulation process can be classified into four stages, including entering, neck stretch, neck shrinking and breakup.

J	Gao, Y; Guo, BH; Xu, J				Gao, Yang; Guo, Baohua; Xu, Jun			Critical Size of Secondary Nuclei Determined via Nucleation Theorem Reveals Selective Nucleation in Three-Component Co-Crystals	ENTROPY												The critical size of the secondary nuclei plays an important role in determining the crystal growth rate. In the past, the Nucleation Theorem has been applied to determine the number of molecules in the critical nuclei of a single-component crystal via variation of the crystal growth rate with dilution by the non-crystallizable component. In this work, we extend the method to the three-component co-crystal poly (ethylene oxide)/urea/thiourea inclusion compound. The theoretical crystal growth kinetics were deduced and the dependence of the radial growth rate of the inclusion compound spherulites on the mass fraction of urea in urea/thiourea was measured. The results reveal that the secondary nuclei of the poly (ethylene oxide)/urea/thiourea inclusion compound consist mainly of ethylene oxide repeating units and urea molecules. We propose that only urea molecules and ethylene oxide repeating units are selected to form the secondary nuclei while co-crystallization of the three components happens at the lateral spreading stage. As a result, the composition of the critical secondary nuclei is different from that of the bulk inclusion compound crystals. The work is expected to deepen our understanding of the nucleation of multi-component co-crystals.

An evaluation of the corresponding constraint forces must be performed in an efficient manner, otherwise it would create a bottleneck in the calculations. If integrators of a higher order than two (for example, Gear predictor-corrector methods) are used to find the trajectories of atoms, the derivatives of the forces on the atoms with respect to the time-including the derivatives of constraint forces-also need to be calculated. In this letter, we present a method to perform the calculation of the constraint forces (i.e. of the Lagrange multipliers) as well as their time derivatives in an analytic, accurate and efficient manner. This method can be used together with integrators of a higher order than two, going beyond the simplification of uniform acceleration to perform calculations of enhanced accuracy for atomic paths, while keeping a low numerical complexity in the calculation of constraint forces.

The process yield is a key parameter for the economic viability of the PSI process. We experimentally demonstrate the detachment of 59 out of 62 PSI wafers with a size of 10 x 10 cm(2), and separation layer etch current densities of 105-120 mA/cm(2) for electrochemically etching the porous Si, and for substrate wafers with a resistivity of 15.7-16.9 m Omega cm. We discuss the statistics of how to deduce a detachment probability from this. From our experiments, we determine a detachment yield of at least 88% with an error probability of 5%. The demonstration of a 99% detachment yield with an error probability of 5% would require at least 300 successfully detached wafers with no failed detachment. Samples have a minority carrier density ranging from 1 to 1.7 ms before any external gettering, which demonstrates the high electric quality of the PSI wafers.

Our ambition is to take a first step towards a provably well posed and stable coupling procedure. We study a simplified setting with a stationary planar interface and small disturbances from a steady background flow with zero velocity normal to the interface. The simplified setting motivates the use of the linearized equations, and we derive interface conditions such that the continuous problem satisfy an energy estimate. The interface conditions can be imposed both strongly and weakly. It is shown that the weak and strong interface imposition produce similar continuous energy estimates. We discretize the problem in time and space by employing finite difference operators that satisfy a summation-by-parts rule. The interface and initial conditions are imposed weakly using a penalty formulation. It is shown that the results obtained for the weak interface conditions in the continuous case, lead directly to stability of the fully discrete problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Exploring the transport properties of equatorially low-coordinated erbium single ion magnets	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												Single-molecule spin transport represents the lower limit of miniaturization of spintronic devices. These experiments, although extremely challenging, are key to understand the magneto-electronic properties of a molecule in a junction. In this context, theoretical screening of new magnetic molecules provides invaluable knowledge before carrying out sophisticated experiments. Herein, we investigate the transport properties of three equatorially low-coordinated erbium single ion magnets with C-3 nu symmetry: Er[N(SiMe3)(2)](3) (1), Er (btmsm)(3) (2) and Er(dbpc)(3) (3), where btmsm = bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl and dbpc = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresolate. Our ligand field analysis, based on previous spectroscopic data, confirms a ground state mainly characterized by M-J = +/- 15/2 in all three of them. The relaxation of their molecular structures when placed between two Au (1 1 1) electrodes leads to an even more symmetric similar to D-3h environment, which ensures that these molecules would retain their single-molecule magnet behavior in the device setup. Hence, we simulate spin dependent transport using the DFT optimized structures on the basis of the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, which, in 1 and 2, suggests a remarkable molecular spin filtering under the effect of an external magnetic field.

Time of Flight measurements on P3HT displayed three distinct hole transport pathways with corresponding mobilities above 10(-4), between 10(-5) and 10(-4) and below 10(-5) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) over a range of sample thickness (1.1 mu m-4.2 mu m), and electric field (2.4 MVm(-1) to 37.7 MVm(-1)). The space-charge limited current (Mott-Gurney) device mobility was in agreement with that obtained for the fastest route (10(-4) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)). The transport pathways were distinguished using a dispersive transport plot of reciprocal transit time versus electric field to thickness ratio and are described by single (pseudo dispersion) parameters: alpha(t1) = 0.97, alpha(t2) = 0.73 and alpha(t3) = 0.62. The P3HT displayed 3 M mass peaks obtained by Gel Permeation Chromatography, which are the most likely cause of the three pathways. The dispersive transport analysis used here offers clearer distinction between pathways than Poole-Frenkel plots and offers a full mobility description, including the dependence on sample thickness, making it suitable for general application.

Spin Lock Adiabatic Correction (SLAC) for B<sub>1</sub>-insensitive pulse design at 7T	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE												A new framework for B-1 insensitive adiabatic pulse design is proposed, denoted Spin Lock Adiabatic Correction (SLAC), which counteracts deviations from ideal behaviour through inclusion of an additional correction component during pulse design. SLAC pulses are theoretically derived, then applied to the design of enhanced BIR-4 and hyperbolic secant pulses to demonstrate practical utility of the new pulses. At 7T, SLAC pulses are shown to improve the flip angle homogeneity compared to a standard adiabatic pulse with validation in both simulations and phantom experiments, under SAR equivalent experimental conditions. The SLAC framework can be applied to any arbitrary adiabatic pulse to deliver excitation with increased B-1 insensitivity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, it is presently not clear how the type of doped-O species affects the capacitive performance. In this paper, an attempt has been made to probe into the possible correlation between the type of doped-O species and the corresponding capacitive performance. Three O species (C=O, C-O and O-C=O) have been introduced onto TiC-derived carbon (TiC-CDC) by using a facile room-temperature oxidation strategy with three typical oxidizing agents (H2O2, HNO3 and (NH4)(2)S2O8), respectively. The results have shown that as the content of the C=O species increases, both the specific capacitance and the capacitance retention for the oxidized TiC-CDC samples become higher, showing a positively correlative performance. This work suggests that optimizing the type of doped-O species will be great potential for obtaining the optimal electrochemical performances for the O-doped carbon materials.

We review an efficient semi-analytical approach to compute such a tunneling decay rate with any number of scalar fields and space-time dimensions. It is based on exact analytical solutions of piece-wise linear potentials with an arbitrary number of segments that describe any given potential up to the desired precision. Contributions beyond the linear order as well as the generalization to more fields are considered and computed through analytical linear expansions within a few iterations. Thereby, this approach provides a fast and robust method for evaluating tunneling decay in theories with multiple scalar fields.

We found that a Schottky emission leakage mechanism dominates the low bias conditions and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling became the main leakage mechanism at high fields with reverse biased condition. The sample with HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm) laminated dielectric shows a high barrier height phi(B) of 1.66 eV at 30 degrees C which was extracted from the Schottky emission mechanism, and this can be explained by fewer In-O and As-O states on the interface, as detected by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test. These effects result in HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm)/n-InAlAs MOS-capacitors presenting a low leakage current density of below 1.8 x 10(-7) A/cm(2) from -3 to 0 V at 30 degrees C. It is demonstrated that the HfO2/Al2O3 laminated dielectric with a thicker Al2O3 film of 8 nm is an optimized design to be the high-k dielectric used in Au-Pt-Ti/HfO2-Al2O3/InAlAs MOS capacitor applications.																				2079-6412				NOV	2019	9	11							720	10.3390/coatings9110720	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/coatings9110720													WOS:000502298300030

Results showed that Cu, Cu2O, CuO, and SiO2 (Cu-SiO2) composite particles were plated on the surface of KH550-modified PA12 powders. The Cu-SiO2 particles existed independently on PA12 surface, and the size was around 200 nm. The melting temperature and crystallization temperature of Cu-SiO2/PA12 composite powders were 183 degrees C and 150 degrees C. The results indicate that the selective laser sintering (SLS) process involved the contact of Cu-SiO2/PA12 powders, the formation of sintering neck, the growth of sintering neck, and the formation of fused solid. The Cu-SiO2 composite particles uniformly dispersed in the part due to surface tension, and the contact interface was good due to their similar polarity. The Cu-SiO2/PA12 SLS parts had excellent dimensional precision. The tensile strength of the 15 W-sintered Cu-SiO2/PA12 specimen was 48 MPa.

Frequency Effects on Helium-Oxygen Dielectric Barrier Discharges from Multibreakdowns to Single Breakdown per Half-Cycle	PLASMA PHYSICS REPORTS												In this work, a one-dimensional fluid model is established to study the effects of frequency on (He + O2) dielectric barrier discharge. As the frequency increases from 20 to 30 kHz, the first pulse becomes more intensive, while the second pulse gradually decreases and finally disappears. The plasma transforms from multibreakdowns to single breakdown per half-cycle. In order to study the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during this transformation, the spatiotemporal distributions of ROS densities are presented and the average ROS densities, as well as their wall fluences, are statistically analyzed. It is suggested that the production of each species increases along with the frequency, but when the second pulse disappears, the productions of some species, such as and, decline slightly. Moreover, the wall fluence and average density of a specific species vary with similar trends.

J	Hansson, J				Hansson, Johan			The Klein-Alfven cosmology revisited	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS												The Klein-Alfv & xfffd;n model is based on the pragmatic belief that also cosmology, just like all other fields of physics, should be based on physical laws independently tested in the laboratory. It actually has a number of attractive features, described in this article. As almost all matter in the known universe is in the plasma state, the model is by necessity based on both gravity and electromagnetism, and as most cosmic plasmas are inhomogeneous and magnetized, it is automatically inhomogeneous (as is the real universe). It is not perfect (no models are), but many of the outstanding unsolved ?problems? of the contemporary standard big bang-model of cosmology are either solved/sidestepped by, or non-existent in, the Klein-Alfv & xfffd;n model. One should remember that the standard model of cosmology also is just that?a model, and highly idealized at that, with many ad hoc ingredients and a large number of free parameters and hypothetical ingredients that are fixed only through comparison with cosmological data in a global best-fit fashion. It is not, and should never be considered to be, sacrosanct. If a comparable number of man-hours had been invested in the direction of the Klein-Alfv & xfffd;n model it is plausible that it would describe the real observed universe as good as, or even better than, the big bang-model?with much fewer speculative additions to known physics.

J	Hatefinasab, S				Hatefinasab, Seyedehsomayeh			Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor-Based Hybrid Full Adders Using Gate-Diffusion Input Structure	JOURNAL OF NANOELECTRONICS AND OPTOELECTRONICS												Scaling down the size of transistor in the nanoscale reduces the power supply voltage, as a result, the design of high-performance nano-circuit at low voltage has been considered. Most of digital circuits are composed of different components which determine the performance of the entire digital circuits. With the improvement of these components, the digital circuits can be optimized. One of these components is full adder for which various structures have been proposed to improve its performance, among them the two novel full adder structures are based on Gate-Diffusion Input (GDI) structure and half-classical XOR/XNOR logic (SEMI XOR/XNOR) modules. In this paper, Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNTFET)-based low power full adders by using SEMI XOR logic style and GDI structure are presented. Due to the incomparable thermal and mechanical properties of the CNTFET, it can be the first alternative to substitute the metal oxide field effect transistors (MOSFET). The digital circuits have the better performance based on CNTFET. Therefore, the three proposed full adders in this paper are designed based on CNTFET technology with many merits, such as low power dissipation, less energy delay product (EDP), and high speed at various supply voltages, frequencies, temperatures, load capacitors, and the number of tubes. Moreover, these proposed full adders occupy the minimum area consumption and have better performance in comparison with previous standard full adders. All simulations are done by using the Synopsys HSPICE simulator in 32 nm-CNTFET technology and layout of all full adder circuits are presented on Electric.

It quantifies the structural information of the signals and helps identify different conditions of the heart systems. Experiments show that compared with the traditional sample entropy (SampEn), qSEDiffAve has significant advantages in reflecting the inherent information of sequences. It also reveals that the qSEDiffAve curves of healthy subjects are significantly different from the atrial fibrillation (AF) and congestive heart failure (CHF) groups, because the CHF signals tend to fluctuate between narrow ranges while the atrial fibrillation (AF) signals are random, and the signals of healthy subjects are usually mixed by signals with different dynamic characteristics, showing higher complexity. In addition, the most important parameter in the model, q, can enlarge the differences between qSEDiffAve curves of healthy and pathological states. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An average output power of 13.5 W with repetition rate up to 7 kHz and pulse duration of ?1.24 ns is obtained, corresponding to a pump extraction efficiency of 16.1% (19.5% for the second stage) and peak power of ?1.5 MW. The beam quality factors at maximum output power are measured to be Mx2=1.56and My2=1.48We introduce an analytical model to estimate gain and beam quality after amplification. This model focuses on the influence of ratio of seed spot radius to pump spot radius when designing an amplifier. Moreover, our experiments reveal that the re-imaging system in the double-pass configuration can be used to enhance the beam quality.																			0256-307X	1741-3540				NOV	2019	36	11							114202	10.1088/0256-307X/36/11/114202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0256-307X/36/11/114202													WOS:000499873300001

A set up using a CO2 laser in continuous mode (CW CO2 laser) was implemented to cut fragile and porous carbon monolithic (CM) and nanotemplated carbon monolithic (NTCM) rods into discs with a prescribed thickness and dimensional integrity (denoted as LCM and LNTCM, or LCMs). Changes in structure, porosity and composition of LCMs were induced by the efficient thermal energy afforded by the CW CO2 laser irradiation under tightly controlled process conditions. The main effects observed before and after laser cutting were studied in comparison with traditional scalpel blade cutting of carbon monolithic (SCM). FE-SEM images confirmed that the resulting LCMs exhibited a more open, interconnected macroporous structure and smoothed mesopores to a depth of approximately 5 while the structure of the bulk section remained intact. Minimal changes in chemical compositions were confirmed by XPS. Raman spectroscopy revealed a modest increase in the graphitic content on the cross sections of LCM discs. Phenol and Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as a model analyze for demonstration of resulting discs adsorption performance.					paull, brett/AAO-8366-2020; Mousavian, Reza/AAH-8189-2019; Nesterenko, Pavel/A-4766-2012; Brabazon, Dermot/A-4658-2015	paull, brett/0000-0001-6373-6582; Nesterenko, Pavel/0000-0002-9997-0650; Brabazon, Dermot/0000-0003-3214-6381													0169-4332	1873-5584				NOV 1	2019	493						829	837		10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.06.298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.06.298													WOS:000502007800044

Impact of carbon nanotubes in a CrFeMnNiTi alloy proposed as a potential candidate for stainless-steel substitution	MATERIALS LETTERS												In the steel industry, the fabrication of sintered products includes the use of graphite as an alloying element and lubricant. This study explores the idea that a sintered alloy with increased properties can be produced substituting graphite by carbon nanotubes. Also, the microstructural characteristics of an equiatomic alloy CrFeMnNiTi were compared with an austenitic 321 stainless-steel; which at present, has a vital role in the food industry. Results showed that the equiatomic alloy was composed mainly by austenite and Ti-rich phases, growth rate and porosity of samples were reduced with the graphite substitution. On this way, carbon nanotubes addition and modification of the chemical composition of the alloy represented viable routes to obtain new alloys with enhanced properties to replace conventional steels.

Charges induced to the wafer by these ESD events can harm or even destroy insulating structures like MIM capacitors because these charges cannot dissipate. This paper deals with the modelling and control of backside-induced ESD defects on MIM capacitors. It will highlight how charges can be induced to the wafer from its backside by wet-chemical processes and consequently destroy MIM capacitors at the wafer front side. Furthermore, we will explain how the DI water resistivity is the root cause for these defects and how it can be controlled to prevent the creation of ESD defects.

Employing renormalized mean-field theory with simple Gutzwiller factors, we obtain three degenerate superconducting states with different pairing symmetry. Through improving the Gutzwiller factors, we find that the state C with inter-layer modified dy2-z2<i-wave pairing has the lowest energy in a large doping range. Besides, we use the density matrix renormalization group method to solve the model. The negative binding energy reveals the pairing tendency, and the pair-pair correlation functions exhibit a slowly decaying behavior on certain types of bonds. From the pair correlations, we confirm the inter-layer modified dy2-z2<i-wave superconducting state as the ground state of the model.

J	Hu, S; Hu, Z				Hu, Sen; Hu, Zhi			Geometric aspect of three-dimensional Chern-Simons-like gravity	JOURNAL OF GEOMETRY AND PHYSICS												In this paper, we detailed study the geometric aspect of Chern-Simons-like gravity in three dimensions. The vacua are provided by three dimensional conformally flat manifold, which admit a special configuration, a two dimensional system (M-2, h, Phi) consisting of metric h and scalar field Phi, by dimensional reduction. For this system we define the quasi-local mass. An interesting observation is that this system contains certain two dimensional dilaton gravity at the classical level. Via AdS/CFT, we check the Weyl anomaly and diffeomorphism anomaly for the boundary theory. We study the linearization of Chern-Simons-like gravity around the background with constant scalar curvature via linear Cotton tensor. If the background manifold is of positive constant scalar curvature, we show that there is no solutions for linearized vacuum equation. To find the solutions of the linear gravity with respect to the background with negative constant scalar curvature, we need to solve some Schrodinger-type equations. Related to supersymmetric quantum mechanics, one can find some exact solutions and some dualities between different components or modes of solutions. And it is also can be related to Seiberg-Witten theory via Picard-Fuchs equation in terms of WKB approximation. We discuss the ADM-type charge under the context of Chern-Simons-like gravity. Finally, we extend the Chern-Simons-like gravity to the supermanifolds by embedding the structure group of three-manifold into the body of othosymplectic supergroup. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Derivative of axial intensity is an important parameter in TIE and usually obtained by finite difference (FD) method. However, nonlinearity error is unavoidable in these FD methods.

In these studies, it was assumed that the warship was composed of one magnetic material in order to establish an effective deperming protocol. However, since the actual warship was composed of various materials, the magnetic interaction between the materials inevitably occurs during the demagnetization process.

J	Inam, O; Qureshi, M; Omer, H				Inam, Omair; Qureshi, Mahmood; Omer, Hammad			De-noising Multi-coil Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Patch-Based Adaptive Filtering in Wavelet Domain	APPLIED MAGNETIC RESONANCE												Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently requires transform domain de-noising methods to preserve important features in the reconstructed images such as corners, sharp structures, and edges. Wavelet transform-based image de-noising is a standard approach used in MRI to recover smooth surface and sharp edges from the given noisy MR images, thereby improving diagnostic interpretations. Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) techniques such as SENSE have been recently developed with an aim to improve the data acquisition speed, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and spatial resolution of the reconstructed images. However, the SENSE reconstruction algorithm often encounters noise during data acquisition and reconstruction process which not only contaminates the quality of the reconstructed images but also leads to poor diagnostic interpretations in clinical settings. During SENSE reconstruction process, noise can appear in the reconstructed image mainly due to two reasons (1) imperfections in the receiver coils; (2) un-folding the aliased images of multiple receiver coils to obtain a single composite image. In this paper, a new adaptive patch-based filtering in wavelet domain is presented to recover sharp structures and edges without introducing any artifacts in the SENSE reconstructed images. The proposed method uses soft-thresholding function as a shrinkage process which typically involves thresholding the small wavelet coefficients to reduce the noise without affecting the important features in the SENSE reconstructed images. For the evaluation of the proposed method, several experiments are performed using simulated phantom and in vivo data sets. The SENSE reconstruction quality using the proposed method is compared with contemporary de-nosing techniques, in terms of structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the SENSE reconstruction using the proposed method when compared to the other contemporary de-nosing methods successfully removes the noise and preserves the fine details in the reconstructed MR images without introducing blurring artifacts.

The ITER project has reached 57.4% of the total construction work scope through to first plasma. Construction of ITER is indeed progressing at full speed, with some ITER components having already been manufactured, such as the toroidal field coil structures and the gyrotrons of the electron cyclotron heating and current drive system, as a result of decades of technological development. Construction of JT-60SA and WEST is also progressing on schedule to support ITER in various engineering and physics aspects. The EU and Japan are advancing with their pre-conceptual designs for DEMO, and the experience and lessons learned from ITER are already being applied to both designs. China reported on the status of the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor engineering design. One of the technical issues evident from these DEMO designs is the interfacing of the plasma-facing, in-vessel components with plasmas. Advanced plasma-facing elements having liquid metals and an advanced in situ boron coating technology were applied to existing fusion reactors, the results of which were reported at this conference. It was also reported that commissioning of the injector for the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility engineering validation and engineering design activities (IFMIF/EVEDA) project has been completed and testing of the Radio Frequency Quadrupole accelerator has begun. Europe and Japan presented their plans to construct neutron irradiation test facilities: the DEMO-Oriented Neutron Source (DONES) and Advanced Fusion Neutron Source (A-FNS), respectively. A new strategy based on a probability-based design method was proposed to mitigate the difficulty of defining the allowable limit for irradiation-induced degradation with limited empirical evidence.																			0029-5515	1741-4326				NOV	2019	59	11							117002	10.1088/1741-4326/ab4288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1741-4326/ab4288													WOS:000490603200001

Here is the corresponding Rabi flopping (angular) frequency and J(0) is the zeroth order Bessel function of the first kind. The resulting oscillations in the B coefficient?even for very small ?drives the system away from thermodynamic equilibrium at any finite temperature contrary to Einstein?s assumption. The time-dependent generalized B coefficient facilitates a path to go beyond Pauli?s formalism of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics involving the quantum statistical Boltzmann (master) equation.

The control of the electrode thickness could be useful to manipulate the energy confinement and the band dispersion of the surface guided mode. It has been demonstrated recently that high aspect ratio (HAR) electrode could produce a dispersive shear horizontal and vertically polarized surface modes in the bulk piezoelectric substrate. In this theoretical study, we propose to employ a high aspect ratio electrode on top of the GaN/sapphire-layered substrate enabling the presence of Sezawa surface mode. Based from the dispersion band, we obtained a higher frequency of surface guided mode in the non-radiative zone in the GaN/sapphire heterostructure configuration compared to the bulk GaN substrate. Indeed, these guided modes are induced by the hybridization between Sezawa surface mode and the mechanical resonance of the HAR electrode producing nearly a flat band at the limit of First Brillouin Zone. Furthermore, the displacement of each guided modes indicates the confinement of energy mostly in the electrode with a slight amount of energy in the top layer of the substrate. We demonstrated also the frequency tuning of guided mode using diverse materials for the electrode but also the thickness of GaN layer. The obtained results could be useful for the development of high-frequency telecommunication and sensing device based on Sezawa surface acoustic wave.

Role of Heat Expansion with a Series of Ionic Liquids: The Case for Isochoric Thermoelectric Generators and Minimal Steric Repulsion	ENTROPY												The role of convection in liquid thermoelectric cells may be difficult to predict because the inter- and intra-molecular interactions are not currently incorporated into thermodynamic models. Here, we study the thermoelectric response of a series of five anhydrous 1-methyl-3-alkylimidazolium halide ionic liquids with varied chain length and counterion in a high-aspect-ratio, horizontal-temperature-gradient geometry, where convection is minimal. While a canonical, constant-volume thermodynamic model indicates that greater disparity and longer aliphatic groups should exhibit larger Seebeck coefficients, we instead measure the opposite: Longer aliphatic chains correlate with lower densities and greater heat expansion, stronger intermolecular associations, stronger steric repulsion, and lower Seebeck coefficients. As evidence of the critical role of thermal expansion, we measure that the Seebeck effect is nonlinear: Values of -2.8 mV/K with a 10 K temperature difference and -1.8 mV/K with a 50 K difference are measured with ether ion. Our results indicate that steric repulsion and heat expansion are important considerations in ionic liquid design; with large temperature differences, the Seebeck coefficient correlates negatively with heat expansion. Our results suggest that Seebeck values may improve if thermal expansion and steric forces are limited in a pressurized, isochoric, convection-free design.

The load impedance of the PA was adaptively sensed by an embedded impedance detector which was digitally controlled and the system adjusted PA power using a feedback circuit to keep the PA safe based on a load mismatch detection. For verification, a two-stage hetero junction bipolar transistor (HBT) PA module for handsets was fabricated and tested against load mismatch. Measurement results showed that the technique could help PA survive at a 0.5V larger collector bias voltage condition than when the technique was not applied for the same mismatch condition with an acceptable RF performance degradation at nominal condition.

J	Jeon, J; Kang, M				Jeon, Jooyoung; Kang, Myounggon			A Ruggedness Improved Mobile Radio Frequency Power Amplifier Module with Dynamic Impedance Correction by Software Defined Atomization	ELECTRONICS												A ruggedness improved multi-band radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) module applicable to mobile handsets, which are required to survive against a serious load impedance change under extreme power and bias conditions, is presented. In this method, the load impedance of PA is adaptively adjusted with a digitally controlled impedance corrector to keep the PA safe by performing a load mismatch detection. The impedance mismatch detector, impedance corrector, and other RF switches were all integrated into a single integrated circuit (IC) using silicon on insulator (SOI) complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS). For the verification purpose, a 2-stage hetero junction bipolar transistor (HBT) PA module adopting this method was fabricated. At a frequency of 1915 MHz, a collector bias voltage of 4.2 V, and over a wider range of load impedance variation between a VSWR of 1 and a VSWR of 5.5, it did not fail. When this technique was not applied with a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) range of 1 to 4, it resulted in an acceptable RF performance degradation of 1% power added efficiency (PAE) in envelope tracking (ET) mode. Moreover, it survived at a bias voltage 1V larger than when the technique was not applied for the same mismatch condition.

The proposed PHORS device comprises a sensing probe combining NaI(Tl) and CaF2(Eu) scintillators for simultaneous measurement of beta and gamma radiation, a multichannel analyzer to characterize the radiation energy, and a laptop computer for signal analysis. For its performance test, we employed a prototype PHORS to measure the energies and the count rates of beta and gamma radiation from three different radiation sources for separation distances from 2 to 10 cm. The count rates of the PHORS were consistent with expected rates, and the captured energy spectra showed classic radionuclide characteristics. Thus, the proposed PHORS system provides an effective and facile tool to detect beta and gamma radiation simultaneously and to identify radionuclides from the captured energy spectra.

This first case report describes our patientwith angina pectoris and thrombocytopeniawhowe successfully treatedwith PCI after partial splenic artery embolization (PSE). A 70-year-old Japanese male was transferred to our hospital because of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). After medical treatment was administered, a coronary angiography (CAG) revealed three-vessel disease. He had severe thrombocytopenia (nadir of 27,000/mu L) due to liver fibrosis. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and PCIwere not feasible. PSEwas performed, and splenic volume reduction was confirmed by computed tomography. As a result, the platelet count increased after PSE and we completed the PCI with a DES. Major bleeding complications and cardiac events did not occur under the DAPT. To the best of our knowledge, performing PSE before PCI for increasing a patient's platelet count for thrombocytopenia has never been reported. This method may be considered as one of the treatment strategies for angina patients with thrombocytopenia. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The study was carried out by using quantitative and qualitative data collection tools within the context of case study methodology. The research sample was formed from 64 physics teachers from different provinces of Turkey who participated in the training organized for introducing a physics curriculum at the Yalova Esenkoy In-service Training Institute. A questionnaire consisting of 30 questions with four-point Likert-type and interviews including eight questions were conducted. Findings show that physics teachers generally indicate a positive approach to the physics curriculum. However, almost all physics teachers who participated in the research stated that the physics course hours were insufficient to implement the physics curriculum and that some subjects should be removed from the physics curriculum.

This increase in capacitance was simulated using finite-element-method-based electric field simulation software. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulation results showed that the rate of increase in capacitance decreased when the aspect ratio or dielectric constant increased. To increase measurement accuracy of the dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic constants of piezoelectric single crystals, the rate of increase in capacitance should be maintained below 0.5%. Actual measurements and theoretical analysis of the transverse- and longitudinal-effect length-extensional vibration in specimens with a small dielectric permittivity were performed. The results indicated that s(jj)(E) can be obtained directly from the f(r) of a transverse-effect length-extensional vibration, but k(ij) and d(ij) must be compensated for if the rate of increase in capacitance is greater than 0.5%.

We find a condition for m in the model similar to G(m), which shows phantom expansion of the Universe. On the other hand, using a phantom source term similar to T-2n in the model we observe that the term similar to G(n), with n > 3/4, gives a phantomic space-time expansion. This form (G(n) + T-2n) obtained for the phantom phase of the Universe exhibits a similar form to Einstein's gravity theory (R + L-m).

The formation volume was defined as the derivative of the Fe formation energy with respect to the pressure within 0-0.8 GPa. Interestingly, the formation volume was found to be equivalent to the difference between the volumes of the relaxed bulk and defective structures. The formation volume versus 'x' exhibited a nonlinear pattern with regions of Fe-induced volume contraction (within x<50%, i.e., Si-rich region) and expansion (x>50%, i.e., Ge-rich region). These results explain the reported observation that Fe prefers Si-rich environment and that Ge does not favor to be a nearest neighbor to Fe.

But in depolarizing channel, the fidelity decreases faster than those three channels (Pauli channels sigma(x), sigma(y), sigma(z)). Also, if the system does not interact with the environment, the fidelity stays fixed and at all times is equal to one(1).

From the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) images, it was possible to observe much larger bumps on the surface of WS2 on soda-lime glass at higher RF sputtering powers and higher RTA temperatures. The Raman spectra results showed the 2D WS2 layers were formed at the higher RF sputtering powers as a formation of E-2g(1) peak and A(g)(1) peak and the Hall measurement results also showed the carrier mobility was dependent on the RF sputtering powers and RTA temperatures.

The surface width W(L, t) grows as t(beta) for t MUCH LESS-THAN L-z and becomes saturated via W(L) - L-alpha for t > L-z, where L is the system size. W(L, t) for N = 1 has some oscillating behavior as a function of time t induced by the discrete height of the model, so we choose the proper N to reduce this artifact. Through a large-scale numerical simulation of a system with size L = 512, beta = 0.196 +/- 0.005 and alpha = 0.332 +/- 0.006 are obtained with N = 5. Our value of beta is consistent with the conjecture 1/5.

The synthesized powders consisted of the Ba1.3Ca0.7SiO4 phase with a hexagonal structure. The photoluminescence spectra of the powders exhibited two emission bands in the blue-green (A-band) and red (B-band) regions, which were assigned to the 4f(7)-4f(6)5d transition of Eu2+ and spin-forbidden d-d transition of Mn2+, respectively. The B-band arose from an energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+. The multiple photoluminescence resulted in Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates occurring in the warm white light region. Increasing x and y had differing effects on the crystal structures, photoluminescence properties, and particle morphologies of the synthesized powders. The B-band was closely dependent on the x values, whereas increasing y mainly produced a change in the luminescence of the A-band. The particle size increased with the x and y values.

Development of the C plus plus three-dimensional reference simulation model of the wedge-shaped beam dynamics	COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS												The paper describes a three-dimensional computer model and a desktop program in the Visual C++ platform, which is intended to provide a reference simulation of the dynamics of a wedge-shaped electron beam in a cylindrical triode type accelerating device. Such a triode-type source of intense radial converging beam is employed in improving the material surface properties of a specimen used as an anode. The simulation model has been developed with the highest possible generality and adequacy achievable under the given computing environment and limitations that do allow using it for the validation and benchmarking. The software package covers the calculation of the electrostatic field by the difference method on a cubic grid, the calculation of the beam own field using the "particle-particle" (PP) method, the calculation of the trajectories of the motion of macro particles using Runge-Kutta solvers of the 4th order (taken as the reference) and lower orders. The solvers were improved to adapt them for the usage with the particle ensembles characterized by the high rate of the input and output particle flows. Having performed a number of testing simulation runs, it has been shown that the proposed model can be applied for both research and benchmarking purposes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, projectability of second-order Lepage forms is considered for variational functionals of the Finsler type. Underlying geometric concepts such as regular 2-velocities, contact elements and second-order Grassmann fibrations of rank 1 are discussed. It is shown that a Lepage form is projectable if and only if its Hamiltonian vanishes identically. In this case, explicit formulas for the Lagrange functions and the projected Lepage forms are given in terms of the adapted coordinates.																			0219-8878	1793-6977				NOV	2019	16			2	SI				1941005	10.1142/S0219887819410056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0219887819410056													WOS:000500955000006

The total fringing capacitance arising due to induced fringing fields in the device is divided into inner, outer and bottom fringing capacitance. A simple expression for each fringe capacitance is developed individually. The 3-D Poisson's equation has been solved in the channel region using the parabolic potential approximation method to develop the surface potential expressions. The effects of fringing capacitances of inner and outer gates which causes charge induction in the source/drain regions have been incorporated within the developed surface potential expressions. The change in potential due to these induced charges of source/drain region along the channel is formulated and added with the developed surface potential expression at both surfaces. The obtained modified surface potential equations have been utilized to derive the expression of the threshold voltage of the device. The performance of the proposed model has been compared with the previously developed model of DGAA MOSFET structure without High-k dielectrics. The effects of variation of device parameters on the threshold voltage have been also analyzed. The accuracy of the proposed model has been verified by numerical simulation results obtained by a device simulator VTCAD from Cogenda Int.

The correct context dependency can be achieved via post-selection. However, this does not contradict the Tsirelson quantum bound (2 root 2), because the latter has been derived without taking into consideration the context-dependent unitary evolutions and / or post-selection. As an important application, this leads to a more efficient (in terms of resource (singlets) and classical communication) and more sensitive (to eavesdropping) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol, compared to Ekert's and Wigner's QKD protocols.

We consider two examples: (1) a three-level. system interacting with a weak XUV field at the high-energy transition and a strong IR field at the adjacent low-energy transition.

The one-loop scalar potential is scale-invariant, since the loop calculations preserve the scale symmetry, with the DR subtraction scale generated spontaneously by the dilaton vacuum expectation value, (sigma). At the quantum level, the Higgs mass is protected although the theory is non-renormalizable. It is argued that the instability of the effective potential in the Higgs sector that is driven by the quartic coupling running towards negative values becomes worse in the scale-invariant version, since the effective potential becomes unbounded from below.

J	Lee, H				Lee, Hunpyo			Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo in Combination with Machine Learning on the Hubbard Model	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY												The acceleration of exact continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) approaches in multi-site or multi-orbital systems is extremely interesting work, because these approaches are very time-consuming in terms of numerical computation and might account for the nature of exotic behaviors such as high-temperature superconductivity and Mott insulator behavior observed in the strongly correlated materials. We extend the recently developed interaction-expansion CTQMC method in combination with a machine learning (CTQMC+ML) approach for the single-site and single-orbital systems to multi-site and multi-orbital ones. This method can be applied to explore the nonlocal correlation effects in lattice models and to study the electronic structure of real materials via an ab-initio density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory approach. We find that our CTQMC+ML method for multi-site (and multi-orbital) systems accurately predicts the impurity Green's function with less computational time than the CTQMC approaches, as in the case of the single-site and single-orbital version.																			0374-4884	1976-8524				NOV	2019	75	10					841	844		10.3938/jkps.75.841	http://dx.doi.org/10.3938/jkps.75.841													WOS:000501035900015

In this work, we first propose the coherence eigenvalue for multipartite pure quantum states and then define the coherence measure for a given multipartite pure or mixed state based on it. It is found that the convex roof coherence measure is equal to the geometric measure based on fidelity. This finding allows us to give an alternative way to prove that the geometric measure of coherence is monotone under selective measurements on average. The other two new coherence measures based on coherence eigenvalue are presented, and their properties are also investigated. As an application, the bounds of several well-known coherence measures are derived by using of coherence eigenvalue. In particular, by proposing a new coherence witness which is related to coherence eigenvalue, we obtain a bound to robustness of coherence and give it a corresponding geometric interpretation.

Furthermore, the microdroplet could be manipulated by OT to build microstructures on the slide. We also discuss the possible mechanism behind our observations and the potential usage of such discoveries.

The formations of tobermorite and hydroxyapatite benefited the flexural strength up to 12 MPa and adsorptive properties to contaminants. In sewage treatment experiments, the zeolite-based materials achieved the limited removal rates of 34.6% (from 364 to 238 mg/L) and 26.3% (from 46.6 to 34.3 mg/L) respectively for COD and NH4+ due to saturation adsorption. After bioburden, the removal rate of COD and NH4+ increased significantly to 93.4% (from 364 to 24 mg/L) and 81.1% (from 46.6 to 8.8 mg/L), reflecting the integrated function of adsorption and further degradation. The variations of NO3-/NO2- showed that various microorganisms within the matrix did contribute to the continuous and efficient purification performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Liang, T; Duan, WS				Liang, Tao; Duan, Wen-Shan			Scattering of shock wave by impurities in a viscoelastic granular chain	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E												The transmission and the reflection of a shock wave by one or several impurities in viscoelastic bead chains is studied in the present paper. There is only one reflected wave for a single impurity. The amplitude of the beads oscillation increases as the initial velocity of the boundaries beads increases, while it decreases as the viscosity coefficient increases. Two reflected waves will be produced if the impurity number is larger than a critical value. This critical value depends on both the initial velocity and the viscosity coefficient. In addition, the maximum amplitude of reflected wave is a constant, when the viscosity coefficient is large enough.

J	Liu, Q; Li, H; Wang, Y				Liu, Qiao; Li, Hui; Wang, Yong			General Secure Information Exchange Protocol for a Multiuser MIMO Relay Channel	ENTROPY												Secure information exchange occurs in many recently emerging cooperative-based networks, such as 5G networks (especially those with a Device to Device architecture), the Internet of Things, and vehicular ad hoc networks. However, the existing information exchange protocols only focus on either pairwise information exchange or group information exchange, and none of these protocols enable private and public information exchange to occur simultaneously. Thus, a general secure information exchange protocol for a multiuser channel is desirable. With this motivation, this paper investigates simultaneous private and public information exchange in a Multiple Inputs Multiple Outputs (MIMO) multiuser relay channel. In an aim to achieve this goal, signal alignment is chosen as the core technique. With the designed precoding matrix for each user, private information is aligned with its exchange partner, and public information forms a coding chain at the relay. With the aligned private signal and public coding chain, neither an untrusted relay nor external eavesdroppers can recover the original individual information. Performance analyses of the proposed protocol are conducted. First, we conduct transmission performance analyses from the perspective of time slot cost. Second, we conduct a security analysis for private information exchange and public information exchange. Third, we conduct secrecy sum-rate analysis for three attack scenarios: an untrusted relay attack only, an eavesdropper attack only, and both an untrusted relay and eavesdropper attack. The simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed protocol can enable simultaneous private and public information exchange while resisting attacks by an undesired receiver, an untrusted relay, and external eavesdroppers.

Previously, the excitonic origin of this feature has been demonstrated experimentally, but a detailed understanding still lacks a model Hamiltonian being able to reproduce absorption as well as exciton relaxation time scales. Here, we propose a system-bath model which accommodates these observables. It combines Frenkel exciton theory for a dimerized and energetically heterogeneous B800 pigment pool with a quantum master equation approach describing phase and energy relaxation according to an experimental spectral density. The analysis of this model shows that the LH2 of Alc. vinosum features an interesting interplay of two excitonic bands, which are originating from the different pigment pools.																			0301-0104	1873-4421				NOV 1	2019	527								110476	10.1016/j.chemphys.2019.110476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphys.2019.110476													WOS:000487251000014

In the case of coexistence of circular and noncircular signals, the method first transforms the uniform rectangular arrays to a virtual uniform linear array. Multiple 2-D DOAs are then decoupled into several 1-D DOAs using RARE method.

After XRD and SEM analysis, the five CYSZ ceramic coatings (CeO2 content 0, 1, 5, 10, 15 mol%) prepared were tetragonal phase structures before and after the thermal shock experiment, and the thickness of CYSZ ceramic coating was about 200 mu m. Adding appropriate amount of nano CeO2 promoted the formation of micro-cracks in the coating, released the coating stress, slowed down the thermal shock damage process, and prevented the transformation from t-ZrO2 to m-ZrO2. The AFM morphology showed that the coating surface grains grow vertically after thermal shock cycle, which indicated that the entry of Ce4+ into ZrO2 lattice resulted in lattice distortion and made the grains more stable. When the content of CeO2 is 1 mol%, the thermal shock resistance excellent is 84 times. Therefore, the addition of CeO2 can effectively improve the thermal shock resistance performance of CYSZ thermal barrier coating, meeting the requirements of high temperature working conditions of aeroengine and hot-end components.																			1555-130X	1555-1318				NOV	2019	14	11					1597	1605		10.1166/jno.2019.2712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jno.2019.2712													WOS:000491075000012

The Yb-doped optical fiber induces a phase change under optical pumping conditions. The induced phase shift shows a good linear response to applied pumping currents, and N-step phase-shifting up to 2p can be properly performed. Four-, six-, and eight-step phase-shifting methods are performed, and the phase retrievals from their phase-shifted interferograms are achieved using an interframe correlation matrix method. An 8-step phase shifting-based reconstruction, which is effective for background noise reduction, is used for 3D imaging of an indium tin oxide (ITO) thin film and an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) thin film. The reconstructed surface profile was in agreement with the step structure of the samples. The proposed all-optical phase-shifting method is expected to be applied to various optical imaging systems using fiber-based phase-shifting interferometers.																			0374-4884	1976-8524				NOV	2019	75	9					685	692		10.3938/jkps.75.685	http://dx.doi.org/10.3938/jkps.75.685													WOS:000496021100006

The explicit majority comes from the area of philosophical, social and medical sciences. In our paper, we try to present the engineering aspect of the concept of disorder. We propose a mathematical model which describes the effects and consequences concerning the process of making the mess. We use Multi-Agent Modeling, where there are several independent agents with decision-making ability. Each agent has the ability to communicate and perceive for achieving its own aim. We use square grid n x n with objects which can be moved by agents to another places. The degree of disorder of the system is examined by the value of entropy. Using computer simulation, we investigate the time needed to find the desired thing in an environment in which agents (in real life, people) co-exist and they have different tendencies to tidiness. The cost of mess is counted as the number of attempts to access the object in the analyzed system and the time needed to locate the object.

The chip with a total area of 1.25 x 1.25 mm is intended for a working current of 20 mA and a forward voltage of 48 V. To improve the current-distribution uniformity over the active region of the chip elements and to minimize the losses of the element area occupied by the n-type contact, the n-type contact pads in them are arranged inside the p-type contact region due to the two-level metallization layout with an intermediate insulating layer of dielectric. The arrangement topology of the contact pads is developed using numerical simulation.

J	Meyer, RW; Erland, S				Meyer, R. W.; Erland, S.			Induced drag in two dimensions in ideal fluids	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS												In this paper we suggest a model for how a significant part of the drag forces on two-dimensional objects can be derived using the circulation that is naturally maintained around the objects. We assume incompressible and inviscid potential flow and that the circulation is already generated. The resulting velocity field complements the one that is known to generate Prandtl?s induced drag in three dimensions. We demonstrate how fluid particles in a velocity field are attracted towards an object, and that this, due to conservation of momentum, results not only in lift, but also in drag forces. The magnitude of a disturbance velocity can be derived from the circulation of bound and shed vortices accompanying the object and parameters taken from the von K;rm;n vortex street description. Another part of the drag is generated by vortices that emerge behind blunt bodies when fluid particles do not follow the surface of the objects. We obtain a mathematical description of the resistance of several types of blunt bodies and rotating cylinders. The model involves no parameters that are derived from empirical data. Still, this inviscid approach corresponds well with experimental data in viscous flow and is close to a mathematical empirical description of rotating cylinders by W. G. Bickley.

By applying the Stoner model we obtained the magnetic susceptibility of the heme derivatives. We find that the paramagnetic phase of heme, deoxyhemoglobin and aquomethemoglobin to be more stable than the diamagnetic phase as expected from experimentation but the diamagnetic phase of the oxyhemoglobin and hemichrome is more stable.

For first four samples only the diameter of core was varied and for other four samples only the weight percentage of CuO phase was varied. The existence of both cubic spinel ZnFe2O4 phase along with monoclinic CuO phase was verified by X-ray patterns recorded at room temperature. The average core diameter was in between 8 and 13 nm as estimated using Scherrer's formula and further verified by HRTEM images. A reduction in lattice parameter with increasing core thickness and also with increasing CuO phase was observed. A notable enhancement in coercivity and saturation magnetization were observed in field cooled (5 T) hysteresis loops obtained at 5 K for the first four varying core diameter core-shell structured nanoparticles in comparison to bare zinc ferrite nanoparticles of almost same size. A decreasing trend in coercivity and saturation magnetization was also noticed in low temperature hysteresis loops for higher CuO content samples. A considerable improvement in blocking temperature (T-B) as well as Neel temperature (T-N) for all the different core diameter samples were also found in M(T) protocols.

An abrupt breakdown behavior with BVceo of 11V and Vknee less than 1V at Jc>100kA/cm(2) are achieved using an optimized base collector junction transition layer design. Using 2D numerical simulations, components of leakages dominating Iceo at low and high collector to emitter bias voltages are explained. It is further shown that the optimized device exhibits good RF and power performance achieving f(T) of 115GHz and f(max) of 150GHz at emitter width >1um. An MMIC power amplifier (PA) is also designed and fabricated using the optimized Type-I InP DHBT device. At 28GHz, good power performance is achieved with PAE of 54% and Psat of 26dBm. Thus, it is shown that InP DHBTs developed in this work are a good candidate for the next phase of 5G millimeter wave Ka-band power amplifier applications.					mohata, dheeraj/AAQ-4112-2020	Brand, Joseph/0000-0002-0946-6435													0894-6507	1558-2345				NOV	2019	32	4					506	512		10.1109/TSM.2019.2932962	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2019.2932962													WOS:000502719000027
J	Mollaei, M; Jafarian, SMM				Mollaei, Mehdi; Jafarian, Seyyed Majid Malek			The introduction of the surfing scheme for shock capturing with high-stability and high-speed convergence	COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION												In this paper, a novel shock capturing scheme with high stability and speed of solution is presented. The scheme divides the dependent variables into two parts, i.e. Surf and Surfer, like surfing sport. The Surf part is calculated by applying the concept of Sobolev gradient on the dependent variables. Furthermore, it has the least difference with these variables, along with the lowest discretization error and the same equation. Hence, it is expected that this part can be solved at high stability conditions and large time steps. In addition, the Surfer part is obtained from the difference between the Surf part and the dependent variables. Therefore, only the error-maker operators (for example, a discontinuity like a shock) are in this part and accordingly it has a local nature. Due to this feature, it can be solved with fewer points compared to the Surf part. Therefore, its equation is solved as quickly as Surf equation, despite its limited stability conditions. Finally, the summation of the Surf and Surfer solutions makes the main solution. The scheme has been applied to the inviscid Burgers' equation with an initial value of the step function, and one-dimensional inviscid Euler flow through a nozzle with a shock wave. The stability condition for the Burgers' equation has been increased to a Courant number of 10(10) and the solution time for the Euler flow case has been decreased by one-fifth. Comparison of the results with traditional methods indicates the ultra-high stability and ultra-speed convergence of this scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Monnai, T				Monnai, Takaaki			Variational estimation of entanglement entropy for bipartite many-body systems	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT												We explore a variational characterization of the bipartite entanglement entropy such as von Neumann entropy for pure states in terms of general projective measurements of an arbitrary system. By properly choosing the measurement basis, we show that a general estimation of the bipartite entanglement measure can be explicitly written. The number of projective measurement operators of the subsystem necessary for calculating an upper bound of the bipartite entanglement entropy is less than or equal to the dimension of the smaller subsystem. This number is much smaller than that of the full tomography of the density matrix. As an application, our method is useful to estimate the entanglement entropy of each energy eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian.																			1742-5468					NOV	2019	2019	11							113105	10.1088/1742-5468/ab4bc0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/ab4bc0													WOS:000499890600001

It is unbiased and unique on some constraints and is applied to find out the distribution of a data set. But it is difficult to get the distribution of multivariate data by saving the dependency between its variables and transferring it to the outcome distribution. On the other hand, copula function keeps safe the dependency. Thus entropy principle can be added to copula concept to approximate the distributions of the multivariate dependence data sets. In this article, we would like to work on the most copula entropy based on known Spearman's rho as an extra constraint. For this aim, we approximate Spearman's rho via empirical distribution function of a given data set. Then the most copula entropy based on Tsallis definition is gotten and compared with Shannon results in some senses by plots. Finally its density function is practically obtained.

Preparation and study of a conductive nanocomposite applicable for the wall material of tissue-equivalent proportional counters used in radiation protection	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY												In the present work a tissue-equivalent (TE) nanocomposite is prepared by mixing polyamide 6 (PA6), polyethylene (PE) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to be a substitution for the expensive and difficult to obtain A-150 plastic as the wall material of tissue-equivalent proportional counters (TEPCs). It is found that 3% of CNTs in the nanocomposite produced 3 x 10(-6)S cm(-1) electrical conductivity comparable with that of A-150 and the soft tissue. Also, TEM picture shows the electrical network formation in the continuous PA phase and the interface of PA and PE phases. Determination of the density and the weight percentage of elements of this nanocomposite reveal that the obtained values are similar to A-150 and the soft tissue. On the other hand, simulations carried out by Geant4 toolkit show that the fluence of secondary charged particles of the gamma rays or neutrons inside the gas cavity originating from A-150 and the nanocomposite (3% CNT) is similar. In addition, microdosimetric distributions derived from a TEPC with the nanocomposite wall agree well with a TEPC with A-150 wall. Hence, the frequency-mean and dose-mean lineal energies obtained by the two TEPCs are also compatible. A maximum difference 3% is observed between the frequency-mean lineal energies. Also, the dose-mean lineal energies differ up to 10%. Consequently, the dose-equivalent determined by the two above TEPCs is found similar. Finally, it is concluded that the fabricated nanocomposite can be a reliable substitution for A-150 plastic as a wall material of TEPCs in the neutrons and gamma ray measurements.

J	Murti, R; Baskar, S				Murti, Ram; Baskar, S.			Weakly nonlinear ray theory in inhomogeneous moving media filled with polytropic gases	WAVE MOTION												The weakly nonlinear ray theory (WNLRT) has been developed for the study of propagation of wavefronts in homogeneous and quiescent media. The main advantage of this theory is that the study of 2D wavefront propagation can be carried over in a ray coordinate system, which is 1D (in the space variable). This makes the theory (along with the shock ray theory, SRT) more efficient than solving the full Euler system in 2D and is well suited for certain applications. However, the WNLRT and the SRT are developed only in a homogeneous and quiescent medium whereas it is important to update these theories to inhomogeneous and moving media. In this article, we derive the WNLRT system in an inhomogeneous and moving medium filled with polytropic gases. The governing system of this theory involves three balance laws in the ray coordinate system, which is strictly hyperbolic under the condition that the wavefront speed is greater than the ambient sound speed. In order to validate the developed theory, we solve the derived system numerically and show that the effect of medium anisotropy has been captured in terms of the geometry of a propagating wavefront. We also compare our numerical results with linear ray theory to highlight the success in capturing the nonlinear geometric effect of the propagating wavefront. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nemchinsky, V				Nemchinsky, Valerian			What Plasma Density and Temperature Can Support Unipolar Arc?	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE												The unipolar arc (UA) consists of two parts: the emitting electrons cathode part and the anode part collecting electrons. The central (emitting) part operates as a vacuum arc with relatively well-established experimental parameters: cathode voltage drop, current density, and minimal arc current (I-min). The current distribution in the background plasma was considered to find the condition of the UA existence, which is the ability of the background plasma to provide the return current at a level above I-min. Two situations were considered: with and without external magnetic field. It was found that in the magnetic field absence, the condition for the UA existence is determined mostly by the plasma temperature. At the same time, the magnetic field dramatically shifts the domain of the unipolar existence toward higher temperatures and higher plasma densities.																			0093-3813	1939-9375				NOV	2019	47	11	2				5099	5107		10.1109/TPS.2019.2946764	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2019.2946764													WOS:000499238000027

Conventional microwave synthesis processes of electrocatalysts include ultrasonication, stirring, pH adjustment, and microwave irradiation of the precursor mixture. Ethylene glycol (EG), which serves as a reductant and solvent was added during the ultrasonication or stirring stage. However, this step and pH adjustment resulted in unintended multi-stage gradual nucleation. In this study, the microwave reduction approach was used to induce rapid nucleation and high supersaturation in order to fabricate small-sized reduced graphene oxide-supported palladium (Pd/rGO) electrocatalysts via the delayed addition of EG, elimination of the pH adjustment step, addition of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), prior microwave irradiation of the EG mixed with Na2CO3, and addition of room temperature precursor mixture. Besides its role as a second reducing agent, the addition of Na2CO3 was primarily intended to generate an alkaline condition, which is essential for the high-performance of electrocatalysts. Moreover, the microwave irradiation of the EG and Na2CO3 mixture generated highly reactive free radicals that facilitate rapid nucleation. Meanwhile, the room temperature precursor mixture increased supersaturation. Results showed improved electrochemically active surface area (78.97 m(2) g(-1), 23.79% larger), MOR (434.49 mA mg(-1), 37.96% higher) and stability.

From the sheet resistance measurement, strain endurance up to 1.5% is realized in the capacitor with 10 nm thick HfO2.

The participants in the study were 179 students (44 female and 135 male) attending Izmir Vocational School who were enrolled in the Analog Electronics Course. The data of the study were collected by means of three open-ended questions and semi-structured interviews. In the questions, students were given a graph of an AC signal and asked to draw a signal with equal frequency but higher amplitude, a signal with equal amplitude but higher frequency, and a signal with a certain phase difference. The main aim of the interviews was to provide a deeper insight into the difficulties detected in the analysis of the questions.

J	Park, H; Lee, K				Park, Hyeyoung; Lee, Kwanyong			Adaptive Natural Gradient Method for Learning of Stochastic Neural Networks in Mini-Batch Mode	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Gradient descent method is an essential algorithm for learning of neural networks. Among diverse variations of gradient descent method that have been developed for accelerating learning speed, the natural gradient learning is based on the theory of information geometry on stochastic neuromanifold, and is known to have ideal convergence properties. Despite its theoretical advantages, the pure natural gradient has some limitations that prevent its practical usage. In order to get the explicit value of the natural gradient, it is required to know true probability distribution of input variables, and to calculate inverse of a matrix with the square size of the number of parameters. Though an adaptive estimation of the natural gradient has been proposed as a solution, it was originally developed for online learning mode, which is computationally inefficient for the learning of large data set. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive natural gradient estimation for mini-batch learning mode, which is commonly adopted for big data analysis. For two representative stochastic neural network models, we present explicit rules of parameter updates and learning algorithm. Through experiments on three benchmark problems, we confirm that the proposed method has superior convergence properties to the conventional methods.																				2076-3417				NOV	2019	9	21							4568	10.3390/app9214568	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9214568													WOS:000498058600093

Unlike existing approaches, the proposed framework provides natural 3D manipulation of a face without background distortion and interactive face editing by a user's input, which leads to freeform manipulation without any limitation of range or shape. To achieve these features, a 3D morphable face model is fitted to a face region in a video frame and is deformed by the user's input. The video frame is then mapped as a texture to the deformed model, and the model is rendered on the video frame. Because of the high computational cost, parallelization and acceleration schemes are also adopted for real-time performance. Performance evaluation and comparison results show that the proposed framework is promising for 3D face editing in live video.

In the scenario, the inflaton mass-square goes through a renormalization group running that depends on not only inflaton field but also an assisting field. Thanks to the assisting field participating in the running, the initial condition for a slow-roll inflation can be set naturally, and the inflaton potential can be flattened by the vacuum expectation value of the field.

J	Plansangkate, P				Plansangkate, Prim			From the conformal self-duality equations to the Manakov-Santini system	JOURNAL OF GEOMETRY AND PHYSICS												Under two separate symmetry assumptions, we demonstrate explicitly how the equations governing a general anti-self-dual conformal structure in four dimensions can be reduced to the Manakov-Santini system, which determines the three-dimensional Einstein-Weyl structure on the space of orbits of symmetry. The two symmetries investigated are a non-null translation and a homothety, which are previously known to reduce the second heavenly equation to the Laplace's equation and the hyper-CR system, respectively. Reductions on the anti-self-dual null-Uhler condition are also explored in both cases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The code calculates the magnetic field due to straight and circular segments of zero thickness or rectangular cross section and cylindrical wire. The magnetic field calculations use a combination of analytical and numerical integration methods based on the Biot-Savart law. The design philosophy of CAE is to reduce the complexities while generating the inputs, and provide the visuals of the given inputs as 3-D plots of the electromagnets and magnetic field components as outputs in the Excel format.

The achieved results for the lattice parameters and band gaps of three conformers in this research are in good accordance with other theoretical results. The band structures of three conformers show that the chair, boat, and stirrup are direct band gap with a band gaps of (3.12, 4.95, and 4.95 eV), respectively. To regulate the band structures of fh-BN, we employ a hybrid functional of Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) calculations and the band gaps are 3.84 (chair), 6.12 (boat), and 6.18 eV (stirrup), respectively. The boat and stirrup fh-BN exhibits varying degrees of mechanical anisotropic properties with respect to the Young?s modulus and Poisson?s ratio, while the chair fh-BN exhibits the mechanical isotropic properties. Furthermore, tensile strains are applied in the armchair and zigzag directions related to tensile deformation of zigzag and armchair nanotubes, respectively. We find that the ultimate strains in zigzag and armchair deformations in stirrup conformer are 0.34 and 0.25, respectively, larger than the strains of zigzag (0.29) and armchair (0.18) deformations in h-BN although h-BN can surstain a surface tension up to the maximum stresses higher than those of three conformers of fh-BN. Furthermore, the band gap energies in three conformers can be modulated effectively with the biaxial tensile strain.

Temperature induced shift of electronic band structure in Fe(Se,Te)	LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS												FeSe, the simplest iron-based superconductor, reveals a variety of puzzling properties and features that could hold a key for the pairing mechanism in this family of superconductors. In particular, it's complex electronic band structure differs essentially from the DFT calculated one in a specially way called the "red-blue shift" and, in addition, drifts anomalously with temperature. Here we study this band structure evolution in Fe(Se,Te) crystals and reveal essential downdrift of all the hole-like bands with increasing temperature, which is opposite to the "red-blue shift" expectation. We show that this drift cannot be described by temperature-dependent contribution to quasiparticle self-energy within the Fermi-liquid concept but could result in charge redistribution between the bulk and topological surface states. If such a scenario is confirmed, one can tune the topologically non-trivial bands near the Fermi level with temperature, potentially allowing temperature-induced crossover between different Fermi surface topologies.					; Kordyuk, Alexander/G-6502-2010	Yuriy, Pustovit/0009-0009-9665-2727; Kordyuk, Alexander/0000-0001-6737-9172													1063-777X	1090-6517				NOV	2019	45	11					1172	1177		10.1063/10.0000123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/10.0000123													WOS:000499998800005

Specifically, for different spectra responses to surface thicknesses d(L) (30, 60 and 90 nm) and incident angles theta (45 degrees , 60 degrees and 75 degrees ), color attributes of synthesis, s-polarization (s) and p-polarization (p) are systematically induced as: arithmetical averaging properties of luminance factors Y-synthesis % - (Y-s% Y-P%)/2 or tristimulus values (Tv) Tv-synthesis = (Tv-s + Tv-p)/2; collinearity of synthetic and polarizationseparated chromaticity coordinates (CCs); constant mathematic relation of T-v(s) > T-v(p); synthetic CCs partial to s-polarized CCs as d(p-synthesis) > d(s-synthesis).

The feedback operation is elaborately designed with respect to the eigenstates of the density matrix of the target state and its post-measurement state. This design procedure is suitable for the generation of any predefined coherent superpositions of multiple quantum states and elicitation of desired quantum dynamics. For the sake of clearness, arbitrarily prescribed superposition states in three- and four-level systems are prepared, and quantum dynamics achieved as desired. The simulation results indicate that the scheme tolerates modest imprecisions of feedback operation and is robust against sudden perturbations. Thus, the scheme enables new insight on quantum manipulations in a variety of multi-level systems to be achieved.

An ENIG surface typically exhibits excellent planarity, good electrical characteristics, wettability for solder, and wire bond-ability. Reliability and performance of ENIG systems have been extensively reported at temperatures below 250C; however, information is not readily available about its reliability at higher temperatures. In this paper, thermal behavior of electroless Ni/Au, Ni/Pd and Ni/Pd/Au during solder reflow processing at temperatures of up to 350C is characterized. Wafer level evaluations were completed using optical microscopy and FIB cross-sectional SEMs, while packaged devices were subjected to standard reliability tests. Electroless Ni began to exhibit signs of cracking when exposed to temperatures of 350C under certain conditions. Based on these findings, we propose electroless Ni material structures and maximum processing temperatures to minimize stress cracking at high reflow temperatures. This paper builds on our previous work expanding the tested material structures to a gold-free process of Ni/Pd as well as 5 $\mu {\mathrm{ m}}$ Ni/Pd/Au. Power devices manufactured with electroless Ni metallization can be capable of passing JEDEC qualification when implemented with these design parameters.

As a result of this oscillation in the fusion excitation function, the extracted values of the energy derivative of the excitation function times energy become oscillatory in the variation with incident energy showing several peaks and deeps including deeps of negative values. These structures are more pronounced in the fusion of light nuclei as compared to those in heavier ones. By a theoretical investigation we demonstrate how resonances give rise to oscillatory structures in the fusion cross sections and their energy-weighted derivatives and successfully reproduce the experimentally observed structures in the fusion data of the O-16+O-16, Si-28+Si-28, O-16+Pb-208, S-36+Pd-110, Ca-40+Zr-96, Ca-48+Zr-96, and Ni-58+Ni-60 systems involving light as well as heavy nuclei.																			0954-3899	1361-6471				NOV	2019	46	11							115108	10.1088/1361-6471/ab4101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6471/ab4101													WOS:000502251700002

This allows removing the complexity of randomly shaped particles thus concentrating on the interaction between adjacent particles. For this purpose, conceptual compression experiments on assemblies of hexagonal steel nuts are performed and subsequently simulated by a discrete element method. The interaction models for contact of two particles are as follows: in normal direction an elastic model augmented by a viscous supplement and in tangential direction an elasto-plastic model are applied; furthermore, an elasto-plastic model describes the contact of a particle with a plane underground. For an adhering bond between particles an elasto-damage beam including an axial force is introduced between the centers of adjacent particles. It allows modeling gradual failure of the bond. In order to test the capability of these models in a direct way, the conceptual experiments on simple regular particle arrangements are compared with their corresponding simulations. For samples of unglued particles relevant characteristics like shear bands are reproduced. For assemblies of particles glued together by an adhesive the study describes important failure properties like localization in cracks as well as ductile failure.																			1434-5021	1434-7636				NOV	2019	21	4							91	10.1007/s10035-019-0930-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10035-019-0930-6													WOS:000482912600003

Due to the presence of Rayleigh Anomaly (RA) peak, however, it has not been possible to design filter array spanning wide-spectral-range without sacrificing spectral purity. In this paper, a plasmonic grating filter design using Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) with suppressed RA peak is presented. Proposed filter allows extending spectral range without sacrificing spectral purity. Using proposed MIM structure, surface plasmon polariton (SPP) mode supported on air side of bottom grating structure is cancelled by second set of SPP mode on top grating structure. This allows designing filter array with improved spectral range and achieves better than 2; improvement in suppression of the Rayleigh Anomaly peak.

In recent years, many algorithms have been proposed to detect the high-quality communities in real-world networks. However, these algorithms have shortcomings of performing calculation on the whole network or defining objective function and the number of commonties in advance, which affects the performance and complexity of community detection algorithms. In this paper, a novel algorithm has been proposed to detect communities in networks by belonging intensity analysis of intermediate nodes, named BIAS, which is inspired from the interactive behavior in human communication networks. More specifically, intermediate nodes are middlemen between different groups in social networks.

J	Shi, XG				Shi, Xuguang			Topological current for transverse electrical and thermal conductivity in thermoelectric effect	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS												Thermoelectric efficiency of the traditional thermoelectric material is low, which restricts the large scale applications. Recently, the developing of the topological insulator provides a new opportunity to get high thermoelectric efficiency material. There are two effects in topological insulator: anomalous Hall and Nernst effect, which have contribution to the transport properties. Because of anomalous Hall and Nernst effect the electrical thermal conductivity have transverse parts, which affect the Seebeck coefficient. However, the transverse parts can be expressed by Berry curvature. By using of ?-mapping topological theory, the Berry curvature is studied and we find there is topological vortex in the momentum space. The Bloch wave function is zero at the topological vortex. Finally, the relationships between the topological vortex and the transverse electrical and thermal conductivity is given and how the topology affects the Seebeck coefficient is researched in detail.																			2399-6528					NOV	2019	3	11							115020	10.1088/2399-6528/ab5872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2399-6528/ab5872													WOS:000499382100001

However, Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) that connect layers in the structure of 3D ICs can seriously increase the delay due to capacitance coupling between TSVs and lead to crosstalk fault. The severity of crosstalk faults depends on transitions appearing on TSVs that is called transition patterns. To propose an efficient crosstalk tackling mechanisms in 3D ICs, an accurate probability analytical model is required to predict the delay caused by TSVs (3D ICs) in the attendance of these transition patterns. In this regard, this paper proposes an accurate crosstalk probability model for 3D ICs called AM3D that estimates the latency of communication channels of 3D ICs in the attendance of crosstalk faults. The model is applicable for both non-protected TSVs and TSVs which are protected by crosstalk mitigation mechanisms. In order to accredit our proposed model, various SPICE simulations are conducted and obtained outcomes in different benchmarks are compared with extracted results from AM3D. Comparisons present an average of 1.81% discrepancies between the time delay obtained from SPICE simulations and time delay calculated by our proposed model.

Here, we present a case of unpredictable delayed coronary obstruction in the left main trunk (LMT) after self-expandable device implantation because the left coronary height was enough over 15 mm. LMT obstruction was caused by a heavy calcification that was pushing up from the outside of the LMT, like an "uppercut" phenomenon. Stent-in-stent technique was a useful option for this type of LMT obstruction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

G.; Sinyaev, S., V			Multiparametric Investigation of Thermal Limitations in a Rapid-Fire Multirail Railgun Powered by a Pulsed MHD Generator	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE												The operation of rapid burst firing multi-rail railguns was analyzed by numerical simulation using coupled 2-D and 3-D nonstationary formulations. In the calculations, a Sakhalin-type pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator is assumed as a power source for the launcher. Launchers with three and five pairs of parallel rails connected into a series electrical circuit are considered. The simulation was performed for different numbers of projectiles in a burst and for different projectile masses. It is established that a major factor limiting the operation of launchers in such modes is the heating of the rails. It is shown that the rate of rail heating is determined by the inhomogeneity of the current density distribution along the rail section due to the nonstationary diffusion of the magnetic field into the rails and by the velocity skin effect. It has been shown previously that the maximum heating of the rails occurs in regions located outside the launcher channel provided that the width of the outer rail extends beyond the section of the launcher channel. We investigated the possibilities of reducing the heating of rails in these regions using rails of different widths in the rail launcher channel, using rails of different materials and rails with inhomogeneous electrophysical properties, and using armatures of different materials. The calculations show that with an optimal choice of the material and structure of the rails and the armature material corresponding to this structure, multirail launchers 5-6-m long can provide a projectile velocity of 2-2.5 km/s in a burst of 10-16 projectiles with masses of up to 800 g at a firing rate of 200-300 shots per second with no melting of the rails in the launcher channel.

Simulations have been performed on random pockets (slums) with different areas and lifetime of the Delhi city. The images were procured and processed using GIS package SAS planet and ImageJ and the fractal dimension was calculated by the box-counting method. In addition, we propose a confined leapfrogging model. Both studies suggests that any such confined pocket shall eventually have a high fractal dimension in the range 1.65-1.85 with a central tendency of 1.76 from the data of pockets and 1.78 from the confined model. These slums will approach a high fractal dimension due to the high level of social and economic pressure there.

In such a system, the anisotropy is slightly tilted from the normal to substrate plane. The effect of tilt was observed as shift in out-of-plane (OP) room-temperature hysteresis, in presence of in-plane (IP) bias field. Tilt angles were obtained by measuring the shifts in OP hysteresis for several magnitudes and relative azimuthal orientations of bias field with respect to IP projection of tilted anisotropy direction. We studied variation of tilt angle as function of FM layer thickness which was increased near to Spin Reorientation Transition (SRT) value for FM layer in corresponding system. We also studied this variation for different bottom Pt layer thicknesses. The results of our experiment show the variation to follow two different profiles - one monotonic and the other non-monotonic.

Using the spin Hartree-Fock approach we construct a quantitative theory of heat capacity in the quasi-1D regime with a finite coupling between spin chains. This theory reproduces closely the exact result of Bethe Ansatz in the 1D limit and does not produces any spurious phase transitions for any anisotropy in the quasi-1D regime at finite temperatures in agreement with the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We study the static spin-spin correlation function in order to analyse the interplay of lattice geometry and anisotropy in these systems. We compare the square and triangular lattice. For the latter we find that there is a quantum transition point at an intermediate anisotropy of similar to 0.6. This quantum phase transition establishes that the quasi-1D regime extends upto a particular point in this geometry. For the square lattice the change from the 1D to 2D occurs smoothly as a function of anisotropy, i.e. it is of the crossover type. Comparing the newly developed theory to the available experimental data on the heat capacity of Cs2CuBr4 and Cs2CuCl4 we extract the microscopic constants of the exchange interaction that previously could only be measured using inelastic neutron scattering in high magnetic fields.																			1434-6028	1434-6036				NOV	2019	92	11							252	10.1140/epjb/e2019-100387-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjb/e2019-100387-9													WOS:000496299600001

For this, an additional negatively polarised electrode is mounted in P+(source)-N (channel)-N+(drain) structure over the source region to overcome material solubility. This improves the electrical characteristics of the device. Along with this, we have implanted a low workfunction metal layer (ML) in the oxide layer under the gate electrode for creating more abruptness at the junction to improve the subthreshold swing (SS) of the device. Thus, the proposed concept improves the DC/RF performance of the doped TFET device. Further to this, the optimization of metal layer workfunction and misalignment of metal layer in TFET have been performed to get optimum device characteristics. In addition to this, for the suppression of ambipolar behaviour, gate electrode is shorted from the drain side. Due to short length of gate electrode tunneling barrier width at the drain/channel junction increases, hence the tunneling probability decreases which reduces the ambipolar current to parasitic current. Shortening of gate electrode also improves the RF performance.

The concentration dependence of the ionic conductivity of Pb1 - xSnxF2 single crystals and poly- and nanocrystals is analyzed. The single-crystal form of the superionic conductor is characterized by the highest conductivity. The mobility and concentration of anionic charge carriers in a single crystal and ceramics of Pb1 - xSnxF2 (x = 0.2) is calculated on the basis of structural and electrophysical data. The mobility of carriers mu (mob) = 2.5 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s V (at 293 K) in a single crystal is seven times higher than in nanoceramic. The concentration of carriers n(mob) = 1.7 x 10(21) and 3.6 x 10(21) cm(3) (4.5 and 9.5% of the total number of anions) for a single crystal and nanoceramic, respectively. The comparison of isostructural Pb0.8Sn0.2F2, Pb0.67Cd0.33F2, and Pb0.9Sc0.1F2.1 single crystals shows that anionic carriers have a maximum mobility in the beta -PbF2 and SnF2 based solid solution.

The segmentation, or partition of the image pixels, is viewed as a model structure selection problem, where the decisions are based on the implementable codelength of the model, akin to minimum description length for lossy representations. The intended usage of the extracted disparity map is to provide to the decoder the geometry information at a very small fraction from what is required for a lossless compressed version, and secondly, to convey to the decoder a segmentation describing the contours of the objects from the scene. We propose first an algorithm for constructing a hierarchical segmentation based on the persistency of the contours of regions in an iterative re-estimation algorithm. Then, we propose a second algorithm for constructing a new sequence of segmentations, by selecting the order in which the persistent contours are included in the model, driven by decisions based on the descriptive codelength. We consider real disparity datasets which have the geometry information at a high precision, in floating point format, but for which encoding of the raw information, in about 32 bits per pixels, is too expensive, and we then demonstrate good approximations preserving the object structure of the scene, achieved for rates below 0.2 bits per pixels.

A third process is therefore required for the production of these nuclei, the so-called p-process. The abundance and the origin of the p-nuclei are still not fully understood even though significant experimental and theoretical efforts in astrophysical modeling have been expended in the last two decades. The experimental studies with the activation method to measure cross sections of the relevant reactions have some limitations: the reaction product must be radioactive, should have an appropriate half-life, and its decay should be followed by proper gamma-radiations. If the cross section cannot be calculated with the radiation followed by the first beta decay of the product, it can be measured using the second beta decay as an alternative method. In this study, the method and candidate reactions for the cross-section measurements via the second beta decay of the reaction product using the activation method are discussed.

We suggest that these plateaus correspond in fact to two minima of the energy, the attractive atomic interactions being long-range.

Time of flight mass spectrometry with direct extraction of a uranium plasma	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY												We demonstrate a Wiley-McClaren Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer modified to allow direct extraction of ions from a laser-induced plasma. Unlike many other methods that utilize mass spectrometry to investigate laser-induced plasmas, no collisional cooling or further ionization of the plasma is required prior to acceleration, allowing measurements of the plasma ion composition to be obtained directly. Furthermore, we show using the laser ablation of gadolinium as an example that we are able to obtain the translational energy distribution of the plasma directly and infer information about the relative composition of ions within different regions of the plasma plume. The approach is then applied to laser ablation of a uranium sample as a step toward probing the chemistry under conditions relevant to a nuclear fireball for nuclear forensics applications.

J	Tolman, JR; Arbogast, LW				Tolman, Joel R.; Arbogast, Luke W.			Selective spin inversion in solution by magic field cross polarization	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE												A pulsed element is proposed allowing the selective inversion of a single H-1 nucleus, without regard to the presence of other degenerate H-1 nuclei, provided that it is coupled to a heteronuclear spin with adequate chemical shift resolution in a 2D heteronuclear correlation spectrum. The approach is based on selective cross polarization, in which matched weak RF fields of specific amplitude are applied on resonance to the targeted H-1-X spin pair. It is shown theoretically that when the RF field amplitudes are set to specific values (ie. at a magic field), transfer of coherence can be fruitfully achieved transverse to the applied RF fields in addition to the normal longitudinal transfers. This enables the construction of a pulsed element which has the characteristics of a BIRDr,X element (Uhrin et al., 1993), yet with 2D frequency selectivity. Demonstration of the pulsed element is made in the context of selective spin inversion, by which all H-1 spins are inverted except the targeted H-1 spin. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The algorithm, which is a general one and is not restricted to fields with mid-plane symmetry is based on the Maclaurin series expansion of the magnetic field components at any point in space in terms of the distance (y) of the point from the reference plane. The coefficients of the Maclaurin series expansion are expressed in terms of the on-plane field components and their partial derivatives with respect to spatial coordinates (x, z). The field components are usually generated from magnetic field measurements on a rectangular grid on the plane. This algorithm was employed in 1986 in the RAYTRACE computer code to help calculate the optical properties of magnets and of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). A general mathematical formulation of this algorithm based on the differential algebraic method was presented by Makino in 2011. This paper presents the step by step derivation of the algorithm and provides the necessary formulas to be introduced by the reader in any computer code which requires the field components generated by magnetic devices. In addition provides an example of the use of the algorithm and its limitations as applied to a Halbach type magnet with or without median plane symmetry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

J	Tsuzuki, S				Tsuzuki, Satori			Entropy stability analysis of smoothed dissipative particle dynamics	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS												This article presents an entropy stability analysis of smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) to review the validity of particle discretization of entropy equations. First, we consider the simplest SDPD system: a simulation of incompressible flows using an explicit time integration scheme, assuming a quasi-static scenario with constant volume, constant number of particles, and infinitesimal time shift. Next, we derive a form of entropy from the discretized entropy equation of SDPD by integrating it with respect to time. We then examine the properties of a two-particle system for a constant temperature gradient. Interestingly, our theoretical analysis suggests that there exist eight different types of entropy stability conditions, which depend on the types of kernel functions. It is found that the Lucy kernel, poly6 kernel, and spiky kernel produce the same types of entropy stability conditions, whereas the spline kernel produces different types of entropy stability conditions. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of particle discretization.

Our methodology combines the ab initio results of SIESTA code with discrete element method (DEM) to describe the fracture in brittle materials. This methodology has shown to be efficient in predicting TiO2 hardness at the normal and high-pressure phases, and to describe low hardness materials such as cassiterite (SnO2). On the other hand, micro-hardness Vickers models such as Simunek et al. were applied to predict the hardness using structural and electronic parameters of single crystals, showing the importance of the information provided by self-consistent calculations. Our results show that it is possible to extend this methodology to the evaluation of the micro-hardness of a wide range of materials, and consequently, the methodology could be extended more reliably in a systematic searching of hardness in the design of solid solutions.																			0947-8396	1432-0630				NOV	2019	125	11							770	10.1007/s00339-019-3074-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00339-019-3074-y													WOS:000492157100002

Fluctuating hydrogen-bonded structures formed due to the intermolecular dynamics provide different relaxation processes when microwave or THz spectroscopy is applied. Relaxation characteristics of water molecules in the liquid have been estimated by different modes taking into consideration proton sharing between the hydrogen-bonded molecules. One of the mode was deduced using Maxwell relation eta = B-m tau(r), where eta is dynamic viscosity, B-m is bulk modulus, and tau(r) is relaxation time. The latter (tau(r)) depending on temperature was used to estimate Debye relaxation time and its fast component (tau(2)). Rotational relaxation time (tau(rot)), which has been connected with tau(2), is introduced to characterize rotation of 2p(4)-electron orbit configuration arisen because of hydrogen bonding oscillations. Relaxation time of proton motion in the N-H+center dot center dot center dot O moiety with single hydrogen bond described like boson moving is found consistent with tau(2) of water.

Despite spectral overlap with the polymer cation, the g-anisotropy of the acceptor radical could be directly confirmed through detection of its unique N-14 hyperfine couplings using electron-electron double resonance (ELDOR)-detected nuclear magnetic resonance (EDNMR) for spectral filtering. The spectral assignment is further underpinned by quantum-chemical calculations, which also provide detailed information about the spin density and charge distribution of the polaron in the DTTzTz acceptor.

Currently, only invasive and sacrificial methods exist to study neurochemical alterations following TBI. Nuclear magnetic resonance methods-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS)-are powerful tools which may be used noninvasively to diagnose a range of medical issues. These methods can be utilized to explore brain functionality, connectivity, and biochemistry. Unfortunately, many of the commonly studied brain metabolites (e.g., N-acetyl-aspartate, choline, creatine) remain relatively stable following mild to moderate TBI and may not be suitable for longitudinal assessment of injury severity and location. Therefore, a critical need exists to investigate alternative biomarkers of TBI, such as acrolein. Acrolein is a byproduct of lipid peroxidation and accumulates following damage to neuronal tissue. Acrolein has been shown to increase in post-mortem rat brain tissue following TBI. However, no methods exist to noninvasively quantify acrolein in vivo. Currently, we have characterized the T-1 and T-2 of acrolein via nuclear magnetic resonance saturation recovery and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill experiments, accordingly, to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of acrolein obtained with MRS. In addition, we have quantified acrolein in water and whole-brain phantom using PRESS MRS and standard post-processing methods. With this potential novel biomarker for assessing TBI, we can investigate methods for predicting acute and chronic neurological dysfunction in humans and animal models. By quantifying and localizing acrolein with MRS, and investigating neurological outcomes associated with in vivo measures, patient-specific interventions could be developed to decrease TBI-associated morbidity and improve quality of life.					; Rispoli, Joseph/AAB-1655-2019	Vike, Nicole L/0000-0002-8617-2377; Talavage, Thomas/0000-0003-4977-6398; Rispoli, Joseph/0000-0003-4514-3390													0937-9347	1613-7507				NOV	2019	50	11					1291	1303		10.1007/s00723-019-01148-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00723-019-01148-2								32051668					WOS:000491493500005

Recoil-proton track imaging is a technique to optically record the tracks of recoil protons in a gaseous scintillator via real-time imaging devices. Scintillation luminescence images represent the 2-D tracks of recoil protons and can directly reflect the neutron energy spectra. Since the track image is 2-D, more information can be obtained. The satisfactory performance of the recoil proton track imaging was determined via Monte Carlo simulations. A series of recoil proton track images were generated using the Geant4 toolkit as the detector response. The neutron energy spectrum was unfolded via a genetic algorithm. Compared with 1-D recoil proton track images, this method has the advantage of being able to achieve a finer resolution for the energy spectrum. Several different neutron energy test spectra were used in this study and it was found that the method was stable and provides accurate results efficiently.

For such guiding, the transverse profile of the laser intensity at the capillary entrance has a strong influence on the fluctuations of the transverse plasma wakefield during the laser propagation. The effects of these fluctuations on the acceleration of an electron bunch injected at 100 MeV is analyzed in detail. Our results show that, in the best match conditions, the usually used Gaussian transverse profile leads to strong fluctuations generated by the diffraction of the edges of the laser at the capillary entrance.

The results showed that the measured fatigue threshold values in lamellar gamma-TiAl alloys are very sensitive to the applied testing procedures. For example, the staircase load-increasing method yielded smaller threshold values. When such a load-increasing method was used, the threshold values were measured either from a notch machined by electro-discharge machining or prepared by a compression-compression fatigue loading. Moreover, some differences could be seen with respect to the morphologies of the crack starters. Most of the above influences are associated with the brittle nature of the material and the characteristics of the lamellar microstructures, and closure effects are primarily induced by crack wake roughness or unbroken ligaments.																				1996-1944				NOV	2019	12	21							3487	10.3390/ma12213487	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma12213487								31653069					WOS:000502798800028

The defocused regions of MTs in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery were utilized here instead of the whole original radar data. A joint radar projection operator for the static and moving objects was formulated and employed to construct an optimization problem. The Lp norm constraint was utilized to promote the separation of MT data and the suppression of clutter. After the joint sparse imaging processing, the energy of strong static targets could be suppressed significantly in the reconstructed MT imagery. The static scene imagery could be derived simultaneously without the defocused MT. Finally, numerical simulations were used verify the validity and robustness of the proposed methodology.																				2079-9292				NOV	2019	8	11							1215	10.3390/electronics8111215	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics8111215													WOS:000502269500011

For security enhancement, we adopt the max-link relay selection policy and propose three secure transmission schemes: (1) non-jamming (NJ); (2) source cooperative jamming (SCJ); and (3) source cooperative jamming with optimal power allocation (SCJ-OPA). Moreover, to analyze the secrecy performance comprehensively, two eavesdropping scenarios, i.e., non-colluding eavesdroppers (NCE) and colluding eavesdroppers (CE) are considered. Based on this, by modeling the dynamic buffer state transition as a Markov chain, we derive the exact closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability, the average secrecy throughput, and the end-to-end delay for each schemes. The analytical analysis and simulation shows that the SCJ-OPA scheme achieves similar performance as the NJ scheme when the total transmit power is small. On the other hand, when the transmit power is high, the performance achieved by SCJ-OPA is similar to that of SCJ. Thereby, the SCJ-OPA scheme can achieve better performance across the entire total transmit power, which makes up the defects of NJ and SCJ exactly.

During subsequent investigation a correlation between MIM top metal defects and Knudsen flow conditions within the metal deposition system was revealed. MIM surface condition prior to and after top metal deposition was extensively studied. MIM surface characterization showed large size particles formed on the MIM feature after the wafer experienced Knudsen flow. Experiments show such defects could also be produced after multiple oxygen plasma cleans and long staging time of exposed MIM features. These same changes of the MIM surface condition occurred at an accelerated rate under Knudsen flow conditions in the metal deposition system. Inline AOI results showed that when the Knudsen number was at or greater than 0.2 during vacuum load lock pumping, MIM metal missing/peeling defects were formed, affecting up to 20 of die.

We have dealt with the problem based on repeatability postulate, which generalizes Zurek's result to the GPT framework (Wu et al., Phys. Lett. A 379, 2694, 2015). A natural question arises: can we deduce the information transfer result under weaker assumptions? In this paper, we generalize Zurek's result to the framework of GPT using weak repeatability postulate. We show that if distinguishable information can be transferred from a physical system to a series of apparatuses under the weak repeatability postulate in GPT, then the initial states of the physical system must be completely distinguishable. Moreover, after each step of invertible transformation, the composite states of the composite system composed of the physical systems and the apparatuses must also be completely distinguishable.

Size effects on phonon response of bismuth nanoislands to ultrafast laser excitation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS												The lattice dynamics of bismuth nanoislands induced by ultrafast laser excitation is studied by ultrafast electron diffraction. The decay times of the Bragg peak intensity depend on the diffraction order. For 5-nm flat nanoislands, the decay time of the (110) diffraction order is close to the A(1g) optical phonon decay time. When the thickness is increased to similar to 16 nm, the excitation energy is dissipated into low energy phonons, making energy transport diffusive, thus leading to a longer decay time. The temporal evolution of the (012) Bragg diffraction peak shows a two exponential decay with a second decay time of similar to 40 ps emerging when the nanoislands are 5 nm thick and the laser fluence is lower than 1.5 mJ/cm(2). This second decay may be attributed to a phonon bottleneck caused by size restriction.

The eddy current loss is related to the magnetic field, the shape of magnets, and rotating speed. In this article, the eddy current is analytically calculated with a 2-D method in a high-speed machine with the Halbach magnetization. This analytical method calculates the eddy current with two parts: one part is induced by the instantaneous radial flux density and the other part is induced by instantaneous tangential flux density. The instantaneous radial and tangential flux densities are varying in the PM when the rotor rotates. The flux density in the PM is calculated by the 2-D complex relative permeance method with the SC-Toolbox aid. When the slotted machine operated at no-load condition, the eddy current is analytically calculated in this article based on the instantaneous flux density, and the eddy current distribution in the magnet is compared with the finite-element method (FEM) solutions, the comparison shows that the 2-D analytical method is an effective method for the eddy current and eddy current loss calculation. In the slotted machine with the Halbach magnetization, the eddy current loss increases with the arc angle of the main segment magnet increases, the eddy current loss increases fast at high speeds and cannot be ignored, but Halbach magnetization can reduce it in the high-speed machine as long as the magnetization parameters are chosen properly.

The scheme utilizes the correlation of quantum entangled states to transmit bidding information. It can use an entangled state to transmit two bits of bidding information, which greatly improves the transmission efficiency. In order to avoid collusion between bidders and auctioneer, we introduce a semi-trusted third party Trent.

Finally, the security of the scheme is proved, and the scheme is more economical and feasible.																			0020-7748	1572-9575				NOV	2019	58	11					3863	3870		10.1007/s10773-019-04253-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10773-019-04253-x													WOS:000496661600023

However, the growing cost of product wafers has progressively hindered their use for analysis, depending on the shrinkage of device dimensions. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a new analytical style that uses the remaining dies on a sawn wafer after all the good dies have been picked and taken for assembly. We call the resulting structure a "skeleton-wafer". In the present study, we have developed a testing system that can handle a skeleton-wafer in the same manner as a conventional wafer. Basically, skeleton-wafer testing is performed at room temperature, given that commonly used dicing tapes have low heat-resistance. We have also developed a sophisticated method that enables analytical testing on the remaining dies at high temperature. A case example achieves high throughput and good contact characteristics, enabling the developed system to be of practical use in high-volume electrical failure analysis. We illustrate how our analytical testing system has improved cost-effectiveness and time-efficiency in yield enhancement activity.

To address such difficulty and harness information from both model forecast and observation, we propose a novel particle filter framework with the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) method. By constructing a gPC expansion for the system state of interest, our framework delivers a system assimilation procedure that updates gPC coefficients when observations of the system are available, and whose forward model is defined by the stochastic Galerkin method. In this way, one can not only estimate the system state for specific realizations but also its statistical moments, and even the probability density function. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through four numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The temperature dependence of electrical resistance (R) was measured for the low-T-c phase of (NH3)(y)LixFeSe0.5Te0.5 over a pressure (p) range of 0?14 GPa, and for the high-T-c phase of (NH3)(y)LixFeSe0.5Te0.5 over 0?19 GPa, yielding double-dome superconducting T-c?p phase diagrams, i.e. two superconducting phases (SC-I and SC-II) were found for both the low-T-c and high-T-c phases under pressure. For the low-T-c phase, the maximum T-c was 20.2 K at 0 GPa for SC-I, and 19.9 K at 8.98 GPa for SC-II. For the high-T-c phase, the maximum T-c was 33.0 K at 1.00 GPa for SC-I, and 24.0 K at 11.5?13.2 GPa for SC-II. These results imply that the maximum T-c value of the high pressure phase (SC-II) does not exceed the maximum value of the SC-I, unlike what was shown in the T-c?p phase diagrams of (NH3)(y)LixFeSe and (NH3)(y)CsxFeSe investigated previously. Nevertheless, the double-dome T-c?p phase diagram was found in metal-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5, indicating that this feature is universal in metal-doped FeSe1?zTez. Moreover, no structural phase transitions were observed for either the low-T-c or high-T-c phases of (NH3)(y)LixFeSe0.5Te0.5 over the wide pressure range of 0?15.3 GPa, and the T-c-lattice constant (c) plots for both phases were recorded to determine the critical point separating SC-I and SC-II.

Fractional excitations in one-dimensional fermionic systems	PHYSICA SCRIPTA												We study the soliton modes carrying fractional quantum numbers in one-dimensional fermionic systems. In particular, we consider the solitons in the one-dimensional fermionic superfluids. For the s-wave order parameter with phase twisted by an angle phi, the complex Z(2) soliton may occur carrying a localized fractional quantum number phi/(2 pi). If the system is finite with length L, we show the existence of a uniform background -phi/(2 pi L) which, though vanishing in the thermodynamic limit, is essential to maintain the conservation of the total integer quantum number. This analysis is also applicable to other systems with fractional quantum numbers, thus providing a mechanism to understand the compatibility of the emergence of fractional quantum number in the thermodynamic limit of a finite system with only integer quantum numbers. For the p-wave pairing case, the Majorana zero mode may occur associated with a real Z(2) soliton, and the fractionalized quantum number is the dimension of the single particle Hilbert space, which turns out to be 1/2. Again for a finite system with length L, there is an accompanying uniform dimension density -1/(2L) to maintain the dimension of the Hilbert space invariant. We conjecture a connection of the dimension density of one-dimensional solitons with the quantum dimension of topological excitations.

Standard 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis provides a fresh determination of the atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances for 17 species including C, Na, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Y, and Nd. Then, the computed up-to-date abundances are used to investigate FIP in the program stars, as seen in the Sun and sun-like stars. Also, we scrutinize their behavior for dust-gas separation as an alternative mechanism to the FIP.

The AAO is chosen as the leak element because its conductance remains constant from vacuum to atmosphere. The container to be measured is connected to the vacuum system via the AAO leak element. The dynamic differential pressure decay with time between the inlet and outlet of AAO leak assembly was measured and fitted by an exponential function, followed by volume calculation. The volume of two different containers has been obtained using this method with nitrogen, helium, and argon, respectively. The influence of temperature fluctuation on experimental results under vacuum and atmospheric pressure outlet conditions was discussed. For vacuum outlet conditions, the temperature change caused by pressure decay in one single experiment is small enough to satisfy the isothermal hypothesis, which makes the influence of temperature fluctuation on the experimental results negligible. The preliminary results compared with the static expansion method demonstrate that this novel volume measurement technique is accurate, simple and efficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Via applying the centre manifold theorem and bifurcation theorems, the occurrence conditions for flip bifurcation and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation as well as Turing instability are determined. Numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and reveal many interesting dynamic behaviours. The flip bifurcation and the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation both induce routes to chaos, on which we find period-doubling cascades, invariant curves, chaotic attractors, sub-Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, sub-flip bifurcation, chaotic interior crisis, sub-period-doubling cascade, periodic windows, sub-periodic windows, and various periodic behaviours. Moreover, the food chain system exhibits various self-organized patterns, including regular and irregular patterns of stripes, labyrinth, and spiral waves, suggesting the populations can coexist in space as many spatiotemporal structures. These analysis and results provide a new perspective into the complex dynamics of discrete food chain systems.																			0932-0784	1865-7109				NOV	2019	74	11					945	959		10.1515/zna-2019-0086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zna-2019-0086													WOS:000494940200001

The specimens were prepared by coating ZrO2 sol on etched Al foils and anodization in MPD-boric acid electrolytes at 30, 60, and 90 degrees C, respectively. Anodization potential was 700 V. The thickness of oxide layer anodized increased with increasing the electrolyte temperature. In contrast, the crystallization of ZrO2 and Al2O3 decreased at higher anodizing temperature. Compared with the specific capacitance of the sample anodized at 90 degrees C, the specific capacitances of which anodized at 30 and 60 degrees C are enhanced about 12.8 % and 8.8 %, respectively. Therefore, the anodization at 30 degrees C can effectively improve the specific capacitance of the samples, and save the thermal energy during anodization.

J	Zhang, LJ				Zhang, Lingjiang			Growth Rate Model for the Prediction of Crystal Polyhedrons	SCIENCE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS												A model aimed at precisely elaborating the quantitative relation between the relative growth rate of crystal faces and the shape of polyhedral crystals in cubic crystal system was firstly proposed, via investigating the section profiles left by (110) section cutting plane. By using this model, the relative growth rate conditions for all polyhedral crystals (14 kinds) that enclosed by low index crystal faces were successfully deduced, resulting in a R-{100}/{111}-R-{100}/{110} plot. In turn, these conclusions could be applied in crystallography research: (1) predict the crystal morphology if giving the relative growth rate of the crystal faces; (2) calculate the surface ratio of each crystal plane if giving the relative growth rate of the crystal faces; (3) calculate the relative growth rate of the crystal faces if knowing the polyhedron shape, and so on. Although this model focuses on low index crystal faces in cubic crystal system, the idea behind it is still applicable to polyhedral crystals that belong to high index faces and non-cubic systems.																			1947-2935	1947-2943				NOV	2019	11	11					1556	1566		10.1166/sam.2019.3518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/sam.2019.3518													WOS:000486578900007
J	Zhang, S; Huang, WJ				Zhang, Sheng; Huang, Wenjing			Application of a Propeller-Based Air Propulsion System to the Land-Based Holonomic Vehicle	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Holonomic vehicles with wheels such as ball wheels can move in any direction without rotating. For such a system, more driving motors and precise transmission mechanisms are necessary, which makes the control and fabrication complicated. This paper aims to present the design and construction of a novel holonomic mechanism to simplify the system. Air-based propulsion was applied to a land-based holonomic vehicle. A prototype with three roller balls was developed with a propeller for the propulsion of a triangular holonomic vehicle. Only two motors were applied, one for propeller rotation and the other for the adjustment of the angle of thrust. For the establishment of the methodology, the data, including propeller size, rotation per minute, velocity, thrust, efficiency, etc., were measured or calculated. The prototype can move at a velocity of approximate 0.558 m/s with an efficiency of 18.55%. Simulation results showed that with the increase of propulsion efficiency, the velocity can achieve more than 5 m/s if the efficiency is 70%. This study is the first attempt to apply air-based propulsion to a land-based holonomic vehicle. Further, the construction method is simple and can satisfy the accuracy requirement. This design method, therefore, will contribute to the application of holonomic vehicles due to the realization of holonomic functionality and simplicity.					zhang, sheng/AGP-1983-2022	zhang, sheng/0000-0001-5599-6261														2076-3417				NOV	2019	9	21							4657	10.3390/app9214657	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9214657													WOS:000498058600182

The model is developed upon a physical-based equivalent circuit and a set of closed-form formulas. Different current transport mechanisms including thermionic emission, tunneling, and carrier velocity saturation are counted by nonlinear resistances in the intrinsic model, while stray and substrate parasitic effects are also included in the parasitic model. A systematic procedure is built up to directly extract all the model parameters from measurements. The model is validated in 65- and 130-nm CMOS technology, and the modeled results show an excellent agreement with the measured data up to 67 GHz, which is the highest modeling frequency reported up till now.

A middle infrared ZnGeP2 optical parametric oscillator (ZGP-OPO) pumped by a Q-switched Ho:YAG laser is employed as the ultrasonic excitation source. The ZGP-OPO has a spectral range of 3.2?3.4 ?m. At an output wavelength of 3.4 ?m, the maximum average output power of ZGP-OPO is 3.05 W with a pulse width of 24.3 ns, corresponding to a peak power of approximately 127.5 kW. The ultrasound is generated by the laser converted from 3.2 to 3.4 ?m in the PEEK composite. The maximum ultrasonic signal amplitude in PEEK is 33 mV under the condition of thermoelastic excitation at 3.4 ?m. Ablation occurs in the CPRF sample when the energy fluence is over 122.45 mJ/cm(2). PEEK has a stronger absorption at 3.4 ?m and laser-ultrasound generation is influenced by the wavelength of the laser.

J	Zhang, YX; Zou, J; Shao, B				Zhang, Yuxia; Zou, Jian; Shao, Bin			No-Signaling-in-Time (NSIT) Condition for Energy	ENTROPY												In this paper, analogous to the no-signaling-in-time (NSIT) conditions, a series of equalities for the change of conditional and average energy of a quantum system are given to test macrorealism. These equalities are named no-signaling-in-time conditions for conditional energy (CNSIT) and no-signaling-in-time conditions for average energy (ANSIT), respectively. Then, we investigate the violations of the NSIT conditions, the CNSIT conditions and the ANSIT conditions for a qubit in the following scenarios: pure coherent dynamics, dynamics with drive, dynamics under dissipation and dephasing. For the pure qubit, when the NSIT conditions or the CNSIT conditions are not violated, the ANSIT conditions can not be violated, and a suitable conjunction of the CNSIT conditions and the NSIT conditions may be better for testing macrorealism. While for the driven qubit, the non-violation of the CNSIT conditions implies the non-violation of the NSIT conditions, which in turn implies the non-violation of the ANSIT conditions. For dephasing and dissipative qubits, the relationships among the NSIT conditions, the CNSIT conditions and the ANSIT conditions are similar to those of the pure and driven qubits, respectively. While the degree of violations of the NSIT conditions, the CNSIT conditions and the ANSIT conditions is decreased with the increasing time interval between measurements; and if this time interval tends to a very large number, all three kinds of conditions are satisfied.

J	Zhao, H				Zhao, Hanqing			Anisotropic thermalization propelled motor	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT												Brownian motors and Feymann ratchets have been intensively studied in the past decades due to their significance to the foundation of statistical physics. In this work, we propose a new type of Brownian motor, i.e. a self-driven motor that only utilizes the temperature differences inside and outside the motor. The motor is a container with asymmetric geometry. When filling gas, directional motion occurs when the temperature is different from the environment. This new mechanism is about the asymmetric geometry of the container, which induces anisotropic thermalization, and results in a density gradient and propels the motor. The directional motion ceases until the density gradient disappears as the inside temperature approaches the environment temperature. The same mechanism is also applied to design self-driven rotators. Additionally, possible experimental realizations are discussed.																			1742-5468					NOV	2019	2019	11							113207	10.1088/1742-5468/ab4986	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/ab4986													WOS:000499894600001
J	Zhao, HT; Jia, X; Watanabe, T				Zhao, Huatao; Jia, Xu; Watanabe, Takahiro			Router-Integrated Cache Hierarchy Design for Highly Parallel Computing in Efficient CMP Systems	ELECTRONICS												In current Chip Multi-Processor (CMP) systems, data sharing existing in cache hierarchy acts as a critical issue which costs plenty of clock cycles for maintaining data coherence. Along with the integrated core number increasing, the only shared cache serves too many processing threads to maintain sharing data efficiently. In this work, an enhanced router network is integrated within the private cache level for fast interconnecting sharing data accesses existing in different threads. All sharing data in private cache level can be classified into seven access types by experimental pattern analysis. Then, both shared accesses and thread-crossed accesses can be rapidly detected and dealt with in the proposed router network. As a result, the access latency of private cache is decreased, and a conventional coherence traffic problem is alleviated. The process in the proposed path is composed of three steps. Firstly, the target accesses can be detected by exploring in the router network. Then, the proposed replacement logic can handle those accesses for maintaining data coherence. Finally, those accesses are delivered in the proposed data deliverer. Thus, the harmful data sharing accesses are solved within the first chip layer in 3D-IC structure. The proposed system is also implemented into a cycle-precise simulation platform, and experimental results illustrate that our model can improve the Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) of on-chip execution by maximum 31.85 percent, while energy consumption can be saved by about 17.61 percent compared to the base system.																				2079-9292				NOV	2019	8	11							1363	10.3390/electronics8111363	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics8111363													WOS:000502269500159

Here, we demonstrate the change of intracellular Ca2+ release in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in vitro by femtosecond laser stimulation using confocal microscopy combined with special fluorescence probe Fluo-3/AM. The results showed that relative fluorescence intensity increased significantly after the axons of DRG neurons was performed with photostimulation.

The present work identifies an Er3+ doped micro-sized CSAO-CSO mixed material that exhibits both up-conversion and persistent luminescence. The cross-relaxation that occurs among Er3+ ions contributes to enhancing the up-conversion intensity. The Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped strategy was used to induce tunable up-conversion colors.

Effect of meter-range electromagnetic irradiation on the current-voltage characteristics of wide superconducting films	LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS												We experimentally studied the effect of meter-range electromagnetic field (tens of MHz) on the current-voltage characteristic (I-V curve) of a wide superconducting film. The vortex resistivity region is shown to significantly extend under the effect of meter-range (MR) electromagnetic irradiation owing to rapid suppression of critical current with a slower change in the upper boundary of stability of the vortex state. We found that as the MR irradiation power increases, the I-V curve structure related to phase slip lines is smoothed out to eventually vanish. A model of the film I-V curve in the adiabatic regime is proposed that explains the effect of blurring of voltage steps and suppression of critical current.

Two-frequency laser with distributed feedback formed by a space charge wave	OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS												The regimes of amplification and generation of optical TE waves arising on a grating formed by a space charge wave (SCW) in a plane optical waveguide based on an n-GaAs semiconductor are considered. For the perturbed n-GaAs waveguide, the reflectance and transmittance of TE modes with the same indices (m = n = 0) are calculated depending on the pump level and length of interaction between the optical and SCWs. It is shown that even with a relatively small depth of modulation of the dielectric constant (Delta epsilon approximate to 10-5) cm(-1)) and corresponding SCW-optical interaction length, there is a possibility of not only amplification, but also generation of forward and backward optical modes at a wavelength of 10.6 mu m.

This appears to arise from the two undergoing an ene reaction followed by a rearrangement analogous to a ketenimine-nitrile rearrangement. Computational studies indicate that mechanistic steps suggested for the latter require energies too large for the reaction to take place under the experimental conditions. Instead, a mechanism in which the ene reaction product is attacked by a second molecule of 1, followed by hydrogen transfer and decomposition, exhibits barriers lower than that for the ene reaction. The mechanism implies that the fragment of 1 in the observed product is not the one that underwent the ene reaction. The ene reaction barrier is rate-determining, and it is low enough to conform to the experimental conditions.

Relaxation and condensation kinetics of trapped excitons at ultra-low temperatures: numerical simulation	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS												This work is a theoretical study of the excitons relaxation dynamics in cuprous oxide at ultra-low temperatures and within a potential trap. Exciton-phonon collisions and exciton-exciton collisions have been included as relaxation processes. Special attention is given to the thermal distribution, cooling process and the condensation of the exciton gas with high number of excitons. It has been done by solving the Boltzmann equation numerically, using MATLAB. In this work, the relaxation behaviour has been analysed for the temperatures between 0.1 and 3 K. It has been found that for the temperatures above 0.1 K the local effective temperatures are coming down to the bath temperatures, i.e. the excitons reach the local equilibrium with the lattice, but for 0.1 K it does not happen. For 3 K, the global distributions do not change at all with time, but for 0.1 K this change is significant. Maybe this thermal loss of excitons for 0.1 K is related to the Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons. Interestingly, for the temperature of 0.1 K the condensate has been formed with sufficiently high number of excitons, for the times larger than 300 ns. Also, the results have been compared with the other theoretical results.

The "Planckonions"	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A												We consider a spherically symmetric stellar configuration with a density profile rho(r) = c(2)/8 pi Gr(2). This configuration satisfies the Schwarzchild black hole condition 2G M/c(2) R = 1 for every r = R. We refer to it as "Planckonion". The interesting thing about the Planckonion is that it has an onion-like structure. The central sphere with radius of the Planck-length L-p = root(2hG/c(3)) has one unit of the Planck mass M-p = root(ch/2G). Subsequent spherical shells of radial width L-p contain exactly one unit of M-p. We study this stellar configuration using Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and show that the equation is satisfied if pressure P(r) = -rho(r). On the geometrical side, the space component of the metric blows up at every point. The time component of the metric is zero inside the star but only in the sense of a distribution (generalized function). The Planckonions mimic some features of black holes but avoid appearance of central singularity because of the violation of null energy conditions.

Two dimensional electron gas in the δ-doped iridates with strong spin-orbit coupling: La<sub>δ</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER												Iridates are of considerable current interest because of the strong spin-orbit coupling that leads to a variety of new phenomena. Using density-functional studies, we predict the formation of a spin-orbital entangled two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the delta-doped iridate La delta Sr2IrO4, where a single SrO layer is replaced by a LaO layer. The extra La electron resides close to the delta-doped layer, partially occupying the J(eff) = 1/2 upper Hubbard band and thereby making the interface metallic. The magnetic structure of the bulk is destroyed near the interface, with the Ir-0 layer closest to the interface becoming non-magnetic, while the next layer (Ir-1) continues to maintain the AFM structure of the bulk, but with a reduced magnetic moment. The Fermi surface consists of a hole pocket and an electron pocket, located in two different Ir layers (Ir-0 and Ir-1), with both carriers derived from the J(eff) = 1/2 upper Hubbard band. The presence of both electrons and holes at the delta-doped interface suggests unusual transport properties, leading to possible device applications.

J	Brahimi, S; Bouzar, H; Lounis, S				Brahimi, Samy; Bouzar, Hamid; Lounis, Samir			Impact of single atomic defects and vacancies on the magnetic anisotropy energy of CoPt thin films	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER												The impact of surface vacancies and single adatoms on the magnetic properties of tetragonal L1(0) CoPt thin films is investigated from first principles. We consider Co and Fe single adatoms deposited on a Pt-terminated thin film while a Pt adatom is assumed to be supported by a Co-terminated film. The vacancy is injected in the top-surface layer of the films with both types of termination. After finding the most stable location of the defects, we discuss their magnetic properties tied to those of the substrate and investigate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Previous simulations (Brahimi et al 2016 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 28 496002) predicted a large out-of-plane surface MAE for the Pt-terminated CoPt films (4 meV per f.u.) in contrast to in-plane surface MAE for Co-terminated films (-1 meV per f.u.). Here, we find that the surface MAI:, is significantly modified upon the presence of the atomic defects. All investigated defects induce an in-plane MAE, which is large enough for Fe adatom and Pt vacancy to switch the surface MAE from out-of-plane to in-plane for the Pt-terminated films. Interestingly, among the investigated defects Pt vacancy has the largest effect on the MAE in contrast to Co vacancy, which induced the smallest but still significant effect. This behavior is explained in terms of the orbital moment anisotropy of the thin films.

Studying low-<i>x</i> structure function models with astrophysical tau neutrinos	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												Despite not have been yet identified by the IceCube detector, events generated from v z deep inelastic neutrino scattering in ice with varied topologies, such as double cascades (often called double bangs), lollipops, and sugardaddies, constitute a potential laboratory for low-x parton studies. Here we investigate these events, analyzing the effect of next-to-next-to-leading order parton distribution function in the total neutrino-nucleon cross section, as compared with the color dipole formalism, where saturation effects play a major role. Energy deposit profiles in the "bangs" are also analyzed in terms of virtual W-boson and tauon energy distributions and are found to be crucial in establishing a clear signal for gluon distribution determination at very small x. By taking the average (all flavor) neutrino flux (Phi(v) similar to E-v(-2.3)) into differential cross sections as a function of tau and W energies, we find significant deviations from pure Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi parton interactions for neutrino energies already at a few PeV. With these findings one aims at providing not only possible observables to be measured in large volume neutrino detectors in the near future, but also theoretical ways of unravelling QCD dynamics using unintegrated neutrino-nucleon cross sections in the ultrahigh-energy frontier.

The limit of the immiscibility of component elements under non-equilibrium conditions have been explored, but achieving complete miscibility and formation of single phase microstructures in eutectic alloys would be unprecedented. Here, we report that during the low-temperature ball milling that provides high energy impact, complete mixing of phases can occur in immiscible Ag-Cu eutectic alloys. From combined theoretical and experimental studies, we show that impact can produce solid solutions of Ag-Cu nanoparticles of eutectic composition. Our results show that phase diagrams of low dimensional materials under non-equilibrium conditions remain unexplored and could lead to new alloy microstructures drastically different from their bulk counterparts.

The growth of GaN was enhanced not only from bottom c-plane, but also from the sidewall of the micron-sized patterns. In this study, KOH solution was used to etch AlN (especially sidewall AlN) for the first time. The additional etching process is very simple. It was found that KOH etching 1 min did enhance the light output power (LOP) of LED. However, with the increase of etching time to 4 min, the LOP decreased.

For the purposes of this paper, a trajectory is a sequence of coordinates in a phase space defined by an underlying hidden dynamical system. Our work is inspired by earlier work on the use of KDE to detect shipping anomalies using high-density, high-quality automated information system data as well as our own earlier work in trajectory modeling. We focus specifically on the sparse, noisy trajectory reconstruction problem in which the data are (i) sparsely sampled and (ii) subject to an imperfect observer that introduces noise. Under certain regularity assumptions, we show that the constructed estimator minimizes a specific energy function defined over the trajectory as the number of samples obtained grows.

J	Mata, I				Mata, Ishan			Invariants of families of flat connections using fiber integration of differential characters	LETTERS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS												Let E -> B be a smooth vector bundle of rank n, and let P is an element of I-p(GL(n, R)) be a GL(n, R)-invariant polynomial of degree p compatible with a universal integral characteristic class u is an element of H-2p( BGL(n, R), Z). Cheeger-Simons theory associates a rigid invariant in H2p-1( B, R/Z) to any flat connection on this bundle. Generalizing this result, Jaya Iyer (Lett Math Phys 106 (1):131-146, 2016) constructed maps H-r(D( E)) -> H2p-r-1(B, R/Z) for p > r + 1. Here, D( E) is the simplicial abelian group whose group of r-simplices is freely generated by (r + 1)-tuples of relatively flat connections. In this article, we construct such maps for the cases p < r and p > r + 1 using fiber integration of differential characters. We find that for p > r + 1 case, the invariants constructed here coincide with those obtained by Jaya Iyer, and that in the p < r case the invariants are trivial. We further compare our construction with other results in the literature.																			0377-9017	1573-0530				APR	2020	110	4					639	657		10.1007/s11005-019-01234-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11005-019-01234-3		OCT 2019											WOS:000493261200001

A three-dimensional turbulence simulation is performed, based on the reduced fluid model. The background parallel flow is applied by introducing the time independent parallel momentum source. Changing the magnitude of the momentum source, the behavior of the zonal flow is investigated. The drift wave turbulence is affected by the parallel flow, and it shows the spatial competition between turbulence modes. The spatial competition appears/disappears abruptly, depending on the intensity of the parallel momentum source. As a consequence of the transition between the turbulence state, the radial profile of the turbulence drastically changes, which leads to the change of the turbulence force to drive the zonal flow. In this way, the parallel flow indirectly affects the zonal flow through the deformation of the turbulence.

Taghavi			Dependence of Energy Product to the Shell Thickness in FePt/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Core/Shell Nanoparticles	JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM												A new model is presented to calculate energy product variation for FePt/Fe3O4 core/shell in the terms of Fe3O4 shell thickness. The spins at the core/shell interface and some parts of the core volume have a random orientation due to the presence of chemical disorder created by the experimental procedures. The mentioned random effects based on the chemical disorder and intermixing of core and shell produces random interactions, which according to the presented model can behave similar to the spin glass system. Due to the existence of a competition between exchange and anisotropy energies, the coercivity field contain two parts: In the first part, the effects of exchange interactions will dominate the effects of anisotropy. As a result, this section will include low anisotropy and frustrated spins, which is coupled to neighbor particles due to the strong exchange interactions. In the second part, which is the volume part of matter, the anisotropy is higher; in this case, the spins are frozen and remain fixed so that the neighbor particles do not have much effect on them. Since the nanoscale particles have a significant value of surface to volume ratio, there will be a competition between these two parts. Energy product variations for FePt/Fe3O4 core/shell increases when coherent rotation is dominant in the core/shell system. By increasing shell thickness, coherent rotation of spins disappears and the magnetization rotation will not be uniform, which leads to a decrease in energy product. To increase the maximum product energy, we need to increase the value of coercivity which is achieved by increasing the core thickness. If we can increase the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant of the core, then the coercivity and thus the maximum energy product will increase.

Besides the ideal case of well-defined Landau levels with small broadening, the effects of resonance degradation due to big broadenings and big fluctuations of Fermi energy along the sample are demonstrated. The maximum values of light absorption coefficients and their resonance positions in magnetic field scale B-max were studied in a wide range of Fermi energies from 0 up to 400 meV at frequency THz of the incident beam. The calculation shows that B-max increases when Fermi energy grows, but there are regions of plateaus resulting in semiladder type of this dependence. The peak values of light absorption manifest a periodic-like dependence on Fermi energy with a huge change in value (in several orders), although the increase in average of maximum value of absorption with Fermi energy is also observed. The possibility to observe photoconductivity response due to photoinduced charge carriers by terahertz transitions between Landau levels is discussed.

J	Galvagno, M; Giribet, G				Galvagno, Mariano; Giribet, Gaston			Luis Santalo and classical field theory	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL H												Considered one of the founding fathers of integral geometry, Luis Santalo has contributed to various areas of mathematics. His work has applications in number theory, in the theory of differential equations, in stochastic geometry, in functional analysis, and also in theoretical physics. Between the 1950's and the 1970's, he wrote a series of papers on general relativity and on the attempts at generalizing Einstein's theory to formulate a unified field theory. His main contribution in this subject was to provide a classification theorem for the plethora of tensors that were populating Einstein's generalized theory. This paper revisits his work on theoretical physics.																			2102-6459	2102-6467				DEC 2	2019	44	4-5					381	389		10.1140/epjh/e2019-100038-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjh/e2019-100038-9		OCT 2019											WOS:000492555900001

Impact of pressure dissipation on fluid injection into layered aquifers	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS												Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and subsurface storage is one method for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change. It is well known that large-scale fluid injection into the subsurface leads to a buildup in pressure that gradually spreads and dissipates through lateral and vertical migration of water. This dissipation can have an important feedback on the shape of the CO2 plume during injection, but the impact of vertical pressure dissipation, in particular, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of lateral and vertical pressure dissipation on the injection of CO2 into a layered aquifer system. We develop a compressible, two-phase model that couples pressure dissipation to the propagation of a CO2 gravity current. We show that our vertically integrated, sharp-interface model is capable of efficiently and accurately capturing water migration in a layered aquifer system with an arbitrary number of aquifers. We identify two limiting cases - 'no leakage' and 'strong leakage' - in which we derive analytical expressions for the water pressure field for the corresponding single-phase injection problem. We demonstrate that pressure dissipation acts to suppress the formation of an advancing CO2 tongue during injection, reducing the lateral extent of the plume. The properties of the seals and the number of aquifers determine the strength of pressure dissipation and subsequent coupling with the CO2 plume. The impact of pressure dissipation on the shape of the CO2 plume is likely to be important for storage efficiency and security.

The effects of annealing the nanodots in the reducing/oxidizing atmosphere on the nanodot luminescence are investigated. Analysis of the effects together with low-temperature luminescent spectroscopy of the nanodots indicates a significant contribution of oxygen atoms to the formation of luminescence centers in the carbon nanodots studied. The temperature dependence of the degree of the photoinduced linear polarization of the emission of colloidal solutions of carbon nanodots was investigated. Increasing temperature is found to result in the depolarization of nanodot emission. The thermal effect on the polarization degree is well described by the Levshin-Perrin equation, which proves the rotational mechanism of the nanodot emission depolarization. By comparing the experimental data and the theory, the size of the rotating elementary emitters was estimated. The size obtained (similar to 0.9 nm) is appreciably less than the diameter of carbon nanodots under study (similar to 3 nm), which indicates that the atomic groups responsible for the luminescence of carbon nanodots are nonrigidly connected with their cores and can rotate almost independently of them.

The Fresnel coefficients of the interface between Chern insulator and chiral metamaterial, as well as the corresponding polarization rotation angles, are derived. The reflection characteristics of the linearly polarized incident wave at the interface, such as complete polarization conversion and change of polarization state, are discussed. Under the combined influence of Chern insulator and chiral metamaterial, the partial polarization conversion may be enhanced to the complete polarization conversion, and the chiral metamaterial may compensate for the suppression effect of longitudinal conductivity of Chern insulator on the polarization conversion.

J	de Matos, CJ; Tajmar, M				de Matos, Clovis Jacinto; Tajmar, Martin			Gravitational wave spectrometry with a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer in space	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY												The possibility to use a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer to carry out gravitational waves detection and spectrometry is investigated. The noise budget of the instrument is evaluated. The basic experimental requirements are calculated. It is shown that the power and wavelength of the heralded photon source, together with the angular accuracy of the measurement of the photon polarization rotation, form the main constraints to determine the type of gravitational waves sources, which would be the target of HOM gravitational wave spectrometers. The currently available pW power heralded photon sources, with typical heralded photon frequencies in the order of 10(14) Hz (visible-UV part of the optical spectrum) are totally unsuitable, in terms of required detection time for any of the GW sources, which are presently targeted by ground and space based GW detectors. The operation of the HOM interferometer as a GW spectrometer is illustrated with a numerical model that uses the gravitational wave strain data recorded by LIGO on 14 September 2015 (GW150914 event). Assuming an angular accuracy of mu rad for the measurement of photons polarization rotation, these measurements could only be carried out with HOM interferometer's arm lengths of the order of 10.000 km (only achievable in space, if we do not use optical cavities), and by using heralded photon sources of about 1 W power, producing heralded photons with wavelengths in the radio-wave band of the electromagnetic spectrum, 10 MHz. Although the technology to produce this type of heralded photon sources is currently not available, a brief discussion of the possible implementation of a large arm HOM interferometer in space is introduced.

Both Slater, Vosko, Wilks, and Nusair and B3LYP exchange-correlation (XC) functionals are employed in a two-stage density functional theory (DFT) calculations to generate these clusters. In the first stage, a minimum energy cluster structure is generated by an unbiased global search algorithm coupled with a DFT code using a light XC functional and small basis sets. In the second stage, the obtained cluster structure is further optimized by another round of global minimization search coupled with a DFT calculator using a heavier XC functional and more costly basis set. Electronic properties of the structures are illustrated in the form of a ternary diagram. Our DFT calculations find that the thermodynamic stability of the clusters increases with the increment in the number of constituent nickel atoms. These results provide a new insight to the structure, stability, chemical order, and electronic properties for the ternary alloy nanoclusters.

J	Li, XF; Zhang, Z				Li, Xiu-Fei; Zhang, Zhao			Roberge-Weiss transitions at different center symmetry breaking patterns in a Z<sub>3</sub>-QCD model	PHYSICAL REVIEW D												We study how the Roberge-Weiss (RW) transition depends on the pattern of center symmetry breaking using a Z(3)-QCD model. We adopt flavor-dependent quark imaginary chemical potentials, namely, (mu(u), mu(d), mu(s))/iT = (theta - 2 pi C/3, theta,theta + 2 pi C/3) with C is an element of [0, 1]. The RW periodicity is guaranteed and the center symmetry of Z(3)-QCD is explicitly broken when C not equal 1 and/or quark masses are nondegenerate. For N-f = 3 and C not equal 1, the RW transition occurs at theta = theta(RW) = (2k + 1)pi/3(k is an element of Z), which becomes stronger with decrease of C. When C = 1, the theta(RW) turns into 2k pi/3 for N-f = 2 + 1, but keeps (2k + 1)pi/3 for N-f = 1 + 2; in both cases, the RWtransitions get stronger with the mass mismatch. For other C not equal 0 cases, the theta(RW)'s are not integral multiples of pi/3. We find that the RWtransition is more sensitive to the deviation of C from one compared to the mass nondegeneracy, and thus the strength of the traditional RW transition with C = 0 is the strongest. The nature of RWend points and its implications to deconfinement transition are investigated.

A standard approach is to saturate the pore space with a fluid and perform NMR relaxation measurements. The standard measurements are sensitive to the low-lying diffusion eigenmodes and they allow an estimation of the pore size distribution. To obtain more complete information about the pore geometry including connectivity, it is necessary to determine the entire set of eigenmodes. Towards this goal, we present here a new approach to excite and detect higher eigenmodes that are not visible in standard relaxation measurements. The method is based on a two-dimensional pulse sequence that incorporates a pair of gradient pulses. The validity of our methodology was tested on a sample of bulk water that has an eigenmode spectrum that is known. We also demonstrate the detection of higher eigenmodes in a sandstone core that has a more complex geometry of the pore space and associated eigenmode spectrum.

Thus a simple iterative geometry-based interface-preserving reinitialization is proposed to reconstruct a signed distance function (SDF) while fixing the interface location with the combination of the external and internal iterations. The external iteration is used to restore the nature of the SDF. And the internal iteration firstly determines displacement errors of zero-level-set interpolation points via the geometric position of the interface, then the errors are redistributed iteratively to adjacent nodes until moving zero-level-set interpolation points are driven back to their original positions. The novel approach performs excellent mass conservation and shape preservation without sacrificing the simplicity of the iterative reinitialization. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are validated with typical stationary interface examples and well-known benchmark cases.

This weak interaction can be understood as the formation of host-guest species, for which the inherent electronic and optical properties of the [M@Au-8(PPh3)(8)] cluster along the series do not vary to a large extent. This demonstrates that, in [M@Au8Hgx(PPh3)(8)], each Hg can be considered an inclusion atom rather than a dopant element, where the parent cluster is able to act as a Lewis acid host.

These heterostructures were grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The compositional fluctuations and crystalline quality of pristine and implanted samples are measured by the high-resolution x-ray diffraction. The tricking asymmetric (10 - 15) GaN and InGaN peaks of omega - 2 theta and omega diffraction patterns are then resolved using reciprocal space mapping. The morphology of N ion implanted InGaN sample shows a decrease in density of the V-pits and hillocks with increasing N ion fluences. The atomic percentage of In, Ga and N are estimated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Raman studies showed the E-2 high and A(1) (LO) modes of GaN and InGaN for pristine and implanted samples which also confirm that the linear dependence of In composition with the N ion implantation fluences. The photoluminence results confirm the suppression of yellow luminescence peak after implantation. The Hall measurements confirm the enhancement in electron mobility after implantation which inevitably suppressed the carrier concentration with decreased nitrogen vacancies.

The two-section DBR lasers, consisting of a gain section and an unpumped Bragg reflector, display an output power above 0.6 W in continuous wave (CW) mode at room temperature. The anomalous spectral data is defined as a longitudinal mode which moves toward shorter wavelengths with increasing temperature or injection current, which is unexpected. Although the longer wavelength modes are expected to start lasing when raising device temperature or injection current, occasional mode hops to a shorter wavelength are seen. These anomalous mode transitions are explained by means of modal analysis. The thermal-induced change of the refractive index implied by an increase in the temperature or injection current yields nearly periodic transitions between cavity modes.

Finite difference time domain (3D-FDTD) numerical analysis is carried out to study the influence of engineered nanoparticles on the electrode transparency and resistivity performances. Our investigation demonstrates that metal nanoparticles are responsible for inducing plasmonic and light trapping effects, where their spatial arrangement, geometry and position in transparent conductive oxide (TCO) play a crucial role in modulating the electrode optical and electrical properties. Besides, an enhanced average transmittance and reduced sheet resistance over the conventional electrodes are recorded. Subsequently, a new hybrid modeling approach based on 3D-FDTD supported by genetic algorithm global optimization is proposed to identify the metal of nanoparticles and their spatial distribution, allowing an excellent trade-off between transparency and resistivity characteristics. Interestingly, the investigated electrode structure with optimized nanoparticles patterning showcases promising pathways for boosting the TCO performances, where it provides a high average figure of merit of 38x10(-3) ohm(-1). Therefore, this systematic investigation can provide more insights concerning the benefit of plasmonic effects for designing high-performance transparent electrodes suitable for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.

Jaswanth Kumar			The Effect of Functionalization on Spin-Polarized Transport of Gallium Nitride-Based Magnetic Tunnel Junctions	JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM												Using first-principles spin-polarized density functional theory computations, the effect of functionalization (fluorination and hydrogenation) on spin-polarized transport of gallium nitride (GaN) nanosheet-based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) with CrO2 as electrodes is investigated. The results show fluorinated GaN-based structure exhibits better spin filtration and high TMR (maximum similar to 99%), as compared with hydrogenated GaN (maximum TMR similar to 93%)- and pristine GaN (maximum TMR similar to 83%)-based structures. In addition, fluorinated GaN nanosheet exhibits a ferromagnetic behavior with a magnetic movement of 1.0 mu(b) per fluorine atom. The magnetic movements for pristine GaN and hydrogenated GaN sheets are reported to be 0 mu(b) and 0.9 mu(b) per hydrogen atom, respectively. Higher TMR, better spin filtration, and ferromagnetic behavior for fluorinated GaN-based structure open up its possibility as spin filter (injector) in MTJs and other spin-based devices.																			1557-1939	1557-1947				APR	2020	33	4					1053	1063		10.1007/s10948-019-05307-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10948-019-05307-1		OCT 2019											WOS:000494227700001
J	Mejía-Cortés, C; Cardona, JC; Sukhorukov, AA; Molina, M				Mejia-Cortes, Cristian; Carlos Cardona, Juan; Sukhorukov, Andrey A.; Molina, Mario			Nonlinear optical lattices with a void impurity	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												We examine a one-dimensional nonlinear (Kerr) waveguide array which contains a single "void" waveguide where the nonlinearity is identically zero. We uncover a family of nonlinear localized modes centered at or near the void, and their stability properties. Unlike a usual impurity problem, here the void acts like a repulsive impurity causing the center of the simplest mode to lie to the side of the void's position. We also compute the stability of extended nonlinear modes showing significant differences from the usual homogeneous nonlinear array. The transmission of a nonlinear pulse across the void shows three main regimes-transmission, reflection, and trapping at the void's position-and we identify a critical momentum for the pulse below (above) where the pulse gets reflected (transmitted), or trapped indefinitely at the void's position. For relatively wide pulses, we observe a steep increase from a regime of no transmission to a regime of high transmission, as the amplitude of the soliton increases beyond a critical wave-vector value. Finally, we consider the transmission of an extended nonlinear wave across the void impurity numerically, finding a rather complex structure of the transmission as a function of wave vector, with the creation of more and more transmission gaps as nonlinearity increases. The overall transmittance decreases and disappears eventually, where the boundaries separating passing from nonpassing regions are complex and fractal-like.

The new Trigger/GPS module for the extreme energy events project	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT												The Extreme Energy Event (EEE) project is an experiment devoted to the study of high energy Extensive Air Showers (EAS) over a very large area, using an array of muon telescopes. At present the array is composed of more than 50 stations, most of them distributed across the Italian territory, on a total area of around 3 x 10(5) km(2). The telescopes are based on position-sensitive Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs) whose readout strips are connected to two TDC (Time-to-Digital Converter) units. Here a novel VME trigger unit for the EEE telescopes is presented, which also includes an embedded GPS receiver for precision timing applications. This new unit gets together, in the same electronic board, the functionalities of different parts of the electronics used up to now in the EEE experiment, and adds new ones, making the whole readout system simpler, more flexible and robust. Details about the trigger/GPS unit, including some measurements of its time resolution, are reported here.

A novel synthetic diamond Cherenkov radiator for measuring space radiation	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT												The measurement of cosmic rays and Solar energetic particles in space is basic to our understanding of the Galaxy, the Sun, phenomena in the Heliosphere and the emerging field of space weather. For these reasons, cosmic ray instruments are common on both scientific spacecraft and operational spacecraft such as weather satellites. Cosmic rays (CRs) and Solar energetic particles (SEPs) include ions over the full range of elements found in the Solar System. High-resolution measurements of the energy spectra of space radiation are key to understanding both acceleration and propagation processes. An inherent challenge is the large range of energies of such spectra. Cosmic ray energies range up to over 10(21) eV, while SEPs can reach a few GeV. Multi-instrument measurements are currently required to cover the full range of particle energies. Indeed, the highest energy particles, due to the rarity, can only be measured with ground-based instruments using the atmosphere as a calorimeter. Over limited energy ranges, SEP spectra are often approximated by a power law; however, over the full energy range, SEP events exhibit changing spectral shapes (e.g. "knees", "roll-overs" and "cut-offs"). These features give information about the acceleration processes, such as size of the acceleration region, time of acceleration, morphology of the magnetic field during acceleration, and others, all of which can vary from event to event. Measurements of such features are often compromised by the need to combine measurements from more than one instrument, each with its own limited energy range. Even if there are no gaps between the energy intervals of the instruments, differing systematics can severely impact data analysis. A single instrument capable of measurements over a continuous and extended energy range would offer vastly more reliable measurement of the energy spectra of SEP events as well as replacing multiple instruments on resource-limited spacecraft. The most common method to measure GCRs and SEPs from a few to similar to 100 MeV for protons, is Si Solid-State Detector (SSD) stacks. Above these energies, Cherenkov detectors are typically used together with SSDs. Ideally, to provide full energy coverage with no gaps, this requires a Cherenkov radiator with a threshold of similar to 100 MeV. No suitable Cherenkov detector with such a low threshold has been developed. We are in the process of developing a synthetic diamond Cherenkov detector for this purpose. Diamond's high index of refraction (2.42) results in a theoretical threshold of 92 MeV for protons. Even with a practical threshold of similar to 110 MeV, this is ideal for extending the energy range from that of SSDs alone to that of sapphire Cherenkov detectors (202 MeV threshold) with higher energies attainable using plastic Cherenkov detectors. Both Sapphire and plastic Cherenkov radiators have spaceflight heritage.																			0168-9002	1872-9576				OCT 21	2019	942								162338	10.1016/j.nima.2019.162338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2019.162338													WOS:000480338100016

Operational properties of fine powder aerosol as radiation detection medium in gaseous proportional counters	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT												Due to its exceptional properties, He-3 proportional counters are the golden standard for neutron detection, particularly in homeland security applications where large area detectors are deployed. However, in recent years He-3 has become severely scarce, which led to a tremendous price increase and acquisition restrictions of this material. Motivated by this, the development of He-3-free solutions became a priority. In a previous work, we have established a novel concept for neutron detection: a proportional counter with boron carbide (B4C) fine powder suspended in the proportional gas, forming a neutron sensitive aerosol that relies on the B-10 neutron capture reaction. Computer simulations and prototype exposure to a cold neutron beam yielded favorable results, validating the detection concept, which may also be applied to hard x-ray and gamma ray detection by using fine particles made of a heavy element, such as Bi or Au. In this work we study the effect of the presence of B4C microparticles in the charge gain and energy resolution of a proportional counter filled with Ar-CH4 (90%-10%), by irradiation with x-rays from a Fe-55 source. For the same applied voltage, an average gain loss by a factor of 36% and energy resolution (FWHM) increase by 15% (absolute value) was observed with the inclusion of B-4 C microparticles. Intrinsic energy resolution was calculated, obtaining 15% for pure P10 operation and 32% in the presence of the microparticles. While the gain drop is recoverable by increasing anode voltage, energy resolution degradation may be a drawback in low energy applications, were energy resolution is favored over detection efficiency.

The beam polarization is measured using He-3 spin analysis, but this measurement does not account for the contribution of depolarization from spin-flip scattering primarily due to orthohydrogen in the bulk liquid. This is a systematic effect that dilutes the experimental asymmetry and is modeled using Monte Carlo.

Controlling the structure and mixing properties of anisotropic active particles with the direction of self-propulsion	SOFT MATTER												In the search for advanced materials active particles could offer unique structural and functional properties, with tunable time-dependent characteristics. We demonstrate here that the direction of self-propulsion, relative to the particle orientation, may be as influential for the phase behavior as the pair interactions are for passive particles, and enable dynamic properties that are not available to passive systems. We perform simulations on ensembles of self-propelled squares, and find that squares that self-propel in the direction perpendicular to a side rapidly reach a steady state with a characteristic cluster distribution, positional order, and well-defined diffusion constant. After tuning the direction towards a corner, the particles form large and dense clusters that show a transient collective motion, and display remarkable fluctuations over long time scales, with a distinct periodicity. Clusters of these particles appear unstable beyond a critical size, and susceptible to a catastrophic disintegration. Directionality is found to effect equally sharp transitions in the mixing properties of active squares and passive squares, and the behavior of the passive ensemble. We relate directionality to the collision dynamics and the resulting reaction network of clusters, evolved by a Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, to correlate propulsion direction to the observed phase behavior. Understanding this behavior could offer new design rules for programmable materials, and grant further insights in the dynamic processes that nature employs for self-assembly.					martin, robert/A-7127-2010														1744-683X	1744-6848				OCT 21	2019	15	39					7757	7764		10.1039/c9sm01120j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9sm01120j								31482905					WOS:000496486700002
J	Petersen, OL				Petersen, Oliver Lindblad			On the Cauchy Problem for the Linearised Einstein Equation	ANNALES HENRI POINCARE												A classical problem in general relativity is the Cauchy problem for the linearised Einstein equation (the initial value problem for gravitational waves) on a globally hyperbolic vacuum spacetime. A well-known result is that it is uniquely solvable up to gauge solutions, given initial data on a spacelike Cauchy hypersurface. The solution map is an isomorphism between initial data (modulo gauge producing initial data) and solutions (modulo gauge solutions). In the first part of this work, we show that the solution map is actually an isomorphism of locally convex topological vector spaces. This implies that the equivalence class of solutions depends continuously on the equivalence class of initial data. We may therefore conclude well-posedness of the Cauchy problem. In the second part, we show that the linearised constraint equations can always be solved on a closed manifold with vanishing scalar curvature. This generalises the classical notion of TT-tensors on flat space used to produce models of gravitational waves. All our results are proven for smooth and distributional initial data of arbitrary real Sobolev regularity.																			1424-0637	1424-0661				DEC	2019	20	12					3849	3888		10.1007/s00023-019-00857-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00023-019-00857-5		OCT 2019											WOS:000491829300001

UV excitation of iodide ions produced fully solvated electrons, as well as transient (I, e(-)) and (counterion, e(-)) pairs, the overall concentration of which was monitored by NIR absorption with subpicosecond time resolution. After the UV pulse, the solution absorbance decays almost completely in a few hundreds of picoseconds due to geminate electron-iodine atom recombination and a competitive annihilation channel involving the scavenger. Recombination of transient (I, e(-)) pairs follows the well-known kinetic model, while the electron-nitromethane reaction proceeds by two distinct mechanisms: static scavenging (interpreted in terms of the encounter complex model), with a characteristic time shorter than the temporal resolution of the apparatus, or via a diffusion-limited bimolecular reaction, with a rate constant of 1.1 x 10(11) M-1 s(-1).

J	Bali, R				Bali, Raj			The quasi-steady-state cosmology in a radiation-dominated phase	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A												Analytical solutions for radiation-dominated phase of Quasi-Steady-State Cosmology (QSSC) in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models are obtained. We find that matter density is positive in all the cases (k = 0,-1, 1). The nature of Hubble parameter (H) in [0, 2 pi] is discussed. The deceleration parameter (q) is marginally less than zero indicating accelerating universe. The scale factor (S) is graphically shown with time. The model represents oscillating universe between the above-mentioned limits. Because of the bounce in QSSC, the maximum density phase is still matter-dominated. The models represent singularity-free model. We also find that the models have event horizon i.e. no observer beyond the proper distance r(H) can communicate each other in FRW models for radiation-dominated phase in the frame work of QSSC. The FRW models are special classes of Bianchi type I, V, IX spacetimes with zero, negative and positive curvatures, respectively. Initially i.e. at tau = 0, the models represent steady model. We have tried to show how a good fit can be obtained to the observations in the framework of QSSC during radiation-dominated phase. The present model is free from singularity, particle horizon and provides a natural explanation for the flatness problem. Therefore, our model is superior to other models.

J	Bao, LP; Li, WY; Wu, LQ				Bao Li-Ping; Li Wen-Yan; Wu Li-Qun			Singularly perturbed solutions of a class of non-Fourier temperature field distribution	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												Thermoelastic coupling model excited by laser is of great significance in engineering. To study the thermoelastic coupling model, the distribution of temperature field must be determined firstly. Because the laser excitation time is short (usually femtosecond), the traditional Fourier heat conduction law is no longer suitable. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the distribution of temperature field by using the non-Fourier heat conduction law. Previous studies on the temperature field model mostly use numerical analysis and computer simulation to discuss its numerical solution, but few can directly solve the analytical solution of the model. Up to now, there are few reports about using singularly perturbed analysis method to solve the asymptotic solution of temperature field model and determine the jumping position of heat conductivity coefficient. In this paper, a temperature field model is constructed by using the non-Fourier heat conduction law, i.e. a class of singularly perturbed hyperbolic equations with small parameters in an unbounded domain. The nonlinear singularly perturbed two-parameter hyperbolic equations with discontinuous coefficients are obtained when the heat conduction coefficients jump due to sharp temperature changes. By using the singularly perturbed biparametric expansion method, the asymptotic solution of the problem is obtained. First, the expansion of the problem is obtained by using singularly perturbed method. The existence and uniqueness of the internal and external solutions are obtained by estimating the maximum modulus of the internal and external solutions and the maximum modulus estimates of the time derivatives, and the formal asymptotic expansion of the solutions is obtained. Secondly, the singularly perturbed hyperbolic equation is corrected by the singular perturbation theory, and the derivative of the solution is estimated. The position expression of the jump of the thermal conductivity coefficient is determined by the Fourier transform, and the seam method is used to connect the seams of the two sides of the jump position of the thermal conductivity coefficient, thus the form asymptotic expansion of the solution is obtained. Finally, the uniform validity of the asymptotic solution is obtained by estimating the residual term, and the distribution of the temperature field with discontinuous heat conduction coefficient is obtained. In this paper, we have synthetically applied the knowledge of ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, mathematical and physical equations, nonlinear acoustics, mathematical analysis, singular perturbation theory and so on, which enriched the study of non-Fourier temperature field model.																			1000-3290					OCT 20	2019	68	20							204401	10.7498/aps.68.20190144	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190144													WOS:000492303400019

J	He, TC; Li, J				He Tian-Chen; Li Ji			Measurement of gravity acceleration by cold atoms in a harmonic trap using Kapitza-Dirac pulses	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												The interferometry of two Kapitza-Dirac (KD) pulses acting on cold atoms in a harmonic oscillator potential well is investigated by Feynman path integral method. The wave function and density distribution function of the system at a given time are calculated analytically by using the propagator under the action of an external field. The first KD pulse acts on cold atoms to produce a large number of modes in the harmonic oscillator potential well. The maximum value of wave packet of mode 0 is larger than those of other modes. These modes evolve along different paths. The external field changes the phase of each mode and makes the evolution path of the mode deviate from that without the external field. When the second KD pulse is added, it splits the mode of the first KD pulse, and thus generates more modes. These modes will evolve along different paths under the action of external field and harmonic potential well, and interfere with each other. At the moment of measurement, all the wave packets are separated without overlapping. The effect of the external field does not change the magnitude of the density distribution at the time of measurement, but makes the wave packet of each mode shift. The phase difference between adjacent modes decreases linearly with the increase of field intensity. When the external field is a gravity field, we calculate the Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao lower bound. The Fisher information is proportional to the mass of atoms and inversely to the third power of harmonic potential well frequency. We can improve the measurement accuracy of interferometer by reducing the frequency of harmonic potential well and increasing atomic mass. When the initial state is the ground state of the harmonic potential well, the accuracy of the gravity acceleration measured by the interference device can be obtained to be 10(-9) by using the experimental parameters. The initial state is the ground state of the harmonic potential well and the external field, and the calculation result indicates that the measurement accuracy will decrease. At the same time, the enhancement of inter-atomic repulsion and attraction interaction will also lead the measurement accuracy to increase.																			1000-3290					OCT 20	2019	68	20							203701	10.7498/aps.68.20190749	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190749													WOS:000492303400009

Chiral edge states in (2+1)-dimensional topological phases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A												Chiral edge states of (2 + 1)-dimensional Abelian and non-Abelian topological phases can be represented by chiral conformal field theories with integer and noninteger values of central charge, respectively. In this work we describe certain edge states in terms of constrained fermionic fields that realize chiral coset CFT structures. This construction arises naturally in the so-called quantum wires approach for topological phases and allows for representing fractionalized edge states directly in terms of fermionic degrees of freedom. At the same time, the constrained fermions description introduces some subtleties concerning gauge anomalies since it involves the coupling of chiral fermions to gauge fields. We describe in this paper how to handle these issues.																			0217-751X	1793-656X				OCT 20	2019	34	29							1950171	10.1142/S0217751X19501719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X19501719													WOS:000492838300007

However, it usually needs synthesizing through a complicated multistep process involving high temperature (e.g., 1350 degrees C), severe reduction (e.g., 700-1300 C for up to 240 h in Ca or Ti metal vapor atmosphere) and post-purification. Owing to the H2O sensitivity of mayenite, the post-purification is quite troublesome once impurities are introduced. High-density, loosely bound encaged electrons with a low work function make it promise to possess practical applications. Therefore the facile method of massively producing the high-quality C12A7:e- with high Ne is extremely desired. In this work, C12A7:e- bulks are for the first time synthesized by simple spark plasma sintering process directly from a mixture of C12A7, CA and Ca powders under milder conditions (e.g., sintered at 1070 C for 10 min in a vacuum). The obtained electride, which exhibits a relative density of 99%, an electron concentration of 2.3x 1021 cm-3 and an obvious absorption peak at 2.5 eV, is obtained via SPS process at 1100 C for 10 min. Electronic structure is also investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance. The occurrence of Dysonian characteristic, a typical feature of good electronic conductors, strongly suggests that the electrons are trapped in mayenite cavities. Furthermore, the obtained C12A7:e- exhibits good sinterabilty on a crystal scale of 5-40 um. Thermionic emission test results show that the thermionic emission begins to occur at 700 K and a large current density of 1.75 A/cm2 is obtained in the electron thermal emission from a flat surface of the polycrystalline C12A7:e- with an effective work function of 2.09 eV for a temperature of 1373 K with an applied electric field of 35000 V/cm in a vacuum. Owing to no external reductant is needed, this developed route exhibits notable superiority over the conventional reduction method for phase-pure C12A7:e-. Therefore, these results not only suggest a novel precursor for fabricating mayenite electride but also make it possible to produce efficiently the electride in large volume.

J	Liang, JL; Zhang, Y; Qiu, XY; Wu, SY; Luo, Y				Liang Jin-Ling; Zhang Yun; Qiu Xiao-Yan; Wu Sheng-Yu; Luo Ya			First-principles study of Fe:Mg:LiTaO<sub>3</sub> crystals	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												The electronic structures and absorption spectra of LiTaO3 (LT) crystal and Fe:Mg:LiTaO3 crystal with different Mg concentrations are investigated by first-principles through using the density functional theory. The supercell crystal structures are established with 60 atoms with four models: the near-stoichiometric pure LiTaO3 crystal (LT); the iron doped LiTaO3 crystal (Fe:LT), with the charge compensation model expressed as Fe-Li(2+)-2V(Li)(-); the iron and magnesium co-doped LiTaO3 crystal (Fe:Mg:LT), with the charge compensation model taken as Fe-Li(2+)-Mg-Li+-3V(Li)(-); the other iron and magnesium co-doped LiTaO3 crystal (Fe:Mg(E):LT), with Mg ion concentration near threshold value (slightly less than 6 mol%) and taking the charge compensation model as 2Mg(Li)(+)-FeTa2-. The geometry optimization results show that the total energy values of all models can achieve certain stable values, which means that the models used in this paper are very close to the actual crystal structures. In the electronic structures, the extrinsic defect energy levels in the forbidden band of Fe:LT crystal are mainly contributed from the Fe 3d orbital, and the band gap of Fe:LT about 3.05 eV is narrower than that of LT, the band gap of Fe:Mg:LT and Fe:Mg(E):LT sample are 2.72 eV and 2.45 eV respectively. The results show that the orbit of Fe 3d, Ta 5d and O 2p are superposed with each other, forming covalent bonds, which results in conduction band and valence band shifting toward low energy in iron doped LiTaO3 crystal. The Fe 3d orbit is split into E-g orbit and T-2g orbit under the influence of the crystal field. There are two absorption peaks at 417 nm (2.97 eV) and 745 nm (1.66 eV) in the Fe:LiTaO3 crystal. The first one is attributed to the transfer of the T-2g orbital electron to conduction band. The last one can be taken as the result of E-g electron transfer of Fe2+ in crystal. The intensities and positions of these peaks vary with the concentration of Mg ion. Specially, with the concentration of Mg ion attaining the threshold value, the peak at 745 nm disappears, and the other peak moves slightly to 457 nm (2.71 eV). With the Mg ion concentration at the threshold value, the Fe ions can occupy Ta positions. This occupying condition makes the E-g orbital energy change greatly compared with the scenario in the Fe-Li condition, and it affects hardly the T-2g orbital energy. So, if the absorption nearby 745 nm waveband can be taken as the useful process in holographic storage application, it is better to take smaller concentration of Mg ions (less than threshold value). On the other hand, nearby 457 nm waveband, concentration of Mg ions can be chosen as a large value.

Based on the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) method, THz absorption characteristics of Ti disk arrays with different structure parameters in micro-bridge structure arrays are studied. Periodic disk array structure reduces the surface plasmon frequency of Ti, excites the spoof surface plasmons in the THz band and leads to resonance enhanced absorption. The resonance absorption frequency is determined by the structural parameters of Ti disk array including period and diameter while the absorption rate of THz wave is greatly affected by the thickness of Ti disks. The resonant cavity in micro-bridge structure can reduce the resonance frequency and enhance the coupling efficiency. The micro-bridge structure designed in this paper breaks the diffraction limit and traps the THz wave with a small period (37 mu m). An absorption of nearly 90% is achieved at 3.5 THz. The structure meets the requirements of small size, high absorption and good process compatibility of the THz microbolometer.																			1000-3290					OCT 20	2019	68	20							208501	10.7498/aps.68.20190902	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190902													WOS:000492303400033

J	Wang, RX; Li, X; Li, L; Xiao, YC; Xu, SW				Wang Ri-Xing; Li Xue; Li Lian; Xiao Yun-Chang; Xu Si-Wei			Stability analysis in three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												Spin-transfer torque-based magnetic random access memory is becoming more and more attractive in industry due to its non-volatility, fast switching speed and infinite endurance. However, it suffers energy and speed bottlenecks, so the magnetic tunnel junction urgently needs a new write scheme. Compared with the spintransfer torque, emerging spin-orbit torque will replace spin-transfer torque as a new write scheme of magnetic storage technology for its faster writing speed and avoiding the barrier breakdown. A three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction consists of magnetic tunnel junction/heavy metal structure offers a promising perspective from a technological point of view in the design of new generation of magnetic random access memory, for it is possible to control the magnetization dynamics through two current densities of spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque. In this paper, the stability of magnetic states in the three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction is studied theoretically. Through linearizing the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation including the spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque defined in the spherical coordinates, the new equilibrium directions and linear differential equations are obtained. Performing linear stability analysis of the new equilibrium directions, the phase diagrams defined by the direction of pinned-layer magnetization vector and the current density of spin-orbit torque are obtained. Several magnetic states are distinguished in the phase diagram, such as in-plane precessional and stable states, out-of-plane precessional and stable states. When the pinned-layer magnetization vector rotates out of the film plane, through adjusting the direction of pinned-layer magnetization vector, the switching from stable state to precessional one can be realized. Orientating the pinned-layer magnetization vector in the film plane, neither the out-of-plane precession nor stable states emerges for the current density of spin-orbit torque and spin-transfer torque are relatively small. The instability current takes a minimum value with the pinned-layer magnetization vector nearly parallel or antiparallel to the easy axis of free layer and increases with the direction of pinned-layer magnetization vector deviating from these two locations. The magnetization reversal can be realized through adjusting the current density of spin-transfer torque, and the reversal time can decrease greatly under the assisting of spin-orbit torque. By showing the dependence of magnetization vector on the time of different magnetic states, the validity of phase diagram is confirmed. The selecting of the different directions of the pinned-layer magnetization vector provides an alternative way to control the current-driven magnetization dynamics. This will provide useful guide for the application of threeterminal magnetic tunnel junction.																			1000-3290					OCT 20	2019	68	20							207201	10.7498/aps.68.20190927	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190927													WOS:000492303400028
J	Ye, HF; Jin, D; Kuang, B; Yang, YH				Ye Huan-Feng; Jin Di; Kuang Bo; Yang Yan-Hua			Effect of equilibrium distribution positivity on numerical performance of lattice Boltzmann method	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												Traditionally, the numerical performance of the lattice Boltzmann method is mainly determined by the moment degree of a discrete equilibrium distribution. The equilibrium distribution positivity is merely considered as an ancillary property which is used to constrict the numerical configuration. With the newly-developed partial Gaussian-Hermite quadrature scheme, the positivity of equilibrium distribution is validated as an independent property like moment degree which can be adjusted by discrete velocities. Researchers speculated that the positivity should also be significant for the numerical performance by the lattice Boltzmann method and can be used to improve the performance. Comparing with the classical improvement through moment degree, the positivity approach will not bring additional computation. However, due to the lack of boundary treatment, the speculation has not been validated by detailed numerical simulations. In this paper, through employing a periodic case, the Taylor-Green vortex, to avoid the boundary issue, we in depth analyze the numerical effect of the model positivity, including the numerical accuracy in the model positive range, the influence of positivity on the numerical performance, and the significance comparison between positivity and moment degree. The results show that for a given model, the numerical accuracy is not consistent in the whole positive range. As the configuration is close to the border of positive range, the accuracy will degrade though it is still acceptable. The numerical performance of a model depends on both moment degree and positivity. The role that the moment degree plays lies mainly in the qualification of a model on Galilean invariance. Once a model fulfills the Galilean invariance, its numerical performance is solely dependent on the positivity. Hence, the improvement approach through modifying the model positivity is a viable solution, and a Galilean invariant model with wider positive range does possess a better numerical performance regardless of its moment degree. Furthermore, based on the numerical results in this paper, all DnHm models with high moment degree are better than the classical D2Q9 model. Of the above models, the D2H3-2 model has the best performance and deserves to be further studied																			1000-3290					OCT 20	2019	68	20							204701	10.7498/aps.68.20190624	http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.68.20190624													WOS:000492303400020

J	Zhang, XD; Chu, YX; Jia, W; Hu, ML				Zhang Xu-Dong; Chu Yu-Xi; Jia Wei; Hu Ming-Lie			Ultraviolet picosecond conversion efficiency improvement system at 355 nm based on fundamental frequency laser amplified	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												In recent years, picosecond laser in ultraviolet (UV) has manifested great importance for applications both in science and industry, such as biomedical research, micro machining, etc. Now, the well proven approach to generating ultra-short UV pulses is extra-cavity frequency conversion based on nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal, due to the lack of suitable laser sources directly generating UV laser. In this process of harmonic generation, the length of nonlinear crystal is an important factor affecting the conversion efficiency and beam-quality. The optimal length of the nonlinear crystal is influenced by incident laser parameters and crystal absorption coefficient. At present, for the UV 355 nm picosecond laser generated from extra-cavity sum frequency, published are few reports about detailed analysis and research on the influence of photon ratio of the incident laser beams and nonlinear crystal absorption on optimal length of sum frequency crystal. In this paper, the steady-state solutions with the highest conversion efficiency under different incident conditions are obtained by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of the three waves coupling equations. The effects of different photon ratios and absorption effect of the sum frequency crystal on the optimum crystal length are analyzed. We propose a solution based on the fundamental frequency laser amplified to shorten crystal length and improve conversion efficiency. In this scheme, the 532 nm second harmonic laser with a high conversion efficiency over 65% can be achieved by LiB3O5 crystal. After that, the 1064 nm fundamental frequency laser is separated from the second harmonic laser, and then it is amplified by the Nd:YVO4 laser crystal pumped by an 808 nm laser diode. Finally, the ultraviolet 355 nm picosecond laser is obtained by combining the 1064 nm fundamental frequency laser with the 532 nm second harmonic laser in the LiB3O5 crystal. The simulation results show that the incident photon ratio of the sum frequency reaction can be changed by amplifying the residual fundamental frequency laser, and the optimum length of the sum-frequency crystal corresponding to the highest conversion efficiency can be shortened. Meanwhile, the absorption and walk-away effect of the sum frequency crystal can be also reduced. The final 355 nm laser output power can be increased more than 40 percent compared with the traditional scheme of early reports. In consequence, the high sum frequency conversion efficiency of the UV 355 nm picosecond laser can be obtained by changing the photo ratio of the incident laser beams through amplifying the fundamental frequency laser.

J	Zhou, GZ; Li, Y; Lan, T; Dai, JJ; Wang, CO; Wang, ZY				Zhou Guang-Zheng; Li Ying; Lan Tian; Dai Jing-Jing; Wang Cong-Con; Wang Zhi-Yong			Design and simulation of integration of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers and heterojunction bipolar transistor	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are widely used in the field of short-range optical communication and optical interconnection because of their advantages such as low threshold current, large modulation bandwidth, easy two-dimensional integration, easy coupling with optical fibers and low cost. The VCSELs and heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) are longitudinal current devices, so they can be well integrated on the same wafer, and the output light power can be modulated by the HBT base current. Integration of VCSELs and HBT are designed in this paper. The VCSELs and PNP InGaP/GaAs HBT form a direct series structure. The reflectivity of DBR is 99.72% at a resonant wavelength of 850 nm and 99.57% after adding HBT separately. Therefore, the addition of HBT has little influence on the reflectivity of DBR at the resonant wavelength. The electro-optical characteristics of the integrated structure are simulated by using PICS3D software. An interim collector is added into the model in order to ensure that the simulation can be carried out smoothly. Firstly, HBT is conducted and the current flows from the emitter to the interim collector. Then, the voltage across the interim collector and the N-type electrode is increased to make VCSELs conducted and the current of the transition collector drop to zero. The interim collector can be removed from the actual structure because the current is zero. The simulation results show that the current gain coefficient is 400, and the maximum modulation rate of the base current to the output light power rises up to 280 mW/mA. The maximum temperature in the active region increases with the base current increasing, and the output light power first increases and then tends to be saturated. The ac optical gain characteristics of the integrated structure is simulated by PICS3D, and the simulation result shows that cutoff frequency exceeds 1 GHz. The addition of HBT limits the modulation rate of the integrated structure, and further optimization of HBT structure parameters and geometric dimension are needed to improve the modulation rate. The integrated structure and simulation method established in this paper can also be used to integrate LED, LD, DFB or other luminescent devices with HBT.

The phase composition, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of (1 - x) Li2Zn3Ti4O12-x CaTiO3 (x = 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 wt%) ceramics were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDS and network analyzer. The XRD and EDS results indicated that the ceramics involved Li2Zn3Ti4O12 and CaTiO3 phases. The SEM micrographs shown that as the CaTiO3 contents increased, the average grain size of the composition ceramics decreased. The microwave dielectric properties of the composition ceramics can be effectively controlled by varying the CaTiO3 contents. The values of dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and tau(f) of the composition ceramics were increased, and the quality factor (Q x f) was decreased with increasing the CaTiO3 contents. Typically, a new temperature stable microwave dielectric material of 0.94 Li2Zn3Ti4O12-0.06 CaTiO3 with excellent microwave dielectric properties of epsilon(r) = 21.7, Q x f = 61,490 GHz, and tau(f) = + 2.68 ppm/degrees C was attained when sintered at 1175 degrees C for 4 h.																			0957-4522	1573-482X				NOV	2019	30	22					20160	20165		10.1007/s10854-019-02391-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10854-019-02391-w		OCT 2019											WOS:000491605200006

J	Khanpour, M				Khanpour, Mehrdad			Variants of the optimised random phase approximation: from one direct correlation function to many different radial distribution functions	MOLECULAR PHYSICS												It is shown that there are an infinite number of radial distribution functions (RDFs), corresponding to only one direct correlation function (DCF) of the optimised random phase approximation (ORPA). This observation in the thermodynamic perturbation theory is in sharp contrast to that of integral equation theories in which they uniquely correspond. By devising a new method we will be able to introduce various perturbation theories of simple liquids all coming from one DCF. Among all, we will only present analytically seven variants of the ORPA in the thermodynamic perturbation theory of liquids. The DCF of hard-core potential for all variants is assumed to be the same as the ORPA. However, interestingly enough the resulted expressions for the Helmholtz free energies and the RDF are obtained very differently. Furthermore, the resulted thermodynamic properties come out somehow the same, whereas the structural functions of some variants are found to behave much better than the standard ORPA.

Variable reactivity and phase separation in patchy particle systems	MOLECULAR PHYSICS					10th Liblice Conference on the Statistical Mechanics of Liquids (LIBLICE)	JUN 17-22, 2018	Srni, CZECH REPUBLIC					Using statistical model, we study mechanisms of phase separation in a solution consisting of patchy particles, which are capable to form directed and saturated thermoreversible bonds. We focus on the impact of variable reactivity of patchy particles on the form of miscibility gap. We show that the variation of model parameters determining features of interparticle interaction makes it possible to obtain miscibility gaps of different types within the unified formalism. In particular, we uncover two different mechanisms of the formation of phase separation curves with lower critical solution temperature. The first mechanism is realised in the case of positive bonding energy; the second one can takes place when the energy of formation of two-bonded particles is lower than that for all other m-bonded ones. We conclude that the most interesting and non-trivial phase behavior is observed in the case of patchy particles with variable reactivity. Using rigorous statistical model, we uncover new mechanisms of phase separation in a solution consisting of patchy particles, which are capable to form directed and saturated thermoreversible bonds. This topic corresponds to state of the art in modern chemical physics. The results obtained shed light on interplay between features of non-isotropic interactions and phase behavior in both molecular and nanoparticle systems. We conclude that the most interesting and non-trivial phase behavior is observed in the case of patchy particles with variable reactivity.

The structure and chemical composition of the ferrites were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The presence of peaks in the XRD patterns was confirmed by the formation of a cubic spinel structure, because the main peaks of the patterns were related to the single-phase cubic spinel structure with PDF-number of 008-0234. The XRD patterns showed a slight shifting in peaks position due to unstable spacing values with increasing Mg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ contents in all ferrites. The mean crystallite size and lattice constant were determined from the Scherer's formula and XRD data. They were found to have been increased by the increase of x concentration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images were used to analyze the ferrites' structures. In addition, room temperature magnetization and coercivity of ferrites were determined from the hysteresis loops in a magnetic field of 9 kOe by alternative gradient force magnetometer. It was found that the magnetization and coercivity of ferrites with increasing x contents were increased, which is discussed according to the site's occupation of the substituted cations on the sub-lattices. Among all synthesized ferrites, Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.8 showed the highest magnetization and coercively, whereas Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.0 displayed the lowest corresponding values. The initial permeability of ferrites as a function of frequency were measured over a frequency range of 10 kHz to 10 MHz. In all curves, the initial permeability remained almost constant during increasing frequency until similar to 1 MH,z and then it fell rapidly. This constant trend of the initial permeability shows the high operating frequency of the ferrites.																			0361-5235	1543-186X				FEB	2020	49	2					1104	1109		10.1007/s11664-019-07725-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11664-019-07725-2		OCT 2019											WOS:000491399000002

In this paper, we propose a plasmonic nanoantenna with PT-symmetric potential for unidirectional scattering functionality. The studied plasmonic nanoantenna is comprised of three metallic layers separated by two dielectric layers. Such kind of system, with the same coefficient kappa of loss and gain in each of the two dielectric layers, holds the characteristic of PT symmetry. We show that the unidirectional scattering is obtained for the passive structure (i.e., kappa = 0), and the switching between forward and backward directionality can be achieved with a single structure by changing the excitation wavelength, when the induced electric dipole (ED) and magnetic dipole (MD) modes satisfy the first or second Kerker conditions, respectively. In addition, we find that the forward-to-backward ratio spectra can be strongly affected by the non-Hermiticity parameter kappa. In particular, it is possible to reverse the radiation direction at the same wavelength in a wide spectra band by adjusting kappa. Moreover, putting the nanoantennas in an array of transverse configuration can efficiently narrow the main lobe angular beam width to be <6 degrees. These results contribute to the basic understanding of the optical properties of active-passive finite nanostructures with potential applications, and provide new ideas for the design of novel nanostructures displaying asymmetric and tunable responses.

It is shown that the absorption probability may exceed relative populations of excited levels in divertor plasma by several orders of magnitude.

From the analysis results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Hall-effect measurement, the amorphous GeSn film starts to crystallize at 450 degrees C while the crystallinity enhances at 500 degrees C by employing rapid thermal annealing (RTA) as the film crystallization process. With capping layer on the whole region, the hole concentration becomes too high to turn the JL P-TFTs off. However, by limiting capping layer on source/drain region to increase hole concentration, total series resistance is reduced due to lower sheet resistance and contact resistance, which consequently improves the drive current, I-ON/I-OFF ratio and field-effect mobility. Based on the best process conditions and structure to form the poly-GeSn JL P-TFTs, I-ON/I-OFF ratio up to 5.6 x 10(2) are achieved while peak field-effect mobility of 20.8 cm(2)/Vs is obtained. Moreover, the low thermal budget process of 500 degrees C for 30 sec enables next-generation monolithic 3D-ICs. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Cotter, J; Guldiken, R				Cotter, John; Guldiken, Rasim			Vertical manipulation of fluids through electrostatic formation: model development and experimental validation	MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS												A novel actuation method, called electrostatic formation (ESF), for MEMS and other applications, is introduced. The ESF mechanism uses a droplet of liquid material that is electrostatically deformed. ESF differs from Electrowetting and Electrowetting on Dielectric as the electrode used to apply the voltage is of a smaller diameter than the droplet being manipulated, and the electrode is located above the manipulated fluid. Modeling this movement requires adherence to the Lippmann and Young-Laplace equations simultaneously. In order to understand how the surface tension is specifically manipulated, as is required for the development of a model of representation of the phenomenon, a force-based interpretation of the Lippmann equation is outlined, with focus on how it compares to the force response provided by hydrostatic pressure under the influence of gravitational field forces. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a differential surface charge must be present of which the formulation is complex in nature, likely stemming from the combination of the internal pressure and a localized skin effect caused by an electric double layer that is present at the surface of the transformed liquid. In this study, a target liquid of gallium is manipulated under electrostatic charge in a physical experiment and compared against the geometry suggested by the developed model. By utilizing the assumptions highlighted in this article, a coefficient of variance (R-2) of 0.907 was calculated between the measurements and model. This coefficient of variance was improved to 0.915 through the introduction of varied electrostatic and internal pressure terms.

The R2PICD spectrum of PhOH-(-)BOH exhibits nonzero ICD bands near the absorption region of bare PhOH, where (-)BOH is transparent. Two different conformers containing a single hydrogen bond between PhOH and (-)BOH are identified using ultraviolet-ultraviolet hole-burning and infrared ion-dip spectroscopy combined with quantum theoretical calculations. The ICD values of the two conformers are similar to each other. To understand these similar ICD effects of the conformers, the geometrical asymmetry of the PhOH moiety bound to (-)BOH and the coupling strength of the electric transition dipole moments between PhOH and (-)BOH are estimated. Comparing the ICD values of PhOH (-)BOH with those of PhOH-(-)-L-methyl lactate in the previous report [Hong, A.; et al. J. Phys. Chem.

Geometrical matching and its influence on the melting transition of confined vortices in a mesoscopic triangle of Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+<i>y</i></sub> superconductor	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												To study the melting transition of a vortex crystal (or cluster) consisting of a small number of vortices confined in a mesoscopic-scale superconductor, c-axis magnetoresistance in the highly anisotropic high-T-c superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+y (Bi2212) has been measured using a triangle-shaped stack of intrinsic Josephson junctions, which was trimmed out from a single-crystal flake of Bi2212 via a double-sided etching process using a focused ion beam. We observed oscillations of the melting transition line, in which the oscillating part of the melting temperature has sharp peaks when the number of vortices N exactly coincides with the triangular number n(n + 1)/2 (n is an integer number), at least for N < 50. This is in contrast to the case of square shapes where the enhancements appeared as broad peaks around N = n(2). Furthermore, the field ranges of the N-vortex state expand at the triangular numbers of N, suggesting that the triangular number of vortices has a more stable configuration than the others. Numerical studies on the configuration of vortices in a triangle shape show that geometrical matching with no defect structures is realized at the triangular numbers, whereas an edge dislocation often appears in the other nonmatching cases.

We review the standard form of the Mathieu equation, d(2)u/d theta(2) + (delta + epsilon . cos 2 theta)u = 0, and propose a modification of the method of multiple scales (i.e., a perturbation method) so that the asymptotic analytical solutions of the Mathieu equation can be computed in the stable and unstable regions for both delta >= 0 and delta < 0. This method was applied to the nonlinear transverse oscillation equations for a cyclotron. Analytical solutions for transverse oscillation in the stable and unstable regions (i.e., vicinity of the resonances) were obtained, and the accuracy of these analytical solutions was confirmed by their close agreement with the direct numerical integration. Useful results such as the analytical solution of the transverse oscillation frequency, increasing rate of the amplitude in unstable regions, and the resonance width were also derived; the stable condition and driving terms of the resonances can be obtained from the analytical solutions.

A half-life limit for the quadruple beta decay to the 0(1)(+) state of Gd-150 was found to be T-1/2 (0 nu + 4 nu) > 8.7 x 10(20) yr (90% C.L.).

The as-prepared azo-Cn exhibited a good reversible redox process and possessed a specific capacitance as high as 221.0 F g(-1) at 10 mV s(-1). However, with the value n increased from 8 to 16, the specific capacitances of azo-Cn electrode materials decreased. In order to study the reasons, the effect of surface amphiphilic property of azobenzene self-assembled electrode materials on the properties of supercapacitors was studied and the results showed that the capacitive behaviors of azo-Cn could be greatly improved by better surface hydrophilic properties and azo-C8 with good supercapacitive characteristics could be the potential ideal electrode materials for low-cost and high-efficiency electrochemical supercapacitors.

Analysis of the inorganic impurities after refining TMIn shows that the total impurity is lower than 530 mu g/L by ICP-AES. In the FT-NMR of detective organic chemical bonding of "(CH3)(3)In" peak is observed with no defective organic structure of bonding.

Conservative interpolation on surface interfaces for transport problems in the Finite Volume Method	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS												This paper presents a new strategy to couple non-matching interfaces in the Finite Volume Method based on a conservative interpolation. In contrast to most of the conservative methods, the current approach does not modify the mesh and therefore, the connection between variables at both sides of the interfaces is solved using interpolation. The conservation of fluxes is imposed by a pair of vector equations which relates the matrix coefficients of the Finite Volume problem with the weighting factors used for interpolating. These relations are satisfied by projecting the matrix coefficients from an interface to its opposite and then computing the weighting factors according to a conservation principle. This new strategy is implemented for an incompressible flow solver including a transport equation of a scalar function. The conservation and accuracy properties of the proposed methodology are analyzed in a set of numerical problems where the theory and the computational implementation are validated.

However, available gases with relatively high refractive indices, that simultaneously preserve their gaseous phase at room temperature and moderate pressures, are rare. Until recently, R-12 (Freon-12) was broadly used, but to date, it is generally unavailable due to its high global warming potential. In this work, we present an estimation of the refractive index of an alternative gas, Octafluoropropane (R-218), and we explore its feasibility as a Cherenkov radiator, for tagging charged particles at momenta as low as 2 GeV/c.

In this paper we investigate the predictability of an exchange rate with an entropy risk factor model. Considering that recent studies find complex systems characteristics of financial markets, we explore the usefulness of sample entropy as a risk factor for currency fluctuations. The empirical testing of sample entropy is based on the data of the Chilean peso (CLP) exchange rate for the period of January 1, 2005 and November 25, 2016. We find evidence that Chilean peso market has enough market inefficiencies that can be profitably exploited by the sample entropy based prediction algorithm developed in this paper.

A combined quantum chemical statistical mechanical simulation	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS												In the current work, in order to model a free electron solvated in water, we have implemented a method to represent the molecular charge distribution as a set of Slater-type functions within the framework of a QM/MM method called QMSTAT. Also, it has been introduced in this method a new approach to calculate the intermolecular induction energy in the presence of very strong electric fields. Unlike most previous potentials, our method uses the ab initio energies of the electron-water complex as reference to obtain the few fitted parameters that the model needs, instead of the ab initio potential of the electron. A Metropolis-Monte Carlo simulation of 15 million steps has been carried out in a system that consists of an electron solvated in 200 water molecules explicitly described. The obtained results predict a vertical electron detachment energy of 3.30 eV and a radius of gyration of 2.38 angstrom, which are in very good agreement with the experimental data of 3.27+0.10 eV and 2.45 angstrom, respectively. We have also obtained the absorption spectrum of the hydrated electron from our simulation. The maximum of the spectrum agrees very well with the experimental result and the experimental width at half-maximum is only 0.11 eV wider than the calculated curve. The calculations predict the same blue tail as the experimental result but with a less smooth shape. Also, our results indicate that the transfer of intensity from the transition arriving to the highest of the three p states to transitions arriving to higher-lying states contributes to the intensity enhancement of the blue tail of the spectrum. Regarding the solvated structure of the free electron, we have found that if the basis center is used as the electron site to calculate the correlation functions, the results predict a structure where the electron places itself on top of a central water molecule surrounded by the remaining water molecules in a very organized and stable arrangement. However, if the maximum of the electron density is used as electron site the obtained picture shows an electron located in a very fluctuating cavity that collapses and reforms continuously.

This study investigates the interaction between graphene and aluminum oxide layer (Al2O3) and the influence of Al2O3 on the properties of graphene. The electrical characterization demonstrates the tunability in the resistivity of Al2O3/Gr devices by applying V-g. Al2O3 deposition introduced n-doping in graphene and is affirmed by shifting of charge neutrality point towards negative V-g. The selective coverage of channel, results in the formation of p-n junction within graphene FET which becomes more pronounced upon DUV treatment. Moreover, the study validates the modulation in interface properties of pristine GFET and Al2O3/Gr at different V-g and temperatures. An enhancement in the intervalley and phase coherence scattering rates is observed for Al2O3/Gr device.

J	Jiang, J; Zhou, TS				Jiang, Jian; Zhou, Tianshou			Nontrivial effects of uncertainty on epidemic spreading under limited resources	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												While epidemic spreading often involves uncertainty (represented by noise), its control depends on the resource amount to be invested. It is unclear how the noise affects epidemic spreading under limited resources. Here we analyze an artificial model of epidemic spreading on a two-layer network, which considers three factors often neglected in other studies: noise, resource amount and time delay. We find that the noise can significantly impact epidemic spreading, depending on resource amount, sub-network topology, connection strength between sub-networks, and time delay. Main findings include: (1) for a given number of resources, a stronger noise correlates to a smaller fraction of the population infected. Moreover, if the more resources are invested, then the effect of the noise in reducing the fraction of the population infected becomes more apparent; (2) for a large range of time delay or topology degree, there is an optimal noise intensity such that the fraction of the population infected is smallest. These findings would provide useful guidelines for government decisions on the control of epidemic spreading.

We determined a maximum intra-pulse phase distortion (B-integral) of 21.2 rad by mixing the burst with a reference. The difference in the B-integral between the first and last pulse in the burst was large, 12.8 rad, but can be compensated for. Moreover, burst-to-burst amplitude fluctuations (standard deviation, std) were below 6%, where phase fluctuations were similar to 0.6 rad (std) or less. Even if these fluctuations cannot be compensated for, they still allow for efficient coherent combination, which opens up for transform-limited or narrow-line high-energy divided-pulse amplification with single-frequency seeding.

We prove the robustness of delay parameters on prices of underlying asset and prices of three types of options, which differ in their payoff functions. We provide numerical experiments which validate our theoretical results and find that when the underlying assets exist delayed response, the corresponding impact on option prices is robust with respect to the small changes in delay parameters.

In this paper, we propose a dynamic speed allocation algorithm with maximum speed based on the degree of nodes. By adjusting a tunable parameter in the algorithm, we obtain three different stable states in the network: uniform, clustered and decentralized state. There are two thresholds to describe the phase transitions between them. The transportation capacity of the network in clustered state is the best, the second in uniform state and the worst in decentralized state. It is found that there exists an optimal tunable parameter in clustered state, leading to the maximum traffic throughput of the network. Combining the spatial distribution of nodes, the nodes will aggregate into a group in clustered state or many different groups in decentralized state. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Previous reports have shown that the two-band and spin paramagnetic effects are responsible for the inter-plane (H//c) and in-plane (H//ab) upper critical field behaviors of the 112-type iron-based superconductor Ca1-xLaxFeAs2 (x similar to 0.2) respectively. With the effective mass anisotropy, the present paper suggests that the two-band Ginzburg-Landau theory may be applicable to study the magnetic properties of 112-type iron-based superconductors in arbitrary direction. The theoretical calculations on the upper critical fields fit well with the experimental results over a wide range of temperature. In addition, the upper critical field increases with the increase of the directional angle, which is similar to the result for MgB2. By comparing the upper critical fields of Ca1-xLaxFeAs2 and Ca1-xLaxFe0.98Co0.02As2, we also analyze how impurities affect the physical properties of 112-type iron-based superconductors.
