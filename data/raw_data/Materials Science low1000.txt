J	Hossain, MF				Hossain, M. F.			Fabrication of Nanosticks-Like CdS Sensitizer for the Application of Solar Cells	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												The novelty of this work is to fabricate the Nanosticks (NSs) like CdS sensitizer on the surface of TiO2 electrode by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method with a very high vacuum annealed at 350 degrees C for 30 min. Whereas, nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes have been prepared on FTO (SnO2: F) glass by a spin-coating method with high purity (99.99%, Degussa P25) TiO2 powder. The surface of the CdS layer has been covered by NSs like structures which are confirmed by the scanning electron microscope image. The 100 nm of platinum-coated FTO substrate and polysulfide-based electrolyte are used to assemble the Gratzel Solar cell (GSC). The performance of solar cell (SC) based on NSs like CdS has been compared with the nanoparticles (NPs) based CdS sensitized SC, where CdS NPs has synthesized by CBD without any post-annealing. The efficiency of NSs like CdS sensitized SC exhibits 2.44%, which is 2 folds of the efficiency of the CdS NPs sensitized SC. The NSs like CdS sensitized SC shows the highest photocurrent 20.24 mA/cm(2) compared to CdS NPs based SC.

J	Li, KD				Li, Kun-Dar			The Influence of Process Parameters on the Morphological Characteristics by Directional Etching for Materials Nanoarchitectonics	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												In nanoarchitectonics, the advanced technology of directional etching is highly demanded for the fabrication of modern electronic device with high anisotropy ratio of structures. To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle. The featured surface morphologies, including the pyramid, ripple, mounds and etch pits, are reproduced numerically, and these simulation results correspond well with the observations of directional etching experiments. This study provides the fundamental knowledge and detailed information for the advanced application of the directional etching technology.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				MAY	2020	20	5					3060	3070		10.1166/jnn.2020.17429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17429								31635649					WOS:000492366900051

This modification provided for water dispersibility of C60P and the capability for secondary modification as well. The resultant C60P particles have several useful physical properties: water-dispersibility for ease of injection; fluorescence for detection and quantification; and a characteristic morphology to assist identification.

Investigation of Swift Heavy Ion Irradiated Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO)/Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) Nanocomposite Using Raman Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												In this work, a few layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite have been synthesized by liquid exfoliation method. The morphological and structural properties are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. The optical properties are also investigated using absorption and Raman spectroscopy. This report presents quantification of swift heavy ion irradiation induced defects using Raman spectroscopy. We found both Raman mode E-2g(1) and A(1g) corresponding to MoS2 and Raman modes of rGO are strongly affected by increasing ions doses. The defect induced lattice strain in the rGO/MoS2 nanocomposite is also estimated from Raman spectroscopy. MoS2 layers are found to be much more sensitive than rGO in the rGO/MoS2 nanocomposite.

Fabrication of Al-TiO<sub>2</sub> Thin Film Electrode by Spray Pyrolysis Technique for Urea Sensing	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												A simple cost effective Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was fabricated for urea sensing. Urea is the key end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans. Increased level of urea leads to loss of kidney function. Thus determination of urea is important in analysis of kidney diseases. Al-TiO2 thin films were deposited with different concentration of Al by Spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the anatase phase of the Al-TiO2 thin films with tetragonal structure. A shift is observed in the XRD peak position compared to as prepared TiO2 thin film indicates the incorporation of Al ions into Ti ions. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study shows that the absorption increases and the absorption peak shifts towards the visible region for Al-TiO2 thin films compared with that of the as prepared TiO2 thin film. The optical band gap values changes with the change in the Al concentration in TiO2 thin films. The electrochemical analysis for optimized Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. CV studies of Al-TiO2 thin film electrode show the good stability and linearity which is essential to fabricate biosensor. The sensor response to urea is linear with correlation coefficient of 0.944 and the sensitivity is 3.17 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2).																			1533-4880	1533-4899				MAY	2020	20	5					2887	2892		10.1166/jnn.2020.17447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17447								31635625					WOS:000492366900027

A series of the materials such as mesostructured aluminum organophosphonate (AOP) and AlPO type ones were investigated according to the molecular structure and crystallinity of inorganic-organic hybrid and non-hybrid inorganic frameworks. Considering a uniqueness of AlPO based frameworks, a rational insight on strength of interactions between crystalline/amorphous AlPO based units and cationic surfactant molecules was surveyed as one of the most significant factors for understanding the mesostructural variation.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of silicon on microalgae growth by mixed-culture experiments with four different microalgae. The results showed that under the osmotic pressure caused by high concentration of Na2SiO3, Navicula sp. N6 had a competition advantage of absorbing nutrient compared with the other three microalgae. The impacts (initial pH, nitrogen content, and silicon content) on cell growth and lipid accumulation were investigated by response surface analysis and the biomass and lipid content increased from 1.01 g/L and 10.98% to 1.33 g/L and 20.04% under the optimal conditions, with lipid yield raised from 110.90 mg/L to 266.53 mg/L. Comparison on the growth under optimum and silicon deficiency condition indicated that silicon played an important role on the growth of Navicula sp. N6 and algal contamination in diatom open scale cultivation could be solved by regulating the sodium silicate concentration.

Optimal glucose and microcrystalline cellulose transformation conditions resulted in yields of 41.05 wt.% and 38.56 wt.% for EL, 0.73 wt.% and 2.63 wt.% for ethyl-glucoside (EG), 0.42 wt.% and 0.36 wt.% for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and 2.18 wt.% and 2.16 wt.% for 5-ethoxy methyl furfural (EMF), respectively. Increasing the reaction time and temperature resulted in an optimized yield of EL. These increases also resulted in decreased EG and EMF yield, and the change trend of HMF was not significant. EMF, HMF, and EG are intermediates in the formation of EL. Finally, we concluded that biomass conversion occurs first through cellulose degradation to glucose followed by the production of EG through alcoholysis and hydrolysis and dehydration of the reaction products to produce EL.

In this study, GXDF33, a strain of Alternaria, together with the reported pathogen Cladosporium, was isolated from symptomatic leaves. The in vitro pathogenicity tests on seedlings showed GXDF33 can cause black spot disease. Based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) result, it was found that the biomass of both Cladosporium and Alternaria increased as the symptom went severer. According to amplicon sequencing data for the symptomatic samples from Guangxi and Zhejiang Provinces in China, Cladosporium and Alternaria were both common genera in symptomatic plants.

The physical and chemical characterizations confirmed presence of both PPy and ZnO phases in the nanocomposite. In the present work, antimicrobial activity of the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite against human pathogen Y. lipolytica has been investigated. Attempts have been made to reveal the influence of PPy percentage on the antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, all PPy-ZnO nanocomposites, irrespective of PPy percentage showed 90 to 95% inhibited growth of Yarrowia lipolytica.

The mechanical reliabilities of Sn58Bi and epoxy Sn58Bi solder were evaluated by the board-level drop test and the 3-point bend test after temperature-humidity storage testing. The microstructure and chemical composition of the solder joints were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The addition of epoxy in solder paste did not affect the morphology of the intermetallic compound. The thickness of the scalloped-shaped Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound of solder/OSP joint increased with aging time. The drop number until fail for the epoxy Sn58Bi/OSP joint was higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint; the average numbers of drops withstood by the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint and epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint following the reflow process were fewer than 10 drops and 180 drops, respectively. The drop number of solder/OSP joints decreased with increasing aging time. The result of the 3-point bend tests shows that the number of bend cycles for the epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint was 30 times higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint. The number of bend cycles for solder/OSP joints was decreased with increasing aging time.					kim, nayoung/IWV-4038-2023														1947-2935	1947-2943				APR	2020	12	4					525	530		10.1166/sam.2020.3660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/sam.2020.3660													WOS:000495065200011

The hydrophobic surfaces covered with square pillar structures in the hexagonal array were prepared and the repulsive normal load and friction coefficient of the droplet were characterized. The force measurements in the vertical and lateral directions on the droplet confined between the prepared hydrophobic surfaces revealed that the compressive resistance to the vertical motion which is identical with the repulsive capillary force increases with deformation when the deformed droplet is horizontally symmetric. On the other hand, the friction coefficient of the squeezed droplet is inversely proportional to the repulsive capillary force. It was found that the reduced pressure acting on the solid-liquid interface results in the abnormal reduction in friction coefficient. In addition, the critical hydraulic pressure analysis confirmed that the partially wetted Cassie-Baxter (CB) state is maintained during sliding motion.																			1947-2935	1947-2943				APR	2020	12	4					589	593		10.1166/sam.2020.3671	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/sam.2020.3671													WOS:000495065200021

The polar solvent, dimethylformamide (DMF), was mixed with the PEDOT:PSS solution to improve the conductivity of the HTL. When the DMF was added to the PEDOT:PSS solution, the conductive PEDOT fragments distributed more uniformly because of the high dipole moment of the DMF. In order to find the optimal process condition, the blending ratio of DMF and the baking condition of the PEDOT:PSS layer were examined. The detector with the PEDOT:PSS layer fabricated with 50 wt% DMF added and 160 degrees C baking for 30 min had the highest sensitivity, of 1.988 mA/Gy.cm(2), which was 61.23% higher than the sensitivity of the detector with the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer.

Using the principle of evaporation-induced assembly in contact free dispersion droplets, we have synthesized porous micrometric HAp granules consist of interlocked ellipsoidal nanoparticles. We have shown that the shape of the microgranules can be tuned from spherical to doughnut solely by controlling the drying temperature during assembly. The structure and interparticle correlation in the synthesized granules have been probed by electron microscopy and small-angle scattering. The observed morphological transition has been attributed to the buckling of elastic shell made of interlocked HAp nanoparticles. Alteration of granular morphology at higher drying rate does not affect the local packing fraction of the correlated HAp nanoparticles in the granules. The absorption of bovine serum albumin protein by the synthesized granules has been tested as a potential application.

These batteries are expected to have extensive applications in fields requiring high-energy density. However, such applications are hindered by some serious intrinsic obstacles. Herein, TiO2 nanosheets-rGO/sulphur (TiO2 NS-rGO/S) composites were fabricated through a two-process hydrothermal method. TiO2 nanosheets served as active sites for polysulphide absorption, whereas rGO offered space for sulphur improvement and TiO2 NS-rGO/S composites. The TiO2 NS-rGO/S composite exhibited high discharge capacity of 1099 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2 C rate and retained a capacity of 690 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles, with high sulphur loading of 3 mg.cm(-2). The high initial specific discharge capacity and improved cyclic stability were attributed to the synergistic effects of TiO2 nanosheets and rGO. These results indicated that the simple, low-cost and scalable method provides a novel perspective on practical utilisation of lithium-sulphur batteries.					xie, keyu/F-8076-2012; JIANG, Feng/HTP-2862-2023; Li, Qingyu/AGT-0982-2022; zhang, kun/HPB-5142-2023	Li, Qingyu/0000-0003-4638-4401													1533-4880	1533-4899				MAR	2020	20	3					1715	1722		10.1166/jnn.2020.16957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.16957								31492335					WOS:000484782900045

In this paper, the MgFe-LDH with Mg/Fe molar ratio of 3.0 was prepared by urea method and the calcined products are obtained by calcining at different temperatures (473 K, 573 K, 673 K, 773 K, 873 K and 973 K) under a N-2 atmosphere for 4 h. The structure, morphology, texture, pyrolysis kinetics and mechanism of the MgFe-LDH were studied in detail. On one hand, based on the TG/DSC curves, Starink, Kissinger and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) methods were used to calculate the activation energy, on the other hand, the Satava-Sestak, Achar and Malek methods were used to define the most probable reaction mechanisms of pyrolysis behavior. The results suggested that the thermal decomposition of the LDH experienced two steps, i.e., removal of the interlayer water, followed by dehydroxylation and decarbonation. Moreover the Makel method was used to define the most probable reaction mechanisms of the pyrolysis behavior.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				MAR	2020	20	3					1822	1831		10.1166/jnn.2020.16958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.16958								31492348					WOS:000484782900058

The influence of crosslinkers and magnetic particle distribution along the filament backbone on the magnetic properties of supracolloidal linear polymer-like chains	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												Diverse polymer crosslinking techniques allow the synthesis of linear polymer-like structures whose monomers are colloidal particles. In the case where all or part of these colloidal particles are magnetic, one can control the behaviour of these supracolloidal polymers, known as magnetic filaments (MFs), by applied magnetic fields. However, the response of MFs strongly depends on the crosslinking procedure. In the present study, we employ Langevin dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of the type of crosslinking and the distribution of magnetic particles within MFs on their response to an external magnetic field. We found that if the rotation of the dipole moment of particles is not coupled to the backbone of the filament, the impact of the magnetic content is strongly decreased.

For the same peak-indentation load, increasing the holding time and/or decreasing the indentation-loading rate cause the increase of the indentation depth. There exists the "bulge" of the unloading curve at the onset of the unloading for small indentation-loading rates. The Vickers hardness is a monotonically increasing function of the indentation-loading rate for the same peak-indentation load. For the indentations with the same loading and unloading time of 30 s and without an intermediate stage at the peak-indentation load, the Vickers hardness of the Cu47.5Zr19Hf28.5Al5 bulk-metallic glass-matrix composite decreases with the increase of the indentation load. The strain energy dissipated through plastic deformation during the indentation is a power-law function of the indentation load with a power index of 3/2, and the energy ratio (total energy/plastic energy) linearly increases with the depth ratio (residual indentation depth/maximum indentation depth).																			1533-4880	1533-4899				MAR	2020	20	3					1530	1539		10.1166/jnn.2020.16954	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.16954								31492316					WOS:000484782900026

J	Chen, SH; Huang, TW				Chen, Son-Hsien; Huang, Tsung-Wei			Spin-orbit torques from intrinsic spin-orbit couplings in a periodically buckled honeycomb lattice	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												In this paper, we study the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) originated from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of intrinsic type in a periodically buckled honeycomb nanoribbon such as silicene. Using the Green function formalism with density matrix expressions, we analyze the SOT contributions from the Fermi-level and -sea electrons. We find that the intrinsic-SOC-induced inverse spin galvanic effect generates spin accumulations perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The anti-damping torque results purely from the Fermi-level contribution, while the field-like torque from both the Fermi-level and -sea contributions. At zero bias voltage, the SOT is symmetric with respect to the Fermi energy (i.e., an even function of the Fermi energy), whereas the presence of bias further introduces the anti-symmetric torque components. When the ferromagnet magnetization lies in the honeycomb plane, all Fermi-sea contributions disappear. The maximum SOT among different Fermi energies is also inspected. For large enough in-plane magnetization compared to the staggered potential, the field-like torque has a maximum at zero Fermi energy. When the magnetization is smaller than some value characterized by the intrinsic SOC, the maximum of the anti-damping torque occurs at the cross point of the two Dirac linear bands in the leads. More importantly, we find that the anti-damping torques responsible for magnetic switching as well as the torkance require staggered potential from an applied out-of-plane electric field, i.e., lattice buckling is essential to the switching. When the electric field is reversed, the anti-damping torque and the torkance are also reversed. Accordingly, full electric control of the SOTs can be realized in this buckled system.																			0304-8853	1873-4766				FEB 15	2020	496								165914	10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165914	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165914													WOS:000491941800012

This type of special cement is mixed with PVA as polymer additive material so it can have a higher strength and sufficient elasticity per unit weight. Also, boric acid which can absorb neutrons having poisonous effect in nuclear reactions is added into the cement in order to minimize environmental disaster caused by a nuclear accident. Compressive and bending strengths were measured based on TSE tests of graphene doped PVA and boron-based cement paste. Then, samples were measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Method (BET) and subjected to X-ray Diffraction (XRD). In XRD measurements, crystalline structure was observed in all materials. According to compressive strength tests, as the graphene amount increases compressive strength also increases, however in bending strength tests as the graphene amount increases bending strength decreases. Although the values of bending strength of samples produced decreased with increase of graphene content, these values were found to be above the standard values. In addition to boron, graphene admixture has a significant effect on material with its positive strength properties.

However, as compared with bilayer heterostructures, it is very challenging in experiments to prepare single crystal epitaxial ultrathin superlattices consisting of ferromagnetic metal and antiferromagnetic insulator, where the interface exchange coupling, magnetic order, and electrical transport properties are expected to be greatly modulated due to the multiple interfaces and periodical structures. Here we prepared single crystal epitaxial [Co/CoO](n) superlattices consisting of ferromagnetic metal Co and antiferromagnetic insulator CoO by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that the saturation magnetization of [Co 0.6 nm/CoO 1.2 nm](5) superlattice is robust against temperature increase, which only shows a slight decrease of 1.5% from 5 K to 300 K. Moreover, we found that the longitudinal resistivity and anomalous Hall resistivity of [Co/CoO](n) superlattices are strongly modulated by the short-period Co/CoO heterostructure, which are quite distinguished from the electrical transport properties of Co bulk ferromagnetic metal. The [Co/CoO](n) superlattices provide a new insight into heterostructures consisting of ferromagnetic metal and antiferromagnetic insulator, which are beneficial for designing future spintronics devices.

In this paper, a two-mode optimal control scheme for biomass/wind/diesel/storage independent microgrid system is proposed, which includes economic operation scheduling under normal operation and emergency power control under large disturbances, based on the operation characteristics of distributed power supply. Diesel generating unit runs near the base point of higher power generation efficiency, absorbs the instantaneous fluctuation of net load, and provides the reserve capacity for system operation. The fluctuating output of the apparent net load of biomass power generation system can effectively cooperate with wind power to generate electricity and improve the permeability of renewable energy. A new control method of battery energy storage system (BESS) is proposed, which gives priority to emergency power control, followed by peak shaving and valley filling, reduces the allocation requirement of energy storage capacity and optimizes operation conditions. Aiming at an independent microgrid system in a remote community, simulation studies are carried out from two aspects, namely, quasi-steady-state-based system operation economy and transient stability in typical operation scenarios.

The as-prepared magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles calcined at 400 degrees C for 2 h with absolute alcohol of 30 mL were characterized with the average nanoparticle size of around 30 nm and the specific magnetization (Ms) of 14.7 emu/g. The adsorption characteristics of reactive blue (RB) from aqueous solutions onto Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles were investigated by UV spectroscopy at room temperature; the adsorption kinetics data were in good agreement with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model in the initial RB concentrations of 100-400 mg/L. Compared with Langrnuir and Freundlich models, the Temkin model (correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.9998) could be used to evaluate the adsorption isotherm of RB onto the magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles at room temperature, which revealed that the adsorption of RB onto the magnetic Ni0.7Co0.3Fe2O4 nanoparticles was a hybrid of monolayer and multilayer adsorbing mechanism.					he, dawei/GZK-8280-2022														1533-4880	1533-4899				FEB	2020	20	2					957	964		10.1166/jnn.2020.16932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.16932								31383092					WOS:000484777500033

Two kinds of doping scenarios are considered, namely dopants into pristine graphene and vacancy graphene. It is observed that the doping energy is negative for dopant (N, P, S) into vacancy graphene at pyridinictype site, yet it is positive at graphitic-type site for pristine graphene. It could be inferred that the introducing process is exothermic reaction for defective graphene. Meanwhile, for the adsorption of C2H2 on the surface of defective graphene, we notice that C2H2 would prefer to be adsorbed at the top site of the doping atom and the adsorption energy increases with the introducing of dopants, indicating that the dopant would enhance the interaction between C2H2 and graphene. Regarding hydrogen molecule, the dopant has less promotion effect on the adsorption. Moreover, the graphene plays a role of electron donor while the gas molecule (C2H2/H-2) is the electron acceptor when it is adsorbed. For the co-adsorption, the C2H2 is privileged to interact with the graphene and the pre-adsorbed C2H2 on doped graphene would weaken the opportunity of the uptake of H-2 molecule. We anticipate that our results would provide information to design the optimized catalysts.

Compared to the group with constant influent CO2 concentration, astaxanthin and lipids content of the group with stable pH value adjusted by floating CO2 supply increased by 93% and 9%, respectively. Lipids from H. pluvialis, which contained 63.6% of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid, could be a considerable biodiesel feedstock. The presence of astaxanthin in lipids also improved the performance of biodiesel in many aspects. Lipids transesterification efficiency with astaxanthin increased to 1.4 times as that without astaxanthin. Crystallization temperature of biodiesel with astaxanthin (-7 degrees C) was 4.7 degrees C lower than that without astaxanthin. Thermal analysis indicated that the presence of astaxanthin might avail to enhance biodiesel thermostability, which increased the pyrolysis temperature to 212.6 degrees C and increased the activation energy to 84.8 kJ/mol.																			1556-6560	1556-6579				FEB	2020	14	1					83	90		10.1166/jbmb.2020.1941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jbmb.2020.1941													WOS:000482707600010

In this research, the uniformly dispersed GNPs were added into high-performance cementitious materials. The autogenous shrinkage of high-performance cementitious matrix materials with different incorporation of GNPs was also researched with water to cement ratio of 0.25, 0.30 and 0.35. According to hydration heat, hydration products, microstructure and porosity of GNPs cementitious matrix materials, the microcosmic mechanism for autogenous shrinkage was also investigated. It was testified that moderate addition of GNPs decreased the autogenous shrinkage of cement-based composites. Moreover, the autogenous shrinkage value was minimal after treatment with 0.10 wt% GNPs cement paste sample for 7 days, at the water to cement ratio of 0.35, and the depressed percentage of autogenous shrinkage reached 81.60% compared with the blank sample.

Equilibrium structures and flows of polar and nonpolar liquids and their mixtures in carbon nanotubes with rectangular cross sections	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE												Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of equilibrium structures and flows of polar water, nonpolar argon and methane, and mixtures of water and methane confined by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with different rectangular cross sections have been performed. The results of these simulations show that equilibrium structures and flows of all confined liquids significantly depend not only on the shape of the SWCNT's rectangular cross sections but also on the types of liquids inside SWCNTs. The cross sections of equilibrium structures of all confined liquids resemble replicas of cross sections of corresponding SWCNTs. In addition, the equilibrium structures formed by nonpolar argon atoms are most spatially ordered whereas nonpolar water molecules form the least spatially ordered equilibrium structures. It has been found that, for nonpolar methane flows through SWCNTs with rectangular cross sections, there are critical values f(xc) of the external driving force below which an average flow velocity is equal to nearly zero and above f(xc) methane molecules can flow. The critical value of the external driving force depends strongly on the shape of rectangular cross sections of SWCNTs under consideration. It has been also found that, for a sufficiently large value of the external driving force, the liquid argon flow through SWCNT with rectangular cross section with the ratio between its sides 1:4 demonstrates the ballistic frictionless regime.

J	Onaka, S				Onaka, Susumu			Approximate rotation vector expressions to consider crystal orientation changes in plastically deformed materials	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE												Orientation changes are important factors when considering microstructural changes in materials caused by plastic deformation because these are related to the arrangement and density of dislocations. The three elements of a logarithm of a rotation matrix are called log angles, which compose a rotation vector that can be used as a parameter to represent crystal orientations. Herein, approximate expressions of a rotation vector are derived for a product of two small-angle rotations. The degrees of the first-order, second-order and third-order approximations are discussed. The non-commutativity of two rotations is graphically illustrated using the approximate expressions. Experimental results of orientation changes in a cold-rolled Cu bicrystal are considered to evaluate the validity of the approximate expressions. It is shown that a linear approximation for the product of rotation vectors is valid to treat small-angle orientation changes in plastically deformed crystals with dislocation structures.

Evolution of lattice defects upon Bi-doping of epitaxial Si overlayers on Si (100)	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												Single Bi dopants in Si exhibit promising properties for quantum information science. Here we study, as a function of Bi-doped Si film thickness, the evolution and ultimate removal of lattice defects that are associated with a recently demonstrated viable route to precisely incorporate Bi dopants in homoepitaxial Si thin films. Scanning tunneling microscopy imaging reveals how the elongated defect structures in the Si lattice, originating from prefabricated Bi nanolines on the substrate surface that are the source of the Bi dopants, evolve with increasing Si overlayer thickness. Moreover, we demonstrate that a prolonged low-temperature annealing is able to annihilate these defect structures while leaving a significant Bi dopant concentration in the Si films.

The QCM frequency quickly decreased by introducing the trichlorosilane gas, while it slowly decreased by the dichlorosilane gas. The QCM frequency behavior was explained by the gas flow condition, such as the plug flow and recirculating flow, in the reactor. The relationship was consistent with the gas flow calculations, because the heavy and light gases could directly flow downward and recirculate, respectively, in the chamber due to natural convection. The information obtained from the QCM frequency behavior is expected to be utilized for the real-time gas monitoring and for the process design.

In this paper, anisotropic nanocomposite PrFeB/PrCo5 hot-deformed magnets with and without doping PrCu eutectic alloy were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. With the addition of 6 wt% PrCu, the coercivity of the magnet (10.8 kOe) is almost double than that of undoped magnet (5.6 kOe), with an enhancement of the remanence (9.1 kG versus 8.4 kG). For the magnet with PrCu, the nonmagnetic PrCu phase is mainly distributed in the phase boundary regions, introducing a coupling effect of demagnetization on the hard-magnetic phases, which obtained an enhancement of the coercivity. The deformed Pr2Fe14B grains of the hybrid magnet have elongated platelet shapes, but the PrCo5 grains are not easy to be deformed, which affects the overall degree of deformation texture of the hybrid magnet. This implies that there is uncoordinated deformation for the PrFeB/PrCo5 hybrid magnet.

Low boiling solvents such as hexane show an oscillatory modulation of transmitted light intensity (period similar to 4 s) while solvents with intermediate boiling points such as toluene give a stable switching response. An on/off ratio of 83% is observed in the transmitted pump beam. Using this, a pump beam (404 nm, 80 mW continuous wave) was shown to reversibly switch the state of a probe laser (630 nm, 5 mW continuous wave). This switch thus serves as an optical analog of an electronic transistor and demonstrates the potential for all optical switching of low power light beams. Further, all optical universal logic gates, NAND and NOR, were also demonstrated using the micro-bubble switch.

The photogenerated current of the InZnO phototransistor at long light wavelength (>600 nm) was significantly improved by utilizing narrow bandgap MoS2 as the capping layer (1.3 eV). At lower wavelength, photocarriers are generated due to the optical absorption of both InZnO and MoS2 layers, whereas the latter ensures significant photocarrier generation even at the higher wavelength region of the visible spectrum. The photogenerated carriers subsequently transfer to the underlying InZnO layer of superior carrier mobility that has a high channel conduction of additional electrons from the optically-induced doubly positively charged oxygen vacancies (Vo(++)) where the gate field is screening, thereby leading to the higher photoconductive gain of the InZnO/MoS2 phototransistors. The dynamic photosensitivity behaviour of the aforesaid phototransistor reveals the presence of persistent photoconductivity (PPC) due to the oxygen vacancy associated with InZnO which can be removed by applying a reset gate pulse from -15 to +5 V. The optical properties of these phototransistors were further enhanced by replacing the opaque Ti/Au electrode by an ultrathin transparent Ti/Au electrode. Utilization of the transparent electrode results in enhanced electron injection from source to channel due to a reduced barrier height under illumination giving rise to a ten-fold improvement in the photocurrent and responsivity of the phototransistors. A position-dependent study of the photocurrent w.r.t beam position also reveals that the enhancement in photocurrent is strongly dependent on the position and is at its maximum when the beam is placed near the source region.

As known, the ultrathin alumina mask (UTAM) surface nanopatterning technique allows the fabrication of periodic nanoparticle (NP) arrays with 5 nm gaps among the NPs, however, it still faces a significant challenge in realizing the reliable distribution of nanogaps over a large area, because of the unavoidable collapse of the UTAM pore wall during the traditional one-step homothermal pore-widening process. Herein, an efficient two-step poikilothermal pore-widening process was developed to precisely control the pore wall etching of a UTAM, enabling effectively avoiding the fragmentation of the UTAM and finally obtaining a large-scale UTAM with a pore wall thickness of about 5 nm. As a result, large-scale NP arrays with high-density sub-5 nm and even smaller gaps between the neighboring NPs have been realized through applying the as-prepared UTAM as the nanopatterning template. These NP arrays with sub-5 nm gaps show ultrahigh SERS sensitivity (signal enhancement improved by an order of magnitude compared with NP arrays with 5 nm gaps) and good reproducibility, which demonstrates the practical feasibility of this promising two-step pore-widening UTAM technique for the fabrication of high-performance active SERS substrates with large-scale ultra-small nanogaps.

By advanced electron microscopy techniques, the orientation relationship of (0 0 1)[1 1 0](film)//(0 0 1)[1 0 0](MgO) and (0 0 1)[1 0 0](film)//(0 0 1)[1 0 0](MgO) is determined for the NBT-BT/MgO heterostructures prepared at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C, respectively. In comparison, a high density of zigzag-typed planar defects appear in the film prepared at 900 degrees C. At the semi-coherent interfaces, periodic dislocation arrays form to relax the film-substrate misfit strain. In particular, the formation of both (a/2) < 0 1 0 > -type and (a/2) < 01 (1) over bar >-type interfacial dislocations facilitates the growth of NBT-BT films on rough MgO substrates at 900 degrees C.

On the relative accuracy of power law analyses for uniaxial low stress steady state high homologous temperature deformation	MECHANICS OF MATERIALS												If the mathematical operations are correct, uniaxial low stress, steady state high homologous temperature creep and steady state structural Superplasticity phenomena can be well described by a 'power law' that relates the applied stress to the strain rate of deformation (Padmanabhan et al., 2015). Isothermal dislocation creep, which exhibits no grain size dependence, displays a linear log strain rate - log stress relationship till there is a change in the rate controlling mechanism. In contrast, during grain-size dependent, isothermal steady state structural superplastic flow, even within narrow strain rate ranges the slope changes, notwithstanding the presence of the same rate controlling mechanism. In both the phenomena the stress exponent, n, decreases with increasing temperature even for a constant rate controlling mechanism (Padmanabhan, 1973). Four analytical methods, differing in details, are based on the power law equation, viz., a procedure used by experimental scientists, its improved variant, a method in vogue in rheology and a procedure due to Padmanabhan et al., 2015. By examining experimental data pertaining to many systems, it is demonstrated that the method of rheology does not follow the tenets of Dimensional Analysis and that the scatter in the predictions is the maximum for this case. The method of experimental scientists ignores the temperature dependence of the stress exponent and this leads to significant discrepancies between the measured and predicted properties. When mathematics is correct and the relevant physical situation is taken into account, the other two methods, i.e. the improved method of the experimental scientists and that of Padmanabhan et al., 2015, lead to similar results, but the latter analysis is more accurate because of its better normalizing procedure. It is also simpler. A missing detail in the earlier paper (Padmanabhan et al., 2015), viz., estimation of the grain-size exponent of the strain rate predicted for isothermal, steady state structural superplastic flow in terms of the Buckingham Pi Theorem is also furnished here.

Their alternating current impedance characteristics, under various frequencies, were measured and studied as a function of temperature in the range 200 to 400 K. Both the real (Z') and imaginary (Z '') parts of the complex impedance were temperature dependent. It was apparent that the Z ''-Z' curve for all temperatures exhibited single semicircles. The center of these semicircles was below the Z' axis. With temperature increment, the diameter of the semicircles decreased. The characteristics of the semicircular curve indicated that the parallel resistance (R-p) and constant phase element (CPE) in parallel combination with the series resistance (R-s) should be appropriate for the equivalent electrical circuit model for the produced heterojunctions. Through simulation, the value of R-s at 200 K was found to be 5.04 x 10(3) Omega, and fell to 252.05 Omega at 400 K. Also, the value of R-p was 1.34 x 10(7) Omega at 200 K and decreased to 3.37 x 10(5) Omega at 400 K. Moreover, the value of CPE at 200 K was 95.91 x 10(-12) F with a deviation from the standard (n) value of 0.90 and rose slightly to 115.60 x 10(-12) F with an n value of 0.98 at 400 K.

The results of current density-voltage (J-V) curves justified a large leakage current along with minimal response under illumination. A recombination process controls the mechanism for carrier portage in the zone of V <= 0.16 V, while a space-charge-limited current process governs the carrier portage mechanism in the circumstance of V value beyond 0.16 V. Frequency (f) dependent conductance (G/omega)-V and capacitance (C)-V curves were measured to extract the series resistance (R-s) and density of the interface state (N-ss). On the basis of extraction in the manner of Nicollian-Brews, the value of R-s rose with f abatement. With zero bias voltage applied, the value of R-s was 189.84 Omega at 2 MHz and rose to 715.10 Omega at 20 kHz. The acquired R-s may be attributable to the occurrence of R-s in the neutral zones as well as Ohmic contact. The values for N-ss, which were extracted in the manner of Hill-Coleman, were 1.23 x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2) at 2 MHz and 6.51 x 10(12) eV(-1) cm(-2) at 20 kHz. This result was an indicator of the occurrence of interface states at the zone of the junction interface performing as a source of leakage current and a trap center for the carriers originated by light.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					433	441		10.1166/jnn.2020.17295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17295								31383190					WOS:000484770600057

Oxygen was introduced during the sputtering process to prevent the reduction of transmittance and the formation of nonstoichiometric compositions. The dependence of the optical and electrical properties of MTO thin films on the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio was systematically investigated. The transmittance of the MTO single layer (24 nm) at 550 nm gradually increased from 85.9% to 88.2% with an increase of the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio from 0% to 7.9%. The optical band gap was also affected by the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio, varying from 3.30 to 3.64 eV. The MTO film deposited at an O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio of 2.7% showed the minimum resistivity (0.03 Omega . cm). The XPS spectra indicated that the SnO2 thin films become almost stoichiometric as the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio increased. Thus, this sputtering process can be used to prepare flexible MTO films with a wider optical band gap, improved transmittance, and decreased resistivity.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					505	509		10.1166/jnn.2020.17254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17254								31383200					WOS:000484770600067

To reduce refractive index-mismatching, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and MTO layers were inserted between the MTO/Ag/MTO multilayer film and the PET substrate. MTO and Ag were deposited by RF/DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature, whereas spin-coating was used to deposit PDMS at various dilution ratios in hexane. In this study, pattern visibility was examined by comparing the differences in the color and reflectance of oxide/metal/oxide multilayers before and after adding the PDMS and MTO IMLs. In addition, the effects of the PDMS dilution ratio on the electrical and optical characteristics were also investigated. The MTO/Ag/MTO/PDMS/MTO multilayer films showed high transmittance (>86% at 550 nm) except at the dilution ratio of 1:50. As the PDMS dilution ratio increased from 1:50 to 1:200, the reflectance difference (Delta R) increased from 0.08% to 0.35% and the color difference (Delta b*) increased from 0.31 to 1.23. The maximum resistance changes of the multilayer films were 0.126% and 0.124% after outer and inner bending, respectively, for 10,000 cycles with a radius of curvature of 4 mm.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					594	598		10.1166/jnn.2020.17255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17255								31383217					WOS:000484770600084

In particular, the high contact resistance generated in a nano-area significantly degrades the device performance. In this study, we propose a direct contact resistance measurement method without a test structure by separate processes to improve the nano-area contact resistance. The nano-area contact resistance of Ti-Ti and Cu-Cu decreased from 6.46 M Omega to 1.08 M Omega and from 3.78 M Omega to 1.48 M Omega, respectively, when the metal line and native layer formed on the surface were removed. In addition, it is confirmed that the contact resistance decreased with an increase in bonding strength in the case of nano-area homo-metal contact. However, the contact resistance is affected by the tunneling effect and bond energy according to the distance between the first layers of atoms in the case of nano-area hetero-metal contact.

With the development of nanotechnology, a huge potential has been created for the design of highly sensitive sensors with low energy consumption and low costs. If a composite material constructed with carbon nanotubes is used as an electrode in contact with a contaminant, this material undergoes an oxidation-reduction reaction with the contaminant that allows the electrode to function as an electrochemical sensor. This study involved the application of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and modified working electrodes constructed with multi-walled carbon nanotube composites (Ag- and ZnO-multi-walled carbon nanotubes) as electrochemical sensors. These electrodes have good response speed and sensitivity at low concentrations, and they are reusable. To lower the price of these sensors, our goal was to maximize their sensitivity by using the low-cost multi-walled carbon nanotubes in conjunction with silver electroless plating of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotube composites.

As the undercooling is not greater than 350 K, only heteronucleation process occurred in both cases. However, at a larger undercooling (400 K), the nucleation transformed from a heteronucleation mode to a mix-mode of heteronucleation and homonucleation in both cases. Interestingly, we found that the heteronucleation of Cu embryos, in the amorphous-Ta/liquid-Cu samples, was always triggered by the recrystallization of amorphous Ta; it means that crystal Ta possesses a higher nucleation potency than amorphous Ta. Further analysis indicated that the higher nucleation potency of single crystal Ta originates from its ability to induce liquid Cu atoms ordering. Liquid Cu took a longer time, on average, to nucleate on amorphous Ta than on crystal Ta at different temperatures. In addition, microstructure analysis indicated that the crystallized region contained both stacking faults and twin crystals.					wang, lin/HZK-4145-2023; FEI, Linfeng/D-5202-2011; shu, longlong/AAO-3089-2020	FEI, Linfeng/0000-0001-7329-0019; Gan, Xianglai/0000-0001-8200-917X; Shu, Longlong/0000-0002-7121-1652; Zhou, Naigen/0000-0003-4168-2637														2053-1591				JAN	2020	7	1							015201	10.1088/2053-1591/ab5531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab5531													WOS:000499455400001
J	Giannopoulou, A; Kounavis, P				Giannopoulou, A.; Kounavis, P.			Spectral-resolved two-light beam photoresponse spectroscopy to resolve and investigate different photogeneration processes in organic semiconductors	ORGANIC ELECTRONICS												A photocurrent spectroscopy employing two-color light excitation beams scanned at different photon energies is proposed to resolve and to investigate different photogeneration processes involving exciton dissociation and above bandgap excitations in organic semiconductors. The basic concept of this spectroscopy is based on the phenomenon of photoresponse enhancement (PE), recently observed in pentacene films. In this phenomenon, the photocurrent, generated with modulated probe-light creating excitons, undergoes enhancement under additional above bandgap bias-light excitation, which acts to facilitate exciton dissociation. In the proposed photocurrent spectroscopy, the excitation energies of probe-light producing photocurrent undergoing PE and those of the biaslight which can induce PE are specified. This allows us to resolve photogeneration via exciton dissociation, which is facilitated by above bandgap excitations, and the onset of the above bandgap excitations, which facilitate exciton dissociation in pentacene films. It is found that light excitation in the region of 1.77-2.43 eV generates excitons diffusing with a diffusion length of 50-80 nm, which is compatible with that of triplet excitons, to the pentacene-substrate interface where dissociate via electron transfer to positive donor-like traps. For light excitation exceeding 2.43 eV, above bandgap excitations become strong competing triplet exciton creation by singlet fission. These results can be explained if the singlet fission and the above bandgap excitations are mediated by charge transfer states with energy-dependent electron-hole separations.

The capping layers for films with the thicknesses of 50 nm and 100 nm broadened the metal-insulator transition, though they produced rather few changes to other properties. The results were dramatically different for a 20-nm-thick LCMO layer compared to other thicker films. The metal-insulator transition temperature increased from 160 to 200 K for capped LCMO film despite the fact that the capping layer reduced the magnitude of magnetization. The temperature of maximum magnetoresistance (MR) shifted from 115 to 185 K. However, its magnitude, 1500% at 5 T, remained unchanged due to capping. This behavior was attributed to atomic inter-diffusion at the LCMO/Fe3O4 interface which resulted in the generation of Mn2+ ions. These results are of great significance and suggest a promising future for both the fundamental research and device applications involving thin films of LCMO.

SEM was used to confirm the shape of the particles. The crystal structure of the synthesized materials was analyzed by XRD, and BET measurements were performed to determine the correlation between the BCR and specific surface area.

J	Jang, HS; Lim, YT; So, SY				Jang, Hong-Seok; Lim, Yong-Taek; So, Seung-Young			Characteristics of Steam-Cured Carbon Amino Silica Black Mortar Using a Methyl Cellulose Polymer	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												Along with the increase in the demand for existing colored concrete, the demand for secondary concrete products of various colors is also increasing. However, the initial surplus water in mortar causes the internal calcium component to leach out and contaminate the surface, and the hardening of concrete that contains pigment is generally slower than that of normal concrete. This study was to evaluate the physical properties of mortar colored by carbon amino silica black (CASB), using a methyl cellulose (MC) polymer to reduce surface efflorescence and increase early strength by means of steam curing. MC modifies the mechanical properties of mortar by forming a polymer film, which prevents the soluble calcium from migrating to the surface and reduces whitening in steam cured mortar. However, steam curing significantly decreased the strength with increasing MC content when CASB content was high.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					584	588		10.1166/jnn.2020.17237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17237								31383215					WOS:000484770600082

Among lithium secondary batteries, the lithium polymer battery, which has similar performance to the lithium secondary battery, is made of a solid polymer electrolyte. Lithium ions in a solid polymer electrolyte exist in the form of a solution by a polar group in a polymer matrix. Lithium ions in the solid polymer electrolyte migrate via the segmental motion of the polymer. That is, the properties of a polymer matrix in a solid polymer electrolyte can affect the conduction of lithium ions. Therefore, this study focused on the electrochemical properties of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer-based solid polymer electrolyte. For this, poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer-based solid polymer electrolytes, which have spherical micelles, and various sizes of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer micelle, were prepared. Amino acids were added to the poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymer-based solid polymer electrolyte as an ion dissociator to assist in the dissociation of a lithium salt and increase the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolyte. The copolymer-based solid polymer electrolytes was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, impedance analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and linear sweep voltammetry.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					498	504		10.1166/jnn.2020.17251	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17251								31383199					WOS:000484770600066

Long life and minimal energy consumption are often the most attractive advantages for electronic devices. Because LEDs are based on compound semiconductors, which explore the direct transition between the conduction and valance band edges, thermal energy loss can be minimized during operation. However, even though these types of LEDs are based on direct transition type semiconductors, thermal energy is still emitted during operation owing to forward conduction and reverse leakage currents. This research proposes capturing this energy loss through thermoelectric module-based energy recycling methods to improve the energy efficiency of LED applications, achieving savings of up to 18%. Additional analysis was performed on high power LED sources resulting in the manufacture of a high-power LED light grid system.

When 0.025 M aqueous precursor solution was used, the obtained ZnO nanorods exhibited an improved vertical orientation and growth rate, showing directional growth along the (002) plane, as confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, ZnO nanorods (NR1) obtained on the seed layer prepared by oxidation of Zn films exhibited the faster growth rate than those (NR2) synthesized on the seed layer prepared by spin-coating method due to having access to a sufficient amount of Zn2+ ions. The ZnO nanorods obtained at a precursor concentration of 0.025 M exhibited the highest photocurrent, dark current, and photoresponsivity, with the photoresponsivity and photosensitivity of ZnO NR1 exceeding those of ZnO NR2, owing to the larger surface area.

However, Mg-based hydrides undergo hydrogenation/dehydrogenation at high temperature and pressure due to their thermodynamic stability and high oxidation reactivity. Various attempts have been made to lower the reaction rate and dehydrogenation temperature by adding transition elements (e.g., Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Ce), metal oxides, and intermetallic compounds to overcome these shortcomings. On the other hand, carbon materials have been mainly studied in the field of hydrogen storage with high specific surface area and lightweight properties; however, results show that they cannot store a large amount of hydrogen. Recently, it has been theoretically reported that carbon materials act as adsorbents in hydrogen storage. This study focuses on the hydrogenation behavior of MgHx-CaO and MgHx-CaO-MWCNT composites prepared by hydrogen-induced mechanical alloying, and investigates the properties of these composite materials.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					611	615		10.1166/jnn.2020.17269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17269								31383221					WOS:000484770600088

Twenty eight male, 10-week old Wistar rats were used, divided into three groups, i.e., the control one, the group including the diabetic rats and, finally, the group including the diabetic rats which were treated using sitagliptin. The biomechanical study was based on a series of three-point bending tests of the femora of the sacrificed rats and the analysis of the experimental data was implemented in terms of the actual geometry of the fractured cross-section. It was concluded that diabetic bones undertake larger forces despite the fact that the "diameter" of their cross-section was somehow smaller. On the contrary, the slope of the load-deflection curve (corresponding to a measure of the stiffness) of diabetic bones is slightly lower compared to the control bones. Finally, it seems that treating diabetic animals with sitagliptin only partly reverses the effect of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on their bone tissue, at least concerning its strength and stiffness.

The prepared specimen was post-annealed at a temperature of 773 K for various time durations, and the effects of annealing conditions have been investigated. Vickers hardness of Al6061, Al6063 and Cu decreases as annealing time decreases; however, that of the interface between Al alloys and Cu increases with an annealing time of 1 h, and then decreases as annealing time increases further. The growth of a diffusion layer in Al6063/Cu is larger than that in Al6061/Cu, because the activation energy in the Al6063/Cu is lower than that in Al6061/Cu during the annealing process. Cracking of the diffusion layer occurs by annealing for extended periods of time in both materials, which contributes to the decrease in hardness.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				JAN	2020	20	1					599	602		10.1166/jnn.2020.17258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2020.17258								31383218					WOS:000484770600085

Compared to DKDP crystal, ADP has a larger nonlinear optical coefficient and higher laser damage threshold, so a larger energy and higher conversion efficiency can be expected from ADP crystals. In this paper, a high-quality ADP crystal (118 x 137 x 160 mm) was grown through point-seed rapid growth method within one month. The corresponding optical properties and homogeneity for noncritical phase-matching fourth harmonic generation were investigated. For the ADP sample with cross-section of 110 x 110 mm, the obtained homogeneity noncritical phase-matching temperature is 0.13 degrees C, which is superior to a DKDP crystal with the same growth parameters. Moreover, UV transmittance property of various thicknesses for ADP crystals was also explored. The transmittance at 263 nm is 88% and decreased 0.36% per millimeter. This result is much lower than the 0.63% for the DKDP crystal in the same thickness range. These results indicate ADP crystals are very promising candidates for noncritical phase-matching fourth harmonic generation.

The average pore diameter and thickness of the BTO nanotube arrays obtained were approximately 50 similar to 70 nm and 2 similar to 4 mu m, respectively. The BTO nanotube arrays were then dip-coated with CoFe2O4 (CFO) sol with the assistance of vaccum impregnation equipment to enable the penetration of CFO sol into the tubular pores of the BTO nanotube arrays. The good distribution of CFO in the BTO nanotube arrays was confirmed by electron microscopy accompanied with elemental analysis.

At the same content of Al2O3, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of composites made by synthesized polymer resin exhibited higher than that of composite made by bisphenol-A resin. The obtained maximum thermal conductivity of the composite was 0.25 W/mK, which was 0.4 times as large as that of the conventional bisphenol-A epoxy resin which has an amorphous structure.

The formation of Cluster (1) was substantially suppressed by the formation of Cluster (2) during step quenching at 100 degrees C for 0.06 ks. The hardness increase was retarded for a period during two-step aging at 170 degrees C in the case of natural aging for 604.8 ks. The hardness decrease was determined to be due to the dissolution of nanoclusters in the early stage of two-step aging at 170 degrees C. On the other hand, hardness was directly increased in the step-quenched samples during multi-step aging at 170 degrees C. It is noted that Cluster (2) directly transforms into the strengthening phase. The bake hardening response is fairly enhanced by the formation of Cluster (2), which is formed by the step quenching process. It was confirmed that the step-quenched samples had a higher number of precipitates than the naturally-aged ones based on TEM images.

We applied advanced analytics and in silico approaches to illustrate the retrieval-based potential to elucidate host responses and enable discovery of corresponding biomarkers indicative of in vivo implant performance. Hip retrieval analysis was performed using variables based on immunostaining, polarized microscopy, and fretting-corrosion and oxidation analyses. Statistical analyses were performed in R. Hierarchical/k-means clustering and principal component analysis were used for data analysis and visualization. Correlation Engine (CE) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were employed for in silico corroboration of putative biomarkers. Higher giant cell and histiocyte scores and positivity for CD68 and CD3 indicating infiltration with macrophages and T-cells, respectively, were detected mainly among older generation hips with higher ultra-high-molecular-weight-polyethylene loads. Our in silico analysis using pre-existing data on wear particle-induced loosening substantiated the role of CD68 in implant-induced innate responses and identified the CD68-related molecular signature that can be indicative of development of aseptic loosening and can be further corroborated for diagnostic/prognostic testing in clinical setting.

J	Wang, BH; Hu, YH				Wang, Bohan; Hu, Yuhang			Pressure diffusion wave and shear wave in gels with tunable wave propagation properties	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS												Gels are composed of cross-linked polymer network and solvent. Gels are both ubiquitous in nature and widely applied in engineering applications. In this work, we develop a physics-based dynamic theory to investigate the tunable wave propagation properties of gels. Gels are soft and can generate large deformation. The constitutive relation takes account the coupled large deformation and diffusion of gels. The dynamic governing equations take account the relative motions between the polymer network and solvent, which leads to a pressure diffusion wave similar to the "slow pressure wave" in the classical Biot's poroelastodynamics. It is different from the pressure wave in pure solid or pure liquid. The phase velocity, group velocity and attenuation coefficient are analyzed at different frequencies and propagating directions for both pressure wave and shear wave. We show that the wave propagation properties of gels are not only related to the material properties including the crosslink density and the interaction property between solvent and polymer, but also can be tuned by different mechanical loading conditions and chemical stimuli. It is also predicted that the constrained swollen gel exhibits anisotropic wave propagation properties, which leads to the splitting of the pressure wave and shear wave propagating through it. The theory provides a general frame for fundamental understanding and quantitative characterization of the dynamic behaviors of gels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Significant changes in the microstructure were detected after annealing at 500 degrees C with fragmentation and sphering of eutectic particles. The annealing temperature of Al-1.0RE alloy increased proportionally to the electrical conductivity. The formation of Al-RE intermetallic compounds increases the electrical conductivity and improves the mechanical properties of the alloy through precipitation hardening.

By using a compact quadrupole mass filter system a hyperthermal ion beam is mass filtered. The GaN thin film depositions with varying ion-to-atom arrival ratio and kinetic energies of 40 eV and 80 eV are performed to highlight the distinct impact of the ion species on the early stages of the growth.

J	Nakata, K; Nakazawa, H; Okamoto, H; Kobayashi, Y				Nakata, Keiichi; Nakazawa, Hideki; Okamoto, Hiroshi; Kobayashi, Yasuyuki			Influence of the terrace width of pentacene underlayers on the crystallinity of C<sub>60</sub> overlayers	THIN SOLID FILMS												Pentacene and fullerene (C-60) form an efficient stacked heterostructure in organic solar cells, and C-60 films exhibit high crystallinity on pentacene films. However, the mechanism of the crystallinity improvement in C-60 overlayers remains to be fully elucidated. In this work, the surface (step and terrace structure) of pentacene films is investigated in terms of the terrace width using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to clarify the mechanism. We found that the terrace width becomes wider as the substrate temperature for pentacene film growth increases, and the terrace width becomes narrower as the thickness of pentacene films increases. In addition, we investigate the influence of the terrace width of pentacene underlayers on C-60 overlayers using AFM and X-ray diffraction. We found that pentacene underlayers with wide terraces increase the grain size and improve the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers. These findings indicate that growing pentacene underlayers with wider terraces allows for further enhancement in the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers, leading to higher quality pentacene/C-60 stacked heterostructures.																			0040-6090					DEC 31	2019	692								137638	10.1016/j.tsf.2019.137638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tsf.2019.137638													WOS:000499678700026

Details of mechanisms of oxidation of ClO on Ti-doped carbon and boron nitride nanocages were examined. Ti atoms of Ti-C-48 and Ti-B24N24 show catalytic activity towards ClO adsorption with low-barrier energies. Results displayed that the Ti-doped carbon and boron nitride nanocages oxidized ClO by the mechanisms of Eley-Rideal (ER) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH). Catalytic activities in the LH path were limited by irremediable adsorption of chloride dioxide (ClO2) on Ti-C-48 and Ti-B24N24. While, in the ER path, the first and second ClO2 were separated, directly. Finally, the results proved that the Ti-C-48 and Ti-B24N24 show suitable catalytic abilities towards ClO oxidation via the ER path.																			0250-4707	0973-7669				DEC 26	2019	43	1							28	10.1007/s12034-019-1983-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12034-019-1983-1													WOS:000511599900028

We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because we showed that the interlayer distance of untreated MMT was increased from 1.23 to 2.05-2.21 nm, and thus verified the intercalation of CTS into the MMT interlayer. The maximum adsorption of Cu2+, as calculated using the Langmuir equation, was significantly higher for oxalic acid-crosslinked CTS-modified MMT, relative to untreated MMT or the non-crosslinked CTS-modified-MMT. The oxalic acid-crosslinked CTS-modified MMT could also take up more Cu2+ than Ni2+ from a solution containing a mixture of Cu2+-Ni2+. The selective adsorption of oxalic acid-crosslinked CTS-modified-MMT (i.e. Ni2+ < Cu2+) is governed by the selective adsorption of CTS and the oxalic acid. This reveals the effect of the complex formation with CTS and oxalic acid.

However, many issues, especially imbalanced carrier injection, have limited their development, so further research is needed. Herein, 4,4 '-cyclohexane-1,1-diylbis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)aniline] (TAPC) with a large bandgap is introduced as a multifunctional hole transport layer (MHTL) for efficient hybrid organic/inorganic WLEDs. Optimized hybrid WLEDs with TAPC are achieved with a peak current efficiency of 20.6 cd A(-1) and a near purity white light with color coordinates of (0.32, 0.33). They exhibit better EL performance than those without TAPC. This proves that an optimized TAPC layer can effectively reduce electron overflow and improve hole injection to acquire much better charge balance in the emitting layers. Such good results will significantly promote the design and fabrication of phosphor-free WLEDs with high performance.

BETON- UND STAHLBETONBAU												For years national and international research works on performance-based durability design concepts have been performed to improve economy and durability of concrete structures with a differentiated estimation of member resistance (solidity and cover of concrete) under different environmental conditions. First concepts already have been tested on specific projects. The present state of science - partly state of the art - and the chances and risks by using performance-based durability design concepts are presented in this article. As an example the descriptive requirements according to the present German standards and the performance based design of the resistance against chloride induced corrosion (XD-exposition) are compared and explained in detail. Furthermore the present knowledge of the corrosion intensity of reinforcing steel in cracks is summarised, in which chlorides were penetrated during one winter saison. This question is essential for reinforced concrete structures in car parks with and without surface protection systems.

Small-amplitude superimposed horizontal motion of a load supported symmetrically by rubber springs	MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS												The undamped small-amplitude superimposed horizontal motion of a load supported symmetrically between identical isotropic hyperelastic springs, each subjected to an initial finite uniaxial static stretch, is reviewed in general terms. The small superimposed motion is discussed for the classical incompressible Mooney-Rivlin, James-Guth, and Gent models, as well as two limit classes of compressible Blatz-Ko material models, f=0 and f=1. The small-amplitude vibrational frequency is presented for each model, and the effects of limited extensibility are demonstrated for the James-Guth and Gent materials. Unstable equilibrium states are exhibited for the Blatz-Ko compressible foamed rubber material with f=0, while the others exhibit infinitesimally stable motion for an essentially arbitrary initial static stretch. It is shown that unstable equilibrium states exist for the general compressible Blatz-Ko model with 0<f<1, and these states are characterized graphically in terms of the static stretch and the material Poisson ratio. The article concludes with a discussion of the Blatz-Ko and Gent-Thomas foamed rubber materials and their relation to the classical molecular-based uni-constant theory of elasticity.

J	Morice, C; Kopp, T; Kampf, AP				Morice, Corentin; Kopp, Thilo; Kampf, Arno P.			Nonunique connection between bulk topological invariants and surface physics	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												At the heart of the study of topological insulators lies a fundamental dichotomy: Topological invariants are defined in infinite systems but surface states as their main footprint only exist in finite systems. In the slab geometry, namely, infinite in two planar directions and finite in the perpendicular direction, the 2D topological invariant was shown to display three different types of behavior. The perpendicular Dirac velocity turns out to be a critical control parameter discerning between different qualitative situations. When it is zero, the three types of behavior extrapolate to the three 3D topologically distinct phases: trivial, weak, and strong topological insulators. We show analytically that the boundaries between types of behavior are topological phase transitions of particular significance since they allow us to predict the 3D topological invariants from finite-thickness transitions. When the perpendicular Dirac velocity is not zero, we identify a new phase with surface states but no band inversion at any finite thickness, disentangling these two concepts which are closely linked in 3D. We also show that at zero perpendicular Dirac velocity, the system is gapless in the 3D bulk and therefore not a topological insulating state, even though the slab geometry extrapolates to the 3D topological phases. Finally, in a parameter regime with strong dispersion perpendicular to the surface of the slab, we encounter the unusual case that the slab physics displays nontrivial phases with surface states but nevertheless extrapolates to a 3D trivial state.

Process gases are silane (SiH4) and hydrogen (H-2). SixHy radical partial pressures are simulated as a function of H-2 gas flow for given gas inlet compositions in order to optimize radical partial pressures, leading to higher quality and more ordered Si:H films. The simulation results are compared with a series of deposition runs using an array of 10 heated tungsten wires (600 mm long, 0.53 mm diameter, held at 2100 degrees C) providing a deposition area of 500 x 600 mm(2).

The object of the study was this nanolayer that changed its optical transparency under action of pulsed laser radiation. Zerodur plate located on the back side after ablation was step-by-step thinned by grinding and polishing up to the boundary with aluminum nanolayer. After each thinning step, we performed the X-ray phase analysis by using the diffractometer Philips X'Pert PRO - MRD.

It has been ascertained that the changes in phase composition are present within the region of 50...100 nm from the aluminum nanolayer boundary. It has been found the appearance of the weak but sharp peak at 28.4 degrees that corresponds to the reflection (1 1 1) of cubic silicon nanoparticles. Their size is approximately 12 nm. It was revealed the weakly pronounced but clear peak at 44.78 degrees that corresponds to the reflection (2 0 0) attributed to cubic aluminum. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main phase of YDC exists in all samples, and the second phase of Al2O3 starts to appear in the XRD patterns when its content is beyond the solid solubility limit in YDC. No severe reaction between YDC and Al2O3 occurs in the composite samples at 1300 degrees C. The average grain size of the composite ceramics decreases from 510 nm to 330 nm with the rise in Al2O3 content from 0 to 30%. The specific grain boundary electrical conductivity of YDC-xAl(2)O(3) samples decreases with the Al2O3 content from 0 to 20% and then begins to increase when the Al2O3 content rises from 20% to 30%. The YDC-30%Al2O3 sample shows a higher specific grain boundary conductivity than YDC-20%Al2O3, which mainly originates from the higher volumetric fraction of YDC/Al2O3 heterogeneous interface in YDC-30% Al2O3 as well as the higher oxygen ion mobility in YDC/Al2O3 heterogeneous interface region.

In contrast to this method, this study demonstrates that conventional solid-state synthesis route, which includes milling and subsequent thermal annealing, would not give rise to the synthesis of pure PZT powder, indicating the simultaneous heating and milling effectively promotes formation of the perovskite PZT in the hot milling process.

The effect of the various pulse patterns on recorded currents, energy efficiency and mechanical pulsing are investigated by the constant input heating of SPS and a stable punch system. The results show that the recorded current increases while the energy efficiency decreases with the increasing ON/OFF ratio. The TiO2 powder was sintered by pulse patterns 12:2 and 10:9 with constant power input. An increase of one order of magnitude in grain size and 8% in density is shown after application of the pulse pattern 10:9, while the amount of consumed energy remained constant. When heated with different pulse patterns, the variation of the effective power and contact resistance induced by the mechanical pulse are two main reasons accounting for the varying energy efficiency. This unique SPS behavior was demonstrated by experiments and calculations.					; Kalousek, Radek/B-1190-2014; Salamon, David/A-6219-2012	TAN, HUA/0000-0002-0857-8515; Kalousek, Radek/0000-0003-2612-8259; Salamon, David/0000-0002-3267-5235													0272-8842	1873-3956				DEC 15	2019	45	18	A				24392	24397		10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.08.158													WOS:000497245400065

Numerical simulation of the hydrodynamics and mass transfer in the capping of large size Z-cut plates	JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH												Numerical simulation of the hydrodynamics and mass transfer involved in the capping of large size Z-cut KDP plates has been performed. The variations of surface supersaturation with thin layer height, bulk supersaturation and rotation rate are analyzed. The results show that keeping still is very unfavorable for the growth of thin layer, a certain rotation rate should be applied to the Z-cut plate to increase the concentration gradient across the (0 0 1) face, thus making sure that thin layers can grow from the edges while small pyramids barely grow from the face center. Given the result that end faces of thin layers nearly bear a bulk supersaturation, a relative low bulk supersaturation will be better to ensure both the growth of thin layers and the good surface uniformity brought by low supersaturation. Moreover, as thin layers grow, rotation rate should be increased to make up the insufficient solute supply resulting from the decreasing linear speed. The optimal parameters for rapid and high-quality capping of large size Z-cut plates are suggested, the relevant simulation results are also presented.

In this part we use the propagator matrices to deduce the dispersion equation and its static limit in a closed form with the use of symbolic calculations. The roots in statics which are analyzed at the first step play the key role. Then, the low frequency approximations for the dispersion curves are derived. The method is aimed to evaluate a dispersion curve of any order n and to describe it in a closed form by an asymptotic formula.

Part II: Asymptotics/numerical results	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES												Developing the approach outlined in Part I, the wavenumber spectrum is evaluated. Firstly, for the nth complex dispersion curve the asymptotics of the wavenumber's static value is considered as n -> +infinity Two approaches to obtain this asymptotics are compared. Then, for any n the exact value in statics is calculated using iterations, starting with the asymptotic value as the initial approximation. The parametric analysis revealed a specific (critical) value of the geometrical parameter at which the wavenumbers are redistributed. Secondly, the low frequency asymptotics of the dispersion curves are obtained. They exibit the flat initial segment of each complex dispersion curve which is the longer, the larger is the index n of the curve. Thus, this part of spectrum can be described by simple analytical formulas. The exact dispersion curves are evaluated using another iterative algorithm for improving the approximations. For both steps the numerical results are in a good agreement with the asymptotics. Finally, the perspectives of the method for other composite structural members are discussed.

This device adopts the single cell design that with lower cost, and utilizes the optical properties of electrically tilted LC to achieve the function of NVA display. An issue has received less attention in the past and been indeed found in the production process. It is that the off-axis color shift will appear in NVA mode. We put forward one method to improve this issue here, which is combined with the concepts of Gray Frame Insertion (GFI) and Impulse-type driving. By switching the voltage between two different gamma values, the color shift will be perfected on the produce.

This type of product, however, can suffer from syneresis: densification due to the expulsion of fluid. Gaining insight into the physical principles governing syneresis in such soft hybrid dispersions remains a challenge from a theoretical perspective, as experimental data are needed to establish a basis. We record non-accelerated syneresis in a model system for low-fat mayonnaise: a colloid polymer mixture, consisting of oil in water emulsion with starch in the aqueous phase. We find the flow rate of expelled fluid to be proportional to the difference in hydrostatic pressure over the system. The osmotic pressure of the added starch, while being higher than the hydrostatic pressure, does not prevent syneresis because the soluble starch is lost to the expelled fluid. From these findings, we conclude that forced syneresis in these systems can be described as a gravity-driven porous flow through the densely packed emulsion, explainable with a model based on Darcy's law.

However, the Li2S full cell suffers from rapid capacity degradation due to the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. Herein, a Li2S/Si full cell is designed with a Li2S cathode incorporated by titanium nitride (TiN) polysulfide immobilizer within parallel hollow carbon (PHC). This full cell delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(Li2S)(-1) (1007 mAh g(sulfur)(-1)) at 0.5 C rate and excellent cyclability with only 0.4% capacity fade per cycle over 200 cycles. The long cycle stability is ascribed to the strong polysulfide anchor effect of TiN and highly efficient electron/ion transport within the interconnected weblike architecture of PHC. Theoretical calculations, self-discharge measurements, and anode stability experiments further confirm the strong adsorption of polysulfides on the TiN surface. The present work demonstrates that the flexible Li2S cathode and paired Si anode can be used to achieve highly efficient Li-S full cells.

Here, we observe a strain-driven stripe-like morphology of two supertetragonal (monoclinic Cc and Cm) phases in the strained BiFeO3/LaAlO3 thin films. The two supertetragonal phases have a similar giant axial ratio but differences in oxygen pyramid tilting mode. Especially, the competition between polar instability and oxygen pyramid tilting is identified using atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the polarization rotation across the phase boundary. In addition, microtwins are observed in the Cc phase. Our findings provide new insights of the coupling between ferroelectric polarization and oxygen pyramid tilting in oxide thin films and will help to design novel phase morphology with desirable ferroelectric polarization and properties for new applications in perovskite oxides.

The application of different forces (16, 33, and 50 N) resulted in the formation of Ag nanodiscs with different heights (106, 99, and 88 nm) from polyhedral Ag NPs (similar to 114 nm). We observed a clear red-shift in the plasmonic resonance for completely deformed Ag nanodiscs produced using 50 N force. We show that the fluorescence emission from Rhodamine B (RhB) is enhanced by >30 fold (with respect to RhB on bare glass) in the presence of Ag nanodiscs due to a simultaneous increase in the excitation intensity and photonic mode density. The observed increase in RhB emission on Ag nanodiscs is explained in terms of the nanodisc's scattering spectrum red-shifting toward the RhB emission wavelength, which results in an increased local electric field and higher photonic mode density for Ag nanodiscs.

Controlling spontaneous emission via electronic correlations and temperature in transparent oxides	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We study spontaneous emission of two-level quantum emitter agglomerates embedded in transparent oxides. The two levels correspond to the splitting between vacancy impurity states F, F+, and V- color centers, whereas correlations are due to narrow bands in transition-metal oxides with ABO(3) perovskite structures. For these systems, we put forward a mechanism to control light emission in which micrometer-size vacancy-rich regions play the role of cavity resonators for the emitted radiation with normal frequencies mode volumes, and emission linewidths determined by their size and material properties. We argue that a physical scenario in which the emitter's natural frequency and linewidth can be fine-tuned via electronic correlations or temperature explains unusual features in the experimental photoluminescence spectra of Ar-irradiated SrTiO3. By unveiling the role of electronic correlations on spontaneous emission in transparent oxides, we hope our findings help set the basis for the design of controllable engineered solid-state single-photon sources.

It is the first unit cell model for the molten carbonate DCFC in which both 4-electron carbon oxidation and 2-electron CO oxidation reactions, as well as the reverse Boudouard reaction, are considered. The simulation results verify that, besides the relatively sluggish kinetics of the anodic reactions, cell performance is mainly limited by ohmic losses in the anode. Further modeling exploration reveals that a minimum effective electronic conductivity of around 0.56 S/cm is required to facilitate proper electrical conduction in the cathode to attain high DCFC performance. It was found that there are optimal volume fractions for the carbon fuel and liquid electrolyte in the anode. If the effective electronic conductivity of the cathode falls to 0.56 S/cm, optimal volume fractions also exist for the solid material and liquid electrolyte in the cathode. The detailed modeling analysis showed that performance improvement at high operating temperature was mainly attributed to improvement of anodic kinetics and reduction of ohmic loss in the electrolyte of electrodes and electrolyte-matrix.

Particularly AIE-active polymer nanoparticles have been widely utilized in a modern biomedical research. In this work, we prepared a novel kind of AIE-active fluorescent polymeric nanoparticals (Dex-OH-CHO) through a facile esterification between a new hydrophobic AIE-active 1, 8-naphthalimide derivative and the hydrophilic dextran. The structure and optical properties of Dex-OH-CHO were characterized in detail by FTIR, H-1 NMR, XPS, TEM and fluorescence spectra. The results showed that Dex-OH-CHO emitted light-blue fluorescence in aqueous solution with high fluorescent quantum yield (phi = 24.43%, concentration is 20 mu g/mL), low CMC (5 mu g/mL), good photostability, high water solubility and well dispersivity. Moreover, good biocompatibility and ideal cell uptake made Dex-OH-CHO had a great application potential in biological imaging.

In this work, temperature-dependent synaptic plasticity behaviors, which are mimicked by the indium-gallium-zinc oxide thin-film transistors gated with sputtered SiO2 electrolytes, have been studied. With the temperature increasing from 303 to 323 K, the electrolyte capacitance decreases from 0.42 to 0.11 mu F cm(-2). The mobility increases from 1.4 to 3.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), and the threshold voltage negatively shifts from -0.23 to -0.51 V. Synaptic behaviors under both a single pulse and multiple pulses are employed to study the temperature dependence. With the temperature increasing from 303 to 323 K, the post-synaptic current (PSC) at the resting state increases from 1.8 to 7.3 mu A. Under a single gate pulse of 1 V and 1 s, the PSC signal altitude and the PSC retention time decrease from 2.0 to 0.7 mu A and 5.1 x 10(2) to 2.5 ms, respectively. A physical model based on the electric field-induced ion drifting, ionic-electronic coupling, and gradient-coordinated ion diffusion is proposed to understand these temperature-dependent synaptic behaviors. Based on the experimental data on individual transistors, temperature-modulated pattern learning and memorizing behaviors are conceptually demonstrated. The in-depth investigation of the temperature dependence helps pave the way for further electrolyte-gated transistor-based neuromorphic applications.

Here, we report on the configuration of horizontally aligned ZnO-nanowires-based metallic cavity ensemble with a light to dark current ratio of similar to 1000. An enhanced polarization photodetection ratio of transverse electric (TE) to transverse magnetic (TM) was experimentally observed compared to the single ZnO nanowire photodetector. Finite difference time domain simulation was performed on the metallic cavities, showing the distinct resonance behaviors under TE and TM light. The confinement by the multi-reflection and optical resonances between the metallic claddings contribute to the high anisotropy ratio. Furthermore, the polarized light absorption in the metallic cavity was studied as well as in the naked nanowire, which reveal a significant dependence on the cavity diameter and wavelength. For the metallic cavities, the absorption ratio of TE to TM show an enhanced value in the range of 300-500 nm wavelength and 85-150 diameter and a reversed value in the range of 400-500 nm wavelength and 17-50 diameter. While for the naked nanowires, the ratio show an apparently opposite value in these two regions. The presented metallic cavities demonstrate a specific paradigm of optical engineering in nanoscale and potentially helps the development of optoelectronic devices.

New approach to moisture accumulation assessment	MATERIALS & DESIGN												We suggest an innovative approach to simulate moisture buildup on structures with arbitrary geometries and different surface adhesion characteristics. Using 3D particle physics, rain, snow and freezing rain buildup on flat and cylindrical surfaces was assessed. The numerically simulated moisture accumulations were subsequently successfully verified experimentally through a series of outdoor and indoor moisture accumulation experiments. We also conducted molecular dynamics simulations to assess how hydrogen bonds influence snow and rain adhesion on high and low energy substrates. The simulations supported the experimental observations, namely that freezing rain results in increased moisture adhesion and accumulation due to the spreading of the water droplets, resulting in more hydrogen bonds between water droplets and substrates than snow.

Distribution of Hydrogen Concentration in a Compact Specimen Under the Conditions of Electrolytic Hydrogenation	MATERIALS SCIENCE												We propose a computational model for the evaluation of the distribution of hydrogen concentration in a compact specimen under the conditions of its electrolytic hydrogenation. The compact specimen is modeled by a parallelepiped whose surface opposite to the crack tip is immersed in the electrolyte down to a certain depth. The specimen is hydrogenated through this surface. The applied mathematical model is based on the Fick equation with initial and boundary conditions. A constant hydrogen concentration is assigned on the immersed surface of the parallelepiped; on the other surface, this concentration is set equal to zero. The mathematical model is realized by the finite-element method and the distribution of hydrogen concentration over the parallelepiped is determined in the form of a function of geometry and time.

Modeling is developed to achieve 10-N damping force utilized in micro-machines and compared to experimental results that show good conformity. Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function is used to apply rough surface profile on the piston, and bounce back boundary condition is utilized as no-slip boundary condition. Results of modeling show that 140-CG magnetorheological fluid is suitable as the agent fluid. Also, it is observed that by increasing fractal dimension of roughness profile, damping force has an initial enhancement and then trends to a constant value. Results shown by utilizing Bouc-Wen model and genetic algorithm method and fractal dimension of roughness profile of 1.5 using at the beginning and the end of the piston as presented in scenario B; by applying 20% magnetic field strength, considered damping force of 10 N is achieved within 2 s, while under conventional conditions, using the smooth surface area of piston, more damping time is needed and more electrical energy is used than the developed model.

Ti15Mo alloy was produced by milling in a mechanical alloying device for 120 min. The alloys produced are examined using SEM, X-ray diffraction, hardness and density measurements. Three different loads, four different sliding distances and 1 m center dot sec(-1) sliding speed were used in the tests performed in SBF environment. Corrosion tests were carried out using potentiodynamic polarization technique, cyclic polarization measurement at 37 degrees C body temperature, in SBF, with a scan interval of +/- 750 mV and scan rate of 1 mV/sec. Density and hardness measurement results of MA'ed Ti15Mo alloy are 4.93 g/cm(3) and 299.5 HV, respectively. As a result of increasing the load applied during the wear tests, the resistance of the samples against wear has decreased and the amount of wear has increased. Corrosion tests showed that the potentiodynamic polarization parameters were 36.969 mA/cm(2) for I-corr value and 0.54448 mmpy for corrosion rate. Corrosion tests made in the environment of SBF and at body temperature revealed that there was very little pitting corrosion observed in MA'ed Ti15Mo alloy.

J	Trapezon, AG				Trapezon, A. G.			Residual Stress Effect on the Strength Estimate of Base-Coating Systems	STRENGTH OF MATERIALS												The effect of manufacturing-induced residual stresses in layered isotropic composites of basecoating type on the latter strength is studied. The conventional method, based on the principle of additivity of the initial properties of layers of a symmetric composite, is applicable to uniaxial tension or compression, but not to bending, where the latter principle is not valid. Therefore, in the latter case, stress calculation has to be based on the method of equivalent bending stiffness linking the derived strength characteristic with operating stresses in the composite layers. Residual stresses in strength assessment are taken into account by substituting their analytical expressions into respective calculation models. The reliability of mostly used relationships for determining residual stresses is analyzed. To this purpose, an independent derivation of engineering formulas for axial residual stresses was carried out, varying elastic parameters, thickness, and number of layers of the composite. The substitution of the above formulas into the additivity relation for an isotropic symmetric system under uniaxial loading does not change the latter form, due to self-balancing of residual stresses and, therefore, residual stresses do not affect the strength estimate. As an example, the axial tensile strength of an aluminum alloy clad with corrosion-resistant steel was calculated for various ratios of cladding layer-to-steel layer thickness. The results on the composite hardening are presented. It is shown that, in contrast to the uniaxial tension of a composite, residual stresses in bending loading, significantly affect the strength assessment results. Numerical results on such an assessment are presented for a case study. A scheme for determining the endurance limit under cyclic bending was elaborated based on the Goodman hypothesis and experimentally verified. All analytical derivations implied the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of the physicomechanical properties of the composite constituents, their ideal adhesion, and elastic stress-strain state described by Hooke's law.

Here, the annihilation process of the 30 degrees Shockley partial dislocation pairs in CdTe is studied by first-principles calculations. We found that the dislocations can glide relatively easily due to the weak local bonding. Our systematic study of the slipping mechanism of the dislocations suggests that the energy barrier for the annihilation process is low. Band structure calculations reveal that the band bending caused by the charge transfer between the two dislocation cores depends on the core-core distance. A simple linear model is proposed to describe the mechanism of formation of the dislocation pair. More importantly, we demonstrate that hole injection can affect the core structure, increase the mobility, and eventually trigger a spontaneous mutual annihilation, which could be employed as a possible facile way to reduce the dislocation density.

Rapid method of Predicting the Subsonic Flutter Stability of AGTE Axial-Flow Compressor Blade Cascades. Part 2. Mathematical Implementation of Method and its Potentional Application	STRENGTH OF MATERIALS												The paper considers the implementation of the rapid method of predicting the dynamic stability of the compressor blade assemblies against subsonic flutter. The first flexural mode of blade vibrations is analyzed at the design stage for a wide range of the angle of attack based on the developed database of the critical values of the reduced vibration frequency in straight cascades of blade airfoils. The multiple regression equation is developed that depends on the relative blade spacing and stagger angle of the straight cascade of blade airfoils, coefficient of the flexural-torsional coupling of the blade, and angle of attack with the correlation factor of the studied parameters in the range of 0.92-0.98. Using the obtained equation, the numerical program has been developed for the determination of the dynamic stability limit against subsonic flutter for the first flexural mode of the blade vibrations. The program allows one to find the numerical values of critical reduced frequencies as the characteristics of its dynamic stability and determine their dependence on the angle of attack. The results of practical application of the developed program are presented using the assessment of the dynamic stability of the flexural mode of axial compressors in four modern aircraft gas-turbine engines. It is shown that at the design engine stage it is possible to select the reduced vibration frequencies of the blade assembly for the specified geometry of its peripheral sections and angle of attack of the inflow upon the condition of the occurrence of subsonic flutter.

In calculations, the generalised gradient approximation (GGA + U) formalism is used with the Hubbard parameters (U) are applied to Zn-3d and O-2p electrons of ZnO. The calculated electronic band structures show that the band gap energies of the investigated structures increase linearly with increasing Mg mole fraction from 0 to 31.25% which is also quantitatively consistent with the previous experimental results. In addition, the electron effective masses of investigated MgxZn1-xO structures are calculated. The electron effective masses of investigated structures show an increment linearly with increasing Mg mole fractions. The optical results show that the absorption edges of the structures move toward the higher energies region as the Mg mole fractions increase.

Two different melts are examined. Ferrite growth was assumed to take place under paraequilibrium conditions. The study involves the measurement of the temperature of ferrite precipitation start under slow cooling conditions by DSC. Thermo-Calc was used to calculate the equilibrium concentration of Si at the ferrite precipitation start temperature. Calculated Si concentrations are compared to microsegregation profiles measured on the same alloys in a previous study. The results led to conclude that partitioning of Silicon does not represent a constraint for ferrite to grow between the upper and lower limits of the three-phase field, contradicting some of the existing literature.

In this paper, a new gradient calcination process through four-step temperature gradients is applied to synthesize LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 material synthesized by gradient calcination shows more excellent electrochemical performance than traditional method.

In addition, the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode produced by gradient calcination presents the highest initial capacity (177.9 mAh g(-1)) and a retention of 82.07% after 100 cycles at 0.2C. And the material shows the best electrochemical properties when the final temperature in these steps is 820 degrees C.

The samples of steel were cut out from the straight part and from the zone of tension in the bend of the main steam pipeline of a thermal power plant. It is shown that the degree of heterogeneity of the distribution of grain sizes in the straight part is lower than in the tensile zone of the bend. In approaching the outer and inner surfaces of the pipe, this characteristic decreases in the straight part but increases in the tensile zone of the bend, which is caused by the intense degradation of the material under severe operating conditions.

Method of Measuring the Ballistic Coefficient of Bullets	STRENGTH OF MATERIALS												The method, employing universal expressions, was examined to determine the ballistic coefficient of a bullet by the G7 standard (air drag law for the flight of a long boat tail tangent ogive G7 bullet in view of its muzzle velocity and flight trajectory descent within a 100-200-m range). The method permits of measuring the ballistic coefficient of a bullet without a specialized measuring laboratory, i.e., under unequipped shooting-ground conditions. The only metrological equipment is a mobile unit for evaluating the muzzle velocity. The relation is derived based on the experimental design by the central alternate that describes the range of point values for an examined process since the range of nonexistent ones does not permit of employing the uniform alternate. The range of initial bullet velocities is divided into the three subranges to include all points of the central alternate into the range of existent values. The above ballistic coefficient-based approach can be used to compute the bullet velocity at an arbitrary distance in the tests of armored targets under field conditions without bulky equipment. The reliability of describing the examined process is provided by the approved mathematical model of the bullet flight in air as the motion of a solid body based on the system of four differential equations of first order. Adequacy of empirical description of the relation between the ballistic coefficient and muzzle velocity and flight trajectory descent within 100-200 m is verified by determining the standard deviation for the values based on the mathematical model of the bullet flight and the polynomial and their comparison with the accuracy of the ballistic coefficient measurement (no more than 10(-3)).

Compared to conventional sheet metal components, stringer sheets show a significant increase in stiffness and therefore offer new possibilities for lightweight design. A challenge in stringer sheet forming is the failure due to instability, which appears in the buckling of the stringer in concave curvatures. The prediction of this failure mode is so far only possible by complex numerical simulations. This work introduces an analytical model for the prediction of the buckling failure during forming of concave stringer sheet curvatures under different process boundary conditions. It is derived from Kirchhoff's plate theory. A detailed sensitivity analysis of all influencing parameters is shown and extends the process understanding. The model is validated by means of a 4-point bending test and a stamping process. It can be used for a conservative estimation of the buckling failure limit in stringer sheet forming.																			1960-6206	1960-6214				NOV	2020	13	6					939	956		10.1007/s12289-019-01518-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12289-019-01518-y		DEC 2019											WOS:000500283000001

Using the data presented in Part 2, a comparative analysis of the effect of winding angles on strength for five different reinforcement patterns has been performed according to three failure criteria for an anisotropic material.

Nitrides should be oxidized in the presence of air and converted to the oxides. The synthesis of nitrides in air is a new direction in the technology of refractory nitrides. Nitrogen from air is used in the proposed technology. The synthesis occurs at atmospheric pressure with free access of air. Complicated equipment is not required. Energy consumption is minimal. The synthesis proceeds spontaneously (exo-effect) after initiation. Mixtures of NPAl and the dioxides are reduced to the metals (Ti, Zr, Hf) or suboxides during combustion in air. Subsequent nitriding proceeds if the oxygen chemical activity is diminished.

These iron oxide-based materials were obtained by a direct plasma-dynamic synthesis with supersonic outflow of an iron-containing electric discharge plasma into an oxygen atmosphere. Subsequently, they were used as an initial precursor and placed in the plasma-chemical reactor, where the multicomponent C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanostructures were synthesized under the influence of the pulsed electron beam. This method was based on the volume excitation of the reaction gas by a pulsed electron beam in such a way as to control the uniform process implementation in the entire excitation region. The morphology and phase composition of the synthesized C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanocomposites were studied.

Modification of the Time-Effective Moduli of Viscoelastic Bodies	MECHANICS OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS												The problem on constructing new time-effective characteristics of a linear viscoelastic body is considered. The initial medium is modeled as a viscoelastic composite. One its part has properties determined by time-effective moduli of the Lagrangian type, but the other part has properties determined by moduli of the Castigliano type. This model makes it possible to employ the methods of mechanics of composite materials, for example, to formulate the effective Voigt and Reuss moduli and to construct iterative transformations narrowing the Voigt and Reuss fork. These transformations are constructed in such a way that, at each iteration, the inequalities following from the minimum total potential energy principle and the theorem of complementary work are satisfied for the effective moduli. It is shown that, at each moment of time t, the sequences of iteratively transformed Voigt and Reuss moduli converge to the same limit, equal to the geometric mean of their initial values. By the example of the problem on bending of a viscoelastic plate, the approximate solutions obtained on the basis of the new time-effective characteristics found, are compared with an analytical solution. Their good agreement points to a high accuracy of the approximate solutions.

Recently, cement has become a more economical binder to modify in situ subgrade soil because other binders, such as fly ash, have become less available and therefore their prices have gone up significantly. In addition, a much higher percentage of fly ash needs be used when compared with cement to achieve the same subgrade strength and stiffness. However, cement-modified subgrade may have an issue with shrinkage cracking, which can eventually reflect through the asphalt pavement layers to the surface after construction. For some subgrade soils, a high cement content is needed to meet the unconfined compressive strength requirement without jeopardizing durability. A higher cement content will result in higher shrinkage cracking potential. To overcome this problem, microcracking technology has been developed and adopted in the field. This technology involves recompaction of cement-modified soil (CMS) with a roller 24-48 h after initial compaction to induce microcracks in the CMS and minimize the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Microcracking of CMS is not expected to significantly reduce the strength and stiffness of CMS, but it is expected to increase its permeability and reduce the potential for large shrinkage cracks. Unfortunately, the procedure to simulate microcracking of CMS in the laboratory and evaluate its effect on properties of CMS has not been established yet. This note documents the development of such a procedure and discusses the effect of microcracking on the properties (strength and modulus) of CMS specimens.

However, its implementation is still problematic due to its surface nickel content, making it sensitive to pitting corrosion. In applications, it is often necessary to modify NiTi surfaces by using organic coatings, which provides new physico-chemical properties as well as functionalities and often contributes to a reinforcement of the alloy corrosion resistance. In this work, we assess the differences between the molecular layers made out of methylphosphonic acid (C1P) and the bi-phosphonic acid derivatives: (methylimino)dimethylene-bisphophonic acid (MIP2) and 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEP2) using conventional (CG) and electro-assisted (EG) graftings. The surface modifications with the bi-phosphonic derivatives (MIP2) and (HEP2) carried out with the EG process lead to denser layers and a reinforced NiTi corrosion resistance.

The liquid phase was modeled using the ionic 2-sublattice liquid model. Only binary parameters were optimized in the beta 2, delta and tau solid phases, to fit the isothermal section at 600 degrees C. The liquid did not require much adjustment from the extrapolation from the binary Fe-Te, Ni-Te and Fe-Ni systems. The paper presents a re-optimization of the Fe-Te liquid description in order to remove inverted liquid miscibility gaps at high temperatures. The resulting phase diagrams reproduce experimental isothermal sections well, and fits liquidus and solidus data very well.

Based on the results, the baking and hot wax methods adversely affected the indigenous leather positively in the hardening of the leather. The results also show that using only one part of the leather (the back, belly or butt) affected the quality of the leather vessels, but incorporating the various parts of the hide helped improve the quality and durability of the leather vessels. The implications of the results and future research directions are also presented. This study has, therefore, expanded the usefulness of the Ghanaian indigenous vegetable tanned leather apart from the conventional usage for making shoes, bags and belts.

Microscopic and Spectroscopic Characterization of Nanostructured Topographical Surface of Rattlesnake Rattle	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												Rattlesnakes are easily recognized by a rattle on the tail. Despite the advances in molecular, morphological, and evolutionary studies about several aspects of rattles, there are no studies elucidating these nanoscale topographical features using high-resolution techniques. Here we propose a set of approaches to show these micro/nano surface features searching for patterns or hidden signatures. The results showed that the older rattle ring (segment 8) presented higher roughness values when compared to other segments. Cluster analysis allowed the observation of similarities/differences among some groups, which reinforced the strong discrepancy of the segment 8 when compared to the others and enable possible topographical transitions among each segment features, considering their linkages and Euclidean distances. Attractive forces and surface hardness were also significant increased on segment 8, while adhesion was significantly decreased on the segments 5, 6, and 7 compared to segment 1 (P < 0.05). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed typical profiles of keratin spectra considering the amino acids present in this protein structure. Energy dispersive spectroscopy results indicated possible different molecular composition on each segment. These set of approaches applied on the present study represents an array of new possibilities towards the qualitative and quantitative analyses of this type of biomaterials enabling to address several structural, chemical and mechanical questions ongoing on scientific world.

The outer tylosis wall has a smooth, granular surface with simple perforations analogous to that of the primary wall of ordinary cells. The underlying wall stratum shows parallel oriented macro-fibrils, normally found in the secondary walls of regular cells. At the contact areas of tyloses, stabilizing seams can be observed. Various types of wall openings such as simple pits, blind pits and vestured pits were present. Also tylosis division was detected.

Using quartz tube furnace, three main parameters are investigated that are: drive-in temperature, drive-in time and temperature ramp-up time. It is found that the sheet resistance as measured by the four point probe method (4-pp) decreases from 93 ?/? to 24 ?/? as the drive-in temperature increases from 850 ;C to 950 ;C, likewise, it decreases from 57 ?/? to 38 ?/? as the drive-in time increases from 20 min to 40 min. The electrically active boron dopant profiles as measured by the electrochemical capacitance voltage technique (ECV) exhibit surface concentrations below the solid-solubility limit of boron in silicon for all the studied emitters, the maximum surface and peak boron concentrations of 1.30;;10(20) and 1.58;;10(20) atoms cm(?3) were measured respectively on the emitter which is formed at a drive-in temperature of 950 ;C. Furthermore, it is revealed from the secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements (SIMS) the presence of the boron rich layer (BRL) on its surface.

The results show that when the aging temperature is constant, and the corrosion rate decreases with the lengthen of aging time, while when the corrosion time is constant, the corrosion rate increases with the increase in aging time. Appropriate aging treatment not only refines the grain of the alloy, but also precipitates the Mg-Zn phase which can effectively prevent the corrosion process and improve the anti-corrosion properties of the alloy. The main corrosion characteristics of the alloy are filamentary corrosion and pitting corrosion.																			2158-5849	2158-5857				DEC	2019	9	9					1092	1099		10.1166/mex.2019.1585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/mex.2019.1585													WOS:000502830100016
J	Cao, XS				Cao, Xian-Sheng			Phonon properties of multiferroic <i>BiFeO</i><sub>3</sub>	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING B-ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL SOLID-STATE MATERIALS												The phonon properties of BiFeO3 have been studied by using the specific heat. It is found that the specific heat of BiFeO3 exhibits two peaks. The first peak appears at the magnetic phase transition temperature T-N = 650 K. This anomaly in specific heat can be interpreted as antiferromagnetic transition. The values of the specific heat (at the magnetic phase transition temperature T-N) increase with the increasing of the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g. Another abnormal peak of specific heat appears at nearly 550 K, which is associated with the onset of structural changes. Note that the second peak shifts to lower temperature as the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g decrease. It is considered that the main reason of leading to the structure distortion increases is due to the increase of the J(1), vertical bar J(2)vertical bar, I and g. Those calculation conclusions are in accordance with the experimental results of other researchers.

Impact of ZrO<sub>2</sub> reinforcement on the surface roughness, electrical and magnetic properties of the nano-permalloy	FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITES AND STRUCTURES												Ni-Fe alloy and Ni-Fe/ZrO2 nanocomposite, electro co-deposited from ethylene glycol bath, were evaluated in terms of magnetic, electrical, surface roughness and corrosion resistant properties. The properties of the nanocomposite coating were found to mainly depend on the ZrO2 particle content of the coatings. The surface of the Ni-Fe/ZrO2 nanocomposite coating was found to be smoother and more resistant to corrosion than the alloy because of the inert nature of the embedded ceramic particles. The electrical resistivity of the electro deposits increased with the increasing content of the ZrO2 particles in the coating. Magnetic studies revealed that the composite coatings have very small magnetic remanence and coercivity. Saturation magnetization (M-s) of the composite was reduced after incorporation of nonmagnetic ZrO2 nanoparticles in the Ni-Fe alloy matrix.

The output force of the traditional asymmetric microgripper is stable. However, its output displacement is small, typically half the output displacement of the symmetric microgripper. To solve these problems, in this study, we designed a large-displacement asymmetric microgripper. First, we calculated the relationship between the theoretical input and output variables based on their geometric relationship. Then, we analyzed the performance of the microgripper using finite element software. Lastly, we used a piezoelectric actuator as the input driver of the microgripper. The errors associated with the theoretical and simulated output displacements were 7.05% and 924%, respectively. At 150 V of driving voltage, the maximum output displacement was 224 pm, and the actual magnification was 11.2 times. Microparts can be gripped in parallel and stably, which confirms the validity of the design. Copyright (C) 2019 Tianjin University.

Rails under stress conditions undergo microstructural changes, and these cause degradations of the structural integrity and lifetime of rails. In this study, three different rails (newly-manufactured rail, newly-manufactured head-hardened rail, and worn (used) rail) were compared to examine the effects of heat treatment and repeated wheel-rail contact stress on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of continuous welded rail. The crystal structure, constituent phase distribution, tensile property, and hardness were investigated at various locations along a cross section of the rails. All three rails consisted of a mixture of BCC and FCC crystal structures as a majority phase with a very small amount of cementite (Fe3C) as a minor phase. Rietveld analysis revealed that the weighted fractions of the BCC crystal structure were approximately 74%, 64%, and 85% for the new rail, head-hardened rail, and worn rail, respectively. While the web and foot areas of the three rails showed no significant differences in mechanical properties, the railheads of the three rails revealed much higher yield strength, tensile strength, and hardness. The highest tensile strength and hardness were measured at the railhead in the head-hardened rail, and were attributed to the evolution of the bainite phase, generated by additional heat treatment. The higher mechanical strength of the railhead of the worn rail is thought to have resulted from a combination of work hardening and smaller lamellar spacing of the pearlite phase, induced by repeated wear processes during train operation.					, LIm NH/GWW-0432-2022; Song, Minji/IWU-4307-2023														1738-8228					DEC	2019	57	12					755	763		10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.12.755	http://dx.doi.org/10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.12.755													WOS:000502093400001

Overlooked in a paper by Einstein's colleague Sommerfeld and kept under wraps until publication of a recent book, the germane criterion points to a seemingly unknown hemispherical liemix' spiral which encapsulates the Gudermannian relating a fixed thrust rocket's velocity and clocked own-time. This opens new avenues for analysing relativistic noninertial length contexts whereby hemix-generated real-metric lambda vertical bar tau 'own-szrfaces' visualisable in are corroborated by radar path attributes, oddly a strategy unexploited in relativity. The Euclidean models epitomise not only Born's (one off) 'rigid motion' but also non-Minkowski extended medium acceleration scenarios such as the previously unresolved Bell's spaceships problem where the +/- [+++-] signature is misplaced, increment 'own-lines' and radar paths turn out to be nongeodesics, and Gauss curvature remains the same along each shared own-time likewise nongeodesic 'medium curve'.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102721	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102721													WOS:000502391000196

By slowly varying the amplitude of modulation, we steer the light to the desired output waveguide when equal amounts of lights are launched into each waveguide. We reveal that depending on the sign of the static propagation constant mismatch (detuning) between two waveguides, the launched light can be completely switched to either of waveguides. Additionally, we numerically examine the performances of light switching for general inputs and modulation amplitudes, and show that the localization of output light is robust against small to moderate variations in the final modulation amplitude, phase difference and intensity distribution of input field between two waveguides. More importantly, according to the principle of the proposed scheme, we are capable of steering the output light to the targeted waveguide at extremely low input power. In theory, our findings can be explained qualitatively by means of adiabatic navigation of the so-called nonlinear Floquet states.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102792	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102792	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102792													WOS:000502391000266

Sn?Mg alloys arise as promising alternatives due to characteristics such as low melting point, low coefficient of thermal expansion, suitable mechanical properties, electrical resistivity and low cost of Mg as an alloying element. However, the literature is scarce on studies relating the microstructure features of unsteady state cooling conditions during solidification to the resulting properties of Sn?Mg alloys. It is of the utmost importance to know the influence of the solidification cooling rate on the representative length scale of the alloy microstructure, since it varies from about 0.4 to 8 ;C s(?1) in the soldering process. In the present study the Sn 2.1 wt%Mg eutectic alloy is solidified under unsteady state conditions over a nickel substrate for a range of solidification cooling rates from 0.5 to 12 ;C s(?1). The microstructure is shown to be formed by a mixture of ??Sn and fibrous Mg2Sn intermetallics (IMC) and an experimental growth law is proposed relating the interphase spacing between Mg2Sn fibers (?(F)) and the cooling rate. With the decrease in the cooling rate a pronounced decrease in the Mg2Sn IMC fraction is shown to occur; from about 46% to 23%. Consequently, hardness, that is shown to depend on both ?(F) and Mg2Sn fraction, decreases significantly with the decrease in the solidification cooling rate.

J	Das, RS; Singh, B				Das, Ranendu Sekhar; Singh, Bula			Insight on nano-platinum-catalyzed dehydrogenation of quercetin in presence of peroxide	JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH												Quercetin (Qu), a noted polyphenolic flavonol molecule, exhibits remarkable antioxidant properties against bioenzymes like peroxidase and tyrosinase. However, it was found that under pH = 3.5-5.5 and room temperature, Qu cannot reduce hydrogen peroxide (HP) which is a well-perceived reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for oxidative stress. We found that in presence of noble-metal nano-particles, such redox interactions can be accomplished. We thus synthesized homogenous PVP-coated nano-platinum particles (PNP) to catalyze the oxidation of Qu by HP. On reaction, Qu is oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone (QQ) following the first-order kinetics. The observed rate constant, k(o), gradually increases and tends to saturate with increasing [HP](T) where T represents the analytical concentrations of the reactant. The saturation kinetics indicates that the activities of PNP resemble to that of bioenzymes and similarly, the nano-particles host the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The estimated value of the k(cat) reveals that the extent of catalysis of even 10(-10) M PNP is nearly comparable with the rate constants of oxidation of Qu in presence of enzymes like horseradish peroxidase and tyrosinase. Graphical abstract Quercetin (Qu) is a ubiquitous natural antioxidant. However, in acidic buffer media (pH = 3.5-5.5), hydrogen peroxide (HP) cannot oxidize Qu. Strikingly, in presence of nano-platinum particles (PNP), Qu is promptly oxidized by HP to ortho-quinone following the first-order kinetics. PNP hosts the reactants on its active surface during the redox interactions. The saturation kinetics with respect to HP resembles to enzyme-like activities of PNP, and indeed, the calculated value of the rate constant, k(cat), is comparable with those of the rate constants of enzyme-mediated oxidation of Qu.																			1388-0764	1572-896X				DEC	2019	21	12							273	10.1007/s11051-019-4712-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11051-019-4712-1													WOS:000502722700002

Partial electronic density of states, highest occupied molecular orbital, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital were given and used to discuss the detailed electronic structures. Dielectric function, refractive index, reflectivity, absorption coefficient, and energy loss functions under several pressures were calculated and used to investigate the optical properties. We found that Co6Se8(PMe3)(6) transfers electrons and C-60 receives electrons, making contributions to electron communications between the positive and negative counterparts on the basis of electrostatic interactions. The superatomic structures are made from assemblies of charge-rich and charge-poor molecular precursors. In the solid state, charge is transferred between the components, with a net reduction of C-60 by less than one electron (0.75 electron approximately).					lu, yilin/W-7007-2018	Li, Jie-Sen/0000-0002-5230-2874													2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102595	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102595													WOS:000502391000074

Effect of sintering on the structure, microstructure and electrical properties of mechanosynthesized Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Dy<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> alloyed ceria nanoparticles: A comparative study	MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN												A comparative study of the effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure and electrical properties of Dy2O3 (a rare earth oxide) and Y2O3 (a non-rare earth oxide) alloyed CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized by mechanical alloying has been carried out. All structural and microstructural parameters of these CeO2-based nanoparticles are estimated by analyzing the XRD patterns employing the Rietveld refinement method. FESEM images demonstrate the effect of sintering on the grain size and porosity of both these compounds and reveal the uniform and homogeneous distributions of elemental Ce, Dy, Y and O in two types of compound. In general, electrical conductivities of these compounds are found to increase with an increase in sintering temperature. In unsintered and at lower sintering temperatures the total conductivity value of Y2O3 alloyed compound is less than that of Dy(2)O(3 )alloyed compound and becomes higher when sintered at 1100 degrees C. Electrical relaxation is found to be thermally activated phenomenon for both these compounds. Effect of the sintering temperature on the relaxation time of both these compounds is compared and discussed.

The precursors with bithiazole were successfully prepared, their inorganic and organic parts were connected on molecular level. The DSC results indicated they would all exist in liquid phase at temperature ranging from 180 K to 280 K. The UV-VIS showed that a red shift of the main electronic transitions from 254 to 268 nm of PBSIBTHM to PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 14 (from 249 to 266 nm of PBSIBTMeM to PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+, Delta nu = 17). This verified the formation of a more extensive pi -> pi* conjugating system due to coordination interaction between Ni2+ and PBSIBTHM or PBSIBTMeM. The magnetic measurement results of PBSIBTHM-Ni2+ and PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+ reflected they both exhibited ferromagnetic properties at low temperature. For PBSIBTMeM-Ni2+, it had a transition temperature (T-tran) at 160 K, and became an anti-ferromagnet above T-tran. For PBSIBTHM-Ni2+, it had a very high Curie-Weiss temperature (T-c = 253 K). This strategy was expected to find potential application in fabricating the complexes with desired physicochemical properties.

Effect on the Chemical, Structural and Magnetic Characteristics on Fe-Doped SrTiO<sub>3</sub>	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												SrTiO3 nanopowders doped with various percentages of Fe (0, 1, 3, and 5 mol%) was synthesized, determining its chemical and structural properties using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of the samples were studied using hysteresis curves obtained by an alternating gradient magnetometer. Theoretical calculations within the framework of the density functional theory are also performed to support experimental data. The results indicated that Fe incorporated into de SrTiO3 structure induced intrinsic magnetic properties, which increase as the Fe percentage increase. At 5 mol% of Fe in the sample showed a single-domain state, typical of a ferromagnetic material capable for information storage. This latter result would be due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies as more Fe was added and to the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions reinforced the magnetic behaviour of the compound.

The paper concerns the influence of the resolution of images and the size of detected objects in pixels on measurements results. Test images of the objects of a known size were generated. The values of the perimeter of the objects were compared to the obtained values of measurements on the images with degraded resolution. The process of the degradation of the references images by successive downsizing the resolution, detection and measurements were performed applying automatic algorithm. The analysis of obtained results showed that the size of the analysed objects on the digital images plays an important role in reliability and accuracy of the measurement. The author concludes that, in order to avoid a bias in measurement caused by insufficient object resolution, the minimal acceptable size of objects on digital images in pixels should be recommended.

Molecular dynamics study of the stability of aluminium coatings on iron	LETTERS ON MATERIALS												Among the available protection systems for steel, the use of coatings is the most popular and economical method. One can protect the steel electrode from aggressive media with an aluminum coating. A thin Al film on an Fe substrate has been studied by the molecular dynamics method at a heating temperature from 300 K to 1500 K. A significant horizontal displacement of individual Al atoms on the edges of the film is observed during the simulation. The film begins to "spread" slightly near the edges. This "spreading" creates the conditions for the beginning of diffusion of iron atoms into aluminum. Some Al atoms were found to penetrate the Fe matrix at a temperature of 873 K. The total energy curve of the system shows both the melting transition in aluminum and phase transition from the body-centered cubic lattice to the face-centered cubic one at 1173 K. The binding energy for the Al atom in the lattice of the Fe crystal is smaller than that for Fe atoms. The calculated diffusion coefficients for Al and Fe have a significantly slower growth with a temperature in the range of 673 K <= T <= 1500 K. To describe the diffusion in a crystal using the molecular dynamics model, a temperature-dependent correction to the activation energy is calculated. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient of aluminum atoms in an iron crystal can be represented as an Arrhenius expression with a temperature-dependent energy barrier for diffusion.

New metrics for the gravitational field of a charged and rotating mass	RESULTS IN PHYSICS												The mathematical transformations used in a previous paper by the author enable one to recast the Kerr-Newman metric for the gravitational field of a charged and rotating mass in two new forms which satisfy physically judicious requirements necessary for a relevant system of reference to be realizable with the aid of real bodies throughout all space as distinct from the initial Kerr-Newman metric. The new metrics are physically admissible for any angular momentum of the rotating central mass provided the charge of the mass is not too large. Properties of the metrics are studied. One of the metric is preferable from the physical point of view because all coefficients in the metric are non-singular except for the points where the rotating disk creating the gravitational field is located. The results of the present paper show that there are no black holes around rotating masses, be they charged or noncharged.

Modeling of synthesis pathways for diamond-like polycyclobutane phases	LETTERS ON MATERIALS												In this paper, the investigation of possible methods for obtaining two diamond-like polycyclobutane LA3 and LA5 phases was carried out using the density functional theory method. The calculations were performed in the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation. It was established that the structures of the polycyclobutane phases can be formed on the basis of layer precursors made of hexagonal L-6 graphene and tetragonal L4-8 graphene. Tetragonal LA3 phase can be obtained from hexagonal L-6 graphite with AA packing at pressures from 59 to 67 GPa. Another way to obtain this phase is compression of tetragonal L4-8 graphite AB in the pressure range from 50 to 52 GPa. Orthorhombic LA5 phase can be obtained from orthorhombic L-6 graphite AB and hexagonal L 6 graphite AA in the pressure ranges from 64 to 71 GPa and from 59 to 67 GPa, respectively. Also, this phase can be formed under compression of tetragonal L4-8 graphite AB when the pressure reaches 46 - 50 GPa. The minimum values of the energy barriers separating the structural states corresponding to diamond LA3 and LA5 polymorphs from the states corresponding to different types of graphite are in the range from 0.09 to 0.29 eV/atom, which indicates the stability of these phases under normal conditions. For the experimental identification of diamond-like LA5 phase formed during the compression of orthorhombic graphite along the crystallographic axis [001], a series of the X-ray diffraction patterns of the carbon material in which this phase transition takes place was calculated.

It is well known that the F-P resonance in a slit can enhance the transmission and performs as a peak in the spectrum. However, the groove F-P resonance appeared as a dip in the spectrum. In the proposed structure, by coupling the slit and the groove modes, the width of transmission peak can be reduced due to the two dips introduced by the asymmetric binary grooves.

(2018) and Semeghini et al. (2018). In this paper, we combined the experimental findings with the theory of mean-field, and obtained the potential function of inter-atomic interaction and the function of forces on atoms. The relation between the radial size of liquid droplet (sigma(r)) and magnetic field (B) is established based on the previous functions. From the viewpoint of energy balance, the condition under which the liquid droplets can stably exist and the dependence of the critical atom number (N-C) on B are discussed. A semi-theoretical relation between N-C and B is derived and verified to be valid by comparing the experimental values with the calculated ones. The energy balance (the potential energy of system equaling the kinetic energy of the system) can be considered as a condition under which the liquid droplets exist stably. Our results are helpful to further understanding of the quantum liquid droplets.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102697	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102697													WOS:000502391000172

The presence of Ti in Bi2O2 layer spacer or superconducting BiS2 layers was investigated. For this study, the polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 superconductor was prepared following a two-step solid-state reaction. Grains consisted of lamellae, similar to 5-10 mu m in the planar orientation and 100-500 nm thick, presenting a tetragonal crystalline structure, with space group I4/mmm. For the first time, Raman spectroscopy revealed three modes at room temperature, with no significant changes in the spectra with Ti doping. The superconductivity was observed by the Meissner effect from ZFC and FC magnetization measurements. For both samples, the critical temperature was around 3.5 K, showing that Ti doping did not change the T-C value, probably due to fact that Ti is in the Bi2O2 layer spacer. Also, the doped sample presented a strong positive magnetic moment, probably due to the presence of ferromagnetic order.

Therefore, the purification of the solvents is needed to guarantee smoother operations. In this research, the flotation setup was investigated by means of laboratory and pilot-scale experiments in the amine reclamation for chloride and N, N ' -bis (2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine (BHEP) separation. The maximum removal efficiency recorded was 51% for the largest chloride concentration of 7091 mg/l and 37% for the lowest chloride concentration of 1536 mg/l. The mass transfer coefficient was hence correlated with the hydrodynamic parameters, including chloride reduction rate, bubble surface area, and gas and liquid phase concentration. The average chloride removal efficiency for the monoethanolamine (MEA) was more than 61% due to a better dispersion of pure nitrogen gas bubbles and formation of the tiny bubbles provided in the column. The results indicated that a higher chloride initial concentration corresponded to better performance of the setup. Under the typical column operating conditions, it was concluded that a collection zone H:D of 10:1 was a reasonable compromise. The flotation setup results in BHEP separation, known as amine degradation product showed about 24% average amine recovery.

Physical properties of Fe<sub>1?x</sub>Cu<sub>x</sub> films electrodeposited on porous and non-porous silicon	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												Series of Fe1?xCux alloy thin films have been prepared by electrodeposition, using a sulfate bath, onto non-porous and porous n and p type Si substrates. The physical properties of these Si substrates such as the wettability, the texture, the grain size and the surface morphology have been investigated. Electrochemical analysis, has been carried out for different conditions. The x-ray diffraction (XRD)technique and the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) have been used to study the structural properties and the surface morphology of these samples while the electrical properties were determined using a four-point probe. We have studied the effects of the bath (the [Cu2+]/[Fe2+] concentration), the Si types (n and p) and the porosity of Si on the physical properties of the Fe1?xCux alloy. The alloy is polycrystalline and consists of several crystallographic phases depending on the [Cu2+]/[ Fe2+] ratio. Grain size, surface morphology, square resistance and electrical resistivity are found to be sensitive to the bath concentration, the Si types (n or p) and the substrate porosity. These results will be discussed and correlated. As an application, the charge-discharge characterization indicates that Fe1?xCux alloy deposited onto porous silicon is more suitable for use as anodes in lithium battery.					aziz, Dinia/I-2952-2016; Mebarki, Mourad/I-5286-2019; Layadi, Abdelhamid/T-7782-2017; , Azizi/P-1552-2016	BENHALILIBA, Prof. Dr. MOSTEFA/0000-0001-6507-3663; Mebarki, Mourad/0000-0002-9686-5345; Hadji, Fawzi/0000-0002-9249-3839; Layadi, Abdelhamid/0000-0002-1618-6407; Mohamed Redha, Khelladi/0000-0002-1052-2959; , Azizi/0000-0002-6801-8376													2053-1591					DEC	2019	6	12							126308	10.1088/2053-1591/ab587e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab587e													WOS:000499416200001

Novel NTI-based acceptors with a spirobifluorene (SF) unit (SF-NTIs) were designed and synthesized. Their absorption range (400-600 nm) were clearly different from that of previously reported acceptor with a NTI-indacenodithiophene-NTI structure (IDT-NTI, 650-800 nm). Although, the SF-NTI with the same solubilizing groups as IDT-NTI (2-ethylhexyl groups) is not soluble enough for solution processes and favorable molecular orientation properties for OSC devices, the 1-hexylheptyl substituted SF-NTI showed a good solubility and favorable "face-on" orientation in the active layer films. The fabricated OSCs showed power conversion efficiency as high as 5.2%, and excellent thermal stability. These results indicate that the absorption of the NTI-triads can be tuned by modifying the central pi-unit and that their orientation nature and solubility can be controlled by altering the alkyl groups on the imide moieties.

Convenient method for Curie temperature determination in holmium and yttrium manganite based on capacitance value	RESULTS IN PHYSICS												This study reported an alternative technique to measure the Curie temperature (T-c) of hexagonal manganite as multiferroic sample. The method is based on change identification in slope of capacitance value as a function of temperature. Temperature variation of the capacitance observed in holmium and yttrium manganite sintered at 1250 degrees C has been studied respectively. The optimum preparation of holmium and yttrium manganite with space group P6(3)cm by using high energy ball milling has been chosen in order to provide a convenient T-c. The changes of the capacitance value as a function of temperature range from 300 up to 1000 K at 50 Hz has been carried out in order to obtained the T-c value. Results obtained from the experiments showed that T-c transition could be clearly exhibited by the capacitance value for both the holmium manganite and yttrium manganite samples. The measured property values gave their T-c transition around reported value in previous studies. The ferroelectric T-c transition was observed to be 850 K and 860 K for HoMnO3 and YMnO3 respectively. A completely intrinsic behaviour of T-c was revealed by our simple and low cost method since no applied external field was used, yielding a truly spontaneous ferroelectric behaviour.

J	Haseen, S; Kroll, P				Haseen, Shariq; Kroll, Peter			Paving the way for cristobalite TiO<sub>2</sub> and GeO<sub>2</sub> attainable under moderate tensile stress: A DFT study of transformation paths and activation barriers in cristobalite-rutile transformations of MO<sub>2</sub> (M = Si, Ge, Ti)	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE												We investigate energetics of interconversions between cristobalite-type and rutile-type structures of SiO2, GeO2, and TiO2 at different pressures within Density Functional Theory. Cristobalite-SiO2 is succeeded by the rutile-type, stishovite-SiO2, at high pressures. The rutile-types of GeO2 and TiO2 are favored at ambient pressure, but small tensile stresses are sufficient to yield cristobalite-GeO2 and TiO2. The transition from one structure-type into the other is modeled using collective movements of cations or anions with different degrees of freedom for the remaining structure parameters. We find that increasing the external pressure decreases activation barriers of the cristobalite-rutile transformation. Activation barriers of the reverse transformation from rutile to critobalite decrease with decreasing pressure. If only a fraction of cations follows the collective movement we find even lower activation barriers. The final states are still tetrahedrally or octahedrally coordinated structures, albeit not the high-symmetry variants of cristobalite or rutile, respectively. The small tensile stresses needed to favor cristobalite-GeO2 and TiO2 over their respective rutile counterparts, and the low activation barriers involved in their interconversion let us propose a simple route to synthesize cristobalite-GeO2 and a new cristobalite-TiO2.

Influence of Post-Synthesis Modifications of Ti<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Zr<i><sub>x</sub></i>O<sub>2</sub> Nanocrystallites on Their Photocatalytic Activity for Toluene and Methylcyclohexane Degradation	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												The modification of the structural and surface characteristics of Ti1-xZrxO2 nanocrystallites by post-synthesis treatments is revealed as an effective way to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Starting with the same batch of mixed oxide prepared from reverse microemulsions, different photocatalysts have been obtained by either solvothermal treatment, calcination or a combination of both. Extensive physicochemical characterization of the resulting materials shows that solvothermally treated oxides present lower crystallite size and larger surface area, although without previous calcination these samples appear to have a higher degree of structural disorder. These differences are sharply reflected in the changes in photocatalytic activity for the removal of methylcyclohexane (MCH) and toluene vapours at relatively high concentrations. Thus, the best performance for MCH elimination is obtained with the photocatalysts prepared by calcination and subsequent solvothermal treatment. Following this procedure, the resulting Ti1-xZrxO2 material presents larger surface area and high Zr surface concentration with minimal disturbance of the anatase structure. In contrast, for toluene photooxidation, the solvothermally prepared sample shows improved performance, most likely due to its larger surface area, which contributes to hinder deactivation.

Here we describe the synthesis of continuous and homogeneous MoS2 in the centimeter scale by the thermal vapor sulfurization of pre-deposited molybdenum precursors on SiO2. Metallic molybdenum as well as MoO3 were used as precursors while the sulfurization was performed by chemical vapor deposition. A multi-technique characterization was employed to fully describe the deposition of molybdenum as well as its sulfurization. Thus, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning electron and atomic force microscopies indicated that the molybdenum layers were completely transformed in MoS2. The samples were homogeneous in the centimeter scale and quite flat with a root mean square roughness of 1.4 angstrom. Furthermore, its work function was 4.1 eV.

The 5% weight loss temperatures of emitters M-2EtCz and P-2EtCz solid powder were 437 and 495 degrees C, and their photoluminescent quantum yield in solution were 53.93 and 75.78%, which were both significantly improved to those of parent EtCz-Ph.

All the emitters exhibited blue light emission with aggregation-induced enhanced emission characteristic. The non-doped deep blue light-emitting diodes with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 2.68% were obtained for M-2EtCz, and the electroluminescent color purity of P-2EtCz was better than that of M-2EtCz.

To advance their potential applications, HGSPPWs are required to have tunable capability, highly reliable, simple fabrication process, and feasible integration. In this paper, we propose two tunable HGSPPWs fulfilling the requirements. The proposed HGSPPWs consist of a metallic wedge laterally coupled with a dielectric waveguide. The modal characteristics of HGSPPWs are investigated at the optical telecommunication wavelength, which shows the modal characteristics could be effectively controlled by tuning the key geometry parameters and structure of HGSPPWs. The propagation length could achieve the centimeter scale while maintaining the propagation mode size at the deep-subwavelength scale (similar to lambda(2)/10(5)). The studies on fabrication tolerance and waveguide crosstalk show their robust property for practical implementations. The effective tunable mechanism is also proposed and studied, which shows remarkable feasibility to realize multifunctional plasmon-based photonic components. Compared with the conventional HGSPPWs, the proposed HGSPPWs exhibit superior features in ultralow loss deep-subwavelength light guiding, are highly reliable, and are easy to integrate.

Bimodal behavior in fabric drying kinetics: An interpretation of modes	TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL												Thermo-physiological comfort is an essential property attributed to fabrics. Perceived comfort can be related to the delay in the user experiencing the ambient conditions and the manner in which the fabric manages liquid water. A multitude of material characteristics, ranging from the surface chemistry of the fibers, yarn packing and knit geometry, affect perceived comfort. Standard measures of thermal and evaporative resistance characterize the fabric response at steady state and do not provide insight into the thermal/vapor balance kinetics under dynamic conditions. While investigating an existing dynamic test, International Organization for Standardization 13029:2012, for relating fabric properties to comfort, we observed that the fabric drying kinetics exhibited bimodal behavior. Here, we describe the mechanism that leads to the observed bimodal drying kinetics. While the standard measures the time taken to reach steady state, we use the power profile of the modes to derive quantitative metrics to characterize fabric properties. The derived metrics are based on the observation that the heat of wetting is nearly a constant for a given relative humidity for a material, and that the heat of sorption per unit of absorbed water is identical for a wide range of fabrics. The derived metrics distinguish different fiber types and fabric geometries. The proposed metrics are easily calculated from experimental observations without requiring any modification to the standard test.

Based on this norm, the sampling planning by means of the load level method was optimized in this work. Analytical formulas were developed with statistical methods. These formulas enable a fast estimation of the sample size for arbitrary use cases. Another optimization was the implementation of varying standard deviation within the area of fatigue strength in the load level method corresponding to DIN 50100. This optimization decreases the sample size compared to a constant standard deviation.

As a result, the beam quality of amplified signal will become poor. In this article, a hybrid seeding scheme with a paired two-stage OPA system is used, where the first and second stages used the signal and the idler as seed sources, respectively. The numerical results show that the hybrid seeding OPA scheme can suppress the phase distortion transformation from pump to signal in both spatial and temporal domains. Consequently, the phase of output signal is well restored to its input state. Because of the restriction removal of beam quality for pump light under the conventional birefringent phase-matching method, this scheme had a good application prospect in high-energy OPA or optical parametric chirped pulse amplification systems.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102728	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102728													WOS:000502391000203

Influence of the inclination angle of stiffeners on folding during superplastic forming of corrugated core panels	LETTERS ON MATERIALS												Superplastic forming of thin sheet corrugated structures is of special interest in developing aircraft technologies of new generation. The manufacture of such structures includes pressure welding of a package of three sheet blanks, consisting of two outer skin sheets and one inner core blank. The stop-off coating is applied to the inner surfaces of the skin sheets before welding. During superplastic forming of the package, the skin sheets take the form of a die cavity, while the core sheet stretches between the skins to form stiffeners. One of the main problems in manufacturing three-layer structures is known to be the formation of folds on the outer surface of the skins. The paper reports on studies of the influence of the inclination angle of stiffeners on folding. The choice of skin sheets with a thickness exceeding the thickness of the core sheet by 2 - 3 times may prevent the formation of folds. However, when manufacturing the corrugated structures of variable cross-section, such as hollow fan blades of an aircraft engine, the recommended ratio may not always be implemented. Moreover, its performance is limited by the permissible weight of the blade. In the present study, finite element modeling of the process of superplastic forming of three-layer structures made of titanium sheet alloy VT6 (analog of Ti-6Al-4V) is done using ANSYS software. According to the simulation results, it was found that with an increase in the inclination angle of the ribs, the holding time under pressure should be increased.

J	Lan, BL; Chu, RJ				Lan, Boon Leong; Chu, Rui Jian			Disagreement between non-relativistic and relativistic quantum dynamics of a driven electron	RESULTS IN PHYSICS												We show, both analytically and numerically, that the non-relativistic and relativistic quantum predictions for the dynamics of a prototypical driven electron - the periodically kicked rotor - do not always agree in the non-relativistic regime. The surprisingly different quantum predictions could be tested experimentally using ultra-cold fermionic atoms in a periodically-pulsed 1D optical lattice. Similar breakdown of agreement should occur for driven quantum systems in general. Since the relativistic theory should be empirically correct, it must be used instead of the approximate non-relativistic theory to correctly study the quantum dynamics of a driven system after the breakdown time, which could lead to important contributions in a wide range of fields from atomic to molecular, chemical and condensed-matter physics.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102654	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102654													WOS:000502391000130

Three chip sizes, two temperatures (60 and 90 degrees C) and 120 minutes retention time in pre-hydrolysis step were selected. After pre-hydrolysis treatment, the sample was divided into two portions; one third was used for chemical analysis and the other two thirds for soda pulping. The reference soda pulping conditions were used on either treated or untreated chips. The influence of pre-hydrolysis was determined measuring cellulose and lignin content, residual alkali and the hemicelluloses removal. The lignin and cellulose content were marginally increased and the hemicellulose removal was higher at larger chip size. Total yield and rejects, kappa number and strength properties of the unbleached pulp were measured using corresponding Tappi standard test methods. The pulping total yield and rejects of the treated chips varied between 30.31 % and 48.14 % and 0.83 % to 7.31 %, respectively. The reject from soda pulping of untreated chips was 24.16. Prehydrolysis treatment reduced the tensile index, but the tear index was only marginally improved.

The attempt was accomplished through the substitutions by >= 20 mol% Pb(Mg1/2W1/2)O-3 (PMW) at the presence of additional 20 mol% Pb(Fe2/3W1/3)O-3 (PFW). The perovskite formation yields were 0% (0.8PZW-0.2PFW), 88.3% (0.6PZW-0.2PMW-0.2PFW), and >= 99.7% (virtually completed state) at higher levels of substituent PMW. Lattice parameters of the perovskite structure decreased nearly linearly with increasing fractions of Mg. Developed microstructures of the sintered ceramics mostly revealed well-developed perovskite grains with a multi-faceted polyhedral morphology. Their fracture modes were virtually intergranular. Frequency-dependent dielectric dispersion behaviors, with diffuse modes in the phase transition, were observed at the modified composition range. Values of the maximum dielectric constant increased sharply at an intermediate composition range, whereas corresponding temperatures were comparatively insensitive to the compositional change.																			1385-3449	1573-8663				DEC	2019	43	1-4					20	25		10.1007/s10832-019-00177-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10832-019-00177-4													WOS:000501498500003

The apparent activation energy tested at 523 K is estimated to be 103 kJ mol(?1), indicating that grain-boundary sliding (GBS) associated with grain boundary diffusion is the dominant deformation mechanism of the fine-grained ZK60 alloy. The effects of deformation temperature and strain rate on the strain-hardening and strain-softening behaviors are analyzed by the K-M approach.

In this paper, an extruded composites containing trace amounts of Sc, Zr and graphene was prepared. Then all samples were extruded into round bars with a final diameter of 6.3 mm. Research results show that the UTS of one stage aging is 1812.7 MPa and the elongation is 21.4%. The hardness increases rapidly from 25.8HB(Brinell hardness) to 69.8HB within the first 12 h when the aging temperature at 280 C. During the secondly stage aging, a peak electrical conductivity of 58.5%IACS(International annealed copper standard, 100%IACS=58.0 MS m(?1)), which is obtained after a secondary aging at 380 C for 48 h. A large number of nano-sized precipitates phase with smaller diameter are uniformly distributed throughout the matrix after aging at 280 C for 24 h.

Through symbolic computation, the analytic N-soliton solutions are obtained for the system. The N-soliton solutions can be used to describe the multiple wrinkles in graphene sheets. Furthermore, wrinkle propagation and interaction are discussed. Snake-, V- and Z-like wrinkles are observed graphically by choosing the heat transmission function as three specific functions. A collision between wrinkles is elastic. Before and after the collision, wrinkle energy and propagation direction remain unchanged. But at collision points, the energy carried by the larger wrinkles will be subtracted. The research contributes to a deeper understanding to the structures, characteristics and propagation behavior of the wrinkles in the grapheme sheets, and has potential applications in graphene materials.

It was clearly shown that quasi-equiaxed nanocrystallites of similar to 50-100 nm in diameter and nanorods of similar to 40-50 nm in diameter and up to similar to 700 nm in length can be generated with (NH4)(10)W12O41 center dot 5H(2)O and K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O as tungsten sources, respectively. Introducing Tar(2-) into the K2WO4 center dot 2H(2)O reaction system effectively transformed the primary crystallites of ZnWO4 from nanorods into quasi-equiaxed nanocrystals (similar to 20-50 nm) and then nanoplates (thickness of similar to 20 nm, lateral size of similar to 200 nm) and, meanwhile, aggregated the crystallites into spheroidal clusters (similar to 2-3 mu m in diameter) with the increasing Tar(2-)/Zn2+ molar ratio up to similar to 2. Optical spectroscopy revealed that the ZnWO4 products exhibit broad-band photoluminescence (similar to 425-700 nm) through T-3(1u) -> (1)A(1g) transition of the [WO6](6-) ligand under short ultraviolet excitation and the nanorods show the best luminescence among all tested samples. Calcination at 500 degrees C may effectively remove the adsorbed Tar(2-) species and greatly improve luminescence of the samples synthesized in the presence of Tar(2-).

Therefore, the damage behavior of CMSFs with two acidity coefficients (ACs) immersed in water for 365 days was studied; the fiber structure and composition were measured. The crystalline phase on the fiber surface was identified as CaCO3 deposits that dissolved after long-term immersion, resulting in pits. Owing to continuous replacement of H+, Ca2+ continuously migrates from the inside to the outside of the fiber, resulting in a stepwise increase in the AC of the fiber cross-section; the surface pits significantly increased and joined together to form an axial crack. However, the Si-O-Si bond has no significant fracture during long-term immersion. These findings support the theory on the crack behavior of CMSFs during long-term immersion for practical applications.																			0022-3093	1873-4812				DEC 1	2019	525								119674	10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2019.119674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2019.119674													WOS:000502889900024

Therefore, optimization of acidogenesis of CW in two-stage process was studied in leaching bed reactor (LBR). The main influential parameters such as regulated initial pH and leachate recirculations with different volumes were investigated in this study. Inoculum to substrate ratio (ISR) and sprinkle frequency which had negligible effect on the VFAs production played an important part in the acidification rate. The diversity of microbial community was analyzed and great changes in bacteria and archaea distribution were observed. The relative abundance of acidogenic bacteria increased to 99.8% after acidification, which mainly consisted of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, however, the archaea population was substituted by rapid-growing bacteria and decreased sharply. The optimization of acidogenesis and microbial analysis would provide information on how to operate the LBR efficiently based on the process and microbiological control.																			1556-6560	1556-6579				DEC	2019	13	6					748	756		10.1166/jbmb.2019.1917	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jbmb.2019.1917													WOS:000482706800002

However, the gradient heterojunction has yet been studied due to the complicated process and great random error inside. Especially in the field of transient optics, the light on/off in femto/picosecond range is vitally important for high-speed optical systems, such as application in fiber communications. In this paper, the wedge-structured organic heterojunction was fabricated based on molecular beam epitaxy. The devices were combined with both wedge-structured heterojunction and half-wave plate. When the probe light was tuned to 2.0 eV, a narrow passband was instantly observed once the pump and probe light were perpendicular to each other. The photoresponse can be achieved within 0.84 ps which can tune the optical signals on and off in transient optics. The results have demonstrated an exciting application in photo sensing.

The potential barrier caused by large value of roughness was put forward to explain the appearance of the CeO2 (111) peak. In addition, by the interaction of MgO film's texture and surface roughness, the reason why a higher quality of CeO2 film obtained under the P-s of 70 W was clarified in detail.

In this work, the tape-casting method was adopted to fabricate laminated Co1.1Fe1.9O4 ceramics. Their relative densities are all higher than 95%, and their magnetic anisotropies especially for Delta M-r (the percentage residual magnetization between in-plane and out-of-plane) and Delta H(C )are considerably enhanced by this method comparing with that of the Co1.1Fe1.9O4 ceramic prepared by traditional solid-state reaction. It is also found that the magnetic anisotropies of these laminated Co1.1Fe1.9O4 ceramics are thickness-dependent probably due to the effect of grain size, that is, the magnetic anisotropies can be stronger when reducing the thickness of the sample.

Study of the micro-structure and mechanical properties of DZ9 superalloy after a high-temperature aging	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												The micro-structure and mechanical properties of DZ9 superalloy were studied before, after, and during the high-temperature aging by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoindentation, and fatigue tests. The obtained results showed that the ??-phase of the superalloy was significantly coarsened after a long-term aging at 980?; however, the cubic-shape morphology was basically retained for the ??-phase. Changes of the hardness and modulus of the eutectic ??-phase were not apparent; while, these properties were decreased for the dendrite arm of the ?- phase. Moreover, the tensile-strength and lifetime in creep-rupture were also declined under 980 ?/250 MPa. In addition, aside from aging, both the average elasticity modulus and hardness were higher in the vertical direction of the columnar crystal compared to those in the parallel direction of ?001?. It is also of great importance to study the anisotropy of the directional solidification of the nickel-based superalloy and direction of the mechanical properties of the eutectic ??-phase and the dendrite arm ??-phase.						, Yaxin/0000-0002-5525-4396													2053-1591					DEC	2019	6	12							126518	10.1088/2053-1591/ab40f6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab40f6													WOS:000499930900001

The pin-on-disc equipment under dry sliding conditions was used to determine the wear characteristics of prepared nanocomposites. The worn surfaces of nanocomposite Al-Al2O3 nano-composite have been characterized by SEM. The hardness of the cast nanocomposite samples was measured by using Vickers micro hardness tester. In tensile test specimens, the acoustic emission (AE) technique was used to monitor the acoustic energy released during the deformation process and for the early crack detection of the composite material. The investigation shows that Al- 1.2Al(2)O(3) nano-composites have improved wear resistance, least co-efficient of friction, best surface smoothness than the Al6061 matrix alloy.

Point defects created during irradiation is evidenced from the high resolution X-ray diffraction analysis. From the photoluminescence spectrum it is understood that the weakening of B-O bond led to red shift in the KB5 crystal. The frequency dependence of dielectric constant and dielectric loss is been explained on the basis of polarization mechanism. Also it is observed that the polarization decreases due to trapping of charge carriers at the defect regions. The increase in conductivity with frequency is due to the reduction in the space charge polarization at higher frequencies.						Kirupavathy, Dr. S.

Suitability of eight years kadam tree (<i>Neolamarckia cadamba</i>) in chemical pulping	NORDIC PULP & PAPER RESEARCH JOURNAL												Kadam is a fast growing tree species in Bangladesh. The main aim of this study is to observe the influence of tree age of kadam on chemical pulping. In this research 8, 18 and 30 years old kadam wood were pulped under different active alkali of 16, 18 and 19% maintaining 25% sulphidity and its effect on chemical composition, kappa number, pulp yield and delignification was investigated. The result shows that the content of extractive, lignin, alpha-cellulose and hemicellulose increase to different content along with the increase of tree age. There are also some differences of pulping properties with different tree age. Pulp yield of 8 years old kadam is higher than other ages of kadam trees. The hand sheets were made and the physical strength properties likely tear, tensile and burst were evaluated at two freeness level. The pulps produced from 8 year kadam tree obsessed reasonable strength properties. These could be used for producing moderate quality writing, printing and wrapping papers. Pulp wood of 8 years kadam is more suitable for pulping, compared to that 18 and 30 years.																			0283-2631	2000-0669				DEC	2019	34	4					417	421		10.1515/npprj-2019-0041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/npprj-2019-0041													WOS:000497995600002

The tube was subjected to different conditions. First, the empty tube was tested. Then the tube was filled with different amounts of stationary water (i.e., 25, 50, 75, and 100% full), based on the inner volume of the tube. Finally, flowing water through the tube was considered. Different magnitudes of impact loading were also applied. The study was primarily conducted experimentally with some additional numerical studies completed to further understand the results. The impact force as well as strain along the tube were measured for all described test conditions. Their results were compared. Additionally, the vibrational frequency and damping of the system were examined using strain-time histories. The results showed that the dynamic behavior of the tube was significantly dependent on the amount of internal water as well as its flow condition.

XRD patterns showed a single YBa2Cu3O7-delta phase for all samples. The resistance versus temperature measurements showed that all samples exhibited metallic normal state behavior. The addition of Li2O3 suppressed the superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O7-delta more than Na2CO3 and K2CO3. The AC susceptibility measurements showed a decrease in T-c chi ' for Li2CO3 addition. T-c chi ' was not much affected with Na2CO3 and K2CO3 addition which was around 93-94 K for x = 0-1.0 wt%. However, T-c chi ' was very much suppressed in the Li2O3-added samples with T-c chi ' decreasing from 94 K for x = 0 to 83 K for x = 1.0 wt%. The peak temperature T-p of the imaginary part of the susceptibility chi '' shifted to lower temperatures for Li2CO3, Na2CO3 and K2CO3 addition. This indicated the intergranular coupling and flux pinning force were suppressed when alkali metal carbonate was added. This work also showed that alkali metals with smaller ionic radius, Li, suppressed superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O7-delta more than the larger ionic radius, Na and K.

A double-gaussian waveguide for ultrasonic treatment of metals	LETTERS ON MATERIALS												Ultrasonic treatment (UST) of metals is based on the exciting of resonant high-frequency vibrations to induce oscillating elastic stresses in the bulk of materials, which result in the generation, motion and rearrangement of crystal lattice defects. Normally, the resonant vibrations are obtained by using cylindrical samples or ultrasonic instruments having the length equal to the half-wavelength of ultrasound. In such waveguides, however, the distribution of the stress amplitude is not uniform along their axis. Accordingly, changes in the structure and properties due to the UST are different along the sample. I sere, a new type of ultrasonic waveguide based on the Gaussian (ampulla) horn is proposed and called a double-Gaussian waveguide. It is composed of two identical high-amplitude parts of a Gaussian waveguide joined at a node that allows one to achieve a uniform distribution of the amplitude of normal stresses in a significant region with a length equal to that of a doubled Gaussian region. Analytic results obtained by Eisner are used to calculate geometrical characteristics of the waveguide and the latter are refined by finite element modeling. Characteristics of double-Gaussian waveguides made of steel 45 and titanium alloy VT6 (Russian grades) are calculated. This type of waveguide can be used in the bulk ultrasonic treatment of materials to expose the samples to oscillating stresses of an equal amplitude.

Both the grain size and the relative density increase with the sintering time. The densification is through grain boundary diffusion, and the grain growth is through evaporation-condensation. The pore number in the ridges decreases with the pore size increase. Both grain boundary diffusion related flux J(gb) and evaporation-condensation related diffusion flux J(e/c)(g) increase with the sintering time. However, the former is five orders of magnitude lower than the latter, indicating the dominance of the grain growth process in the ridges. Pore shapes evolve from deformed round tubes, to trigonal tubes, and then to deformed flat tubes. The pore surface evolves from a saddle ridge type to saddle ridge plus saddle rut types. The decreasing dihedral angle psi during sintering indicates increased surface energy of pores, consistent with the 3D reconstruction results.					; Ning, Kaijie/H-7447-2017	, Kathy/0000-0002-2135-6351; Ning, Kaijie/0000-0002-3658-2511													0022-2461	1573-4803				DEC	2019	54	24					14635	14644		10.1007/s10853-019-03944-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-019-03944-4													WOS:000489150200001

This paper presents an analytical method for calculating the mutual inductance of an air-core superconducting variable inductor and investigates the impact of dimensional parameters on the mutual inductance. The proposed method is based on changing the position of a movable inner coil inside an outer coil. A variable inductor may consist of two finite length coaxial helical-shaped coils that their mutual inductance can be changed to achieve a variable inductance. The proposed variable inductor may be further optimized for high-power and high frequency applications and has the potential to be realized in matching circuits technology. To calculate the mutual inductance, a direct and fast method has been employed to solve nonlinear double integration of Neumann's formula along the current-carrying path that offers two advantages. Firstly, it reduces the computational time comparing to the area-integration methods, especially for complex geometries. Secondly, it can split coil turns accurately as well as other design details that violate axial symmetry. In the end, the Finite Element (FEM) and the loop model methods have been used to verify the results of the analytical method. The analytical and FEM results showed an error of less than 0.064% in the least compatible case.																			2053-1591					DEC	2019	6	12							126001	10.1088/2053-1591/ab4381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab4381													WOS:000502784400001

Excluding the wear regime transition and other possible factors such as oxidation, this nonlinear relationship may result from variations in the mechanical behavior of materials such as strain hardening. Although this is a classic topic, relevant issues have still not been fully clarified or quantified. Better understanding of the nonlinearity would help achieve good control of the wear of materials, especially surface wear encountered in nano/microsystems, which are sensitive to surface damage or deterioration. In this study, we investigated the nonlinearity of material loss versus wearing force, without involving the wear regime transition, for three alloys, Al5182 (fcc), AZ31B alloy (hcp), and steel (bcc). An attempt is made to study this phenomenon in depth and extract additional information on the material behavior from the nonlinearity.

Chandrasekhar			Junction edge passivation study of silicon surface barrier detectors using organic films deposited by L-B technique	BULLETIN OF MATERIALS SCIENCE												A new technique to passivate silicon surfaces using SnO2 films, produced by decomposing organic films of the octadecylamine-stannate complex, deposited by the Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) technique, has been attempted to fabricate silicon surface barrier detectors. This method of passivation is relatively simpler and can be carried out at a much lower temperature as compared to the usual passivation method of the silicon surface by growing the SiO2 layer on it. Also, the passivating layer of SnO2 produced in this new method has a good shelf-life. The detectors fabricated with a passivating layer of SnO2 were subsequently tested for I -V, alpha spectrum and long-term performance.

J	Schmid, M				Schmid, Michal			Windshield Defrost Simplified CFD Model	PRODUCTION ENGINEERING ARCHIVES												The windshield defrost system, in general, is a vehicle safety feature. Thus, its restricted by variety of directives. However, the OMEs' benchmark targets could be even more demanding as the deicing process is in addition also part of passengers comfort. From vehicle design point of view the windshield defrost system is typically connected to HVAC unit (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning). In the technical solution the windshield is heated via hot air convection. Nevertheless, other methods are becoming more and more popular, like directly heated glass by hot wire ohmic heating (heated glasses). The defrost CFD model should predict the ice layer thickness in time and space and in environmental conditions defined according to appropriate directives and technical solution. The accurate and fast modelling technique is essential part of a vehicle development, especially nowadays, where the optimization techniques area widely used and requires hundreds of simulations runs. Modelling requests are even increasing with modem pure electric vehicles (EVs), were the thermal and energy management is more demanding compared to the classical internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The aim of the work is to verify possibility to model the ice layer thickness with simplified approach, which could be beneficial from computational time burden.

Multilayers made of boron-based compounds: Simulation of optical properties and prospects for X-ray applications	RESULTS IN PHYSICS												This work presents a quantitative analysis of the optical properties of promising boron-based multilayers for X-ray applications. The use of boron compounds is beneficial due to high thermal and chemical stability of the multilayer and sharp interfaces between the layers caused by low interlayer atomic diffusion. The results indicate that the multilayer structures MoB2/B4C and Mo2B5/B4C provide a relatively high reflection up to 95% and better energy resolution SE/E in comparison to the multilayers based on widely used materials such as Mo, W and N at energies 1-20 keV.

Random spectrum fatigue of zirconia oral implants in air and saline solution	ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS												Zirconia oral implants are increasingly considered as an alternative to metallic (titanium) ones, mostly for their aesthetic properties and their metal free composition that enables soft tissue integration. We report a systematic comparison of the fatigue performance of oral implants of identical geometry, made of partially stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) and titanium as a reference group, using random spectrum fatigue testing in both air and saline solution. The spectrum data clearly points unequivocally to the operation of a fatigue (damage accumulation) failure mechanism in the zirconia implants. Saline solution reduces the quasi-static fracture strength. It also causes a marked degradation of their spectrum fatigue longevity, but it does not affect their spectrum fatigue fracture strength. Given that the quasi-static fracture strength of the tested implants is smaller in saline solution than in air, the results suggest that the maximum admissible design loads for spectrum loaded zirconia oral implants are of the order of 0.8 times their wet (saline) quasi-static fracture strength.					rittel, daniel/G-3455-2011; Özcan, Mutlu/B-2862-2013	Ozcan, Mutlu/0000-0002-9623-6098													1350-6307	1873-1961				DEC	2019	106								104160	10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.104160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.104160													WOS:000496192500025

The near-field plasmon interactions in individual silver nanowire pairs induce MPPs. The 1D PC consisting of dielectric multilayer stacks with alternating refractive indices forms a PBG in the reflection spectrum. When the position of the PBG of the 1D PC is tuned to be close to the MPPs, the MPPs and the PBG can couple together to lead to a hybrid mode within the PBG. At the hybrid mode resonance, the magnetic fields in the center of Ag nanowire pairs are enhanced to nearly 4.3 times larger than those in the nanowire pair array directly lying on a substrate. Our numerical results hold important applications in magnetic sensors and magnetic nonlinearity.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102693	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102693	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102693													WOS:000502391000168

Material safety should be considered in biomedical devices, but the effectiveness of electrospun nanofibers is limited with only the approved chemicals. Therefore, we considered the material in FDA-approved polymers and solvents and developed nanofibers using the general additives in the pharmaceutical industry, such as hypromellose, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and Gellan. The nanofiber, mainly composed of hypromellose and PVA, was applied to a local peptide drug delivery system. Electrostatically complexed Gellan and peptide were loaded in the nanofiber by co-electrospinning. The morphology of the nanofibers with different PVA blending ratios was visualized by scanning electron microscope. The nanofiber composed of only hydrophilic polymers quickly wetted in water and became a transparent gel-like lump. A drug release test of peptide-loaded nanofiber was performed resulted in 37% of initial burst release suppression with the gellan and peptide loaded nanofiber compared with solely peptide loaded hypromellose nanofiber. In addition, higher PVA blending to hypromellose was slightly effective for sustained release of peptide compared with pure peptide-loaded hypromellose nanofiber. Therefore, we suggest the potential application of hypromellose/PVA nanofiber-loaded Gellan/peptide complex to a mucosal layer drug delivery patch.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				DEC	2019	19	12					7920	7925		10.1166/jnn.2019.16860	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.16860								31196310					WOS:000473105800057

J	Sun, R; Zhong, DM; Li, WG				Sun, Rui; Zhong, Deming; Li, Weigang			Formal system interactive failure analysis method based on systems theoretic process analysis model	ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS					8th International Conference on Engineering Failure Analysis (ICEFA)	JUL 08-11, 2018	Budapest, HUNGARY					Interactive failures are failures caused by two or more components that often occur in complex systems when the system is modified, upgraded, or simply designed inadequately. However, the official guideline provided, namely, common cause analysis, cannot discover these problems. It cannot establish a complex interactive system model, nor can it provide a unified analysis method for all parts of the system. Another method, systems theoretic process analysis, is limited to the control system. To solve this problem, a method called system theoretic formal analysis method (STFAM) is proposed in this paper. STFAM establishes a system-component-interactive model that provides an abundance of interactive information for failure analysis and presents a unified model to support the analysis of multiple components in the system. It is divided into three steps. First, a hierarchical system structure is built and then transformed into a formalized state machine. Next, the interactive failures are determined and converted into a linear temporal logic or computation tree logic model. Finally, NuSMV is used to verify the model and record the results. To evaluate the proposed method, a practical problem that occurred in full-authority digital engine control, in which in some cases, the valve closes for unknown reasons until the system is reset is presented. An analysis of the issue demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.																			1350-6307	1873-1961				DEC	2019	106								104141	10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.08.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.08.007													WOS:000496192500006

In contrast to the conventional elemental density-based topology optimization approaches, this method employs an analysis-mesh-separated material density field discretization model to describe the topology evolution of bi-material structures within the design domain. To be specific, the density design variable points can be freely positioned, independently of the field points used for discretization of the displacement field. By this means, a material interface description of relatively high quality can be achieved, even when unstructured finite element meshes and irregular-shaped elements are used in discretization of the analysis domain. Numerical examples, regarding the minimum static compliance design and the maximum fundamental eigen-frequency design, are presented to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed formulation and numerical techniques. It is shown that this method is free of numerical difficulties such as checkerboard patterns and the "islanding" phenomenon.

Dislocation structures forming due to an interaction of slip band with an elastic field of wedge disclination	LETTERS ON MATERIALS												Rotational-type mesodefects - strain induced junction disclination, are formed at joints and ledges of high-angle grain boundaries during plastic deformation of polycrystals. The strength of these mesodefects increases with deformation and, as a result, they create non-uniform elastic stress fields, which significantly affect the processes of structure formation, strain hardening and material's fracture. In the present work, the interaction of a slip band propagating in a grain body under the action of an external stress field with an elastic field of wedge disclination is investigated by the discrete dislocation dynamics simulation method. The simulation results show that the behavior of the front of the band has common regularities. For a given distance between the slip band and the disclination y(0), the behavior of the dislocation cluster in the front of the band essentially depends on the distance between the slip planes of the dislocations h. For small h(c), it is similar to the behavior of a dislocation pile-up. However, the maximum density of dislocations occurs not in the head of the cluster, as in the classical blocked dislocation pile-up, but in its central part. An increase in the distance h between dislocations slip planes leads to a "splitting" of the front of the band. For larger h the front of the band transforms into a broken from both sides dislocation wall. The minimal distance h e above which such dislocation wall is formed, depends on the disclination strength omega(0) and the distance y(0). The maximal misorientation of the wall is equal to the disclination strength omega(0) at y(0) = 0. With an increase in the external stress, the wall overcomes the force barrier of the disclination and moves as a whole to the lateral surface of the crystal. Multiple reiteration of this process leads to the possible appearance of the system of broken from both sides dislocation walls in the body of grain.																			2218-5046	2410-3535				DEC	2019	9	4					409	413		10.22226/2410-3535-2019-4-409-413	http://dx.doi.org/10.22226/2410-3535-2019-4-409-413													WOS:000501586400007

The chemical composition, morphology, structure and magnetic properties of the deposits were studied using SEM-EDX, XRD and AGFM techniques. The EDX results showed that the Ni?Fe?P coatings can be classified into two categories named low Fe content and high Fe content. Magnetic hysteresis loops displayed a soft magnetic character for all the deposited coatings. XRD and AGFM results revealed that the High Fe content coatings present a crystalline structure and high saturation magnetization, Ms, while those with low Fe content exhibited an amorphous structure with low Ms values. The central composite design (CCD) methodology using the ANalysis Of VAriances (ANOVA) and the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) have been applied to investigate the main and the interaction effects of several electroplating parameters on the crystalline phase proportion, CP, and the saturation magnetization, Ms, of the deposits. The ANOVA results showed that Fe/Ni ratio and pH are the most significant factors on the studied properties. A relationship between the factors and the studied responses (CP and Ms) has been established via a linear and quadratic model. A perfect agreement between the experimental and the predicted values is confirmed by high correlation coefficient values: R-2;=;0.97 for CP and 0.92 for Ms. The optimal factors required for the best properties of Fe?Ni?P coatings have been determined by the desirability function.					; NEMAMCHA, Abderrafik/P-7522-2016; MOUMENI, Hayet/P-7529-2016	Rehspringer, Jean-Luc/0000-0002-8997-958X; NEMAMCHA, Abderrafik/0000-0003-3133-2035; MOUMENI, Hayet/0000-0002-5315-4121														2053-1591				DEC	2019	6	12							126413	10.1088/2053-1591/ab58a4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab58a4													WOS:000499425300001

Conducting indium oxide films on plastic substrates by plasma enhanced reactive thermal evaporation	THIN SOLID FILMS												This work reports on low temperature deposition of conducing indium oxide films by a radio-frequency plasma enhanced reactive thermal evaporation (rf-PERTE) technique. The films were deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) without intentional heating of the substrate and at elevated temperatures up to 150 degrees C. The material stoichiometry was accurately controlled by adjusting deposition conditions including the oxygen flow, process pressure, pumping speed, and RF-power. Besides, fine turning of the critical deposition parameters during the deposition was implemented by measuring the variation of film conductance in-situ. The film morphology was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Hall effect measurements were also performed to determine the relation between the deposition conditions and the electrical properties of the films. A resistivity of 4 x 10(-4) Omega-cm was reached under optimized deposition conditions. A 250 nm-thick coating with 16 Omega/sq sheet resistance shows an 82% peak value of transmittance in the visible spectral range.

J	Wang, D; Wu, MS				Wang, Dong; Wu, Mao See			Elastic buckling analysis of an embedded infinitely long rod under combined axial and torsional loads	MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS												In this paper, expressions for the critical axial-torsional loads are derived for the buckling of an elastic rod embedded in an elastic medium. The derivation is based on the assumption that the deforming rod encounters a response force from the surrounding medium, and a first-order perturbation analysis of the governing equilibrium equations. It is shown that a dimensionless universal buckling relationship, independent of material and geometry, exists between the critical axial load, both in compression and tension, and the critical torsional load. A reducing axial compression, or an increasing axial tension, enhances the critical torsional load. In addition, two different mode shapes are predicted for the same critical combined loads, and the buckled shapes are generally three-dimensional.

This study constructs a drug delivery system with Zn(II)-Co(II) bimetal-organic framework nanoparticles with encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX), a model chemotherapeutic molecule. Beyond conventional therapeutic mechanisms powered by DOX, the newly applied Co(II) to the drug delivery system catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a Fenton-like process, leading to necrosis due to oxidative stress beyond threshold. The system displayed DOX-based and Co(II)-based dual mechanism anti-cancer therapy to overcome DOX-resistance while demonstrating significant cytotoxicity promotion in non-resistant cell lines, as effects of ROS were further acknowledged by following cell characteristic examinations.

Investigations on electronic structure of YMnO<sub>3</sub> by electron energy loss spectra and first-principle calculations	POWDER DIFFRACTION												Crystal structure and electronic structure of YMnO3 were investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy related techniques. According to the density of states (DOS), the individual interband transitions to energy loss peaks in the low energy loss spectrum were assigned. The hybridization of O 2p with Mn 3d and Y 4d analyzed by the partial DOS was critical to the ferroelectric nature of YMnO3. From the simulation of the energy loss near-edge structure, the fine structure of O K-edge was in good agreement with the experimental spectrum.

RT-PCR results obtained from 18 MM patients and 10 health people showed that the expression of CIAPIN1 gene was 4 times higher in normal human compared to MM patients. Besides, CIAPIN1 siRNA (si-CIAPIN1) transfected U266 cells presented higher proliferation ratio and superior colony forming ability than U266 cells and U266 cells transfected with non-coding siRNA (controls) evaluated by CCK8 test and soft agar colony formation assay, respectively. In a mice MM xenograft model, the si-CIAPIN1 transfected U266 cells induced the biggest tumor compared to the controls. Furthermore, CIAPIN1 over-expressed U266 cells were developed and compared with the si-CIAPIN1 transfected U266 cells to study the role of CIAPIN1 in the production of apoptosis related proteins in U266 cells. Results indicated that CIAPIN1 facilitated apoptosis promoting proteins expression in U266 cells, such as upregulation of BAX, BAK, Bcl-xs and BIM, and downregulation of p38, PKC, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl proteins. Therefore, CIAPIN1 can be a potential suppression target gene in multiple myeloma.

The rate of heat evolution, compressive strength, connected pore structure, and chloride binding capacity were investigated. The results show that CNA can accelerate cement hydration at early age, and therefore improve the 1-day strength of blended mixtures. The strength at 28 and 56 days can be maximized with 1% by weight CNA addition, but considerably reduced with 5% by weight CNA. Different from the mechanical properties, the connected pore structure and chloride binding capacity are improved straightforwardly with CNA addition, which benefits the ability to resist chloride attack. The experimental and modeling results demonstrate that CNA addition benefits the generation of carboaluminate, which has high efficiency to fill voids due to its higher volume, thus densifying the microstructure as well as improving the chloride resistance. However, these aluminate-ferrite-monosubstituent (AFm) phases demonstrate little cementing capacity relative to calcium silicate hydrate (C S H) gels, thus resulting in an obvious decrease of strength with a high amount of CNA addition even though the microstructure is further densified.

Detection of torque effects in Co/Pt via ferromagnetic resonance	AIP ADVANCES					64th Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials (MMM)	NOV 04-08, 2019	Las Vegas, NV					Charge-current-induced torque effects on the magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic/metal bilayer is interesting from the aspect of fundamental physics as well as the applications in spintronic devices. The torque-induced variation of damping constant of magnetization can be foreseen from the change of the linewidth of ferromagnetic resonance spectrum. The Oersted torque (tau Oe) and current-induced torque (tau C) are induced by charge current; while the spin-orbit torque (tau SO) and field-like torque (tau FL) are induced by spin current. However, the torque effects often were hindered due to the heating-induced artifacts. In this work, we particularly pay attention to minimize the Joule heating effects in order to investigate the intrinsic torque effects in cobalt (Co)/platinum (Pt) bilayer with an applied charge current ranging from -60 to 60 mA. In this range, the Oersted field is estimated as 0.25 Oe which is much smaller than the experimental result of Delta Hr (similar to 0.7 Oe), implying some contribution from the spin-current induced field like torque. The current-polarization-induced asymmetry of linewidth Delta W, Delta W equivalent to W+Jc-W-Jc, increases from 0 to 0.15 with Jc changing from 0 to 60 mA, which is attributed to the spin-orbit torque.

It is also important to include the bleaching agent demand from the dissolved matter in the pulp slurry. If this is done correctly, over- or undercharging of bleaching agents can be reduced, which lead to lower bleaching chemical cost, lower polluting emissions and higher pulp quality. Our previous research has shown that the dissolved organic carryover from the O-2-stage varies significantly when bleaching softwood kraft pulp. The present study investigated the corresponding impact in the case of bleaching of birch pulp. Different mill configurations and process conditions have been simulated in laboratory trials, including proceeding A-stage treatment, different degrees of washing before and between the stages, and a comparison of the effects of recycled and non-recycled wash filtrates. The results have confirmed the significant impact of the dissolved organic matter, and the knowledge which have been generated can be used to understand how measurement and control concepts can be developed to improve the pulp quality control and to decrease production cost.																			0283-2631	2000-0669				DEC	2019	34	4					433	441		10.1515/npprj-2018-0047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/npprj-2018-0047													WOS:000497995600004

However, the ultrafine crystallizing batch preparation of tubular industrial pure titanium is limited by the development of the spinning process and has remained at the theoretical research stage. In this article, the tubular TA2 industrial pure titanium was taken as the research object, and the ultrafine crystal forming process based on "5-pass strong spin-heat treatment-3 pass-spreading-heat treatment" was proposed. Based on the spinning process test, the ultimate thinning rate of the method is explored and the evolution of the surface microstructure was analyzed by metallographic microscope. The research suggests that the multi-pass, medium-small, and thinning amount of spinning causes the grain structure to be elongated in the axial and tangential directions, and then refined, and the axial fiber uniformity is improved. The research results have certain scientific significance for reducing the consumption of high-performance metals improving material utilization and performance, which also promote the development of ultrafine-grain metals' preparation technology.

In this article, the structure and morphology of polyacrylamide nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). And the fluorescence microscopy and core displacement equipment were used to evaluate the properties of the expansion and plugging properties. Results showed that the nanoparticles prepared by inverse emulsion polymerization can be able to pass through the pores in the rocks due to the uniform particle size which is less than 500 nm. When the nanoparticles were in contact with water for 72 hours, the average particle size increased to 12.2 mu m. The water-swelled nanoparticles can effectively block the high-permeability layer and improve the oil recovery in the low-permeability layer. The results obtained in this paper reveal the mechanism of elastic deformation and expansion characteristics of polyacrylamide nanoparticles, and further prove the great potential of nanoparticles to enhance oil recovery in the development of low permeability oilfields.																			2158-5849	2158-5857				DEC	2019	9	9					1062	1066		10.1166/mex.2019.1605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/mex.2019.1605													WOS:000502830100011

J	Zhang, P				Zhang, Peng			Study on EEBS for linewidth imaging by a Monte Carlo method	RESULTS IN PHYSICS												A systematic analysis about the influences of electron beam focusing on scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging for silicon (Si) trapezoidal lines was performed based on a sophisticated Monte Carlo (MC) simulation program. It was found that the focus position and the aperture angle highly affect the final quality of SEM imaging. The effective electron beam shape (EEBS) is hence suggested as the broadening function to overcome this issue for theoretical analysis, rather than the widely-used Gaussian profile. However, EEBS is hardly acquired due to it strongly depends on both the sample topography and the electron beam focusing condition, which make it is impossible to be applied in practical analysis. An approach is proposed to find a best-fit traditional Gaussian profile, which can optimally replace the EEBS in the case of the same sample structure and experimental condition for establishing a database of the parameter in traditional Gaussian profile. Experimenters will benefit from this database to obtain true line-scan profiles for accurate gate linewidth measurement. This investigated result could greatly improve the accuracy of linewidth measurement.																			2211-3797					DEC	2019	15								102712	10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2019.102712													WOS:000502391000187
J	Zhang, S				Zhang, Shuai			Model prediction of melting point for nanoparticles without considering the structure	NANOMATERIALS AND ENERGY												The thermodynamic behavior of nanocrystals is different from that of corresponding bulk materials, mainly because the large surface-to-volume ratio strongly affects the chemical and physical properties of nanocrystals. Fracture bonds of surface atoms inevitably lead to instability of materials at nanoscale. From the point of view of classical thermodynamics and modern molecular dynamics, many excellent models of the size and shape dependence of the melting behavior of nanosolids have been established. However, the bond properties of a system are not clear. An integrated model based on bond number and bond strength in a system with a cubo-octahedral structure is developed to predict the size-dependent thermal characteristics of nanoparticles. Without any adjustable parameters, this model can be used to predict the melting point and cohesive energy of low-dimensional materials, suggesting that both depend on the size and on the atomic distance. The good agreement of the theoretical prediction with the experimental and molecular dynamic simulation results confirms the validity of the cubo-octahedron in describing the thermodynamic behaviors of nanoparticles even without considering their crystalline structures.																			2045-9831	2045-984X				DEC	2019	8	2					196	200		10.1680/jnaen.19.00031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/jnaen.19.00031													WOS:000503276800011

The results revealed that the microstructure of the steel is composed of ferrite and a small amount of martensite after cold rolling annealing. The ferrite grain size varied only slightly with the reduction. In addition, the orientation density along the ? orientation line increased continuously with increasing cold rolling reduction ratio. Similarly, the {112}?110?;and {223}?110?;components along the ? orientation line and the adjacent {554}?225?;and {332}?113?;components were strongly developed. The ratio of the {111} plane texture volume fraction to that of the {100} plane texture, i.e., V-{111}/V-{100}, increased initially and then decreased, reaching the optimum value at 75% reduction. The maximum strength of the steel (i.e., 430 MPa) was realized at 55% reduction. However, the best elongation and r values (29.8% and 1.46, respectively) were obtained at 75% reduction.					zhang, ying/HJB-1230-2022														2053-1591					DEC	2019	6	12							125802	10.1088/2053-1591/ab456e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab456e													WOS:000499905900001

Gradient of strength and microstructure after deformation by free torsion of metal bar	LETTERS ON MATERIALS												The article presents the results of the study and analysis of the structure, properties and deformation parameters of a long-length bar of a circular cross-section from grade 10 steel obtained using severe plastic deformation (SPD) by free torsion at a temperature of 600 degrees C. Using computer simulations with Deform 3D software, the stress-strain state of the samples, including the distribution of accumulated strain, average stresses, and thermal field, are investigated. A physical experiment was carried out, the structure parameters and microhardness in the longitudinal section of the samples after deformation were investigated. It was shown that the free-torsion SPD method provided a non-uniform accumulation of ultrahigh strains up to 6 in long-length metal bars of a circular cross-section, the formation of a gradient type structure with a mean grain size from 1 to 7 mu m and with a gradient in mechanical properties. The effect of localization of deformation during uniform torsion of the workpiece was revealed, at the same time, the temperature of the bar during severe plastic deformation increased up to 30 degrees C. EBSD analysis revealed a gradient structure of steel specimens with a mean grain size of about 1 mu m near the surface area and similar to 5 mu m near the central area.

J	Cho, Y; Chang, HS				Cho, YoungJoon; Chang, Hyo Sik			Change in atomic layer deposited Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> passivation characteristics by ozone concentration	THIN SOLID FILMS												We investigated the effect on passivation performance of ozone-based Al2O3 thin films grown by atomic layer deposition due to the increase in ozone concentration; ozone concentration was varied from 150 g/Nm(3) to 330 g/Nm(3). We found that the carrier lifetime and implied open-circuit voltage (iV(oc)) increased as the ozone concentration increased in the as-deposited condition. Although the passivation performance after annealing also improved and had a maximum value in the low ozone concentration region (<250 g/Nm(3), 17 wt%), it showed a reverse trend compared to the as-deposited sample in the high ozone concentration region (>250 g/ Nm(3)) as the ozone concentration increased. The maximum values of carrier lifetime and iV(oc) obtained in the low ozone concentration region are 1.4 ms and 656 mV, respectively. The improved values in the low ozone concentration region are attributed to a decrease in carbon and increase in hydrogen at the Al2O3/Si interface after forming gas annealing. As a result, the interfacial trap density in the low ozone concentration region was enhanced than that of the high ozone concentration region after annealing.

The orientation of nanocrstallites was revealed with transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. The TEM results showed that the graphene nanocrystallites aligned perpendicular to substrate surface. The anisotropic-magneto-resistive performances of the films were investigated under diowed that from 400 to 2 K, the film resistance varied periodically as the film rotated along its surface axial, exhibiting a sinusoidal feature. In room temperature, the average angular resolution of the film was better than 0.5%/degree, and the largest relative changing rate of the film MR ratio reached over 400% as magnetic field increased from 3 to 9 T. The mechanism of this performance was investigated through electrical transport measurement and magnetic hysteresis loops, which revealed the spin-enhanced magnetism of the nanocrystallites were the main origin of this anisotropic magnetic response behaviors.					chao, wang/J-2707-2014														0040-6090	1879-2731				NOV 30	2019	690								137527	10.1016/j.tsf.2019.137527	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tsf.2019.137527													WOS:000490974900025

Development and application of ultrasonic techniques for the quality control of concrete	BETON- UND STAHLBETONBAU												This paper is dedicated to Prof. Reinhardt for excellent supervision and exciting research. He was about 20 years my supervisor and mentor. On the occasion of the 80(th) birthday of Prof. Hans-Wolf Reinhardt, one of the most important modern measuring techniques for concrete quality control is discussed. It was developed under his guidance and facilitates the ultrasound technique for monitoring and analyzing fresh concrete and mortar properties during setting and hardening. To stress Prof. Reinhardt's merits, the developments at the University of Stuttgart are summarized. They culminated in one of the first commercially available modern test device that was the blueprint for other devices. The paper is giving also an introduction into the capabilities of the technique along with some more recent example of applications and a brief overview about standardization activities. The author's hope is that more scientists and practitioners are stimulated to use and further develop this technique establishing it on a broader range in the area of building constructions.

In the fabrication of aluminosilicates, fly ash was introduced into the batch in the amounts 2.5 - 7.5%, the firing temperature of the articles was 1000 degrees C, and the isothermal soaking time was 1 h. The investigations showed that the introduction of 2.5% fly ash into aluminosilicates promotes leaching of heavy metals, sulfates, and chlorides according to the current regulation 200333EC. The density of such fired aluminosilicate is equal to 1.8 g/cm(3), the strength in compression 24 MPa, water absorption 15.3%, total open porosity 31%, and frost resistance at least 25 freezing-thawing cycles.

During the manufacturing, transportation, and assembly processes, Alloy 690TT surface is easily scratched and it is easily ignored. The effect of added lead on the scratched surface is different from that on the unscratched surface. In the present study, Alloy 690TT was treated with mechanical polishing (MP) and electrochemical polishing (EP) to generate scratched and unscratched surfaces. With the addition of lead, the thickness of passive film on the MP sample increases by eight times, while that on the EP sample only slightly increases. These chemical composition changes of passive films induced by lead result in the drop of their electrical resistivity, and the electrical resistivity of passive film on the MP sample is reduced by two orders of magnitude, while that on the EP sample decreases only three times. Nevertheless, the thickness and electrical resistivity of passive film on the MP sample are always greater than those of the EP sample. The toxic effect of lead on the MP sample is more severe than that of the EP sample, which may be closely related to their subsurface microstructure. Therefore, Alloy 690TT should better avoid being scratched in the secondary circuit system of pressurized water reactors, as scratched behavior will result in a faster corrosion rate of Alloy 690TT with the presence of lead.

The application there is limited to the use of an ordinary Portland cement (CEM I) based repair material and to an average carbonation depth of less than 20 mm beyond the reinforcement. Concerning the repair of drinking water reservoirs, special boundary conditions must also be considered from both a hygienic and a technical point of view. According to the DVGW Code of Practice W 300-3, cement-bonded coatings are classified according to their ability to realkalize leached or carbonated concrete. The realkalization depot of the mortar and the existing residual alkalinity of the substrate are decisive for the choice of the cement-bonded coating. The relationship between the alkalinity depot and resistance to an reoccurring leaching attack of repair mortars as well as the simultaneous realkalization of the concrete substrate are not sufficiently known. In a DVGW funded research project, the performance of repair mortars is being investigated. The necessary boundary conditions for a successful realkalisation are determined and a more detailed description of the realkalisation depot is developed, aiding planners and users in their endeavor to estimate and improve durability of structures.

J	Mielich, O; Zwerger, V				Mielich, Oliver; Zwerger, Valentin			Methods for evaluating concrete pavements for a damaging alkali-silica reaction	BETON- UND STAHLBETONBAU												It is very difficult to plan the maintenance requirements of concrete pavements with alkali-silica reaction. Up to now, the necessary assessment has been carried out via visual appearance, AKR-provoking concrete investigations as well as polarization microscopic investigations on thin sections. With these investigations a forecast for the damage development is not possible. It is only possible to assess whether damage is no longer to be expected or whether there is still further potential for residual damage. The often significant deterioration of concrete pavement can be traced back to an undetected horizontal crack formation. In the context of an alkali-silica reaction (ASR), horizontal cracks can be found in the area of the joint crosses, the transverse joints and the longitudinal joints, which then extend several centimeters into the carriageway slab. The article illustrates the consequences of a damaging ASR and other loads in a carriageway slab. For the first time, it establishes a systematic relationship between a damaging ASR in a carriageway slab and the horizontal cracks in the area of the joints.																			0005-9900	1437-1006				DEC	2019	114	12					899	+		10.1002/best.201900059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/best.201900059		NOV 2019											WOS:000500258700001

For reference, the static compressive strengths under biaxial load with different stress ratios of the two load axes were determined in a triaxial testing machine.

A notable anisotropic magnetization component having a fourfold symmetry has been observed in the antiferromagnetic state in low fields. The angular dependence of the heat capacity does not indicate any additional phase which implies that the observed magnetization anisotropy is an intrinsic property of Ce2RhIn8.

First, we derive a linked cluster expansion and we give the diagrammatic rules for calculating the free energy and the pair distribution function g(r) as a systematic power-series expansion in the particle density. We also present a structured Pade approximation scheme in the momentum space to determine g(r). The calculated g(r) for distinguishable particles interacting with Lennard-Jones and hard-sphere potential in various attempted schemes of approximation of the diagrammatic series compares very well with the results of path-integral Monte Carlo simulation. Our method is applicable to a wide range of problems of current general interest and may be extended to the case of identical particles and, in particular, to the case of the many-fermion problem.

The QDI process involves B+ implantation and rapid thermal annealing (RTA) around 600 degrees C, in which the ion implantation depths are controlled regionally with a combination of SiO2 and polymer (AZ) films.

J	Kitai, AH				Kitai, Adrian H.			Seamless ultrathin rear projection display	JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION DISPLAY												A new architecture for a thin (2-cm depth) rear projection display is described. In order to achieve this small depth, a very high density of rear projectors is used. Three prototype displays using rear projectors on both 5- and 2-cm pitch arrays are described. The displays can achieve an effective screen pixel pitch of as small as 0.5 mm, which makes this technology competitive in terms of resolution with fine pitch LED displays; however, orders of magnitude fewer LEDs are required: Each rear projector requires only one white LED and a color liquid crystal light modulator. In the three prototypes, the projector light modulators utilize 101-cm (40 in.), 80-cm (31.5 in.), and 60-cm (24 in.) diagonal liquid crystal display glass. To minimize cost, no lenses are utilized for the rear projectors. An RGB LED array may augment the projector array, which provides a low resolution component of the image onto which the high resolution component is superimposed by the projector array. Edge gaps between active areas on adjacent LCD glass units are completely eliminated by the rear projection approach enabling low profile wall-size seamless displays. Display contrast depends on rear projection screen design.

It is shown that the energy stored in elastic strains increases with vortex velocity. For moving vortex lattices, the elastic energy depends on velocity orientation relative to the lattice having minimum for the velocity directed along one of the unit cell vectors of the moving lattice.

By reducing off-current, on-current decreases too in compare to MOSFET transistors. Researchers are trying to reduce-off-current so that a minimum decrease in on-current occurs. One of the methods is to select a suitable oxide for the gate electrode. This paper presents an analytical model for the potential distribution of ZrO2, HfO2 and SiO2 effect over TFET. Using the potential distribution, the tunneling drain current is derived analytically by integrating the band-to-band tunneling generation rate over the device volume. The all-clear proposed that analytical models are validated via numerical results obtained from device simulations in SILVACO ATLAS software based on a non-local band-to-band tunneling model.

The AlN-based multilayered structure on NiMnIn layer exhibits a (002) oriented wurtzite growth with columnar structure perpendicular to the substrate. The layered structure has low level of leakage current which is beneficial for reducing dielectric loses. The Piezoresponse of the fabricated multilayered structure is measured by Piezo force microscopy and found to be about 5.17 pm/V. The magnetization versus temperature graph shows a martensite transformation at about 273-295 K. The stain produced during this transformation is visualized in terms of variation in the dielectric constant of the fabricated heterostructure. The transformation region is also verified by resistance versus temperature behavior. Such AlN-based multilayered structures with enhanced dielectric constant are useful for futuristic magnetic field sensing and Microelectromechanical system-based device applications.

The shear forces and displacements are compared with those obtained when simplifying the wall by a cantilever with full fixity at the top of the basement, ignoring the transfer of shear force and bending moment into the basement. First, the influence of the basement is modelled by hinged connections between the wall and the base slab and the floor diaphragm above the basement, respectively. This will result in an unrealistically large wall shear force in the basement. Then, the flexural restraint of the wall by the base plate, and the lateral compliance of the floor diaphragm are modelled by a rotational spring and a lateral spring at those levels. Recommendations are given for reasonable values of the spring constants for practical design purposes. Special attention is given to the way in which including the basement in the mechanical model of such walls will influence aspects of their seismic design. Such aspects are the rigidity of the bracing system which influences the lateral earthquake loads, and the displacement ductility factor which influences the maximum admissible behaviour factor q.																			0005-9900	1437-1006				APR	2020	115	4					300	311		10.1002/best.201900064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/best.201900064		NOV 2019											WOS:000498919200001

The proposed SiC IGBT features a deep current storage layer and a floating p-grid. Compared to the conventional SiC IGBT, the current storage layer significantly improves conductivity modulation in the device, and results in improved conduction characteristics (i.e. lower V-ON). However, a mere deep CSL leads to an appreciable degradation in the device breakdown voltage (BV). The floating p-grid in the proposed IGBT effectively clamps this rise of electrical field, and thus achieves an uncompromised BV. Detailed study reveals that the alignment of the p-grid to the top structure does not have obvious influence on the device performance, which makes the structure easy to implement. Switching characteristics of the IGBTs are also studied, and the E-OFF-V-ON trade-off of the proposed SiC IGBT is much better than the conventional IGBT. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Bourke, JD				Bourke, J. D.			Exchange corrections for inelastic electron scattering rates in condensed matter	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												A method is presented for quantifying quantum-mechanical exchange effects within the dielectric theory of electron scattering, the prevailing model for electron energy losses in condensed-matter systems. The approach utilizes a uniquely symmetric view of direct and exchange scattering events along with a generalized interference phase to account physically for the reduced scattering rates required by the Pauli exclusion of final-state fermions with corresponding spin, energy, and momentum. It is found that existing implementations either neglect or substantially overestimate the impact of exchange interference for condensed materials with broad optical loss spectra due to mathematical approximations or physical assumptions which are largely avoidable. The results suggest that the impact of exchange may alter inelastic scattering cross sections by between 10% and 20% for incident energies below 200 eV, a critical energy range for current investigations in electron and photoelectron spectroscopies.																			2469-9950	2469-9969				NOV 26	2019	100	18							184311	10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.100.184311													WOS:000498848800001

The Bi chalcogenides are of interest for their thermoelectric properties and as model topological insulators (TIs). We show that oxidative dissolution takes place via the progressive nucleation of pits in the initially smooth surface terraces rather than at their edges. Nanometer-resolution EC-STM images show that the pit depth is generally equal to the thickness of a complete chalcogenide quintuple layer. The preferential redeposition of dissolved components at step and defect edges on application of a more negative potential after oxidation is observed.

Tuning of Al doping on martensitic-like transition in phase separated manganites La<sub>0.6</sub>Ca<sub>0.4</sub>Mn<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Al<i><sub>x</sub></i>O<sub>3-δ</sub>	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												The tuning effects of Al3+ doping on the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of La0.6Ca0.4MnO3-delta have been studied by preparing series La0.6Ca0.4Mn1-xAlxO3-delta (x = 0, 0.1, 0.125 and 0.15). Al3+ doping suppresses the ferromagnetic metal phase of La0.6Ca0.4MnO3-delta by weakening the double-exchange interaction of Mn3+-O2--Mn4+, leading to a phase separation state. Al3+ doping dependent irreversible metamagnetic transitions are observed at lower temperatures, especially a martensitic-like transition appears in x = 0.125 and 0.15 system below 4.2 K. Phase diagrams of La0.6Ca0.4Mn1-xAlxO3-delta (0.1 <= x <= 0.15) in the B-T plane are presented, in which the antiferromagnetic insulator and ferromagnetic metal phases boundary is figured out. The antiferromagnetic matrix and magnetic disorders caused by the random distribution of Al3+ ions and the spontaneous oxygen vacancies grow into a pinning center to pin the Mn moments. As magnetic field is increased to the critical field, the localized magnetic moments rotate to parallel to the magnetic field direction, leading to a martensitic-like transition.

The rheological properties of 35 and 40 vol% slips were studied. The densification, microstructure as well as hardness and fracture toughness were investigated as a function of CaPSi glass content at 1300 degrees C-1500 degrees C. The optimum NH(4)PA concentration of 35 vol% AY-TZP5 and AY-TZP10 slips at pH similar to 9 was found to be about 43% and 67% greater than that of AY-TZP slips; this behavior was related to the greater amounts of Ca2+ ions leached out from the CaPSi glass surface. The viscosity of stabilized 40 vol% slips with NH(4)PA attained a minimum value at 5.4 vol% CaPSi glass addition, and resulted in a more dense packing of cast samples. AY-TZP5 can be sintered at a lower temperature (1300 degrees C) compared to that of AY-TZP. AY-TZP5 exhibited a fine microstructure of tetragonal ZrO2 (grain sizes below 0.3 mu m), and ZrSiO4-Ca2P2O7 particles homogeneously distributed within the zirconia matrix. It presented similar fracture toughness and a slightly lower hardness compared to those of AY-TZP.																			1546-542X	1744-7402				MAY	2020	17	3					1141	1154		10.1111/ijac.13420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijac.13420		NOV 2019											WOS:000498175100001

In this paper, we propose nanolayer-embedded compact pseudo-photonic crystals (PPCs) that enable strong interaction between ultrathin nanolayers and photonic crystal modes. In typical two-dimensional slab photonic crystals, the transverse-magnetic (TM) photonic crystal bandgap is not well formed, making it difficult to operate the TM photonic crystal waveguide modes. However, by utilizing the low-frequency TM PPC bands, a long propagation TM waveguide mode, a slow TM waveguide mode, and a TM photonic bandgap are all readily available. In particular, the insertion of a nanometer-thick low-refractive-index layer in the vertical center of TM PPC waveguide can localize the electric fields tightly in nanometer space, causing strong field interaction with the inserted nanolayer material. Using the TM slow light near PPC band edges, field interaction with the nanolayer is significantly enhanced. We can also realize nanolayer-embedded high-quality-factor (Q-factor > 10(4)) PPC cavities using the TM PPC bandgap. We believe that the proposed TM PPCs will play an important role in the strong interaction of ultrathin nanolayer materials with photonic crystal modes.

The fatigue-fracture diagrams were experimentally established for the model 65G wheel steel under the mode II and mode I conditions.

We also studied the dependence of residual service life on the operating and geometric parameters, such as friction/lubrication in the zone of contact between the wheel and the rail, friction between the crack faces, the depth of location of initially rectilinear cracks, and the intensity of loading of the rolling couple. The shapes and dimensions of exfoliations are also predicted.

Gas stuffing of grain boundaries is widely used to strengthen conventional polycrystalline TiN and TaN barriers. Alternatively, a self-formed MnOx layer derived typically from sputter-deposited Cu(Mn) alloy film is a viable barrier. However, vacuum plasma generated during Cu(Mn) deposition tends to damage porous dielectric materials. Thus, this study combines the two approaches, proposing a strategy to enhance reliability of copper/porous carbon-doped organosilica (p-SiOCH) metallization systems using nitrogen stuffed p-SiOCH and bias-filter sputter deposited Mn2O3. An ultrathin (1-4 nm) Mn2O3 film, deposited by reactive sputtering with a biased-filter mechanism on nitrogen-stuffed p-SiOCH (p-SiOCH(N)), was proposed as a barrier layer to prevent Cu from diffusion. Electrical properties of the samples were evaluated by capacitance-voltage and current density-electric field measurements. The bias-filter mechanism eliminated plasma damage of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. Furthermore, stabilization annealing converted Mn2O3 to Mn2O3-x(N) (manganese sub-oxynitride), giving the highest barrier performance for the Cu metallization layer, while maintaining the pristine dielectric properties of the p-SiOCH(N) layers. The Cu/Mn2O3-x(N)/p-SiOCH(N) structure also exhibited extremely low leakage currents after reliability tests, indicting their applicability to Cu metallization.

A zwitterionic polymer that consists of both cationic and anionic functionalities have been reported as an effective material to achieve these goals, likely resulted from the strongly-adsorbed hydration layer after being immersed in the physiological environment. In this investigation, a novel beta-thiopropionate-based zwitterionic monomer, 2-ammonio-3-((3-(2-hydroxy-3-(methacryloyloxy)propoxy)-3-oxopropyl)thio)-3-methylbutanoate (DPAMA), was synthesized through a facial process. And then the hydrophobic polypropylene was surface modified with this novel zwitterionic polymer through the surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization technique. Surface characterization analyses have been employed to investigate the modified surface properties in each reaction stage.

It is assumed that the material undergoes large deflection with small strains. The von Mises yield criterion is used to evaluate the plastic zone and is supposed to have elastic-perfectly plastic material behaviour. An initial stress formulation is used to formulate the boundary integral equations. The domain integrals are evaluated using a cell discretization technique. A total incremental method is applied to solve the nonlinear boundary integral equations. The approach is illustrated in a plate subjected to incremental load. The uncertainties in both geometric and mechanical properties are considered in order to obtain the structural response. Results show that there are high probabilities of exceeding the damage state, d, equal to 0.05 while for the rest of the values of d, these probabilities are low.

The presence of the internal oxide scale on the water side of the tube acts as a thermal insulator reduces heat transfer through the tube wall. Persistent overheating of the tube wall is a crucial issue, which leads to a metallurgical failure of the tube. The oxide scales react as a thermal insulator on the water side and reduce the heat transfer through the tube wall. Relatively thin oxide scale contributes to a reduction of boiler efficiency and causes persistent overheating of the tube wall. The growth of internal oxide scale is a time- and temperature-dependent process with a negative impact on the remaining creep-to-rupture life.

Due to the slow redox kinetics of polysulfide intermediates induced shuttle effect and reduced cycling life. In order to restrain thermodynamic shuttle effect from the source, a new-type reductive functional Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine aramid paper (TCEP-AP) interlayer was incorporated into battery. The phosphophilic ester of TCEP was used to shear the s-s bonds and accelerated redox reactions of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the porous 3D MWCNTs aramid paper can effectively trap polysulfides and provide efficiently conductive pathways. The work indicated that TCEP-AP can be an especially effective agent to cut polysulfides and improved the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. The initial discharge capacity reached 1544 mAh g(-1) for S-TCEP-AP Li-S batteries at 0.1 C. The remarkable cycling stability was obtained, the high reversible capacity of 609 mAh g(-1) with negligible fading rate of 0.029 % per cycle at 1 C were obtained after 400 cycles.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of threshold stress on this parameter. In this paper, the effect of the threshold stress on C-t has been investigated using the Finite Element Method (FEM) for 9-12 wt-% Cr steels. For all the cases that were simulated the power-law creep exponent n was fixed at 5; this was because n is usually equal to 5 for the Chromium steels. The results of the FEM simulations showed that C-t was significantly affected by threshold stress. Based on the results of the FEM, a parameter was then introduced into the equation for estimating C-t in order to calculate the effect of the threshold stress. The results showed that was constant when there was no threshold stress, but that its value increased as the threshold stress and the power-law creep coefficient A increased. The effect A had on was negligible when A was smaller than 1E-19 MPa-n/h. In addition, decreased as both the value of A and the threshold stress increased. It was also found that and decreased slightly as the level of C*increased.

Then, the CSMNSs as the dye adsorbent were applied to the removal of two kinds of azo dyes (methyl orange and amido black). The effect of solution pH and adsorbent dosage, adsorption isotherm, adsorption kinetics and the reusability of CSMNSs were examined. Adsorption isotherms obeyed Freundlich model and adsorption kinetics was described as pseudo-second-order model. Furthermore, the CSMNSs have the advantage of simple synthesis route, high absorption efficiency, rapid magnetic separation from aqueous solutions and excellent reusability.

Two-Particle Scattering and Resistivity of Rashba Electron Gas	PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS												The electrical resistivity of a 2D electron gas that results from two-particle collisions and strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling is calculated. When combined with impurity scattering, the two-particle correction to the resistivity is proportional to the square of temperature T if only the lower helicity band is filled, but the T2 term vanishes if the Fermi level is above the Dirac point. If only the electron-electron scattering is present, the resistivity is proportional to T4ln|EF/T| below and above the Dirac point, but this term vanishes at the point itself.

The starting materials including Na2CO3, CuO, TiO2 and Nb2O5 were mixed by ball milling for 24 hours with stoichiometry, calcined at 950 degrees C for 24 hours and were doped with (0-2.0 vol%) MgO, Al2O3 and ZrO2 nanopowders. Then, the mixed powder was pressed into a disc shape. The green bodies were sintered at 975-1025 degrees C for 10 hours. Phase formation was investigated by XRD and microstructure by SEM. The body-centered cubic perovskite-related structure of space group Im-3 and small amount of second phase were detected. The normal grain growth is observed and shown rectangular grain shape. Density of the sintered samples was measured by Archimedes's method using distilled water as the fluid medium. The highest density of NCTNO and NCTNO/Al2O3 ceramics were found at 1025 degrees C sintered temperature and 1000 degrees C for NCTNO/MgO and NCTNO/ZrO2 samples. Dielectric constant of the samples was examined using an LCR meter and the mechanical properties of samples were investigated by Vickers microhardness tester. The addition of nanopowders can be improved the mechanical property and 1.0 vol%ZrO2 doping sample showed the highest the dielectric constant.																			0015-0193	1563-5112				NOV 18	2019	552	1			SI		159	164		10.1080/00150193.2019.1653092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00150193.2019.1653092													WOS:000600728000017

DNA Barcode Quantification As a Robust Tool for Measuring Mixing Ratios in Two-Component Systems	ACS APPLIED BIO MATERIALS												For many manufacturing processes, correct mixing compositions are crucial to guarantee product quality. However, the analysis of mixing ratios based on component balances can be challenging and requires extensive infrastructure. DNA barcodes have been previously proposed as low-cost markers for product authenticity, and we show here that the quantification of such barcodes via a quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enables the determination of mixing ratios in a range of liquid and polymeric products. To enable the distribution of the DNA within the various matrixes, the biochemical is encapsulated in silica nanoparticles and distributed within the matrix of the raw material. If both raw materials of a two-component mixture contain such barcodes, the composition of the mixture can be determined from the relative concentration of the barcodes via multiplex PCR reactions, irrespective of the sampling volume and for a wide range of initial barcode concentrations (10 ppm to 10 ppb). As an application example, we use the barcodes to determine the mixing ratios of cross-linked and multicomponent polysilicon products.

The effect of BTNb on the phase formation, mechanical, dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties was investigated and discussed. All ceramics have a single perovskite phase. The data also revealed that there was a transformation from rhombohedral (x = 0.00) to mixed tetragonal/rhombohedral phases (0.02 <= x <= 0.04.), then to tetragonal-rich phases at x = 0.06. Microstructure analysis also indicated that the BTNb affected the morphology of the microstructure, where the average grain size decreased with increasing BTNb content. The BTNb doping produced an enhancement of mechanical properties, HV and HK increased with increasing BTNb content and reached the maximum values of 6.28 GPa, 5.51 GPa for x = 0.04 sample, respectively.

The columbite of CoNb2O6, NiNb2O6, and ZnNb2O6 and wolframite ZrTiO4 were weighed and introduced into the batch calculation. The dielectric constant of the samples showed a maximum dielectric constant at y = 0.2 for all systems, while the transition temperature decreased with increasing relaxor compounds in the system. In addition, the polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops of the ceramic systems also changed significantly with the relaxor materials content, and reached maximum around y = 0.2-0.3.

We found that administrating NP(CpG) ahead of NP(OVA) polarized immune response toward Th1. In normal mice, such administration stimulated higher frequency of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and stronger memory T cells than both inverted sequence and coinjecting. In tumor-bearing mice, more effector T cells were observed in the NP(CpG) ahead group than that in other ways.

Extraction of the short-range defect potential parameters from available experimental data on the graphene resistance	FULLERENES NANOTUBES AND CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES												We consider a problem of obtaining information about the scattering potentials of the monolayer graphene sample using available experimental data on its resistance. For this purpose, we study theoretically the dependence of graphene resistance on Fermi energy having in mind to compare it with experimental data where super-high mobility electrons in suspended graphene samples without chemical doping were investigated. As far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the Coulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering potentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The empty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical shortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage of the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We consider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit formulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution of this scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function of the Fermi energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results are consistent with experiment, where the resistance was measured as a function of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene. This fact gives a possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the basis of the available experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with the gate voltage controlled Fermi level position. It is clear to be very important for applications.																			1536-383X	1536-4046				MAR 3	2020	28	3			SI		229	232		10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686624		NOV 2019											WOS:000497025100001

B.; Mushnikov, N., V			Compositional genesis of ferromagnetism in alloys PrNi<sub>2-<i>x</i></sub>Co<i><sub>x</sub></i>	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												The structure and magnetic properties of PrNi2-xCox alloys are investigated over the entire concentration range 0 <= x <= 2. It is shown that there is a continuous series of disordered solid solutions with a structure of the MgCu2 type. In all alloys, cobalt atoms have a magnetic moment mu(Co) = 0.5 mu(B). The ground magnetic state of the alloys depends on the composition. In the range 0 <= x <= 0.2, alloys are paramagnetic at a temperature T = 2 K, in the alloys with 0.4 <= x <= 0.8, ferromagnetic order occurs in clusters of cobalt atoms due to the exchange interaction of Co - Co. Their magnetization in small magnetic fields is realized via turnabout, by 180 degrees, of the magnetic moments of individual clusters. In the alloys with 1.0 <= x <= 2.0, the long-range ferromagnetic order is established. The processes of technical magnetization reversal in them are effected via the motion of domain walls and rotation of the vectors of spontaneous magnetization. In all alloys, magnetic saturation is not achieved at T = 5 K even in a magnetic field of 200 kOe, which is associated with a large splitting of the ground J multiple of Pr3+ ions by the crystal field. Numerical calculations of the magnetization curves are performed. In the approximation of the independence of the parameters of the crystal field on the concentration, a satisfactory agreement between the calculated and experimental curves was obtained.

J	Heldin, M; Wiklund, U				Heldin, Magnus; Wiklund, Urban			Influences of load and temperature on groundwood pulping with well-defined tools	WEAR												Groundwood pulping is an industrial process with a high energy demand, although only a minor part of the energy is used for actually separating the fibres and the rest for working them. Traditionally, the separation process employs a grinding stone having particles embedded in a softer matrix. The position and distribution of the particles have been random, causing their interaction with the wood to also be random. This makes studies of the mechanisms during the separation process difficult. Knowledge of the mechanisms in the separation process helps when designing future tools aimed at energy efficiency or tailored fibre properties. Recently, grinding surfaces having diamond particles brazed to a steel backing at fixed positions have been developed and commercialised. In this work, individual particles are not positioned at the tool surfaces. Instead, well-defined structured diamond films, soldered to a backing, are used as grinding tools. The grinding asperities of such films can be tailored to shapes that are not possible to achieve by using particles. Using this kind of tool in a lab scale grinding equipment, confirms the well-known fact that increased load or increased temperature both lead to lower energy consumption for fibre separation and longer, less damaged fibres.

The creep strain and matrix cracking stress (sigma(mc)) were used to determine the creep strengthening effect. Moreover, the stress redistribution model was applied to explain the stress transfer from the matrix to fibre, and therefore the creep strengthening mechanisms. The results indicate that 2D-C/SiC can be strengthened by creep at certain conditions. The ability to resist the creep strain and sigma(mc) can be improved by certain creep treatments with creep temperature of 1400 degrees C, lower stress and longer time. The strengthening effect is resulted from the stress redistribution during the creep. The tensile residual stress is relaxed in the matrix and transferred to the fibre. The stress redistribution leads to compressive stress in the matrix and takes the advantage of superior creep resistance of carbon fibres.					zhang, chengyu/GNM-6964-2022	zhang, chengyu/0000-0001-7257-9689													1743-6753	1743-6761				JAN 2	2020	119	1					49	56		10.1080/17436753.2019.1690845	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17436753.2019.1690845		NOV 2019											WOS:000496379000001

Characterization of ZnO:Ni thin films deposited by the spin coating method	MATERIALS SCIENCE IN SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING												ZnO:Ni thin films with Ni content of 0, 3, 5 and 7% were deposited onto ITO/glass substrates using the spin coating method. The deposited films were characterized for their structural, photoluminescence and electrical properties by respectively X ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and the four points probe techniques. XRD patterns showed that the deposited films were polycrystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The absence of the Ni related diffraction peaks reflected the substitution of Zn atoms by Ni atoms in the ZnO lattice. The variation of both lattice parameters and crystallite size, as a function of Ni content, indicated that the Ni doping enhance the structural properties of the deposited films. In Raman spectra, the band at 667.9 cm(-1) appeared for doped samples, was attributed to the Zn sites occupied by Ni atoms in the ZnO lattice. In PL spectra, the decrease of the UV band emission intensity, as a function of Ni content, was attributed to Ni ions doping. The concentration of deep level defect such as Zn-i,V-zn and V-o, decreased as a function of the Ni content.

The present work explores the method of decoupling the anisotropic MPs directly for bulk soft FSMs. The small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were performed on the [1 0 0]-oriented alloys Fe1-xGax (Galfenol) under a series of magnetic fields. Those two-dimensional (2D) SANS patterns were decomposed and reconstructed by the spherical harmonic approaches. The scattering intensities, which are respectively decomposed into isotropic and anisotropic components, show clearly the pathway of three types of magnetic domains. The 90 degrees domain process is thus quantified directly in the bulk Galfenol. The evolution trend for the domain process is consistent with that for the lattice strain and magnetization responses, which has been respectively evidenced by the in-situ neutron diffraction and initial magnetization measurement. Meanwhile, the quantitatively addressed domain process agrees well with the simulated results by the energy-based domain rotation modelling. These observations indicate that the anisotropic magnetization processes correlate tightly with the lattice strain response, which are of significant importance for the understanding and design of large magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS). The present approach provides a quantitative method for decoupling the magnetization processes, which would be also applicable to other ferromagnetic systems besides Galfenol. This may help the understanding of MFIS mechanism and development of new FSMs.					Zhang, Changsheng/J-2409-2012														0304-8853	1873-4766				NOV 15	2019	490								165495	10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165495													WOS:000475764000006

The tests were interrupted at different deformation stages. The precipitates on prior austenite grain and martensite lath boundaries became obscure due to coarsening of secondary particles. The Laves phase grew faster than M23C6 carbides in both creep and thermal ageing. The dislocation density rapidly decreased at the initial stage, while the martensite lath width increased with ageing and creep duration. The microstructure variations under creep were more pronounced than under thermal ageing, indicating that stress exerts an important effect on microstructure degradation.																			0039-2316	1573-9325				JUL	2019	51	4					501	507		10.1007/s11223-019-00095-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11223-019-00095-4		NOV 2019											WOS:000496199100001

In this study, we found a remarkable aging effect in tetragonal Er3+-doped 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O-3-0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT-BCT) ceramics after poling. It is observed that the domains can spontaneously rotate to keep their spontaneous polarization direction similar to that of the poling electric field during aging for the poled ceramics. Furthermore, compared with freshly poled ceramics, the thermally stimulated current (TSC) peak of the aged ones shifts toward a higher temperature (10 degrees C). And the temperature of the TSC peak in the aged ceramics is exactly equal to their Curie temperature. Such features indicate that aging for the poled ceramics could stabilize the alignment of ordered ferroelectric domains. Additionally, a downward TSC peak above Curie temperature is obtained in both poled and aged ceramics, demonstrating that poling and aging can lead to ordered alignment of defect dipoles.

J	Yankovskii, AP				Yankovskii, A. P.			Steady-State Creep of Metal-Composite Sandwich Panels with Thin Reinforced Bearing Layers	MECHANICS OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS												The problem of steady-state creep is formulated for bent metal-composite sandwich panels with thin reinforced bearing layers. The weakened resistance of their core to the transverse shear is taken into account within the framework of the kinematic hypothesis of independent rotation of the straight normal. The problem is linearized by the method of secant modulus. The mechanical behavior of rectangular elongated three-layer plates with a weak honeycomb core in cylindrical bending is investigated. An analysis of dependence of flexibility of such structures on the reinforcement parameters of bearing layers is carried out. It is found that, at different values of the reinforcement parameters (angles and densities), two different deformation "mechanisms" can be realized in the sandwich panel: "classical" (bending dominates) and "nonclassical" (transverse shear dominates). When the classical mechanism is realized, the flexibility of the plate greatly depends on the variation of reinforcement parameters of the bearing layers. But in the nonclassical mechanism, the flexibility practically does not depend on the reinforcement structure. It is found that the minimum flexibility of the three-layer structure is achieved when the nonclassical mechanism of its deformation occurs. In this case, edge effects occur in the vicinity of its supported edges.																			0191-5665	1573-8922				SEP	2019	55	4					421	434		10.1007/s11029-019-09823-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11029-019-09823-y		NOV 2019											WOS:000496197700001
J	Berlin, AA				Berlin, A. A.			The Mysteries of Science in Solving Applied Problems	FIBRE CHEMISTRY												The solution of various applied problems usually leads to the need to find answers to purely scientific fundamental questions and discover new phenomena. The article gives examples of such discoveries. It was discovered that flammability of polymeric materials can be decreased by dispersion of a material containing microencapsulated low-boiling flame retardants on exposure to an external fire source. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere is analyzed in terms of dynamic equilibrium of the processes of oxygen production from forests and the consumption for their combustion during fires. The study of the amazing kinetics of the preparation of polyformaldehyde from formaldehyde and its cyclic trimer, trioxane, was explained, firstly, in the creation of the theory of reversible heterogeneous polymerization of trioxane and led to a fundamentally new, thermodynamic, method of regulating the molecular and supramolecular structure of the polymer. Secondly, on the example of polymerization of formaldehyde, a possible advantage of "diffusion" over "kinetic" modes was discovered. A similar effect was confirmed for the process of sulfuric acid alkylation of high-octane gasoline production.																			0015-0541	1573-8493				SEP	2019	51	3					157	163		10.1007/s10692-019-10066-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10692-019-10066-9		NOV 2019											WOS:000496119900006

Gelation of PVC is complex because of a narrow processing window. At low temperature, gelation is incomplete and leads to poor mechanical properties, while at high temperature, degradation may occur. The aim of this study is to gain a fundamental understanding of the gelation process of PVC in co-kneaders. Careful examination of the gelation state of extruded PVC samples was carried out qualitatively by swelling the extruded samples in acetone and quantitatively by differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Gelation in various conditions of temperature and shear was firstly studied in a capillary device that ensures both pre-shearing and extrusion through a circular die. This provided a reference basis for comparison with gelation state obtained in the co-kneader. Samples were collected in the co-kneader by means of opening the barrel. The gelation state was particularly examined in connection with the measured temperature at a fixed position along the screw at which a temperature sensor was positioned. The obtained results showed that the co-kneader allows fast gelation with a mixing energy value lower than 200kJ/kg when the temperature is higher than a critical value of 165 degrees C for the studied formulation.

The present investigation has been carried out in an acid solution at pH = 5. The Scharifker-Hills model was used to analyze current transients. At relatively low overpotentials, copper deposition is observed to follow a model that involves instantaneous nucleation and diffusion-controlled 3D growth. The diffusion coefficient for Cu2+ for various applied potentials is determined.

The UV light was only used to generate active species from NH3, not to irradiate the substrate. To determine the effect of the active species on the deposition process, SiNx:H films were deposited via chemical vapor deposition and their refractive index and composition ratio were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the highly reactive species generated from UV-light-irradiated NH3 enabled the deposition of nitrogen-containing films between 30 degrees C and 450 degrees C.

In order to reduce amount of platinum group metals and obtain high CO tolerance, electrochemical atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Pd and Pt on porous Au was proposed for the catalyst formation. The electrochemical ALD was realized by surface limited redox replacement (SLRR) process of underpotentially deposited hydrogen (H-UPD-SLRR). The amount of the deposit and catalytic activity of Au-Pd-Pt structures were tested and optimized on Au wire. A performance of a miniature fuel cell prototype with a porous Au layer formed on a Si chip with several Pd monolayers and Pt sub-monolayer coverage was examined. Pd and Pt loadings were estimated to be 101 mu g/cm(2) and 10 mu g/cm(2), respectively. Though the peak power was poor around 100 mW/cm(2), no performance drop with 100 ppm CO was observed and results were promising as the first prototype. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

Strong magnetoelastic effect in CeCo<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Fe<i><sub>x</sub></i>Si as Neel order is suppressed	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												A very strong magnetoelastic effect in the CeCo1-xFexSi alloys is reported. The strength of the magnetostrictive effect can be tuned upon changing x. The moderate low-temperature linear magnetostriction observed at low Fe concentrations becomes very large (Delta L/L(16T, 2K) = 3 x 10(-3)) around the critical concentration x(c) approximate to 0.23 at which the long-range antiferromagnetic order vanishes. Upon increasing doping through the nonmagnetic region (x > x(c)), the magnetostriction strength gradually weakens again. The interplay between magnetic order and the Kondo screening appears to cause an enhanced valence susceptibility slightly changing the Ce ions valence, ultimately triggering the large magnetostriction observed around the critical concentration. Previous studies of the evolution of the lattice parameters with x as well as magnetization and x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements support this hypothesis.

Complex conductivity of monolayer graphene and Zitterbewegung	FULLERENES NANOTUBES AND CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES												A recently derived formula for complex conductivity of monolayer graphene is analyzed. We show that the real and imaginary parts in this formula obey the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations, which are a good test for validity of the formula for complex conductivity of monolayer graphene. We consider also an additional test for this formula, sensitive to the integral characteristic of the conductance such as the famous f-sum rule. We write it in the two dimensional form and show that it fulfils identically if we admit the cyclotron mass as an effective one and take the principal value of the integral. We find a deep relation between the graphene complex optical conductivity singularities and electrons Zitterbewegung (ZB) in graphene with frequency omega(ZB). Namely, the value of ZB frequency is related with the recently found magnitudes of the inductance L and capacitance C by Thomson's formula, that is, omega(ZB) = 1/root LC.																			1536-383X	1536-4046				MAR 3	2020	28	3			SI		226	228		10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686621	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686621		NOV 2019											WOS:000495834400001
J	Hart, O; Haroche, M; Castelnovo, C				Hart, Oliver; Haroche, Marianne; Castelnovo, Claudio			Long-range Coulomb interactions and nonhydrodynamic behavior in thermal quenches in spin ice	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												When spin ice systems undergo a sudden thermal quench, they have been shown to enter long-lived metastable states where the monopole excitations form so-called noncontractible pairs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 107201 (2010)]. While the nature of these states is well understood, the dynamical mechanisms underpinning their formation remain largely unexplored and are the subject of this study. We find that the long-range tail of the Coulomb interactions between monopoles plays a central role by suppressing the monopole-assisted decay of noncontractible pairs with respect to monopole-antimonopole annihilation. In conjunction with low final quench temperatures, where the system enters a nonhydrodynamic regime in which the monopoles effectively move at terminal velocity in the direction of the local force acting on them, the interactions lead to a metastable plateau that persists in the thermodynamic limit. This is a remarkable phenomenon, reminiscent of jamming and some instances of glassiness: A transient modification of the short-time dynamics of the system allows it to enter a metastable state whose lifetime can easily be astronomically large at (experimentally relevant) low temperatures. We demonstrate this using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field population dynamics theory, and we provide an analytical understanding of the mechanisms at play. When the interactions between monopoles are truncated to finite range, the metastable plateau reduces to a finite size effect. We derive the finite size scaling behavior of the density of noncontractible pairs in the metastable plateau for both short- and long-range interactions and discuss the experimental implications of our results.

The whole forming process is divided into five stages. Compared with traditional tube hydroforming, the thickness can be increased by axial compression deformation to reduce the thinning ratio and enhance the forming capacity of the tube in hydro-forging stage and double-stepped hydro-forging stage, respectively. The proposed multistage axial hydro-forging sequence process was implemented by experiments along with the finite element simulation to validate its feasibility. The suitable loading path to prevent defects such as wrinkle and thinning was discussed. The results showed that double-stepped tube with large expansion ratio can be produced successfully with movable dies' design. There is no thinning in the final tube, particularly in all stepped area, and a better thickness distribution could be achieved. As a result, the proposed multistage axial hydro-forging sequence can be a feasible forming approach for the fabrication of large-expansion-ratio double-stepped tubes with high reliability.

These films might be useful to shape field distributions in passivation stacks or as dielectrics in passive components of integrated circuits such as capacitors. It is shown how such a system can be realized with commercially available materials and simple tools and how they can be significantly improved by adapting the processing techniques applied. The improved electric and dielectric properties are related to changes in the microstructure of the films caused by the different processing conditions. The experiments show that the films possess sufficiently stable properties from room temperature up to 150 degrees C, which enable them to be used in devices. Finally, a model is proposed for the dielectric breakdown of the films that gives a direction for the further improvement of such material systems.

Basically, such structures suffer from their low wave impedance due to inclusion of high-epsilon materials. To reduce effective permittivity of the composite structures, we propose to insert additional inductance into the metallic mesh. For the insertion of lumped inductors along the wires, dispersion diagram and the Bloch-impedance are numerically estimated, and converted to effective permittivity and permeability. The numerical simulation results clearly show almost 3-D isotropic propagation characteristics in a specific frequency region and enhancement of the Bloch-impedance close to free space in the left-handed region. The lumped inductors are replaced by meander-line strip patterns for practical configurations. The metallic patterned structures also achieve the enhanced Bloch impedance that is well-matched to free space.

Accordingly, a theoretical model on the martensite volume fraction was developed in combination with the martensite transformation temperature model and the hard-cutting FE model. A finite element (FE) model of the hard-cutting was established to obtain the stress distribution of the workpieces. A calculation model of martensite phase transformation temperature M-S under the influence of the cooling rate and stress was deduced based on the change of Gibbs free energy. A theoretical model of martensite volume fraction f(M) of the white layer was developed based on the M-S and the FE simulations. The f(M) calculated by the theoretical model is in accordance with the experimental result. The effects of cutting speed, feed rate, flank wear and tool rake angle on the f(M) in the white layers were predicted and analyzed; the results show that the f(M) decreases first and then increases with the cutting speed, decreases with the feed rate and the flank wear, and increases with the tool rake angle.

Graphite modified epoxy-based adhesive for joining of aluminium and PP/graphite composites	JOURNAL OF ADHESION												A graphite-modified adhesive was developed in order to simultaneously enhance the thermal conductivity and the strength of an adhesive joint. The thermal conductivity through the joint was investigated by using highly filled PP/graphite composite substrates, which were joined with an epoxy adhesive of different layer thicknesses. Similar measurements were carried out with a constant adhesive layer thickness, whilst applying an epoxy adhesive modified with expanded graphite (EG) (6, 10, and 20 wt%). By reducing the adhesive layer thickness or modifying the adhesive with conductive fillers, a significant increase of the thermal conductivity through the joint was achieved. The examination of the mechanical properties of the modified adhesives was carried out by tensile tests (adhesive only), lap-shear tests, and fracture energy tests (mode 1) with aluminium substrates. Modification of the adhesive with EG led to an increase of the tensile lap-shear strength and the adhesive fracture energy (mode 1) of the joint. In addition, burst pressure tests were performed to determine the strength of the joint in a complex component. The strength of the joint increased with the graphite content in the PP substrate and in the epoxy adhesive.

Atechnology has been developed capable of reducing the alkali content by 21% of the initial amount of alkali, which has increased the melting temperature by 310 degrees C. Based on the obtained results, pilot plant was designed and refractory heat-insulating materials were developed where the expensive mineral raw materials are substituted with non-scarce man-made waste.																			1083-4877	1573-9139				JUL	2019	60	2					174	176		10.1007/s11148-019-00331-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11148-019-00331-z		NOV 2019											WOS:000495294800001

In this study, a lens for large viewing angle and high uniformity LED has been developed with optical grade poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) material. TracePro software was used to design the lens while Moldex 3D software was implemented to design the mould and the mould filling phenomena. Together with micromoulding technology and Taguchi experimental method with control parameters were mould temperature (MoT), melt temperature (MT), and injection speed, a lens with optical uniformity of 87.18% and viewing angle of 128 degrees has been developed. The experimental results showed that MoT and MT were the main factors affecting the optical quality, each with contributions greater than 50 and 30%, respectively. Though this lens is relatively small in dimension, a draft angle is needed for successful removal of the moulded PMMA lens from the mould.

The hardmetals are processed by a powder metallurgy route including mechanical milling of powders and subsequent consolidation by spark plasma sintering. The effect of the addition of different extra Fe and C contents on microstructure, mechanical properties, and oxidation resistance is fully investigated. Thus, the best mechanical performance is achieved when the formation of brittle eta-phases, M7C3 carbides and soft graphite is reduced or suppressed, while maintaining the nanosized WC grain size. More specifically, the Cr-based WC hardmetal with an extra 3 wt% Fe content and extra 0.5 wt% C content reaches the best combination of hardness and toughness fracture values (2219 HV30 and 8.2 MPam(1/2)). In addition, the oxidation resistance reached is higher than that of conventional Co-based or Ni-based WC hardmetals tested under the same conditions turning them into promising candidates for applications under aggressive oxidation environments.

Bio-mimetic virtual abstract 3D proxy models of knitted structures were developed. The models were mapped onto the original biological templates and then on the knitted fabrics. Image segmentation methods such as binarize, local adaptive threshold and morphological threshold were employed concurrently to 'digitise' the biological template, 3D models and knitted fabrics. Eight samples mimicking the Morpho scales were knitted. Euclidean distance measurement and pixel values, established that the biological template, selected 3D geometrical models and physical knitted fabrics have a high degree of similarity. Local adaptive threshold gave better results for pixel intensity differences while the morphological threshold method generated better results when measuring Euclidean distance.

Antenna engineers are therefore able to design and create artificial substrates which replicate the electrical properties of ferrites without actually using any in the construction. This is advantageous as ferrites can offer performance improvements to microstrip antennas, such as size reduction and wideband impedance matching. In this paper, a metaferrite substrate designed by the use of a genetic algorithm is presented. The metaferrite was optimized in order to obtain the magnetic responses at 9GHz, for its use as the substrate of a microstrip antenna. As an example, a U-slot patch antenna based on the metaferrite is demonstrated, which can achieve stable radiation and 14 dB radar cross section (RCS) reduction performance in the measurement.

Polymorphic modifications of novel cerium germanide Ce<sub>33.3</sub>Ir<sub>22.2</sub>Ge<sub>44.5</sub> (at.%)	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												The formation of novel ternary cerium germanide with the chemical composition Ce33.3Ir22.2Ge44.5 (at.%) was established. As derived from powder X-ray diffraction data, the compound crystallizes with two polymorphic modifications. The high-temperature modification, established for as-cast alloy, possesses a tetragonal ThSi2-type structure and can be named as Ce(IrxGe1-x)(2), x = 0.32. The low-temperature modification forms in the course of heat treatment at 1073 K, crystallizes with an orthorhombic structure of its own type and can be labeled as Ce3Ir2-xGe4+x, x = 0.02. Both structures belong to the AlB2 structural family and are closely related to each other. In both modifications, statistical mixtures of Ir and Ge atoms occupy same crystallographic sites. As found by means of magnetization measurements, the two structural variants of Ce33.3Ir22.2Ge44.5 (at.%) exhibit very similar magnetic properties. Both polymorphs are Curie-Weiss paramagnets with strong crystalline electric field features observed at low temperatures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To synthesize PEG-SS-PCL-SS-PEG, two end-groups of PCL-diol were first modified with cystamine to introduce disulfide bonds and subsequently conjugated with PEG-NHS via carbodiimide chemistry. PEG-SS-PCL-SSPEG fabricated into polymeric micelles with stable structure and different nanoscale sizes via adjusting the PCL chain length, showing obvious reductive responsiveness and fast drug release of encapsulated DOX in the presence of glutathione (GSH). Moreover, DOX-loaded PEG-SS-PCL-SS-PEG micelles exhibited higher therapeutic efficacy than reduction-insensitive PEG-b-PCL micelles in vitro. Thus, end-groups conjugation is a simple and straightforward strategy to introduce intelligent responsiveness in biocompatible block copolymers and improve their therapeutic efficacy.

Mainly over the last three decades, exemplary research efforts and clinical trials have been aimed at achieving the best formulation and treatment regimens for mass eradication of H. pylori. Reflecting on these efforts, we would like to pose the following questions: Is it mandatory to aim for eradication of all H. pylori strains or only specific strains thereof? What populations should be selected for antibiotic therapy? Until now, the screen-and-treat strategy has been the best recommendation by the guidelines for clinicians caring for patients from high-risk populations, but targeting the virulent strains of H. pylori had not been considered. However, updated guidelines based on renewed concepts to improve H. pylori treatment could help clinicians better manage their patients who suffer from gastric cancer. Importantly, preventing gastric cancer will not be feasible by the screen-and-test strategy alone. Here, we present a commentary proposing a renewed consideration of H. pylori screening and treatment and their potential impact on H. pylori eradication in anticipation of preventing gastric cancer.

The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach According to the Fourier transformation, the problem is formulated into two pairs of dual integral equations, in which the unknown variables are the displacement jumps across the crack surfaces.

Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effects of the distance between the two collinear cracks, the lattice parameter and the circular frequency of the incident waves on the entire dynamic fields near the crack tips, which play an important role in designing new structures in engineering. Originality/value Different from the classical solutions, the present solution exhibits no stress and electric displacement singularities at the crack tips in piezoelectric materials.

As a prototype, we study effective spins induced in an impunity sites doped AKLT model by constructing the exact ground state in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We characterize their responses to external fields by studying an extended Zeeman interaction. We also study the antiferromagnetic bond-alternating Heisenberg chain with defect structures. For this model, an MPS representation similar to that for the AKLT model, "a uniform MPS with windows," is constructed, and it gives a good approximation of the ground state. We discuss the trade-off relation between the window length and the precision of the MPS ansatz. The effective exchange interaction between the induced spins is also investigated by using this representation.

Design/methodology/approach The case that the spinning triangle is divided into two parts, primary triangles and final triangle, is investigated. Theoretical model of yarn torque was given by linking the fiber tension in the spinning triangle to yarn torque under the assumption that the arrangement of fibers (substrands) in the substrands (yarn) is hexagonal close packing. Then, as an application of the proposed method, 14.6tex cotton yarns were taken as an example for the numerical simulations. Findings The fiber tensions in the divided spinning triangles and corresponding yarn torques were simulated numerically by using MATLAB software. The effects of division proportions and number of primary triangles on spun yarn torques are analyzed theoretically. Originality/value It is shown that suitable spinning triangle division is benefit for reducing yarn torque.																			0955-6222	1758-5953				NOV 4	2019	31	6					839	855		10.1108/IJCST-01-2019-0004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJCST-01-2019-0004													WOS:000491056700009

The thin films of the Schottky contact with double barriers were observed as increments of the capacitance. The oxygen vacancy increased at the film with the crystal structure and decreased at the film with the amorphous structure. It was confirmed that the current-voltage characteristics differ when observed in the low current area because the formation of potential barrier varies depending on the condition of the interfacing even in thin films with similar amorphous characteristics. Because the size of the potential barrier is mostly small, current is not observed in areas high at mu A level, but at nA level, the electrical properties of the potential barrier could be observed more closely by the effect of relatively large potential barriers. It was found that the single and double connections were made depending on the size of the potential barrier at Schottky contact according to the after annealing treatment temperature.						oh, teresa/0000-0002-4194-381X													1229-7607	2092-7592				FEB	2020	21	1					23	29		10.1007/s42341-019-00133-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42341-019-00133-7		NOV 2019											WOS:000493678700001

In the study, the following variables are alternated: high-speed steel (HSS) vs. hard metal (HM), and with and without the assistance of high-density electropulses. The corrosion rates are determined using comparative studies such as gravimetric analysis, salt spray chamber test, electrochemical polarization curve techniques (PC), and linear polarization resistance (LPR). Differences in surface microhardness were evaluated by applying optical microscopy and planimetric procedures. Specimens subjected to electropulses and turned with HM reported greater reductions of corrosion rates. Changes in corrosion behavior can be explained in terms of grain shape factor h variation. The present study demonstrates that electropulsing affects the corrosion behavior of AISI/SAE 1045 steel after the turning process.

The upper age limit of reconstruction is not determined because tenocytes from old individuals have less proliferative ability than young ones. Dexamethasone is commonly used to deal with musculoskeletal disorder with dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward tenocytes. Ascorbic acid is essential for tenocytes culture and collagen secretion and can alleviate the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone. In the current study, a microfluidic platform was used to screen the best dexamethasone and ascorbic acid combination treatment for tenocytes from young and old donors because it has been proven to provide a high throughput analysis platform. Comparison of their proliferation under three concentrations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone was performed. Tenocytes proliferation among young and old donors was also measured when exposed to nine combinations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone. The result confirmed the differences in cells proliferation when hamstring tenocytes from different ages of donors are exposed to different concentrations of dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. Tenocytes from old donors are not always more susceptible to dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. An optimal dose of ascorbic acid in decreasing the cytotoxic effect of dexamethasone can be screened by a high throughput microfluidic platform.

Detecting degradation in reinforced concrete subjected to uniaxial compression, using the parameters of electric response to mechanical impact	RESEARCH IN NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION												The effect of uniaxial compression on the development of damage in reinforced concrete has been studied, using the parameters of the electric response to elastic impact. During the quasistatic loading of the samples at a constant speed, a weak impact is produced on the lateral surface of the sample during a specified period of time, and an electrical response to this impact is measured. Consistent patterns in the changes of the parameters of the electric response with various loads have been identified. Computer simulation of the parameters of elastic waves in reinforced concrete subjected to mechanical impact has also been used. Based on the simulation, the parameters of the electric response have been calculated using the mechanoelectrical transduction model. Good consistency of theoretical and experimental signals confirms the relationship between the electric response and the interaction of elastic waves and fractures in reinforced concrete caused by uniaxial compression. Based on the electric response data corroborated with the computational results, diagnostic criteria have been obtained which make it possible to predict failure of reinforced concrete structure long before it occurs.

Our study aimed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the CAD/CAM-based template for maxillary orthognathic surgery using dry skulls. After reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual skull model, a surface-based surgical template for Le Fort I osteotomy was designed and fabricated using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology. To determine accuracy, the deviation of the template between the planned and the actual position and the fitness of the template were evaluated. The mean deviation was 0.41 +/- 0.30 mm in the medio-lateral direction, 0.55 +/- 0.59 mm in the antero-posterior direction, and 0.69 +/- 0.59 mm in the supero-inferior direction. The root mean square deviation between the planned and the actual position of the template was 1.21 +/- 0.54 mm. With respect to the fitness of the template, the mean distance between the inner surface of the template and the underlying bone surface was 0.76 +/- 0.24 mm. CAD/CAM-based templates showed precise positioning and good fitness. These results suggest that surface topography-based CAD-CAM templates can be considered as an alternative solution in replacing the traditional intermediate splints for the transfer of surgical plans.																				2076-3417				NOV 2	2019	9	22							4928	10.3390/app9224928	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9224928													WOS:000502570800205
J	Kajiya, D				Kajiya, Daisuke			An agar sandwich method for patterning transparent conducting oxides	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS												Transparent electrodes are frequently used to drive opto-electronic devices, and the patterning of these electrodes is essential. The present work demonstrates a facile means of removing transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) from a glass substrate in selected areas. When agarose gel (agar), a material typically used in desserts, is sandwiched between two TCO-coated glass substrates and connected to a dry cell, the TCO is removed from the glass at the agar stamping area within 2 min. This method allows etching of TCOs using acid-free, inexpensive, and readily available starting materials. Analyses by optical microscopy, transmission spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that this etching occurs as a result of reduction of the TCO in conjunction with the electrolysis of water at the interface between the TCO and agar surfaces. Using this technique, high-throughput patterning of TCOs with an edge resolution of several micrometres was achieved. Furthermore, the shape of the agar template can be readily changed simply by cutting the agar using scissors. Therefore, this method provides a useful means for both researchers and students to easily fabricate patterned substrates for use in electronics and related technologies.

The proposed system approximates the physical movements of a real vehicle using a proportional derivative (PD) servo which estimates proper torques for wheels and controls a vehicle's acceleration based on the conditions of the given trajectory. To avoid expensive simulation calculation, the input trajectory is segmented and compared to the optimized trajectories stored in a path library. Based on the similarity of the curve shape between the input and simulated trajectories, an iterative search method is introduced to generate a physically derivable trajectory for convincing simulation results. For an interaction with other objects in the virtual environment, the surface of the vehicle is subdivided into several parts and deformed individually from external forces. As demonstrated in the experimental results, the proposed system can create diverse traffic scenes with multiple vehicles in a fully automated way.

In-situ neutron diffraction measurement and numerical modelling of macro- and micro-strains in two porous synthetic graphites	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In-situ neutron diffraction measurements have been performed on IMI-24 grade (20% porosity) and PG25 (48% porosity) graphite subjected to external uni-axial compression loading. The 'pore free' matrix properties such as modulus of elasticity of about 72 GPa and 46 GPa were measured for the IMI-24 and PG25, respectively, and were higher than those measured at the macro-length-scale. The elastic modulus of each crystal plane, hkl, is reported ranging from about 48-145 GPa and Poisson ratio ranging from 0.08-0.28 for IMI-24 graphite. With the proposed method, the pore morphology factor 'm' was independently evaluated to be 10.8 and 4.8 for IMI-24 and PG25, respectively. It has been demonstrated from that the micro-diffraction the Young modulus is not dependent on the pore morphology factor. We consider and discuss the experimental plus modelling approach to provide a new perspective on the micro-mechanics of porous graphites.

To capture the slope and the fluctuation pattern, data of the first lines along the horizontal and vertical axes on the stage were used. A corrective function was then utilized to improve the accuracy of reference phase extraction. The method was then corroborated by demonstrating tumor discrimination in mice skin by means of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). B16-F10 melanoma cells were used to grow the tumor. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was applied for histology characterization of the sample. A comparison of both acoustics and histology was conducted.

In this study, the tensile behavior of a steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was evaluated in the joint of a modular flexural member. The modular specimen was fabricated with a 400 mm joint, and an integral specimen was fabricated with the same specifications as the modular specimen, without a joint. The largest crack width of the integral specimen was measured at the center of the beam, and that of the modular specimen was measured at the discontinuity interface. The maximum crack width of the modular specimen was greater than that of the integral specimen. The strain of the steel reinforcement was estimated using the measured crack width and six formulas for evaluating the crack width. The estimated strain of the modular specimen was higher than that of the integral specimen, and the deformation of the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was accelerated with the increasing load. Therefore, the tensile load was concentrated at the discontinuity interface in the modular specimen, and the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was likely to yield earlier than the integral specimen.

Three-dimensional visualization of information is expected to facilitate visual search for radiologists. However, as the differences in user performance, depending on radiologist experience, have not yet been assessed for real three-dimensional images, it is difficult to estimate the usability of new visualization systems for radiologists with different amounts of professional search experience. In this study, we aimed to determine how three-dimensional visual search is affected by radiologist experience and the physical properties of stimuli. Radiologists, residents, and medical students accomplished visual search tasks with varying set sizes and target-distractor similarities. Search items were presented on multiple display planes and image manipulation was conducted using a computer keyboard. We compared the search outcome and strategy among three groups of participants. All three groups submitted a similar number of correct responses depending on target-distractor similarity. However, in contrast to radiologists and residents, it took a considerably longer time for students to find the targets. The major differences were evident in search strategy when comparing the image manipulations of radiologists with those of residents and students. Our results demonstrated that experienced radiologists' search performance benefited from seeing the entire three-dimensional view of an image, whereas residents and students focused instead on reducing the amount of information and searched in a selective manner. These findings should be taken into account when planning the implementation of new workstations with three-dimensional visualization in radiology.

J	Shao, CP; Li, HY; Wang, Z; Fang, JY				Shao, Cuiping; Li, Huiyun; Wang, Zheng; Fang, Jiayan			A Generic Block-Level Error Confinement Technique for Memory Based on Principal Component Analysis	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Nanoscale CMOS technology has encountered severe reliability issues especially in on-chip memory. Conventional word-level error resilience techniques such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC) suffer from high physical overhead and inability to correct increasingly reported multiple bit flip errors. On the other hands, state-of-the-art applications such as image processing and machine learning loosen the requirement on the levels of data protection, which result in dedicated techniques of approximated fault tolerance. In this work, we introduce a novel error protection scheme for memory, based on feature extraction through Principal Component Analysis and the modular-wise technique to segment the data before PCA. The extracted features can be protected by replacing the fault vector with the averaged confinement vectors. This approach confines the errors with either single or multi-bit flips for generic data blocks, whilst achieving significant savings on execution time and memory usage compared to traditional ECC techniques. Experimental results of image processing demonstrate that the proposed technique results in a reconstructed image with PSNR over 30 dB, while robust against both single bit and multiple bit flip errors, with reduced memory storage to just 22.4% compared to the conventional ECC-based technique.

The results show that the decay rate of the WTDs of the cavity for short and long time limits can be effectively tuned by the driving external field Rabi frequency, the frequency of the cavity photon, and the detuning between the microwave driving frequency and the energy-splitting of the DQDs. The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction. This also demonstrates that the effect of the DQDs can be replaced a thermal reservoir when the rate difference of a photon absorbed and emitted by DQDs is larger than zero; otherwise, it is irreplaceable. The results deepen our understanding of the statistical properties of photon emission counting. It has a promising application in the construction of nanostructured devices of photon emission on demand and of optoelectronic devices.

Andrzej Bachowicz using an obstacle lighting lamp that is currently in production. The developed simulation model, which has been verified experimentally, was used to determine the influence of changes in meteorological parameters on the temperature distributions on the surface of the lamp. It will be used in the future to optimize the geometry of the heat sink used in the lamp in terms of electricity consumption and thermal resistance. It is planned to extend the application of the lamp under difficult climatic conditions. Abstract The article presents the results of experimental and theoretical works aimed at determining the distribution of heat emitted by an obstacle lighting lamp. These kind of lamps are commonly applied as a warning for air traffic vehicles. There is a need for lighting devices with various intensities, whose application depends on the location and operating conditions. The overall aim of the author's work is to develop a computer model that would enable us to conduct research aimed at determining the optimal parameters of lamp operation without the need to build many physical models. Measurements of heat emitted by a currently manufactured lamp were made, and based on these, a numerical model of the lamp operating under laboratory conditions was developed. The considered lamp has two heat sources, one of which is light-emitting diodes (LEDs), while the other heat source consists of stabilizers and other elements of the lamp power supply system. After positive experimental verification of the numerical model, theoretical analyses of heat emission under various meteorological conditions were carried out, while the values of ambient temperature and airflow velocity were changed; then, the influence of these parameters on the temperature distribution on the surface of the lamp was determined.

First, a single-frequency continuously tunable 780.2 nm laser of more than 600 mW from second-harmonic generation (SHG) by a 1560.5 nm laser can be achieved.

The continuously tunable range of 780.2 nm and 852.3 nm are at least 6.8 GHz and 9.2 GHz. By employing this laser system, we can conveniently perform laser cooling, trapping and manipulating both rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms simultaneously.

The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Consequently, Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP consumes the available network bandwidth in lesser time and increases the throughput and goodput. The proposed module enhanced the performance of the transport layer protocol. Our findings demonstrate the performance impact in the form of a decrease in the convergence time to consume the available network bandwidth and the increase in the throughput and the goodput.

Electromagnetic interference shielding and mechanical properties of multi-layered polyvinyl chloride/multiwall carbon nanotubes nanocomposite	MATERIALS EXPRESS												Electromagnetic shielding is one of the promising research areas that attract the interest of many researchers, especially researchers interested in polymer nanocomposite. In this work, the shielding efficiency and dynamic mechanical analysis for multi-layered samples are reviewed and analyzed. The multi-layered samples were prepared using two sheets of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymer loaded with multiwall carbon nanotubes over the electrical percolation threshold, and a MWCNTs buckypaper (MWCNTs BP) sheet between them. The three sheets were collected together by hot-press technique to form a multi-layered nanocomposite sample. The shielding efficiency of single and double layers of PVC/MWCNTs sheets loaded by 5 wt.% MWCNTs, was very weak. The new structured (3 layered/multilayered) nanocomposite samples were prepared with different weight percent of MWCNTs BP sheet (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 wt.%). The SE values over all the frequency range (450 MHz to about 2.0 GHz) are strongly depends on the weight percent of the MWCNTs BP. Shielding efficiency increased as the MWCNTs BP weight percent increased. Decreases the elastic modulus, storage modulus and the coefficient of complex viscosity were found for a new set of samples contains 0.14, 0.27, 0.28 and 0.44 wt.% MWCNTs BP layers. This is due to the diffused MWCNTs from the mesh to polymer layers making the composite more brittle. The glass transition temperature determined from tan delta(f) increased as MWCNTs BP content increases.					ibrahim, sobhy/F-1106-2019; Aljaafari, Abdullah/G-2803-2016; Ibrahim, Sobhy Sayed/P-6324-2016	Ibrahim, Sobhy Sayed/0000-0003-2811-2613													2158-5849	2158-5857				NOV	2019	9	8					872	881		10.1166/mex.2019.1568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/mex.2019.1568													WOS:000502558200004

Synthesis and characterization of Zn<sub>1-x</sub>Ac<sub>x</sub>S (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) nanocrystalline quantum dots prepared via soft mechanochemical approach	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL												Here, we report a first example of nanocrystalline Zn1-xAcxS (0 <= x <= 0.1) quantum dots prepared via soft mechanochemical approach. The incorporation of up to 10 at.% of Ac ions into the ZnS quantum dots (QDs) allows preservation of the cubic crystal structure as was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and the selected area electron diffraction. The transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the increase of the Ac ion doping give rise to the increase of the particle size from 4.8 +/- 0.3 nm to 17.9 +/- 0.3 nm. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements indicated that the Zn1-xAcxS powders are stoichiometric at all Ac ion substitutions. The substitution of Zn ions by Ac ions in the Zn1-xAcxS nanocrystals was also verified by the Raman and FTIR spectroscopy measurements. The incorporation of the Ac ions into the ZnS QDs showed a red shift of the optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra. An enhancement of the PL intensity and a decrease of the PL spectrum width were observed due to the partial substitution by the Ac ions in the Zn sites of the ZnS nanocrystals. These properties make the Zn1-xAcxS QDs promising candidates for both light emitting and laser diodes applications.

Ramesh			Development of a Method to Compute the Overall Key Performance Index for a Spinning Mill to Aid Supply Chain Management	FIBRES & TEXTILES IN EASTERN EUROPE												This paper aims to provide a convenient measure of evaluating the performance of spinning mills using the overall Key Performance Index. Although many authors have advocated the concept of the key performance index, their studies were confined to departments other than spinning. The methodology followed in this paper is based on providing weightages to machine utilisation, spindle production, end breaks, HOK (number of operative hours required to produce 100 kg of yarn), roving production, yarn realisation, CSP (count strength product), units/kg of yarn and to compute the overall Key Performance Index in a logical manner: It has come to light that some mills have achieved an overall Key Performance Index (OKPI) of more than 100 and less than 100 in certain other mills. Also the important factors which are significant for supply chain management have been highlighted. A very useful source of information and advice for various spinning mills to develop their own supply chain strategies is provided. Especially with the introduction of technical textiles, supply chain management has become a critical area.					Bapu, B. R.

The Curie temperature (Tc) of the films has been determined. A decrease in the conductivity of the films with x = 0.05 upon cooling in an electric field from the temperatures T<Tc has been found.

The proposed strategy is facile and highly time saving; as the detection of melamine with label-free gold nanoparticles was accomplished within five minutes. The colorimetric probe exhibits high detection limit of 8 nM for melamine determination in raw milk, which is very low as compared to other capping ligands employed for Au NPs such as borohydride, citrate and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The results show a highly sensitive linear range (0.03-2.5 mu M) between absorption ratio and concentration of melamine with a correlation coefficient of 0.991.

Optical and Microstructural Origins of Thermomechanical Streaking Defects in Hot Extruded AA6060	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE												Thermomechanical streaking is a common optical surface defect that affects architectural 6xxx series aluminum extrusions, and can be cause for rejection of the product. AA6060 profiles were extruded at a range of ram speeds using a specialized die with internal geometry purposely designed to produce thermomechanical variation throughout the profile. Subsequently, the extrudates underwent an industrial anodization pretreatment process that revealed the presence of streaks throughout three designated regions. The optical appearance, microstructure and surface topography of streaked and surrounding regions of the extrudate surface were analyzed using colorimetry, electron backscattered diffraction, and optical profilometry. Differences in perceived lightness, roughness, and grain size were observed between streaked and surrounding regions. Changes in appearance of the surface directly correlated with the surface roughness, with rougher surfaces yielding an increase in the perceived lightness. The surface roughness was determined to be primarily dependent on the size and distribution of grain etching steps as related to the surface grain size. A difference in grain size in the regions surrounding the streaks was determined to be the microstructural origin of the visual defect.

J	Baek, YJ				Baek, Yoo-Jin			On Non-Completeness and G-Equivariance	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.																				2076-3417				NOV	2019	9	21							4692	10.3390/app9214692	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9214692													WOS:000498058600217

The proposed work means to determine the difficulties posed by IoT in the service discovery field. Most of the data analytics algorithms applied for data collected through sensors and actuators assume that the data are complete such that each property of the instances is filled with the appropriate value. These data have temporal and spatial correlation between them, and missing such data results in a significant decrease in accuracy and reliability of data analysis performed. Considering the importance of estimating the spatial data and the intricacies involved in estimating it using interpolation techniques, the proposed work bases its system development using an aspect-oriented programming improvement technique, thereby addressing the interpolation strategy as a cross-cutting aspect and reducing the complexity involved thereof. The proposal analyzes the situation of missing data and appropriately weaves the aspect and the application together, thereby decreasing the complexity in handling the interpolating data. The woven aspect estimates the missing data using an inverse distance weighting method and updates the information. Observation of the experimental results reveals significant improvement in response time compared with estimating the unknown value in a conventional manner.

Axial segregation in crystal growth from a thin melt layer	JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH												During a crystal growth from a thin melt layer, the transport of dopant occurs mostly by diffusion. One can describe the dopant distribution by simplified analytical equations, as, for example, those previously obtained by Tiller. We performed numerical 2D axi-symmetric computations of heat and mass transfer in a thin melt layer (0.05 < h/d < 0.2), in order to find the limits of the validity of such approaches. Sb doped Ge, in a cylindrical volume with a diameter of 200 mm, was used as a model material. Compared with the heat transfer, the mass transfer was found to be much more sensitive to residual convection. Some restrictions in the application of the analytical equations for the description of the experimental data are revealed and necessary recommendations to improve the results are made. In order to provide the uniform axial dopant distribution in the very last portion of the ingot, too, it is necessary to vary the rate of solidification by changing the cooling rate with time.

Thomas			A Comparison of the ASTM F2508 and ANSI/NFSI B101.3 Walkway-Safety Tribometry Standards Using Measurements from Two Different Tribometers	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION												In order to provide the safest possible built environment for pedestrian use, care must be taken to supply walking surfaces that are slip resistant. However, there remains an inability to establish a method of consensus for determining whether a surface is slip resistant. Two current walkway-safety standards illustrate two different approaches to this issue-ANSI A137.1, American National Standards Specifications for Ceramic Tile, and ANSI/NFSI B101.3, Test Method for Measuring Wet DCOF of Common Hard-Surface Floor Materials, promotes a numeric threshold model, while ASTM F2508, Standard Practice for Validation, Calibration, and Certification of Walkway Tribometers Using Reference Surfaces, is a validation standard based on the relative ranking of walkway surface materials. The goal of this study was to determine whether these two standards are compatible in how they rank/evaluate surfaces. To do this, two tribometers, (the BOT-3000E (BOT) (Regan Scientific Instruments, Southlake, TX, USA) and English XL Variable Incidence Tribometer (XL) (Excel Tribometers, Chesapeake, VA, USA)) were used to take slip resistance measurements using the four reference surfaces designated in the ASTM F2508 standard. Measurements for the BOT were taken under three conditions: (1) styrene-butadiene-rubber (SBR) test foot with distilled water and surfactant (consistent with ANSI/NFSI B101.3), (2) SBR test foot with distilled water, and (3) Neolite test foot with distilled water. Measurements for the XL were taken using a Neolite test foot with distilled water. Results indicate that the vinyl composite tile was the reference surface nearest to the ANSI threshold for high slip resistance but fell approximately 11 % below the threshold value of 0.42. The two most slippery reference surfaces (granite and porcelain) fell well below the ANSI threshold for high slip resistance, while the most slip resistant (ceramic tile) was well above the threshold. Unexpectedly, we also found a strong linear correlation (R-2 = 0.99) between the measurements from the XL versus the BOT with SBR and surfactant test condition, which allowed for conversion of slip resistance readings between the two tribometers under these conditions. These results provide new data that allow aspects of the ASTM and ANSI standards to be directly compared.																			0090-3973	1945-7553				NOV	2019	47	6					4199	4211		10.1520/JTE20170501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/JTE20170501													WOS:000491001500026

Previously, we developed targeted nanosomes with anti-type II collagen monoclonal antibody (MabCII) on their surface that can bind to the damaged cartilage. The efficiency of nanosomes is highly dependent on their physicochemical nature. Therefore, in this study, we presented a rigorous method for examining the physicochemical characteristics and biological efficacy of nanosomes. Nanosomes were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Specificity of nanosomes for type II collagen was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Release kinetics of nanosomes was determined by dialysis method using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) dye. The biological efficacy of targeted nanosomes encapsulating TGF-beta 3 was determined in porcine chondrocytes (pChon). Moreover, the binding specificity of targeted nanosomes to the damaged cartilage was confirmed onto the cartilage explants and in a mouse model of spontaneous osteoarthritis (OA). The synthetic targeted nanosomes were unilamellar with a mean diameter of 200 nm. Retention factor (Rf) values for all the lipids were in accordance with the standards with a mean 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) concentration of 3.22 nM. It was found that nanosomes release approximately 50% the encapsulated product at 37 degrees C within 24 h. TGF-beta 3-targeted nanosomes found to reduce the expression of inflammatory marker matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1) in chondrocytes stimulated with TNF alpha. In brief, in this study, we present a comprehensive approach to characterize the physicochemical and biological characteristics of nanosomes. Furthermore, this approach can be utilized to deliver the drug or molecule of interest to the diseased or damaged tissues.

Temperature dependent current-voltage (J ? V) characteristics show a transition from ohomic (J?V<i) to trap dominated space charge limited current with a power law J ?V-m, m?2 for higher applied voltages. Capacitance-voltage measurement shows that capacitance value at reverse bias is drift controlled and the accumulation of diffused charge carriers contribute at forward bias. An equivalent impedance model gives charge carrier lifetime values in milliseconds and electron mobility values in the range of ?10(?5) cm(2) V-?1 s(?1); in line with that obtained by charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage method. The extrapolated dc conductivity values in 113 K?473 K show Arrhenius like behavior with an activation energy of 145 meV. Notable changes in temperature dependent conductivity, carrier concentration and carrier mobility values around 320 K indicate a strong correlation of charge transport process with structural changes that may occur in bulk heterojunction around its thermodynamic glass transition temperature.																			2053-1591					NOV	2019	6	11							115114	10.1088/2053-1591/ab5227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab5227													WOS:000499904200001

Continuous production of hierarchically porous silica beads using co-axial flow	MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS												Applications of porous materials require macroscopic shapes, which makes it easier to handle and recover them. The direct fabrication of hierarchically porous macroscopic shapes, without the use of additional binders or complex post-treatments, is both challenging and promising. Flow devices offer a convenient route, with high controllability, to synthesize monodisperse particles. Hierarchically macro/mesoporous silica beads were prepared by means of a co-axial flow device combined with the co-micelle/emulsion dual templating strategy. Precursor droplets, which react to form the silica beads, were produced with the flow device and the size of the droplets was strongly influenced by the external fluid flow rate. Hierarchically porous silica beads with diameters from 300 to 800 mu m were produced as the flow rate was decreased over the range investigated. Furthermore, it was observed that the hierarchical pore structure and sizes of the pores on the different length scales were not significantly affected by the bead sizes, which provides the ability to optimize the size of the beads independently. The silica beads had mesopores around 4 nm in diameter, BET surface areas above 350 m(2)/g and mesopore volumes of approximately 0.25 cm(3)/g.

J	Cao, JD; Tong, FL				Cao Jiangdong; Tong Fuli			High-Temperature Oxidation Behavior of Al-Cr-Y Coating on Ni-based Superalloy Prepared by Pack Cementation	RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING												The oxidation behaviors of Al-Cr-Y coatings with different Al contents prepared by pack cementation process were investigated. The results show that the coating with 2 wt% Al in the pack has a three-layer structure, while the coatings with 2.5 wt% and 3 wt% Al have two layers. In addition, the main phases in the coatings with 2 wt% and 3 wt% Al are alpha-Cr and NiAl, respectively, while the main phase in the coating with 2.5 wt% Al is NiAl with several Cr-rich particles and solid-solution Cr atoms in the coating. The oxidation test demonstrates that the coated specimen with 2 wt% Al has the poorest oxidation resistance and the coated specimen with 2.5 wt% Al has the best oxidation resistance.																			1002-185X					NOV	2019	48	11					3448	3454																WOS:000500083600005

Design and Experiment of a 3D Printing System for Ceramics by Continuous Extrusion	JOURNAL OF CERAMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In order to solve the problems of the brittleness, high hardness, complex shapes, long production times and high cost of ceramic parts, a novel 3D printing system for ceramics is proposed for the fabrication of ceramic parts by means of continuous extrusion. Based on an analysis of the principle of continuous extrusion of ceramics as a forming process, the system structure, nozzle extrusion device and motion control system were developed. The influence of the process parameters on the quality and defects of printed parts was analyzed in a series of printing experiments. The causes of defects (tiny cracks, porosity, holes and irregular morphology) were explored and summarized. Precise contours, size and high bonding quality can be obtained when the printing speed is matched well to the speed of ceramic extrusion. Vases and model heads were fabricated using the 3D printing system. The results of the experiments show that the 3D printing system can meet the precision requirements for ceramic parts. The feasibility and correctness of the 3D ceramic printing technique are verified.																			2190-9385					NOV	2019	10	2								10.4416/JCST2019-00048	http://dx.doi.org/10.4416/JCST2019-00048													WOS:000503061900005
J	Chen, HJ; Gao, Q; Qian, BL; Zhao, LS				Chen, Haojia; Gao, Qiong; Qian, Baoliang; Zhao, Lishan			Unusual Response of Thin LiTaO<sub>3</sub> Films to Intense Microwave Pulses	MATERIALS												Fundamentally different responses of a LiTaO3 thin film detector are observed when it is subjected to short microwave pulses as the pulse intensity is altered over a wide range. We start from weak microwave pulses which lead to only trivial pyroelectric peak response. However, when the microwave pulses become intense, the normally expected pyroelectric signal seems to be suppressed and the sign of the voltage signal can even be completely changed. Analysis indicates that while the traditional pyroelectric model, which is a linear model and works fine for our data in the small regime, it does not work anymore in the large signal regime. Since the small-signal model is the key foundation of electromagnetic-wave sensors based on pyroelectric effects, such as pyroelectric infrared detecters, the observation in this work suggests that one should be cautious when using these devices in intense fields. In addition, the evolution of detector signal with respect to excitation strength suggests that the main polarisation process is changed in the large signal regime. This is of fundamental importance to the understanding on how crystalline solids interact with intense microwaves. Possible causes of the nonlinear behaviour is discussed.

By using simulated ammonia nitrogen wastewater, it included a Cl- concentration of 3000 mg/L, SO42- concentration of 100 mg/L according to conventional leather wastewater conditions. Furthermore, Cl- and SO42- can be used as supporting electrolyte. After pretreatment, the ammonia nitrogen concentration kept about 100 mg/L. The optimal treatment conditions of Electro-Fenton system were obtained throughout single factors experiments. The current density was 150 A/m(2), the reaction time was 30 min, the plate spacing distance was 40 mm, and the reaction temperature was adjusted to 40 degrees C. After flocculation treatment of leather wastewater, the ammonia nitrogen concentration was 142.11 mg/L, and the tanning wastewater was further treated with an Electro-Fenton system. The final ammonia nitrogen concentration was 11.23 mg/L, which meets the first-level wastewater discharge standard.

Effect of Pre-deformation on the Multiaxial Low-Cycle Fatigue Resistance of 2024-T4 Aluminum Alloy	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION												The effect of pre-deformation on the fatigue properties of 2024-T4 aluminum alloy is evaluated, including pre-tension of 1, 2, 3, and 4 % as well as pre-torsion of 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 40 degrees. Multiaxial low-cycle fatigue (LCF) tests are carried out under a constant amplitude sinusoidal wave loading with a tension-torsion ratio root 3 in air at room temperature. The results indicate that the multiaxial LCF life of the specimen reduces with the pre-deformation level. The observed mechanical behavior and associated phenomena are directly linked to microstructure characteristics, such as dislocation density, surface defects, and microcracks. The analysis of mechanism reveals a competition between beneficial effects that are due to hardening and detrimental influences that are due to defects that are caused by the pre-deformation. However, the multiaxial loading makes the detrimental influence more prominent. The typical fracture morphology of multiaxial fatigue can be observed. With the consideration of the effect of pre-deformation on fatigue limit, a modified criterion is developed to predict the multiaxial fatigue life of 2024-T4 aluminum alloy.																			0090-3973	1945-7553				NOV	2019	47	6					4280	4295		10.1520/JTE20170503	http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/JTE20170503													WOS:000491001500033

In inverted OPVs, the top anode must have a high work function to match the highest occupied molecular orbital level of a p-type organic semiconductor. Therefore, a functional interlayer with a high work function is inserted between the light-absorbing layer and anode. OPVs with a dual-anode buffer layer have been reported to exhibit a superior performance than those with a single-anode buffer layer. Herein, the device performance of inverted OPVs with a poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester light-absorbing layer and dual-anode buffer layer of MoO3 and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) is investigated. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPV with the HAT-CN/MoO3/Al anode system is lower than that with the conventional MoO3/Al anode system. However, the PCE of the OPV with MoO3/HAT-CN/Al is slightly higher than that with MoO3/Al. The change in the device performance by varying the deposition sequence of HAT-CN and MoO3 is discussed based on the built-in potential.

J	Chung, SH; Sohn, I				Chung, Sung Hoon; Sohn, Il			Effect of NaF and CaO/SiO<sub>2</sub> Mass pct. on the Hydrogen Dissolution Behavior in Calcium-Silicate-Based Molten Fluxes	METALS AND MATERIALS INTERNATIONAL												The effect of NaF and CaO/SiO2 mass pct. ratio (C/S) on the hydrogen solubility in terms of the hydroxyl capacity of the CaO-SiO2-NaF welding flux system was investigated at 1823 K. As a cost-effective alternative to CaF2 in welding fluxes, NaF can potentially increase the fluidity, electrical conductivity, and hydroxyl capacity of welding fluxes in advanced high-strength steels. Additions of 1.9 to 5.9 mass pct. of NaF was found to depolymerize the structural units in the flux system. Depending on the flux composition, the dominant hydrogen dissolution mechanism varied. At C/S values less than 1.06, the incorporated-hydroxyl dissolution mechanism was dominant in the present flux system, in which SiO2-based complex structural units were pronounced. At C/S values above 1.06, the free-hydroxyl dissolution mechanism was pronounced due to the strong network-modifying CaO content supplemented by NaF. A combination of Fourier transformed infrared, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis was used to determine the structural implications of NaF additions and C/S, which were correlated to the hydroxyl capacity of the flux. High NaF contents and C/S values were found to depolymerize the complex structural units of the molten flux by supplying greater amounts of network-modifying free oxygen (O2-) and fluorine (F-) anions to the flux system in the compositional range of this work.					sohn, il/I-5815-2012	Sohn, Il/0000-0002-8571-9182													1598-9623	2005-4149				NOV	2019	25	6					1626	1634		10.1007/s12540-019-00296-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12540-019-00296-1													WOS:000491427600023

One of the key goals for this review was refining the document such that it may eventually be transitioned to a full-fledged test method. However, before such a goal could be realized, it was necessary to determine the practical limitations of the technique relative to the expected precision, repeatability, and reproducibility. To that end, interlaboratory studies were carried out in two stages. Stage one served as a pilot study and the participating laboratories were given limited guidance. This allowed identification of key control variables that would need to be defined in subsequent broader studies and ultimately in the future method. In stage two, the key variables identified in stage one were controlled and the precision of the technique was elucidated for three material types: polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, and low-density polyethylene. The results from these studies are discussed herein.																			0090-3973	1945-7553				NOV	2019	47	6					4338	4363		10.1520/JTE20180430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/JTE20180430													WOS:000491001500037

The resultant method allows the use of projectors with short or even long throw ratios to achieve ultrashort throw projection through a parameterized algorithm to stitch multiple images into one single frame, alleviating the trade-off between the resolution and frame rate in conventional laser MEMS displays. To evaluate the effectiveness, we construct a test system that consists of three off-the-shelf projectors with a throw ratio of 1.3 and three planar reflective mirrors. Using our method, the integrated system yields an ultrashort throw ratio of 0.26, greatly reducing the projection distance from 12 to 2.6 ft for the 120-in. screen in diagonal. Moreover, our algorithm can be fine-tuned to correct for image distortion, intensity variation, and edge mismatch induced by two-axis light beam steering, thereby further improving the image quality.																			1071-0922	1938-3657				NOV	2019	27	11					708	714		10.1002/jsid.794	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsid.794													WOS:000498966700006

J	de Oliveira, VF; Bagatini, MC				de Oliveira, Victor Freire; Bagatini, Mauricio Covcevich			Experimental evaluation of the usage of residues for sintermaking	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T												The shifts in quality of global reserves of iron ore, as well as the progressive advances in environmental legislations, are tendencies that have motivated researches on the usage of iron and carbon-bearing residues in the production of sinter for blast furnace ironmaking. These residues, however, are commonly limited in use due to their physical (particle size distribution) and chemical (heavy metals, alkali and zinc contents) properties as compared to sinter feed. In that sense, it is necessary to verify the impact of these materials on sinter quality and on sintering process parameters. In order to assess the recycling potential of residues via sintermaking, mixtures with increasing proportions (4.5-50%) of iron and steel-making residues were prepared and tested in controlled laboratory conditions representing those of the sintering machine. The effect of residues on sinter mineral phases and chemical quality was evaluated and showed few differences in sinter quality for a mixture resulting from recycling 100% of a plant's residue generation (4.5% of the mix). The greatest impact was an increased presence of wustite in the produced sinter, beyond 25% of residues in the mixture. The results indicated that there are opportunities, in the industry, for increasing the recycling of residues via sintermaking. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In experiments -15 degrees, 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees approach angles, 0.1 mm x rev(-1), 0.15 mm x rev(-1), and 0.2 mm x rev(-1) feed rates and 560 rpm, 800 rpm, and 1120 rpm spindle speeds were selected. At -15 degrees and 0 degrees approach angles, the deformation influence was dominant on surface roughness and chip morphology, while the cutting effect taking place at the cutting edge was dominant at 30 degrees and 45 degrees approach angles. Primarily at 45 degrees, the most significant roughness values and the shortest cut fibers were achieved due to the occurrence of maximum shear stress according to Tresca. However, fibers were removed from samples on the whole form as bundles, without any cutting, at -15 degrees and 0 degrees approach angles, by the effect of deformation. According to ANOVA, regression and variance analysis results were obtained with p-values and probability results of surface roughness smaller than 0.05 and 5 %, respectively. These results showed that the feed rate was the most influential parameter for turning of CFRP material, followed by the approach angle and spindle speed, respectively. However, the least influential parameter in the processes was spindle speed.

The joining by vulcanization of the conveyor belts allows to obtain superior performances, but it has been found that at the vulcanizing joint of the conveyor belts, there is a "bell"-type defect. This type of defect can cause the quick removal of the conveyor belts from use; thus, within this paper, we realized the constructive optimization of vulcanization installations using the finite element method (FEM). Thus, the FEM analysis was performed for the installation used at the present time, which has four spacers for stiffening, moving to the next stage to a stiffening system with seven spacers and, in the last stage, it was proposed to use a stiffening plate. The joined conveyor belts were of type ST 2000, and by the constructive optimization of the vulcanizing press type DSLQ, the bell-type defect was greatly reduced. Also, an analysis of the effects that the constructive optimization of the vulcanization installation has on the resistance to extraction of the metallic insert from the rubber matrix of the costs determined by the proposed constructive modifications, has been performed.																				1996-1944				NOV	2019	12	21							3607	10.3390/ma12213607	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma12213607								31684147					WOS:000502798800148

The composites of the microcapsules and EVA were prepared by incorporating the microcapsule nanoparticles into ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), respectively. To further understand the intrinsic correlation between microcapsule fillers and EVA matrix, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was introduced to qualitatively analyze the contribution of microcapsule fillers on improving compatibility and mechanical properties of the EVA matrix. The compatibility of microcapsule nanoparticles with EVA matrix were detected in sequence through SEM, DSC and tensile strength tests. And the combustion, thermal behavior and flame retardance were also characterized by TG analyses as well as LOI and UL-94 level. As a result, the MAH@MF filler had the best performances in improving the flame retardancy and mechanical properties among the microcapsule fillers, attributed to high compatibility of the MAH@MF and EVA matrix, which made uniform distribution of the MAH@MF filler due to the reciprocity of triazine functional ring with vinyl acetate linkages.					xu, sheng/KMX-9932-2024														1533-4880	1533-4899				NOV	2019	19	11					7476	7486		10.1166/jnn.2019.16635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.16635								31039916					WOS:000475752300080

J	El Ghadioui, R; Graubner, CA				El Ghadioui, Redouan; Graubner, Carl-Alexander			Shear strength of carbon-reinforced concrete members without shear reinforcement - Experimental investigations of the influence of the reinforcement ratio on load-bearing behaviour	BETON- UND STAHLBETONBAU												Shear strength of carbon-reinforced concrete members without shear reinforcement - Experimental investigations of the influence of the reinforcement ratio on load-bearing behaviour Fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) as reinforcement for concrete members in structural engineering are becoming increasingly important. Compared to conventional steel reinforcement, FRP reinforcement is different in terms of modulus of elasticity, tensile strength and bond behaviour. If concrete compression failure can be excluded, members with the same mechanical ratio of longitudinal reinforcement have the same bending load bearing capacity. The high tensile strengths of FRP reinforcement can lead to a reduced required reinforcement area and thus geometric ratio of longitudinal reinforcement. This effect leads to a reduced shear strength and increased crack widths and spacings. This article presents and evaluates experimental investigations on the shear strength of concrete members without shear reinforcement. Two different member types were analysed: slabs with textile carbon reinforcement and beams with carbon bars. For a direct comparison with conventionally reinforced members, reference tests with steel reinforcement and comparable mechanical reinforcement ratio were carried out. In addition to a detailed description of the specific properties of the used materials and a comparison of the load-bearing and deformation behaviour of the members, a precise evaluation of the cracking behaviour is shown. Finally, the influence of the reinforcement ratio on the shear strength is presented and the resulting conclusions are summarised.

Irrespective of whether there is agglomeration or not, the material morphology is made up of a fundamental unit known as the crystal habit, which is captured by the crystal shape algorithm. Using this algorithm both agglomerated and un-agglomerated morphologies were studied. Enhanced electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4 cathode material is achieved not only from a preferred crystal orientation along the 400 direction, but also when the crystal growth completely stops along the 311 direction. The cubic crystal habit of LiMn2O4 thus shows much better electrochemical performance as compared to the hexagonal crystal habit.					, Vasudevan/AAB-5812-2020; Xia, Hui/G-4533-2012														0025-5408	1873-4227				NOV	2019	119								110535	10.1016/j.materresbull.2019.110535	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.materresbull.2019.110535													WOS:000486134000030

Understanding relationship between the wood quality parameters and susceptibility of <i>Pinus taeda</i> to pine decline	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOOD AND WOOD PRODUCTS												Pinus taeda (loblolly pine) is one of the ecologically and economically important conifer species in the southeastern USA. However, a disease decline syndrome, southern pine decline (SPD), associated with beetle-vectored root-infecting fungi, has emerged as one of the major challenges confronting loblolly pine production in this part of the country. Although several studies have been conducted to screen the susceptibility of the commercially grown families to these fungi, little information exists on wood properties associated with the susceptible and resistant families. Thus, the objectives of this study were (1) to understand variation in wood quality parameters among the families regarded as susceptible and tolerant to SPD, (2) to evaluate the utility of acoustic tool to differentiate between those families. The results indicated the velocity, fiber length, microfibril angle and slenderness of the susceptible families are comparable or superior to those of the tolerant families. The mean error rate of classification associated with acoustic tool ranged from 35 to 40% depending on the distance between the transmitter and receiver probes. The mean error rate of classification was 35% when probes were placed 120 cm apart. The results from this study signify that a family tolerant to pine decline is not synonymous to a quality wood family and possibility of using acoustic tools to allocate pine species into PD susceptibility classes.

Indeed, they know new applications and improved performances even fabricated at low temperatures by low-cost solution-process and printing technologies. Nonetheless, some critical aspects remain to be improved, such as organic semiconductor (OSC) patterning and the control and alignment of organic crystal growth in the desired location and direction. Herein, a new controlled OSC solution-growth processing, which directly occurs within planar electrodes patterning, is reported. A capillary-driven flow occurs in air-opened microchannels and then confines the OSC solution before growing these crystals in the desired region and direction. 1) The modeling, 2) fabrication, 3) experimental functionality of such capillary-driven flow techniques, and 4) growth of OSC single-colored crystals in situ integrated planar device electrodes are reported. Polarized optical images show large crystal growth (i.e., >100 mu m) of typical pi-conjugated small molecules (diF-TES-ADT and C8-BTBT). By such a technology, benefits from both 1) the meniscus-guided coating mechanisms and 2) advantages of maskless and noncontact digital printing technologies are taken. Finally, these results visualize the directional control of OSC single-crystal growth in a printing-compatible (dispensing, inkjet) route in a reliable and reproducible way.

Advanced Diagnostics and Innovative Solutions for Leather Defects: The Problem of Yellowing	JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF LEATHER TECHNOLOGISTS AND CHEMISTS												Providing peculiar enhanced features to leather items is a factor of primary importance for the marketing of high-end articles; although tanning production is oriented to satisfy a wide market range, it is mainly in the 'high end' and 'premium luxury' categories that the quality properties of the material are more expressed, indeed. It is particularly on this market segment that the main current challenges have been focussed, according to the growing requirement of technological innovation, sustainability and product quality. Light-coloured leathers, with particular reference to white items, belong to the category of materials designed especially for the luxury market. For this type of articles, the uniformity of colour and the agreeable appeal of the overall surface appearance are crucial requirements for the most international fashion and luxury brands. One of the most common and undesirable defects of this type of article is the alteration of the colour, with particular reference to the localised or diffused effects of yellowing of the surface of the material. There are several causes able to contribute to the production of this type of defects, due to the complexity of the matrix and to the variability of traditional or innovative production processes used: from the intrinsic fragility, photosensitivity and thermo-sensitivity of the finishing polymers, to the chemical instability of some components of the finishing pigments, further the presence of photosensitive chemical additives, the migration of skin components or assembly components of the manufactured articles (fats, fillers, plasticisers, glues etc.), up to the indirect contribution of environmental and thermo-climatic factors able to affect negatively the performance of the material. SSIP, which has always been involved in research and consulting activities for the leather industry with regards to defect monitoring, through this work, would offer an overview of all the main tools for advanced diagnostics (with particular reference to Scanning Electronic Microscopy and to chromatographic and spectroscopic methods) aimed to the identification of the causes of yellowing, beside to explore innovative solutions for the development of strategies for the resolution and/or minimisation of the problem of yellowing. The technical solutions will include innovative tanning processes, innovative finishing methods, and leather surface treatments carried out in order to provide a sensible attenuation of surface absorption of IR and UV-visible radiation.																			0144-0322					NOV-DEC	2019	103	6					296	304																WOS:000499093700002

Control of airflow in ventilation systems using embedded systems on microcontrollers	MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS												This paper describes the development of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for regulation of the airflow in a ventilation system. The flow was adjusted by controlling the speed of the fan installed in the system. The PID control algorithm was developed for an embedded system in an Atmega 2560 microcontroller contained in an Arduino Mega development kit, where the airflow rate was detected by a Hall-effect sensor that generated a pulsed signal at a frequency proportional to the speed of the fan. Simulation results were used to parameterize the control algorithm, minimizing the benchtop development time. Full details of the procedure are presented in order to assist future PID proposals involving embedded systems in microcontrollers.

The experimental results identify the encapsulation of single, double and triple cores in a flow-focusing microchannel arising from the competition among the inertial force of inner phase, the shear force of outer phase fluid, and the interfacial tension. In addition, the solid-core encapsulation of double emulsion in flow-focusing microchannel is either in the stable state or in the transition state, depending on the flow rates of inner and outer phase fluid. The stable microencapsulation includes the stable single-core, double-cores and triple-cores encapsulation states, while the transition microencapsulation includes the single-double-cores and double-triple-cores transition encapsulation state. Irrespective of encapsulation state, the solid-core encapsulation process can be classified into four stages, including entering, neck stretch, neck shrinking and breakup.

These systems have been utilized as a part of a wide zone of utilizations, such as human services, contamination checking, and target-following frameworks. The dynamic clustering of sensors into bunches is a prevalent procedure to expand the system lifetime and increment adaptability. To accomplish this, in this article the sensor hubs are adjusted to ensure a long lifetime and the activities are arranged into rounds that use fixed time intervals. In the first phase, a clustering topology is found, and a group head is picked in view of the outstanding energy level. Then the cluster head screens the network energy threshold value to identify the energy drain rate of all its cluster members. In the second stage, the Long-Lifetime and Low-Latency Data Aggregation Scheduling method is used. This scheduling method assigns schedule openings to group part information parcels. Here, congestion occurrence is completely kept away from the scenario. In the third stage, an Energy-Efficient Distributed Schedule-based convention is used to keep up greatest residual energy level over the network. The experimental outcome shows the steps proposed in this article ensure an increase in the network lifetime and decrease in the energy utilization.

Detachment yield statistics for kerfless wafering using the porous silicon process	SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS					9th International Conference on Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaics (SiliconPV)	APR 08-11, 2019	Imec, Leuven, BELGIUM	PSE Conf & Consulting GmbH	Imec			The porous silicon (PSI) process is a wafering method to fabricate high quality kerfless crystalline Si wafers by epitaxial wafer growth on porous Si and subsequent detachment from a reusable substrate wafer. The process yield is a key parameter for the economic viability of the PSI process. We experimentally demonstrate the detachment of 59 out of 62 PSI wafers with a size of 10 x 10 cm(2), and separation layer etch current densities of 105-120 mA/cm(2) for electrochemically etching the porous Si, and for substrate wafers with a resistivity of 15.7-16.9 m Omega cm. We discuss the statistics of how to deduce a detachment probability from this. From our experiments, we determine a detachment yield of at least 88% with an error probability of 5%. The demonstration of a 99% detachment yield with an error probability of 5% would require at least 300 successfully detached wafers with no failed detachment. Samples have a minority carrier density ranging from 1 to 1.7 ms before any external gettering, which demonstrates the high electric quality of the PSI wafers.

Exploring the transport properties of equatorially low-coordinated erbium single ion magnets	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS												Single-molecule spin transport represents the lower limit of miniaturization of spintronic devices. These experiments, although extremely challenging, are key to understand the magneto-electronic properties of a molecule in a junction. In this context, theoretical screening of new magnetic molecules provides invaluable knowledge before carrying out sophisticated experiments. Herein, we investigate the transport properties of three equatorially low-coordinated erbium single ion magnets with C-3 nu symmetry: Er[N(SiMe3)(2)](3) (1), Er (btmsm)(3) (2) and Er(dbpc)(3) (3), where btmsm = bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl and dbpc = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresolate. Our ligand field analysis, based on previous spectroscopic data, confirms a ground state mainly characterized by M-J = +/- 15/2 in all three of them. The relaxation of their molecular structures when placed between two Au (1 1 1) electrodes leads to an even more symmetric similar to D-3h environment, which ensures that these molecules would retain their single-molecule magnet behavior in the device setup. Hence, we simulate spin dependent transport using the DFT optimized structures on the basis of the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, which, in 1 and 2, suggests a remarkable molecular spin filtering under the effect of an external magnetic field.

Time of Flight measurements on P3HT displayed three distinct hole transport pathways with corresponding mobilities above 10(-4), between 10(-5) and 10(-4) and below 10(-5) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) over a range of sample thickness (1.1 mu m-4.2 mu m), and electric field (2.4 MVm(-1) to 37.7 MVm(-1)). The space-charge limited current (Mott-Gurney) device mobility was in agreement with that obtained for the fastest route (10(-4) cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)). The transport pathways were distinguished using a dispersive transport plot of reciprocal transit time versus electric field to thickness ratio and are described by single (pseudo dispersion) parameters: alpha(t1) = 0.97, alpha(t2) = 0.73 and alpha(t3) = 0.62. The P3HT displayed 3 M mass peaks obtained by Gel Permeation Chromatography, which are the most likely cause of the three pathways. The dispersive transport analysis used here offers clearer distinction between pathways than Poole-Frenkel plots and offers a full mobility description, including the dependence on sample thickness, making it suitable for general application.

However, it is presently not clear how the type of doped-O species affects the capacitive performance. In this paper, an attempt has been made to probe into the possible correlation between the type of doped-O species and the corresponding capacitive performance. Three O species (C=O, C-O and O-C=O) have been introduced onto TiC-derived carbon (TiC-CDC) by using a facile room-temperature oxidation strategy with three typical oxidizing agents (H2O2, HNO3 and (NH4)(2)S2O8), respectively. The results have shown that as the content of the C=O species increases, both the specific capacitance and the capacitance retention for the oxidized TiC-CDC samples become higher, showing a positively correlative performance. This work suggests that optimizing the type of doped-O species will be great potential for obtaining the optimal electrochemical performances for the O-doped carbon materials.

We found that a Schottky emission leakage mechanism dominates the low bias conditions and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling became the main leakage mechanism at high fields with reverse biased condition. The sample with HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm) laminated dielectric shows a high barrier height phi(B) of 1.66 eV at 30 degrees C which was extracted from the Schottky emission mechanism, and this can be explained by fewer In-O and As-O states on the interface, as detected by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test. These effects result in HfO2 (4 m)/Al2O3 (8 nm)/n-InAlAs MOS-capacitors presenting a low leakage current density of below 1.8 x 10(-7) A/cm(2) from -3 to 0 V at 30 degrees C. It is demonstrated that the HfO2/Al2O3 laminated dielectric with a thicker Al2O3 film of 8 nm is an optimized design to be the high-k dielectric used in Au-Pt-Ti/HfO2-Al2O3/InAlAs MOS capacitor applications.																				2079-6412				NOV	2019	9	11							720	10.3390/coatings9110720	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/coatings9110720													WOS:000502298300030

The black titanium thin film has a larger apparent thickness than that of the glossy thin film. As a result of scanning electron microscope observation, it is seen that the black thin film has an extremely porous structure and consists of a separated column with periodic step differences on the sides. In this configuration, due to the shadowing effect, the nuclei formed on the substrate periodically grow to form a step. The surface area of the black thin film on the Cu thin plate changes with the bias potential. It has been found that the bias of the small negative is effective in increasing the surface area of the black titanium thin film. These results suggest that porous titanium-oxide thin film can be fabricated by applying the appropriate oxidation process to black titanium thin film composed of separated columns.																			1225-0562	2287-7258				NOV	2019	29	11					709	714		10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.11.709	http://dx.doi.org/10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.11.709													WOS:000500931100009

A set up using a CO2 laser in continuous mode (CW CO2 laser) was implemented to cut fragile and porous carbon monolithic (CM) and nanotemplated carbon monolithic (NTCM) rods into discs with a prescribed thickness and dimensional integrity (denoted as LCM and LNTCM, or LCMs). Changes in structure, porosity and composition of LCMs were induced by the efficient thermal energy afforded by the CW CO2 laser irradiation under tightly controlled process conditions. The main effects observed before and after laser cutting were studied in comparison with traditional scalpel blade cutting of carbon monolithic (SCM). FE-SEM images confirmed that the resulting LCMs exhibited a more open, interconnected macroporous structure and smoothed mesopores to a depth of approximately 5 while the structure of the bulk section remained intact. Minimal changes in chemical compositions were confirmed by XPS. Raman spectroscopy revealed a modest increase in the graphitic content on the cross sections of LCM discs. Phenol and Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as a model analyze for demonstration of resulting discs adsorption performance.					paull, brett/AAO-8366-2020; Mousavian, Reza/AAH-8189-2019; Nesterenko, Pavel/A-4766-2012; Brabazon, Dermot/A-4658-2015	paull, brett/0000-0001-6373-6582; Nesterenko, Pavel/0000-0002-9997-0650; Brabazon, Dermot/0000-0003-3214-6381													0169-4332	1873-5584				NOV 1	2019	493						829	837		10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.06.298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.06.298													WOS:000502007800044

Impact of carbon nanotubes in a CrFeMnNiTi alloy proposed as a potential candidate for stainless-steel substitution	MATERIALS LETTERS												In the steel industry, the fabrication of sintered products includes the use of graphite as an alloying element and lubricant. This study explores the idea that a sintered alloy with increased properties can be produced substituting graphite by carbon nanotubes. Also, the microstructural characteristics of an equiatomic alloy CrFeMnNiTi were compared with an austenitic 321 stainless-steel; which at present, has a vital role in the food industry. Results showed that the equiatomic alloy was composed mainly by austenite and Ti-rich phases, growth rate and porosity of samples were reduced with the graphite substitution. On this way, carbon nanotubes addition and modification of the chemical composition of the alloy represented viable routes to obtain new alloys with enhanced properties to replace conventional steels.

Herein, we report a fabrication method of oblique polymer pillars which allow modulating both stiffness and anisotropy of the substrate for spreading and elongation studies of Rat Mesenchymal Stem Cells (RMSCs). Poly (Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid) (PLGA) has been chosen to produce micropillars of different heights and different pitches using a combined method of soft-lithography and hot embossing. The stiffness of such pillar substrates varies over a large range so that RMSCs show effectively different spreading behaviors which are also sensitive to the inclining angle of the pillars. Our results showed that with the increase of the pillar height the area of cell spreading decreases but the cell elongation aspect ratio increases. Moreover, cells preferentially elongate along the direction perpendicular to that of the pillars' inclining, which is in agreement with the calculated anisotropy of the pillar substrate stiffness.

One of the issues to fabricate the nitride thin films via sputtering is the control of N deficiency. In this work, it was demonstrated that the use of atomic diffusion improved the insulating property of amorphous BN (a-BN): BN deposition caused the nitridation of Co underlayer, and the diffusion of N from Co-N into BN reduced the N deficiency of BN. The a-BN formed via this sequence showed flat interfaces and no pinholes and could be used as a tunneling barrier layer. This provides an insight into synthesizing stoichiometric BN thin films. A negative tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of -0.2% was observed at room temperature. The TMR ratio increased with a decrease in temperature to -0.7% at 10 K. The effective thickness and height of the barrier were estimated to be 1.78 nm and 0.52 eV, respectively, for 2 nm thick BN-MTJs based on the dependences of transport properties on the bias voltage and temperature.

Two types of nanostructured ODS ferritic steel powders viz. Fe-14Cr-2W-0.3Ti-0.3Y(2)O(3) (Si-free) and Fe-14Cr-2W-0.3Ti-1Si-0.3Y(2)O(3) (Si-containing) were mechanically alloyed up to 50 h and consolidated via spark plasma sintering. The Si-containing sintered ODS steel contained single phase ferritic microstructure with finer grains and nanoparticles of Y2Ti2O7, SiO2, and Cr2TiO4; whereas, the Si-free one contained different phases such as ferrite, austenite, and martensite with nanoparticles of Cr2O3 and Y2Ti2O7. After performing oxidation at 850 degrees C for 100 h, the weight gain in the Si-containing sample was similar to 18 times lower than that of the Si-free sample. Analyzing the surface and cross-section of the oxide layers via SEM-EDS, XRD, Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns and Raman spectroscopy, it was revealed that Si-free ODS steel consisted of outer Fe2O3 and inner FeCr2O4 layers which were porous and possessed whisker-like morphology. However, the oxidized Si-containing ODS steel possessed thin, dense, adherent and strong protective outer layer of (Fe, Cr)(2)O-3 and the inner layer consisted mixture of Cr2O3 and Fe2SiO4 oxides. Synergistic effect of the single-crystal structure matrix and Si addition in the Si-containing ODS steel played a crucial role in forming thin, dense and protective oxide layers during the oxidation process, resulting in improved oxidation resistance.

The control of the electrode thickness could be useful to manipulate the energy confinement and the band dispersion of the surface guided mode. It has been demonstrated recently that high aspect ratio (HAR) electrode could produce a dispersive shear horizontal and vertically polarized surface modes in the bulk piezoelectric substrate. In this theoretical study, we propose to employ a high aspect ratio electrode on top of the GaN/sapphire-layered substrate enabling the presence of Sezawa surface mode. Based from the dispersion band, we obtained a higher frequency of surface guided mode in the non-radiative zone in the GaN/sapphire heterostructure configuration compared to the bulk GaN substrate. Indeed, these guided modes are induced by the hybridization between Sezawa surface mode and the mechanical resonance of the HAR electrode producing nearly a flat band at the limit of First Brillouin Zone. Furthermore, the displacement of each guided modes indicates the confinement of energy mostly in the electrode with a slight amount of energy in the top layer of the substrate. We demonstrated also the frequency tuning of guided mode using diverse materials for the electrode but also the thickness of GaN layer. The obtained results could be useful for the development of high-frequency telecommunication and sensing device based on Sezawa surface acoustic wave.

The formation volume was defined as the derivative of the Fe formation energy with respect to the pressure within 0-0.8 GPa. Interestingly, the formation volume was found to be equivalent to the difference between the volumes of the relaxed bulk and defective structures. The formation volume versus 'x' exhibited a nonlinear pattern with regions of Fe-induced volume contraction (within x<50%, i.e., Si-rich region) and expansion (x>50%, i.e., Ge-rich region). These results explain the reported observation that Fe prefers Si-rich environment and that Ge does not favor to be a nearest neighbor to Fe.

From the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) images, it was possible to observe much larger bumps on the surface of WS2 on soda-lime glass at higher RF sputtering powers and higher RTA temperatures. The Raman spectra results showed the 2D WS2 layers were formed at the higher RF sputtering powers as a formation of E-2g(1) peak and A(g)(1) peak and the Hall measurement results also showed the carrier mobility was dependent on the RF sputtering powers and RTA temperatures. The structural and electrical characteristics showed that 2D WS2 layers can be directly formed on soda-lime glass substrates at temperatures below 600 degrees C.																			1947-2935	1947-2943				NOV	2019	11	11					1581	1586		10.1166/sam.2019.3632	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/sam.2019.3632													WOS:000486578900010

The synthesized powders consisted of the Ba1.3Ca0.7SiO4 phase with a hexagonal structure. The photoluminescence spectra of the powders exhibited two emission bands in the blue-green (A-band) and red (B-band) regions, which were assigned to the 4f(7)-4f(6)5d transition of Eu2+ and spin-forbidden d-d transition of Mn2+, respectively. The B-band arose from an energy transfer from Eu2+ to Mn2+. The multiple photoluminescence resulted in Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates occurring in the warm white light region. Increasing x and y had differing effects on the crystal structures, photoluminescence properties, and particle morphologies of the synthesized powders. The B-band was closely dependent on the x values, whereas increasing y mainly produced a change in the luminescence of the A-band. The particle size increased with the x and y values. The findings were explained using an ionic radius discrepancy, the crystal field strength, and a site occupancy factor.

However, this equation may not determine the bursting force exactly because it was designed on the basis of two-dimensional numerical analyses without considering various design parameters such as the duct hole and shape of the bearing plate. To improve the design equation, modification of the AASHTO LRFD design equation was considered. The behavior of the anchorage zone was investigated using three-dimensional linear elastic finite element analysis with design parameters such as bearing plate size and diameter of sheath hole. Upon the suggestion of a modified design equation for evaluating the bursting force in an anchorage block with a rectangular anchorage plate (Kim and Kwak 2018), additional influences of design parameters that could affect the evaluation of bursting force were investigated. An improved equation was introduced for determining the bursting force in an anchorage block with a circular anchorage plate, using the same procedure introduced in the design equation for an anchorage block with a rectangular anchorage plate. The validity of the introduced design equation was confirmed by comparison with AASHTO LRFD.

The I-p and electron affinity of the thin films are determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy. The I-p is tuned from 63 to 7.1 eV by varying Ga concentration from similar to 20 to similar to 50%. In addition, the electron affinity shifts from 3.8 to 4.3 eV by varying Cd concentration. Carrier concentration and mobility strongly depend on Cd concentration for Cd concentrations greater than 50%. Carrier concentration (mobility) decreases (increases) with increasing Cd concentration. In contrast, the influence of Ga concentration seems to be greater for Cd concentrations less than 50%. Carrier concentration varies in the range of 10(17) to 10(20) cm(-33).

We use melamine as a nitrogen-containing compound and treat GO thermally with melamine at over 800 similar to 1,000 degrees C and 1 similar to 3 hr under Ar atmosphere. The electrical conductivity of doped rGO is measured by 4-point probe method. As a result, nitrogen contents on rGO are found to be in the range of 2.5 to 12.5 at% depending on the doping conditions after thermal annealing. The main doping site on graphene oxide is changed from pyridinic-N and pyrrolinic N to the graphitic site as the heat treatment temperature increases. The electrical conductivity of doped rGO increases as the N doping content increases. As the thermal treatment time increases, the change of both total doping contents and doping sites is slight and the surface resistance is remarkably reduced, which is caused by healing effects of doped graphene oxide at high temperature.

A discrete-heterogeneous mechanism of heating the surface of a multi-dimensionally reinforced carbon-carbon composite material (CCCM) subject to accelerated heating was revealed. Based on the results of testing carbon materials in the temperature range from 300 to 3,000 K, a numerical stress analysis of the product was performed, in which the arising stress condition was considered to be resultant from constraining the deformation of the heated parts of the product by relatively cold fragments. The safety factor levels were found for different parts of the product. It was shown that an additional increase in thermal strength as part of the combined definition of thermal resistance of CCCM products is associated with high thermal conductivity of 1D-reinforced rods of material structure.																			1083-4877	1573-9139				NOV	2019	60	4					336	345		10.1007/s11148-019-00363-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11148-019-00363-5													WOS:000501073800002

The experimental plates delivered directly from the steel manufacturer were used for butt joint welding. The disk laser with maximum output power (maximum capacity of the laser generator) of 3.3 kW, emitting at 1.03 mu m, and with the beam spot diameter of 200 mu m was used for the trails of welding.

The influences of basic technological welding parameters, especially the energy input of laser welding on the shape of the fusion zone, the microstructure of weld metal and heat affected zone, and the impact toughness were analyzed. Laser welding trials were conducted in a wide range of energy input from 100 to 400 J/mm. Despite the low energy input of the laser welding process and also the short cooling times t8/5, tendency to cold crack was found neither in the weld metal nor in the heat affected zone. The carbon equivalent (CET), determined by the chemical analysis of the experimental melt, was just 0.341, indicating moderate tendency to increase hardness after welding because of martensitic transformation. It was found that the energy input has a clear influence on the microstructure and the impact toughness of the weld metal. The weld metal of the test butt joint welded at the energy input of 198 J/mm showed the average impact toughness at approximately 80 % of the base metal, whereas the weld metal of the test butt joint welded at a lower energy input of 132 J/mm showed the average impact toughness at the level of just 60 % of the base metal of Domex 960 steel.																			2379-1365	2165-3992				NOV	2019	8	6					1226	1236		10.1520/MPC20190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/MPC20190													WOS:001314215200001

However, the performances of vegetable tanned leathers still need a further improvement. In this work, a kind of nonionic gemini aliphatic polyurethane surfactants (GPUs) with different hydrophobic chain lengths as a retanning agent combined with polyacrylic acid (PAA) for condensed tannin tanned leathers to improve their performances. The effects of the alone or combined use of the PAA and GPU, the hydrophobic chain length of GPU, and the offer percentage of retanning agent were studied by evaluating the organoleptic properties, shrinkage temperature, mechanical properties of the obtained leathers. The best performance was found in the leather retanned with PAA and 12-GPU-550 complex retanning agent, and the mechanical properties of leather could be improved when the total offer percentage was controlled at 4 wt%. Moreover, the collagen fibers morphologies and lightfastness properties of leathers retanned with different retanning agents were investigated. The results showed that the total color difference Delta E and the yellowness index Delta b decreased significantly with the introduction of 12-GPU-550, and the leather retanned with PAA and 12-GPU-550 complex retanning agent showed the lowest value of Delta E, demonstrating that the lightfastness properties were improved significantly. Therefore, it was an attractive way to combine use of PAA and 12-GPU-550 as complex retanning agent, which can improve the mechanical and lightfastness properties of vegetable tanned leathers simultaneously.																			0002-9726					NOV	2019	114	11					403	412																WOS:000496897300001

To fabricate the glass, refused coal ore with calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in it (which are added as supplementary materials) is put into an alumina crucible, melted at 1,200 similar to 1,500 degrees C for 1 hr, and then annealed at 600 degrees C for 2 hrs. We fabricate a black colored glass. The properties of the glass are measured by XRD (X-ray diffractometry) and TG-DTA (thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis). Glass samples manufactured at more than 1,300 degrees C with more than 60 % of refused coal ore are found by XRD to be non-crystalline in nature. In the case of the glass sample with 40 % of refused coal ore, from the sample melted at 1,200 degrees C, a sodium aluminum phosphate peak, a disodium calcium silicate peak, and an unknown peak are observed. On the other hand, in the sample melted at 1,300 degrees C, only the sodium aluminum phosphate peak and unknown peak are observed. And, peak changes that affect crystallization of the glass according to melting temperature are found. Therefore, it is concluded that glass with refused coal ore has good melting conditions at more than 1,200 degrees C and so can be applied to the construction field for materials such as glass tile, foamed glass panels, etc.					KIM, Sun/O-5366-2015; Lee, Jung-Hyun/AAL-4128-2020	Kim, Sun Woog/0000-0002-0317-2612													1225-0562	2287-7258				NOV	2019	29	11					727	733		10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.11.727	http://dx.doi.org/10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.11.727													WOS:000500931100012

Results showed that Ga doping enhanced the densification of ITO at a relatively low sintering temperature. Interestingly, the 1 at % Ga- and 20 at% Ga-doped samples showed shrinkage values of 19.5% and 23.0%, respectively, despite the fact they both starting shrinking at the same temperature. In addition, the second phase Ga3-xIn5+xSn2O16 was formed at 5 at% Ga-doped ITO. Moreover, the ITO lattice parameters decreased up to 40 at% Ga doping, since the ionic radius of Ga3+ is smaller than that of In3+. Furthermore, as the Ga concentration increased, the carrier concentration and mobility decreased and resistivity increased. These modifications are thought to result from an increasing quantity of the Ga3-xIn5+xSn2O16 s phase and the corresponding resistivity increase, both of which occur as a function of increasing Ga concentration.

It is found that the higher the electrolyte temperature, the lower is the breakdown voltage of oxide layer. This is probably because films formed at higher temperatures are thinner and denser. Moreover, electrolyte temperature plays an important role in the physical properties of the films. As the electrolyte temperature increases from 20 to 50 degrees C, the hardness of the oxide layer increases. Friction test against steel balls indicates that wear scars become narrower for films formed at higher temperatures because the films are harder, as indicated by the Vickers hardness. The thinner and denser nature of the oxide film formed at 50 degrees C is also advantageous for heat transfer when film is used as a heat sink. Laser flash test results show very fast heat transfer for AZ91D with plasma anodized oxide layer formed at higher temperatures.

Thus, reduction in the amount of utilized cement can contribute to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. The average life of concrete is 20 similar to 30 years, and if concrete life can be improved by ten years, cement use will be much lower. In this study, we examined the use and effect of fructan from microbes as a method for the densification of the pore structure of cement. The effect of fructan on the hydration reaction and pore distribution, as well as the water absorption of hardened cement mortar were studied. Pores distribution increased in mesopore OPC, and absorption rate was found to decrease with the use of fructan, which has a glue-like and swelling character.

In this work, the numerical simulation method to predict the filament temperature and the temperature distribution in a chamber was developed. The radiative heat transfer was simulated in 3-dimension using a commercial fluid dynamics (CFD) code, ANSYS-FLEUNT. Two color pyrometry has been applied to measure filament temperature. The filament temperature was numerically estimated and experimentally measured at the power levels of 480, 576, and 672 W at the fixed current of 32 A. The calculated temperatures were 2,070, 2,167 and 2,253 K by increasing the power level, while the measured temperatures were 2,051, 2,160 and 2,214 K, respectively.

The formations of tobermorite and hydroxyapatite benefited the flexural strength up to 12 MPa and adsorptive properties to contaminants. In sewage treatment experiments, the zeolite-based materials achieved the limited removal rates of 34.6% (from 364 to 238 mg/L) and 26.3% (from 46.6 to 34.3 mg/L) respectively for COD and NH4+ due to saturation adsorption. After bioburden, the removal rate of COD and NH4+ increased significantly to 93.4% (from 364 to 24 mg/L) and 81.1% (from 46.6 to 8.8 mg/L), reflecting the integrated function of adsorption and further degradation. The variations of NO3-/NO2- showed that various microorganisms within the matrix did contribute to the continuous and efficient purification performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In vitro immersion tests showed the corrosion type of MZZ screws were mainly pitting corrosion and the corrosion degree of the screw body especially the thread part was more severe in contrast to the screw cap. In vivo x-ray imaging analysis showed the joint connecting screw cap with screw body had fractured in three months following surgery. Micro-CT analysis confirmed the experimental results of the above x-ray analysis. And Up to three months after operation, the residual volume fraction (RVF) of screw body and screw cap was maintained about 35% and 45% respectively. Moreover, compared with the screws implanted in the lateral position of the condyle (hereafter, denoted as the condyle), the volume loss of MZZ screws implanted in the region between the trochanter and the medullary cavity (hereafter, denoted as the trochanter) was higher. Histological evaluation showed new bone tissues were generated on the surface of MZZ screws at one month postoperation. And some granular degradation products distributed in the soft tissue surrounding the MZZ screws. Obvious inflammation reaction to periosteal cells cannot be confirmed indicating the good biocompatibility of MZZ screws. Therefore, MZZ screws are expected to apply to medical installations in bone fixation surgery.																			2053-1591					NOV	2019	6	11							1165g2	10.1088/2053-1591/ab5133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab5133													WOS:000499810900001

In this study, a new kind of dry-strength agent (CMS-g-PAM) was developed via grafting polyacrylamide onto carboxymethyl starch (CMS). Effects of the operation conditions, including the CMS-g-PAM dosage, polyaluminium chloride (PAC) dosage, and pH value of pulp system, on the properties of the paper were investigated. The contrasting effects when comparing the CMS-g-PAM and CMS were also researched. The results indicated that CMS-g-PAM had a beneficial effect on the paper properties. Compared to the control sample, when 1% CMS-g-PAM was added, the tensile index, burst index, and folding endurance of handsheets displayed noticeable increases of 38.2%, 34.7%, and 97.7%, respectively, and these properties were increased by 27.4%, 17.2%, and 46.6% when compared with the CMS-treated sample of this addition level. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the bonding between fibers of the paper became tighter after using the CMS-g-PAM.

We investigate the deposition of metal Mo thin film by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD). Mo(CO)(6) and H-2 plasma are used as precursor. H-2 plasma is induced between ALD cycles for reduction of Mo(CO)(6) and Mo film is deposited on Si substrate at 300 degrees C. Through variation of PE-ALD conditions such as precursor pulse time, plasma pulse time and plasma power, we find that these conditions result in low resistivity. The resistivity is affected by Mo pulse time. We can find the reason through analyzing XPS data according to Mo pulse time. The thickness uniformity is affected by plasma power. The lowest resistivity is 176 mu Omega.cm at Mo(CO)(6) pulse time 3s. The thickness uniformity of metal Mo thin film deposited by PE-ALD shows a value of less than 3% below the plasma power of 200 W.

Big data has evolved as an ultimate approach in data origination, attainment, and processing and also analysis, coping with the heterogeneity of the data in order to obtain useful insights from it. It is obvious that there is no point in having the data without quality. Hence, in order to use or leverage the data in a more apposite manner, data with quality are important. Numerous technologies are being developed with the evolution of big data. The input to those technologies and approaches is to be processed in such a way that they guarantee data quality, to yield better processing and results. An effective preprocessing approach is proposed in this article for the processing of big data. No single model can work well in the case of data processing, considering the challenges imposed with big data. Hence, a hybrid preprocessing approach is imposed here to deal with the data and processing, ensuring a better outcome. The results show that the approach enhances the quality of the data and is more effective.

The morphologies and volume fraction of Laves in the repaired zone were compared, and the contents of Nb element in the matrix gamma and the hardness of the repaired sample were measured by changing the magnetic field currents to explain the relationship between the magnetic field currents and the element segregation as well as mechanical properties. The results show that with the assistance of electromagnetic field, the morphology of Laves is obviously changed from reticulate to rod-like and granular shape and its volume fraction is decreased. The content of Nb element in the matrix gamma is increased with the increase of the magnetic field current. When the magnetic stirring current is 60 A, the content of Nb element is 3.72 wt%, and it is increased by 0.33% compared to that without electromagnetic stirring. The hardness test shows that the electromagnetic stirring greatly increases the hardness of the repaired sample, which is related to the increase in the solid solubility of alloy elements such as Nb in the gamma phase of dendrite core. The electromagnetic stirring improves both the flow of liquid metal in the melting pool vertical to the dendrite growth direction and the homogeneous distribution of solute element; as a result, the dendrite arm is more developed and the eutectic structure is more homogeneous.

When 0.25 wt% B2O3 was added, LZT135 ceramics could be densified at about 900 degrees C, while the negative tau(f) value of about -31.5 ppm/K restricted its applications. TiO2 was added for further adjustment of the tau(f) value of LZT135 ceramics. Finally, with the addition of 0.25 wt% B2O3 and 9 wt% TiO2, near zero tau(f) values of about -0.5 ppm/K can be achieved for LZT135 ceramics, and at the same time, high Qf values of about 48 300 GHz are attractive for low-temperature co-firing ceramics technology.																			2190-9385					NOV	2019	10	2								10.4416/JCST2019-00055	http://dx.doi.org/10.4416/JCST2019-00055													WOS:000503061900006

In this paper, a new noncontact ultrasonic testing method based on the electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) in the resonant mode is proposed for the bonding strength evaluation in metal-based adhesive structures. Different from the conventional pulse-echo method using short-burst excitation for bonding inspection, the attenuation coefficient feature of the resonant ultrasonic signal with long-burst excitation is applied to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and detecting sensitivity of the EMAT for adhesive bonding strength evaluation. A theoretical model for adhesive bonding testing with EMAT signals in the resonant mode is established. To extract the signal feature representing the reflection coefficient, the time-domain signal was processed by Hilbert transformation and exponential curve fitting. Through the simulation on the received signal, the correlation between the attenuation coefficient of the exponent fitted curve and the strength on the adhesive imperfect interface were confirmed. Finally, the proposed correlation is verified by an experiment on stainless steel plates bonded with polymethyl methacrylate plates by epoxy adhesion via a permanent magnetic EMAT.																			2572-3901	2572-3898				NOV	2019	2	4							040901	10.1115/1.4044638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4044638													WOS:000891984800002

The surface morphology evolution of ZrSi2 films under different substrate temperature are characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD). The sheet resistance of ZrSi2 films are detected by the four-point probe method. In fact, the growth mechanism and physical proprieties of ZrSi2 films synthesized under such conditions are not clear. The work in this article can lead to the further understanding of the synthesis process of the ZrSi2 films.

The results show that the adsorption energies of Ba2+ on the KDP (100) surface are negative, indicating the adsorption processes are spontaneous and exothermic. Three types of adsorption configurations are formed after structure optimizations, and final adsorption positions are top sites on O atoms or bridge sites between two O atoms. The most stable adsorption system can be observed when Ba2+ on the bridge site between two O atoms within a phosphate group. In the three different adsorption configurations, Ba2+ can form ionic bonds with the surface O atoms, while interactions between Ba2+ and the surface H atoms exhibit covalent character. The P-O, H-O, and K O bonds on the KDP (100) surface are elongated or shortened after Ba2+ adsorption, and the structure of hydrogen bonds on the surface also have been changed significantly.

Although lipases have been applied in leather making in the past, the previously reported lipase degreasing ratio is still not very high, i.e. less than 60%. In order to correctly understand the mechanism of lipase degreasing and to choose lipases and optimize the degreasing process for achieving efficient degreasing, a novel method of evaluating the catalytic hydrolysis properties of lipases towards skin fats based on a greasy skin powder substrate in an aqueous medium was established. This simulated the actual leather degreasing process and detected the amount of fatty acids produced. The special substrate was prepared; the determination conditions were optimized; then the performances of several typical lipases were evaluated. The results revealed that the lipase performances determined by the novel method were quite different from the standard method using emulsified olive oil substrate. There was a strong product-inhibition characteristic in the catalytic hydrolysis reaction of lipase, and the inhibition concentration of fatty acids varied with the lipase type, thus the maximum hydrolysis ratio of fats was only 67%. The lipases exhibited "super-activity" at pH around 9.5. This occurred because the fatty acids produced transformed into soluble soaps, thus the product-inhibition was weakened. According to the above results, a two-step lipase processing was made, i.e., beginning at pH 7.5 then 9.5. The hydrolysis ratio of fats rose to 82.57% from 46.23%, and the degreasing ratio increased from 50.78% to 89.68%. The new method with better repeatability can be used as a tool to correctly select lipases and optimize process parameters for lipase degreasing.																			0002-9726					NOV	2019	114	11					429	439																WOS:000496897300004

The study samples were obtained by the sol-gel method from the solution of nitrates of beryllium, magnesium and aluminum and tetraethoxysilane. The calculated ratio of the components in the resulting MgO:BeO:Al2O3:SiO2 mixture was expected to be 2:1:1:6, respectively. The solid-phase synthesis included sintering the dry ground mixture in air and sampling at the crystallization temperature of the PQS and BI. With the physic-chemical analysis the traditional Babushkin method with the Taranenkova modification was used to account for the multi-component nature of the compounds. The thermodynamic analysis of both phases was accomplished with the scheme for a complex oxygen compound consisting of solid oxides, not having polymorphic transformations and melting congruently. The assumptions made do not contradict the data on the phase formation and thermometry in the phylogenetic series, their primary and final members being PQS and BI. The obtained data are appropriate for correct tetrahedration of the BeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system, and for calculating the probability of the formation of its phases.

First, the ECG signal is acquired via Ag-AgCl electrodes, preprocessed using the adaptive Wiener filter to remove the noises and classified with the help of feature extraction techniques and fuzzy decision making (FDM) algorithm. The FDM also finds the type of heart abnormality based on ECG features, such as RRp interval, R peak amplitude detection, and QRS complex interval, and then sends the classified type to the doctor wirelessly via a ZigBee module.

In order to understand the microstructural evolution (i.e., microstructure and crystallographic orientation) a used pearlitic rail sample removed from the heavy-haul railroad was investigated in the current work. A very thin superficial white layer was observed, approximately 15 mu m below the running contact surface. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a supersaturated ferrite phase with carbon content of approximately 3.78 C wt%. It could be attributed to the cementite dissolution due to severe shear and compressive stresses, during intense shear plastic deformation, from the rail-wheel interaction. The dominance of {110} ferrite grains parallel to the rail direction was characterised, in the transition layer between white layer and non-deformed pearlite structure, by X-ray diffraction and electron backscattered diffraction techniques. Formation of these grains, corresponding to the closed-pack plane of the ferrite matrix at the transition region, leads to great ductility and retarded crack formation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Abdo			Moisture sorption isotherm of cross-linked wheat gluten and epoxydized oil using GAB and BET	POLYMERS & POLYMER COMPOSITES												The moisture sorption isotherm of wheat gluten/epoxydized sesame or sunflower oil resin was determined at 25, 40, and 55 degrees C. The resin was prepared by cross-linking epoxydized oil and wheat gluten using I, 2, and 3% zinc chloride as the catalyst. The experiment was carried out over 0.1-0.9 water activity (a(w)) range using gravimetric sorption analyzer (Q 2000, TA Instruments, New Castle, PA, USA). The resin isotherms were found to be type III shape where the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) was higher at lower temperatures. The EMC of gluten epoxy resin was dependent on the degree of cross-linking because more cross-linking decreased EMC. The Guggenheim Anderson-de Boer (GAB) parameters support the theory of the free volume as it relates to monolayer absorption. This could be attributed to the decrease in the number of water binding sites due to the development of dense areas during cross-linking and increase in the free volume. The GAB and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller were found to be suitable for predicting the water sorption isotherm for gluten protein resin because it provided low root mean square error. The heat of sorption based on the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (q(st)) increased with decrease in moisture content.

For first four samples only the diameter of core was varied and for other four samples only the weight percentage of CuO phase was varied. The existence of both cubic spinel ZnFe2O4 phase along with monoclinic CuO phase was verified by X-ray patterns recorded at room temperature. The average core diameter was in between 8 and 13 nm as estimated using Scherrer's formula and further verified by HRTEM images. A reduction in lattice parameter with increasing core thickness and also with increasing CuO phase was observed. A notable enhancement in coercivity and saturation magnetization were observed in field cooled (5 T) hysteresis loops obtained at 5 K for the first four varying core diameter core-shell structured nanoparticles in comparison to bare zinc ferrite nanoparticles of almost same size. A decreasing trend in coercivity and saturation magnetization was also noticed in low temperature hysteresis loops for higher CuO content samples. A considerable improvement in blocking temperature (T-B) as well as Neel temperature (T-N) for all the different core diameter samples were also found in M(T) protocols. Both blocking temperature and Neel temperature decreased for increasing CuO content in composite nanoparticles. The room temperature M(H) plots exhibited superparamagnetic nature with insignificant coercivity and negligible remanence.

Conventional microwave synthesis processes of electrocatalysts include ultrasonication, stirring, pH adjustment, and microwave irradiation of the precursor mixture. Ethylene glycol (EG), which serves as a reductant and solvent was added during the ultrasonication or stirring stage. However, this step and pH adjustment resulted in unintended multi-stage gradual nucleation. In this study, the microwave reduction approach was used to induce rapid nucleation and high supersaturation in order to fabricate small-sized reduced graphene oxide-supported palladium (Pd/rGO) electrocatalysts via the delayed addition of EG, elimination of the pH adjustment step, addition of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), prior microwave irradiation of the EG mixed with Na2CO3, and addition of room temperature precursor mixture. Besides its role as a second reducing agent, the addition of Na2CO3 was primarily intended to generate an alkaline condition, which is essential for the high-performance of electrocatalysts. Moreover, the microwave irradiation of the EG and Na2CO3 mixture generated highly reactive free radicals that facilitate rapid nucleation. Meanwhile, the room temperature precursor mixture increased supersaturation.

A 4-step wet etching process is applied to a 6-inch back surface field(BSF) solar cell. The metal electrode is removed in the first and second steps of the process, and the anti-reflection coating(ARC) is removed in the third step. In the fourth step, high purity silicon is recovered by simultaneously removing the emitter and the BSF layer from the solar cell. It is confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy(ICP-MS) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy(SIMS) analyses that the effectiveness of layer removal increases with increasing chemical concentrations. The purity of silicon recovered through the process, using the optimal concentration for each process, is analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy(ICP-AES). In addition, the silicon wafer is recovered through optimum etching conditions for silicon recovery, and the solar cell is remanufactured using this recovered silicon wafer.

The GP cones used were the conventional (C) and a new one impregnated with zirconia oxide, known as the coated cone (CC). Samples were distributed for each group and they were immersed in the correspondent chemical solution as follows: Group 1 (G1), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) at 5.25% for 1 min; Group 2 (G2), sodium hypochlorite at 2.5% for 10 min; and Group 3 (G3), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) at 2% for 5 min, as recommended by dentistry protocols. The averages and standard deviations of the surface roughness parameters-average roughness (Ra) and root mean square deviation roughness (R-q)-were calculated. Statistical analysis was made before and after immersion by paired t-test. Results showed a statistically significant difference for C GP cones after immersion in 2% CHX and 2.5% NaOCl (p < 0.01).

Development of a <i>Delonix regia</i> decorticating machine	ENGINEERING REPORTS												Delonix regia has good potential for medicinal, nutritional, and energy applications. However, the manual process of decorticating Delonix regia is labor-intensive, slow, and tedious. Mechanization of the decorticating process would be of value to its utilization for medicinal, food, feed, or fuel purposes. In this study, preliminary compressive strength tests were carried out on the D. regia pods to determine the force required to fracture the pods. Subsequently, a machine capable of separating the D. regia seeds from the pods was designed based on impact of beaters on pods. A prototype of the developed machine was evaluated to determine its performance in terms of decorticating efficiency, whole seed recovery, feed rate, and throughput. The compressive tests showed that a force of 602 N was required to fracture the D. regia pods in transverse orientation. The decorticating efficiency of the designed machine, which had a power rating of 6 kW, was 100.0%, and the whole seed recovery was estimated to be 98.4%. The throughput of the machine was 56.4 kg/h.

In fact, cosmetics containing this pigment cause too much oxidation on the skin. Therefore, the substitute for cerium dioxide is required to prepare the cosmetics without catalytic activity. Herein, as novel white pigments for use in cosmetics, cerium phosphates were prepared from cerium carbonate with hydrothermal treatment. The chemical composition (X-ray diffraction pattern and Infrared spectrum), powder properties (scanning electron microscopy images and particle size distributions), the photo and oxidation catalytic activity, color phase (ultraviolet-visible reflectance spectra and L*a*b* values), and smoothness of the cerium phosphates were evaluated. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was assessed from the decomposition of methylene blue. The oxidation catalytic activity of samples was estimated with ascorbic acid solution. All samples prepared in this work indicated X-ray diffraction pattern of cerium phosphate hydrate. Samples prepared in this work had no photo and oxidation catalytic activities. They indicated the absorption at 300-330 nm and high reflectance within the range of visible light.

J	Park, H; Lee, K				Park, Hyeyoung; Lee, Kwanyong			Adaptive Natural Gradient Method for Learning of Stochastic Neural Networks in Mini-Batch Mode	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Gradient descent method is an essential algorithm for learning of neural networks. Among diverse variations of gradient descent method that have been developed for accelerating learning speed, the natural gradient learning is based on the theory of information geometry on stochastic neuromanifold, and is known to have ideal convergence properties. Despite its theoretical advantages, the pure natural gradient has some limitations that prevent its practical usage. In order to get the explicit value of the natural gradient, it is required to know true probability distribution of input variables, and to calculate inverse of a matrix with the square size of the number of parameters. Though an adaptive estimation of the natural gradient has been proposed as a solution, it was originally developed for online learning mode, which is computationally inefficient for the learning of large data set. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive natural gradient estimation for mini-batch learning mode, which is commonly adopted for big data analysis. For two representative stochastic neural network models, we present explicit rules of parameter updates and learning algorithm. Through experiments on three benchmark problems, we confirm that the proposed method has superior convergence properties to the conventional methods.																				2076-3417				NOV	2019	9	21							4568	10.3390/app9214568	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9214568													WOS:000498058600093

Unlike existing approaches, the proposed framework provides natural 3D manipulation of a face without background distortion and interactive face editing by a user's input, which leads to freeform manipulation without any limitation of range or shape. To achieve these features, a 3D morphable face model is fitted to a face region in a video frame and is deformed by the user's input. The video frame is then mapped as a texture to the deformed model, and the model is rendered on the video frame. Because of the high computational cost, parallelization and acceleration schemes are also adopted for real-time performance. Performance evaluation and comparison results show that the proposed framework is promising for 3D face editing in live video.

To reduce cracks in ceramic products using machine learning, it is desirable to utilize big data in recently developed data-driven optimization schemes. However, there is insufficient big data for ceramic processes. Therefore, we developed a numerical algorithm to make "virtual" manufacturing data sets using indirect methods such as computer simulations and image processing. In this study, a numerical algorithm based on the random walk was demonstrated to generate images of cracks by adjusting the conditions of the random walk process such as the number of steps, changes in direction, and the number of cracks.																			1229-7801	2234-0491				NOV	2019	56	6					596	600		10.4191/kcers.2019.56.6.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.4191/kcers.2019.56.6.12													WOS:000500954900011

It is of great importance to select areas with similar natural cultivation characteristics in the plantations established for flower or timber production. Physiographical factors affecting these forests were explored to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil. The soil samples were collected from three natural populations, and a total of 43 samples were examined in terms of aspect, elevation, declivity position, and slope. It was determined that the natural linden populations expanded between the altitudes of 0 m and 400 m and 88% of the populations were denser in aspects with shadow. It was found that 91% of the soil was in the class of "deep to very deep", 61% showed an expansion in sandy clay loam soils, and 30% showed an expansion in sandy loam soils. Average soil pH ranged between 5.6 and 6.6. The soils were found to be salt-free and slightly limy. In terms of the organic carbon amount, the soils were classified as medium.																			1930-2126					NOV	2019	14	4					9588	9600		10.15376/biores.14.4.9588-9600	http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.14.4.9588-9600													WOS:000493997400142

Audio-Visual (Multimodal) Speech Recognition System Using Deep Neural Network	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION												Recognizing the voice of a person by a smart device has become the need of the hour. Our cell phones are equipped with such features that converts speech to text, receives a command as a voice instruction instead of screen touch or pressing of a button. There are numerous intelligent machines such as automatic cars, robots, smart phones that use speech recognition features. These features are also very useful for people who are disabled and cannot use the smart devices with their hands. There are numerous techniques available to implement a speech recognition system. The need of such a system is to accurately recognize human voice at any circumstances, because the accent of each human differs for a single language, and also, the human voice is never devoid of noise and other emotional elements. So, the aim of such systems is to recognize human voices of different accents, even in a noisy environment. Because of this, an effective and robust speech recognition system has become important for machine and human interaction. Much voice-recognizing software depends purely on audio to recognize a voice, and one cannot guarantee that the audio will be noise free. In order to improve the accuracy and performance of traditional speech recognition system in a noisy environment, a new, nontraditional approach called a multimodal speech recognition system that uses both the audio and video features such as lip movement facial expression to recognize a speech is used. This article discusses the advantage of using video features along with the audio features with an experiment that proves it.

Dealuminification of heat exchanger tubes	ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS												This paper presents a failure analysis of heat exchanger tubes manufactured from aluminum bronze. The equipment operates as an intercooler after the first stage compression. The cooling medium was seawater that passed inside the tubes. The investigation involved visual inspection, chemical analysis, metallography, hardness test, scanning electron microscope analysis, and thermal-hydraulic evaluation. The aluminum content of the analyzed tube was higher than the maximum value defined by the design specification ASTM B111 C61400. The high aluminum content promoted gamma(2) phase formation that was preferentially attacked from the tube inner surface. The tubes failed due to dealloying (dealuminification) associated with under-deposit corrosion in regions of higher temperatures and lower seawater velocities.																			1350-6307	1873-1961				NOV	2019	105						970	981		10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.07.052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engfailanal.2019.07.052													WOS:000496188200074

The organosilane was applied as an anchored coupling agent to connect the semiconductors at both ends, one of which connects SiC and the other connects CdS, and the SiC/M/CdS heterogeneous junction was established. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution ability of this heterojunction was three times as much as the traditional SiC/CdS composite under visible light. Meanwhile, the uniform interface distribution, prolonged charge-carrier lifetime and minor electron-hole recombination were achieved.

A Mechanistic Study of Carbon Steel Cracking in 360°C Air and Hydrogen Environments	CORROSION												Thirty percent cold-worked (CW) carbon steel tensile specimens were exposed to 360 degrees C air and hydrogen environments (2 MPa H-2 and 20 MPa H-2) under an applied load to produce intergranular creep cracking. In this study, cutting-edge microscopy techniques were applied to characterize cracking on multiple length scales and in three dimensions. The objective was to develop a better mechanistic understanding of creep cracking in carbon steel, and the known deleterious effect of hydrogen (attack) at the micro-to-nanoscale. Amorphous carbon along the fracture path was observed in all experiments, with evidence for nanoscale cavities/methane bubbles in hydrogen exposures, particularly at cementite-ferrite boundaries. Results suggested that creep or residual stress led to breakdown of cementite to amorphous carbon, cavitation, and/or formation of methane (depending on H-2 content); it is suggested that the combination of deleterious mechanisms leads to initiation and/or acceleration of creep cracking in CW carbon steel. Comparisons are made between the morphology of creep cracking in these laboratory experiments and recent results from characterization of creep cracking in ex-service carbon steel piping from a CANDU nuclear power plant. Although more subtle, similar morphology and chemistry at crack tips in laboratory and ex-service CW carbon steel suggests that the mechanism(s) of creep cracking is similar.																			0010-9312	1938-159X				NOV	2019	75	11					1354	1370		10.5006/3294	http://dx.doi.org/10.5006/3294													WOS:000493898700010

In this paper, we proposed and investigated the effect of the concentration of Ba[Mg2Al2N4]Eu2+conversion phosphor on the CCT deviation (D-CCT) and lumen output (LO) of the 6600 K conformal-packaging white LEDs (CPW-LEDs). For this purpose, we used the Light Tools and Mat Lab software to investigate this problem. From the research results, we can state that the concentration of the red phosphor has a significant effect on the optical quality of the 6600 K CPW-LEDs. The D-CCT can be decreased from 4700K to 2500K, and the LO can be increased from 600 lm. to 1200 lm. This research can provide the new recommendation for LEDs industry at this time.

Post annealing effects on the structural and optical properties of MoO<sub>3</sub> sandwiched with indium slabs	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												Molybdenum trioxide thin films are prepared by the thermal evaporation technique under vacuum pressure of 10(-5) mbar through insertion of indium slabs of thickness of 200 nm between layers of MoO3 and annealing the produced films in the air atmosphere at 250 degrees C for one hour. The films are studied by means of x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and optical spectrophotometry techniques. The structure of the films is found to be composed monoclinic MoO3, tetragonal indium and cubic In2O3. The phase percentage of In2O3 in the films increased to 26.3% upon annealing at 250 degrees C. The annealing process increased the microstrain, the defect density, the oxygen atomic content and lowered the crystallites and grains sizes in the films. Optically, two energy band gaps of values of 3.20 and 1.70 eV were detected for the MoO3/In/MoO3 system. In addition, nonlinear dielectric response associated with wide range of tunability in the dielectric constant value, in the optical conductivity and in the terahertz cutoff frequency was observed in the near IR spectral range. The annealing of the samples improved the nonlinearity in these parameters and make MoO3/In/MoO3 system more appropriates for optoelectronic technology applications as terahertz cavities and frequency convertors.

J	Rahman, TU; Amin, S; Haroon, SS				Rahman, Taqi Ur; Amin, Salman; Haroon, Shaikh Saaqib			A novel methodology for volume reduction of HV capacitors using highly electronegative composite nano materials	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												Capacitors play a key role in many electrical applications and devices. High voltage capacitors are commonly used in many stationary and mobile applications. Mobile applications of high voltage capacitors are of special interest for military installations and weapons. Size reduction of military equipment has always been a point of interest as it favours its easy handling, transportation and deployment. Capacitance offered by common dielectrics for high voltage capacitors is inversely proportional to thickness whereas withstand voltage is directly proportional to thickness. So, increasing the capacity of a high voltage capacitor without increasing its size is a daunting task. This research was aimed at reducing the size of high voltage capacitor while preserving its capacitance at same level by a novel method. Three of the common dielectric materials (polyethene, mylar and paper) for making high voltage capacitors, were surface treated with different concentrations of a nano powder specially formulated beforehand in a separate process. An increase in capacitance of about 12?35 times for different dielectrics was observed while keeping the size constant. This means a net reduction in volume while offering the same capacity. The method used in this work is promising way to decrease the volume of high voltage capacitors especially for mobile and military applications.

The effluents were collected from a textile industry at different stages of treatment, such as Collection Tank Effluent, Effluent after Anaerobic Treatment (EAT), Tertiary Treatment Effluent, and Reverse Osmosis Feed Effluent. The collected effluent samples have been analyzed to establish physicochemical characteristics and their effects on the properties of concrete, such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength. Higher salt content in effluent mix water significantly increased the final setting time of the binder. Furthermore, the workability of the concrete made with effluent mix water is relatively higher than that of the control concrete mix. Also, concrete mixes made with textile effluent mix water demonstrated greater strength than that of the control concrete. Furthermore, EAT mixes have exhibited maximum compressive strength compared with other mixes and also had superior durability compared with the control concrete mix. The higher strength can be attributed to the nucleation effect caused by the presence of a high concentration of total solids in the effluent. However, this concrete can be recommended for applications of plain cement concrete, such as pavements, industrial floors, and curbs/gutters.

Through batch and continuous experiments, it was found that all silica in the cathode phase of a reaction device could be removed if the necessary amounts of magnesium and calcium were present. This occurs because a silica-magnesium-calcium compound is produced via a polymerization reaction with cations in a solution and with hydroxide ions generated by electrolysis. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows that this material has the formula 2CaO-5MgO-8SiO(2)-H2O, and thus is likely generated by the reaction proposed by Sheikholeslami et al. (2019). Increasing the current sent through the reaction solution subsequently produces calcium carbonate. This technique for the separation of silica and calcium from aqueous solutions can be operated continuously without channel clogging, which indicates the possibility of practical applications. However, overly high currents promote the migration of protons from the anode to cathode phases, which inhibits the formation of precipitates due to a neutralization reaction. The proposed method is an effective approach for removing silica from a solution in geothermal binary power generation; although, a means of suppressing the effects of proton generation will be necessary if the process is also to be used to remove calcium ions.																				2077-0375				NOV	2019	9	11							154	10.3390/membranes9110154	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/membranes9110154								31731776					WOS:000501625200015

Bis(isomaleimide) and diphenol blends: Non-isothermal degradation kinetics and TG-FTIR studies	JOURNAL OF ELASTOMERS AND PLASTICS												Blends of 4,4 '-bisisomaleimidodiphenyl methane (VS) with structurally different diphenols are made in 1:1 molar ratio and thermally polymerized. Thermogravimetric studies of the cured materials show that the thermal stability, the degradation pattern and the char yield are much dependent on the structure of the diphenol that is used for blending. The decreased thermal stability of materials from the blends is attributed to decreased cross links owing to the opening of the isomaleimide rings by diphenols during thermal polymerization. The materials with trimethylphenylindane and tetramethylspirobiindane units exhibit char residue of 21% at 800 degrees C. This is due to the thermal stability of the indane and spirobiindane moieties present in the diphenol molecules. The apparent activation energy for thermal degradation (E-a-D) and pre-exponential factor (ln A) are derived. The Friedman, corrected Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, corrected Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and advanced Vyazovkin methods are used to calculate the E-a-D values for various reaction extents (alpha s). The E-a-D values of poly(4,4 '-bisisomaleimido-diphenyl methane) vary from 168 to 226 kJ mol(-1). A slight decrease in E-a-D is noted for the initial alpha levels and increases constantly up to alpha = 0.3-0.75 and then the E-a-D values decrease with increasing alpha values. The highest values of E-a-D and ln A are observed for the polymer derived from the blend of VS with tetramethylspirobiindane diphenol. The volatile products obtained during the thermal degradation of these polymers are analysed using thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) spectroscopy. The TG-FTIR studies showed the compounds carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and aromatic amines are the major degradation products from the polymerized blends.

J	Schneider, B; Ramm, E				Schneider, Benjamin; Ramm, Ekkehard			Conceptual experiments and discrete element simulations with polygonal particles	GRANULAR MATTER												In the present work intentionally polygonal particles with a regular hexagonal geometry are investigated. This allows removing the complexity of randomly shaped particles thus concentrating on the interaction between adjacent particles. For this purpose, conceptual compression experiments on assemblies of hexagonal steel nuts are performed and subsequently simulated by a discrete element method. The interaction models for contact of two particles are as follows: in normal direction an elastic model augmented by a viscous supplement and in tangential direction an elasto-plastic model are applied; furthermore, an elasto-plastic model describes the contact of a particle with a plane underground. For an adhering bond between particles an elasto-damage beam including an axial force is introduced between the centers of adjacent particles. It allows modeling gradual failure of the bond. In order to test the capability of these models in a direct way, the conceptual experiments on simple regular particle arrangements are compared with their corresponding simulations. For samples of unglued particles relevant characteristics like shear bands are reproduced. For assemblies of particles glued together by an adhesive the study describes important failure properties like localization in cracks as well as ductile failure.																			1434-5021	1434-7636				NOV	2019	21	4							91	10.1007/s10035-019-0930-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10035-019-0930-6													WOS:000482912600003

Modeling Iron Pentacarbonyl Ultrapurification in a Vertical Distillation Apparatus	INORGANIC MATERIALS												-This paper presents a mathematical model for the ultrapurification of substances via distillation in a closed vaporization-condensation system, where vapor condenses on a flowing down liquid film. We jointly analyze the mechanisms behind vaporization, vapor transport, condensation, condensate motion, and impurity diffusion in vaporizing liquid. Examining the removal of cobalt impurities from iron pentacarbonyl as an example, we assess the degree of purification as a function of vaporization and condensation temperatures, vaporization area, the fraction of liquid vaporized, and the radius and height of the condensation tube. Using experimentally determined temperature-dependent effective separation coefficients and the mathematical model, we find diffusion coefficients and equilibrium separation coefficients of cobalt, tungsten, and chromium impurities in iron pentacarbonyl.

This study investigated near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled with particle filter (PF) and partial least-squares (PLS) methods to predict wood compression strength. Three structural timbers (Acer mono, birch, and toothed oak) were studied. The NIR spectra were collected from 900 to 1700 cm(-1) and preprocessed by a standard normal variate transformation combined with Savitzky-Golay filtering. The prediction model coefficient matrix and standard variance were obtained by a PF iterative process, and their ratio was used to select the NIR feature wavelength points. A PLS prediction model based on NIR spectroscopy was established to predict the wood compression strength. Compared with the successive projection algorithm (SPA) and Kalman filtering (KF), the PF-PLS prediction model outperformed the other models in all three wood samples, resulting in a high correlation coefficient (r) of 0.89, 0.92, and 0.90, a low root-meansquare error of prediction (RMSEP) of 6.30, 10.60, and 9.71, and a fast average detection speed of 0.28 s, 0.46 s, and 0.33 s, respectively. The optimal PF selection can effectively reduce the redundant information of the NIR matrix and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction model.

The interference effects can be minimized with the help of adaptive directional antennas. The proposed model for implementing adaptive antenna techniques in MANET is a cross layer design. Utilizing adaptive antennas, two nodes are able to communicate when both the transmitter's and receiver's unidirectional radiation beams are directing toward each other's nodes. A cross layer methodology for dynamic topology control enables the interaction between medium access control layer and the routing layer for reaching the necessary quality of service (QoS) of various data packets. After the initialization of a network, the algorithm initially develops a topology and the routing techniques use this network topology to find out the route paths for data transmission. Later, based on the network scenario for ongoing transmissions and to obtain the necessary QoS, the topology gets altered by the topology control layer in order to obtain the optimized network with better performance. Simulation results show specifically, throughput and signal-to-noise ratio were increased by 33 % and 42 %, respectively.

However, current adsorbents are limited in separating boric acid from water due to their low desorption capability and poor selectivity for boric acid. In this study, the authors developed a functional cellulosic paper via crosslinking cellulose and tannic acid with chitosan to efficiently and reversibly remove boric acid from water. The adsorption capacity reached 769 mg/m(2) according to the Langmuir model. The corresponding desorption rate of the chitosan/tannic acid-modified paper exceeded 80% in the whole flow rate region ranging from 15 to 250 mL/h. The reversible adsorption and desorption of boric acid were attributed to the formation and dissociation of the borate bond between the tannic acid and boric acid, respectively, at different pH values. This study improved the selectivity, batch adsorption, expensive carriers, and desorption difficulties of existing boric acid adsorption materials. This approach offers a new way to design highly efficient adsorption/desorption materials by constructing reversible chemical bonds for removal of other pollutants.					kong, fangong/LJL-8621-2024														1930-2126					NOV	2019	14	4					7734	7750		10.15376/biores.14.4.7734-7750	http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.14.4.7734-7750													WOS:000493997400011

A model for indigo pattern elements is proposed based on cardinal splines, in which the rigidity of shape is conveyed by the tension coefficient, and the concavity and variety by configuration of the knots. The generalized version of this model is capable of covering any complex element. The contour tracing technique is employed to extract pattern elements from the image, and the closest model instance is selected in virtue of invariance of the improved Hu moments. The selected instances are transformed with respect to the geometric center, the coverage, and the coincidence to match the pattern elements in the image so as to reconstruct the whole pattern. The element filters are conducted on the reconstructed patterns to modify the elements and produce new innovative patterns of constant skeleton. The model is borrowed serving as a skeleton in element assembling. The skeleton properties are investigated to provide basis for skeleton embodiment in which these properties are involved into establishing the placement determiner and element determiner so as to carry out the assembling of elements. Also discussed is the extended skeleton which goes beyond the model and brings about variety and flexibility to element assembling. It is turned out that reconstruction with the model well implements a mathematical copy of the pattern, and the assembling of elements by skeletons provides rich possibilities to innovation of indigo patterns.

For the polymeric colloids with minimum film formation temperature higher than the room temperature, the setup is used to determine the evaporation rate and the temperature film formation. The versatility of the experimental setup is increased by a controlled temperature of the sample holder and a controlled microclimate chamber (temperature and relative humidity). Investigations on various aqueous dispersions considering the composition, the viscosity of the liquid, and different types of polymeric colloidal particles have been performed, and some results are discussed here.

Thermoelastic and mechanical properties in diamond, c-BN, c-SiC, TiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>1.85</sub> and w-ZnO	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING												Thermoelastic and mechanical properties have been obtained in materials with high (diamond, c-SiC, c-BN), medium (TiO2, TiO1.85) and low (w-ZnO) hardness by means of ab initio calculations. Our methodology combines the ab initio results of SIESTA code with discrete element method (DEM) to describe the fracture in brittle materials. This methodology has shown to be efficient in predicting TiO2 hardness at the normal and high-pressure phases, and to describe low hardness materials such as cassiterite (SnO2). On the other hand, micro-hardness Vickers models such as Simunek et al. were applied to predict the hardness using structural and electronic parameters of single crystals, showing the importance of the information provided by self-consistent calculations. Our results show that it is possible to extend this methodology to the evaluation of the micro-hardness of a wide range of materials, and consequently, the methodology could be extended more reliably in a systematic searching of hardness in the design of solid solutions.																			0947-8396	1432-0630				NOV	2019	125	11							770	10.1007/s00339-019-3074-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00339-019-3074-y													WOS:000492157100002
J	Urban, M				Urban, Maciej			Two Limiting Lines Technique to Obtain Minimum Paste Demand of Self-Consolidating Concrete	ACI MATERIALS JOURNAL												Today, one of the most important challenges of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) technology is minimization of cement paste content. Unfortunately, there are no methods that include this important criterion. The author aimed to fill this gap by determining the relative thickness of excess paste on aggregate grains parameter (t(rel)). This parameter is linearly correlated to minimal paste content needed to obtain a given SCC consistency level (V-paste min). Two such lines were recognized: minimum paste demand line and minimum relative thickness of excess paste line. The main parameters influencing obtaining these lines are: sand to total aggregate ratio (s/a), void content in a loose state (nu(l)), the coarsest fraction content, water-binder ratio (w/b), superplasticizer content, and aggregate fines content (or, alternatively, stone powder content). The proposed design procedure begins with assessment of both lines (using only four to six trial batches of extreme compositions in consideration). Next, the lines are used to predict the V-paste min level by simple calculation of t(rel) for a given SCC composition.

In this study, a novel simulation model based on the Monte Carlo simulation has been utilized to calculate the mass attenuation coefficients for some vitamins at the energies 356.61, 661.66, 1,250, and 1,408.01 keV. The calculated attenuation coefficient values were then used to determine the mass energy absorption coefficient. It was observed that the parameters were highly in accordance with the XCOM program and experimental data. The results showed that the model is quite convenient in the calculation of mass attenuation coefficients. Besides, the Monte Carlo simulation can be followed to determine the attenuation of photons in various materials. The results of the investigated data are useful in the medical field.																			0090-3973	1945-7553				NOV	2019	47	6					4513	4522		10.1520/JTE20170755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/JTE20170755													WOS:000491001500047

This conventional procurement management method is commonly practiced (more than 95 % of the time), which encourages improper utilization of resources in construction industries. Material procurement is a financially operated arena that requires technology transfer rather than common techniques. Construction stakeholders are generally unaware of E-Technology development. Recent E-Technology commerce networking and communication has been drastically improved and thus can be effectively utilized to produce uninterrupted supply chain management in construction procurement systems; additionally, this technological transfer system in construction industries can improve the profit margins and can avoid time overrun of construction projects.					p, venugopal/AAX-1189-2020	Venugopal, Pulidindi/0000-0003-0880-7565; p, venugopal/0000-0002-5608-8414													0090-3973	1945-7553				NOV	2019	47	6					4192	4198		10.1520/JTE20180500	http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/JTE20180500													WOS:000491001500025

The monotonic and cyclic shear stress-strain behaviors of the alloys are described using the Ramberg-Osgood model and the materials constitutive parameters were estimated minimizing the difference between the experimental torque and the analytical value. Results of torsion fatigue tests with R=-1 were compared with rotating bending results and the load factor was evaluated. Experimental fatigue results indicated that the alloys at T6 condition showed the best behavior and the results of strontium modified alloys shown slightly lower performance. The fatigue life diagram of T6 alloys has steeper negative slope (shear fatigue strength exponent, b congruent to-0.2) than the others as cast alloys (b congruent to-0.06). The comparisons of experimental rotating bending and reverse torsion fatigue showed exponent b is dependent on the load type for the as cast alloys. For the heat-treated alloys, the variation of exponent b is minimal and its value can be considered constant.

Chemical Interaction of InAs with Zinc	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS												The partial pressure of Zn over the system including three condensed phases [(In-Zn)-InAs(s)-Zn3As2(s)] has been determined between 617 K and 740 K by optical absorption of a vapor phase at 307.6 nm using a Zn hollow cathode lamp as a source of radiation. The array of experimental data contained 52 values of Zn pressure from 0.32 Pa up to 20 Pa at different temperatures. Using this information the activity of zinc and its mole fraction in metal phase (from 4.6 at.% to 8.3 at.%) were founded.

Guided wave approach to interpret impulse response testing results for piles	INSIGHT												The impulse response method has been applied to the integrity testing of piles for many years and constant velocity one-dimensional (1D) wave theory is conventionally used to interpret the test results. However, there are three- dimensional (3D) effects in the wave responses of piles, so this research uses 3D guided wave theory to analyse the impulse response results. This proposed approach is verified on five piles with different diameters and lengths. The resulting analysis indicates that guided wave theory can efficiently identify the phase velocities at their corresponding resonant frequencies, which are found in the testing spectrum using the concept of resonance. The measured phase velocity is mostly predictable within +/- 2% along the theoretically determined curve, with velocity slightly reducing as frequency increases.																			1354-2575	1754-4904				NOV	2019	61	11					634	642		10.1784/insi.2019.61.11.634	http://dx.doi.org/10.1784/insi.2019.61.11.634													WOS:000499084800005

First, distributions and distortions of residual stresses under coupled extensional-shear loadings were studied. Subsequently, thermal residual stresses were deducted from the thermal analysis, followed by a sequentially structural analysis. It is found that the heat flux has an influence on the magnitude of the thermal residual stresses, but it cannot alter the distribution of the thermal residual stresses. In order to render deep understanding of the microscale behavior in amine-grafted MWCNTs/binary resin composites under thermal loading, for exploring the nature of residual stress variation, the corresponding microscale model is expected to be developed using atomistic simulation, in which the microstructural features of amine-grafted MWCNTs and resin matrix are taken into consideration. The total energy, potential energy, and kinetic energy at different temperature were analyzed as well as the radial distribution function g(r). Weak van der Waals interaction between amine-grafted MWCNTs and resin matrix is indicated and the interactions between amine-grafted MWCNTs and resin matrix reduce and the mobility of chain segments of resin matrix increases with the decreasing temperature.

The results showed that the measured fatigue threshold values in lamellar gamma-TiAl alloys are very sensitive to the applied testing procedures. For example, the staircase load-increasing method yielded smaller threshold values. When such a load-increasing method was used, the threshold values were measured either from a notch machined by electro-discharge machining or prepared by a compression-compression fatigue loading. Moreover, some differences could be seen with respect to the morphologies of the crack starters. Most of the above influences are associated with the brittle nature of the material and the characteristics of the lamellar microstructures, and closure effects are primarily induced by crack wake roughness or unbroken ligaments.																				1996-1944				NOV	2019	12	21							3487	10.3390/ma12213487	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma12213487								31653069					WOS:000502798800028

Effect of Limited Tension Stiffening in Reinforced Concrete Elements under Cyclic Loads	ACI STRUCTURAL JOURNAL												The tension capacity in cracked concrete is not well defined in existing shear models for rein forced concrete (RC) membrane elements under cyclic reversed loading, and the shear strength of RC elements is consequently overestimated due to the deviated decreasing branch of envelope of cyclic tensile stress-strain relationship. In this paper; the cyclic effect of limited tension stiffening of cracked RC elements is evaluated by proposing an analytical model named as the cyclic tension-stiffening fixed-angle truss model (CTFTM). The proposed model, based on fixed-angle theory, integrates unloading and reloading rules and accumulated damage into the limited tension-stiffening effect under cyclic loading and considers the consequent local stress variation at crack surface. The cyclic effect of limited tension stiffening of RC elements is verified by comparing with experimental results in the literature. The predictions show good agreement, and the effect of biaxial loading is also examined.					wang, xueying/HTM-5140-2023														0889-3241	1944-7361				NOV	2019	116	6					143	152		10.14359/51716802	http://dx.doi.org/10.14359/51716802													WOS:000497667200013

The surface structure of the catalyst with large specific surface area was obtained by surface etching of the gradient membrane with 1 mol/L HNO3. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis show that the PtCu replacement solid solution alloy is formed on the surface of the composite membrane electrode, the original Pt lattice is contracted and the spacing between the crystal planes is narrowed. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) RTEM-STEM measurements show that the surface of the post-processed samples has multi-peak structure and trench-pore structure.

For security enhancement, we adopt the max-link relay selection policy and propose three secure transmission schemes: (1) non-jamming (NJ); (2) source cooperative jamming (SCJ); and (3) source cooperative jamming with optimal power allocation (SCJ-OPA). Moreover, to analyze the secrecy performance comprehensively, two eavesdropping scenarios, i.e., non-colluding eavesdroppers (NCE) and colluding eavesdroppers (CE) are considered. Based on this, by modeling the dynamic buffer state transition as a Markov chain, we derive the exact closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability, the average secrecy throughput, and the end-to-end delay for each schemes. The analytical analysis and simulation shows that the SCJ-OPA scheme achieves similar performance as the NJ scheme when the total transmit power is small. On the other hand, when the transmit power is high, the performance achieved by SCJ-OPA is similar to that of SCJ. Thereby, the SCJ-OPA scheme can achieve better performance across the entire total transmit power, which makes up the defects of NJ and SCJ exactly.

In order to improve the rolling of the substrate support, the bushing device adopts a ball transfer method in which a large ball and a small ball are mixed. When the main transfer ball of the bushing part of the substrate support contacts the substrate support, the small ball also rotates simultaneously with the rotation of the main ball, minimizing the resistance that can be generated during the vertical movement of the substrate support. As a result of the improvement, the glass substrate breakage rate is reduced by more than 90 similar to 95 %, and the equipment preventive maintenance and board support replacement cycles are extended four times or more, from once a month to more than four months, and the equipment uptime is at least 15 % improved.

Ultrasonic waves propagate in austenitic stainless steel welds with multiple paths and modes. This study employed a multi-view total focusing method using an ultrasonic phased array for defect detection in the welds of small-diameter austenitic stainless steel pipes. The detection capability of four different direct wave modes and eight different half-skip wave modes for typical defects were compared and analysed through numerical simulation. A fusion imaging method was developed using the preferred direct and half-skip wave modes. The process was further verified with a weld defect detection experiment carried out on small-diameter austenitic stainless steel pipes. The results show that the multi-view total focusing method can efficiently detect the defects in the welds of small-diameter tubes. Compared with the single-mode imaging method, the fusion total focusing imaging approach can not only improve the signal-to-noise ratio but can also reduce the number of image artefacts.																			1354-2575	1754-4904				NOV	2019	61	11					649	655		10.1784/insi.2019.61.11.649	http://dx.doi.org/10.1784/insi.2019.61.11.649													WOS:000499084800007

The present work concerns the high-temperature performance of the chamotte-zircon composite. The crystalline phase, mechanical property, and thermal conductivity were evaluated. In addition, the finite element method was applied to analyze stress distribution. Zircon accelerated the melting of cristobalite in chamotte during sintering. After adding zircon, a drastic elastic modulus change at about 230 degrees C was avoided, and the infrared shielding effect of zircon reduced the thermal conductivity when the temperature was greater than 500 degrees C. At last, based on the results of finite element method, increasing zircon content reduced stress concentration.

Its structure was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that 1) cross-linking increased the Schiff base in SDP, 2) immobilization barely changed the secondary structure such as alpha-helix and beta-sheet of SDP, and 3) adhesives were evenly distributed on the surface after immobilization. Studies on the enzymatic properties of SDP showed that the substrate imprinting significantly improved heat resistance and neutralization resistance of SDP. For example, the relative activity of SDP at 35 to 75 degrees C and at pH 4.4 to 6.5 was 5% and 15% more than that of the adsorption and crosslinking double immobilized pectinase (DP), respectively. In addition, after 8 cycles of use, the relative enzyme activity of SDP still reached 39.5%. Moreover, use of SDP decreased the cation demand in whitewater by 10% compared with DP. Overall, the use of a broad-spectrum substrate for imprinting to obtain SDP provides a new idea and method for using pectinase in in complex systems such as juice clarification and wastewater treatment.

MWCNTs provide a good conductive path that promotes electron transport and maintains structural integrity. The three-dimensional interconnect structure of PM facilitates rapid electrical/ion transport and good electrolyte penetration. The intercalation of nano-Si in layered porous matrix effectively alleviated the serious volume expansion of Si during discharge/charge and prevent the pulverization of Si particles. The addition of LiF can compensated for the L+ consume in the formation of the SEI layers and enhanced the stability of SEI membrane. The electrochemical tests shown that the initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of the SPM/G/7.5%LiF (SPMG-7.5%LiF) electrode reached approximately 75.2%.

The Positive Effect of Hydrogen Alloying on the Phase Tailoring and Mechanical Properties of Sintered Ti-13Nb SMAs	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE												The effect of hydrogen alloying on phase tailoring and mechanical properties of the sintered Ti-13Nb (at pct) shape memory alloy (SMA) was investigated. It was found that hydrogen addition changed the microstructure of the sintered Ti-13Nb-(0-31)H (at pct) alloys gradually from alpha + beta dual phase to single beta phase due to the lowered transition temperature of beta phase to alpha phase by hydrogen action. The reduction of alpha phase precipitation in the alloy reduced the amount of Nb squeezed out from the Nb-depleted alpha phase, and consequently decreased the mean Nb content in the beta phase. Thus, the Ms temperature of Ti-13Nb alloy was successfully increased from lower temperature to near room temperature, which consequently enhanced the recoverable strain of the alloy by easier martensitic transformation. The sintered Ti-13Nb-18H alloy presented a Ms temperature of 22 degrees C and a remarkable recoverable strain of 3.9 pct at room temperature, which is the highest value ever reported in the sintered Ti-Nb based SMAs. Meanwhile, the Ti-13Nb-18H alloy exhibited a fracture strain of 23.1 pct and a fracture strength of 1321 MPa, both better than that of the Ti-13Nb alloy, which was attributed to the hydrogen atoms in the alloy which caused solid solution strengthening and also increased the content of the b phase with higher plasticity.

Results indicate that when the oxidation temperature reached or exceeded 950 degrees C, a complete external oxide film was obtained. Zn would vaporize and condense on the surface of the alloys.

At the same time, the precursor grown in situ on carbon fiber produces ordered and controllable Millepore sp.-like materials as well as a stand-by electrode. The resistance of the adhesive bond to the glassy carbon electrode by the cobalt-nickel material is avoided. Following electrochemical activity tests, the Millepore sp.-like NiCo precursor showed significant redox activity on dopamine and uric acid.

In addition to propagation delay and characteristic impedance, the method uses a phenomenological study on the frequency dependence of the transmission lines and identifies two unified parameters that, respectively, correspond to conductor (skin-effect) and dielectric loss. An accurate transient response is derived, and a generic circuit library is established for efficient and case-independent SPICE simulation. Using peak distortion analysis, the eye diagram versus loss parameters is plotted into unified design charts for eye height and width, which depicts the signal quality without the need for pseudorandom bit sequence simulation. The proposed model is also generalized to coupled transmission lines. The far-end crosstalk noise is found to be significantly affected by the loss parameters, and the proposed circuit model ensures accurate simulation.

The test results indicate that both the elastic modulus and hardness values decrease with the peak force increasing. The elastic modulus increases as the loading velocity increases. However, increasing unloading velocity leads to the decrease of the elastic modulus. The hardness exhibits a decrease with the loading velocity increasing and appears unloading velocity independent.

The effects of the main variables influencing the yield and content of antimony in the smelting slag were investigated in detail for the content-optimized slag, and the following optimum smelting conditions were determined: smelting duration of 50 min, rate of coke, i.e., coke dosage of 12.5 wt.%, and smelting temperature of 1000 degrees C. These conditions enabled high recovery of antimony, > 92.0%, and low antimony content in the slag of around 0.97%; the values of both these parameters are superior to those achieved by existing processes.																			1047-4838	1543-1851				NOV	2019	71	11					3903	3908		10.1007/s11837-018-3262-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11837-018-3262-9													WOS:000491296400015

The AAO is chosen as the leak element because its conductance remains constant from vacuum to atmosphere. The container to be measured is connected to the vacuum system via the AAO leak element. The dynamic differential pressure decay with time between the inlet and outlet of AAO leak assembly was measured and fitted by an exponential function, followed by volume calculation. The volume of two different containers has been obtained using this method with nitrogen, helium, and argon, respectively. The influence of temperature fluctuation on experimental results under vacuum and atmospheric pressure outlet conditions was discussed. For vacuum outlet conditions, the temperature change caused by pressure decay in one single experiment is small enough to satisfy the isothermal hypothesis, which makes the influence of temperature fluctuation on the experimental results negligible. The preliminary results compared with the static expansion method demonstrate that this novel volume measurement technique is accurate, simple and efficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The key problem of SRLS is found to be providing the closest contact between the tritiated carrier substrate and phosphor screen. The improved sol-gel technique of suspended sedimentation of phosphor screen from the potassium water glass binder solution was developed. The composition of the solution was established experimentally and the strong and uniform experimental prototypes of the glass coated phosphor screens were prepared with various thickness. The screen thickness was controlled by the amount of phosphor in the suspension. The optimal thickness of the phosphor screen, giving the maximum luminescence intensity was also determined. The two laboratory prototypes of solid-state radioluminescent light sources were fabricated by coating the phosphor directly on the tritium beta-source. The strong and uniform phosphor screens were produced by the modified sol-gel technique, without using any secondary dispersing agents. The screens were coated directly on the tritium beta-emitter, to provide the tight contact between phosphor and tritium Phosphor screens of different thicknesses were manufactured and the optimal thickness was found.

By using this model, the relative growth rate conditions for all polyhedral crystals (14 kinds) that enclosed by low index crystal faces were successfully deduced, resulting in a R-{100}/{111}-R-{100}/{110} plot. In turn, these conclusions could be applied in crystallography research: (1) predict the crystal morphology if giving the relative growth rate of the crystal faces; (2) calculate the surface ratio of each crystal plane if giving the relative growth rate of the crystal faces; (3) calculate the relative growth rate of the crystal faces if knowing the polyhedron shape, and so on.

For such a system, more driving motors and precise transmission mechanisms are necessary, which makes the control and fabrication complicated. This paper aims to present the design and construction of a novel holonomic mechanism to simplify the system. Air-based propulsion was applied to a land-based holonomic vehicle. A prototype with three roller balls was developed with a propeller for the propulsion of a triangular holonomic vehicle. Only two motors were applied, one for propeller rotation and the other for the adjustment of the angle of thrust. For the establishment of the methodology, the data, including propeller size, rotation per minute, velocity, thrust, efficiency, etc., were measured or calculated. The prototype can move at a velocity of approximate 0.558 m/s with an efficiency of 18.55%. Simulation results showed that with the increase of propulsion efficiency, the velocity can achieve more than 5 m/s if the efficiency is 70%. This study is the first attempt to apply air-based propulsion to a land-based holonomic vehicle. Further, the construction method is simple and can satisfy the accuracy requirement. This design method, therefore, will contribute to the application of holonomic vehicles due to the realization of holonomic functionality and simplicity.					zhang, sheng/AGP-1983-2022	zhang, sheng/0000-0001-5599-6261														2076-3417				NOV	2019	9	21							4657	10.3390/app9214657	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9214657													WOS:000498058600182

The former chemical effect gained by the formation of chemical order governs GFA in the lower Ni concentrations, thus demonstrating GFA enhancement upon micro solute addition.

The present work identifies an Er3+ doped micro-sized CSAO-CSO mixed material that exhibits both up-conversion and persistent luminescence. The cross-relaxation that occurs among Er3+ ions contributes to enhancing the up-conversion intensity. The Tm3+/Ho3+ co-doped strategy was used to induce tunable up-conversion colors. The cross-relaxation process corresponding to the energy transfer mechanism was investigated via the luminescence lifetimes of Er3+. Moreover, the persistent luminescence and thermo-luminescence properties of CSAO-CSO: Er3+ were also investigated systematically. Our results combine the fields of up-conversion and persistent luminescence, which may support other explorations of new kinds of long-persistent and up-conversion materials.

It was compared to that of specimens in ambient conditions (16 degrees C [60.8 degrees F]). On these bases, a nonlinear local bond-slip model was proposed. Two key parameters-A and B-are employed in the proposed bond-slip model, the specific expressions of which were mainly related to ultimate pullout load and peak shear stress of the specimen. The results show that the bond behavior of CFRP strip represents a negative quadratic curve with curing temperature and positive inverse tangent curves with curing time, respectively. The nonlinear local bond-slip model, considering the curing temperature-time, is deduced and validated.																			0889-325X	1944-737X				NOV-DEC	2019	116	6					5	18		10.14359/51719148	http://dx.doi.org/10.14359/51719148													WOS:000500743500001
J	Zhu, F; Liu, HC; Yan, BJ; Deng, TF				Zhu, Feng; Liu, Huachen; Yan, Baijun; Deng, Tengfei			Enhancement of bonding strength between lead wires and ceramic matrix of metal ceramic heater	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY												In recent years, metal ceramic heaters (MCHs) have become widely used in daily life and industrial applications. This paper introduces a method for producing an MCH with high bonding strength of the bonding wires by adding oxide additives (Al2O3, SiO2, and MgO) to a metal slurry. Pilot experiments were carried out at 1600 degrees C under a protective atmosphere. The results indicate that the temperature coefficient of resistance of the samples decreases whereas the bonding strength vastly increases, and the pulling forces of the bonding wires in the samples extends from 2 to 32 N. The pulling forces are progressively increased as the content of the spinel phase in the oxide additives increases. The mechanism of enhancement of the bonding strength is discussed herein. The microstructure characterization, element mapping, and element analysis of different samples were performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results indicate that the formation of a W-Si solid solution in the sample is the main reason for the decrease in temperature coefficient of resistance. The interface between the metal and spinel layers forms a zigzag and interlocked shape, which significantly improves the bonding strength between the lead wires and the ceramic matrix of the MCH.

After pre-aging at 100 degrees C for 3 h, the Zn addition prompts the formation of clusters with a uniform Mg/Si ratio, which can easily transform into beta" phases. Consequently, a fine and dense distribution of beta" phases is observed in the Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloy with Zn addition during bake hardening treatment at 185 degrees C for 25 min after pre-aging. This correlates well with the enhanced bake hardening response of the Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloy with Zn addition.																			1002-185X					NOV	2019	48	11					3500	3505																WOS:000500083600012

The stress state of collagen fibres retanned with PAA was analysed and the structure of retanned leather was characterised by SEM and strain-stress analysis. The results show that PAA mainly interacts with collagen fibres by adhesive force (AF) between collagen fibres and capillary flow.

This process is particularly, important in the textiles - based fashion industry, where external purchases for the retail network are often made once and the goods have shallow stocks. In older to optimise the stream of materials, the use of an integrated IT system is essential. Therefore, the main purpose of this publication is to show how IT solutions can be used to simplify the automation and optimisation of the process of generating proposals for goods reallocation within the retail network.

Resonance Energy Transfer from Alkylbenzene Substrates to Naphthalene and Biphenyl Overlayers on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C												In an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, an alkylbenzene was deposited from the vapor phase onto a cryogenically cooled Al2O3 surface. An additional layer with a fluorophore of naphthalene or methylnaphthalene was deposited, and the bilayer was optically pumped. Vapor-deposited naphthalene and methyl-substituted naphthalene molecules on the surface of Al2O3 are amorphously arranged and exhibit a characteristic excimeric fluorescence that is spectrally broad, featureless, and red-shifted relative to the monomer fluorescence. When the bilayer was heated in a temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment, the ordering in the alkylbenzene substrate caused the overlayer of naphthalenes to crystalize due to heteroepitaxy. Finally, the two layers mixed when the surface temperature was nearly at the desorption temperature and resonance energy transfer was observed from the alkylbenzene to naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes when the alkylbenzene percolated through the naphthalene and methylnaphthalene adlayers. The wavelength-resolved TPD and laser-induced fluorescence of the bilayer are reported. Reformation of the excimer after the passage of the alkylbenzene occurred for weak alkylbenzene naphthalene interaction, whereas for strong interaction, the naphthalene monomer emission persisted after desorption of the alkylbenzene.

Effect of Different Cr and Ni Additions on Oxidation Behavior of Co-Re-Based Alloys	JOM												The oxidation characteristics of Co-17Re-Cr-Ni alloys with varying Cr (18 at.% and 23 at.%) and Ni (8 at.%, 15 at.%, and 25 at.%) concentrations have been investigated at 1000 degrees C in air. The corrosion resistance of the Co-17Re-23Cr-xNi alloys improved with increasing Ni concentration, in turn facilitating the formation of a protective chromia layer. This observation can be attributed to an enhanced Cr diffusivity, as quantitatively confirmed by the determination of the Cr diffusion coefficients of the Co-17Re-18Cr-xNi alloys. Reduction of the Cr concentration from 23 at.% to 18 at.% deteriorated the oxidation behavior, as mass loss was detected. Unexpectedly, the alloy with intermediate Ni concentration exhibited the best oxidation behavior among the various Co-17Re-18Cr-xNi alloys studied. Accelerated sigma phase formation in the Co-17Re-18Cr-25Ni alloy trapped a significant amount of Cr, lowering its concentration in the alloy matrix and, thus, decelerating the Cr2O3 formation.

The growth of GaN was enhanced not only from bottom c-plane, but also from the sidewall of the micron-sized patterns. In this study, KOH solution was used to etch AlN (especially sidewall AlN) for the first time. The additional etching process is very simple. It was found that KOH etching 1 min did enhance the light output power (LOP) of LED. However, with the increase of etching time to 4 min, the LOP decreased. Besides, the effect of remained AlN on GaN growth mechanism was investigated in detail. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

The maximum absorption wavelength of DYE-BD was calculated with the same basis set by using the Gaussian 09 software based on different methods, while time-dependent density functional theory was applied to simulate the maximum emission wavelength of the designed dye. The changes in enthalpy and Gibbs free energy were simulated at the b3lyp/6-31G(d) level, and energy changes in the luminescence process were assessed using mathematical methods. Furthermore, DYE-BD was used to colour acrylic fabric following the typical dyeing procedure for cationic dyes. The photostability of the synthesised dye was analysed using quantum theory and mathematical methods. The synthesised dye, analysed using the Ecological Structure Activity Relationships class program, had no toxicity to aquatic life, while the acrylic fabrics dyed with DYE-BD met the fluorescent orange requirements for background and combined performance materials according to the EN ISO 20471:2013 standard.

Kinetics of current in glass-ceramics on the base of vanadium dioxide	JOURNAL OF ELECTROCERAMICS												The kinetics of current at switching of the VO2 based glass-ceramics samples from a state with high resistance (the off-state) to a state with low resistance (the on-state) and vice versa was studied. The delay of the transition from off-state to on-state, when a switching voltage U-0 is applied to a sample, is related to the time t(don) required to heat a sample to the metal-semiconductor phase transition temperature in VO2. The delay time t(don) decreases with the increase of U-0. It is shown that the calculated dependence of t(don) on the voltage U-0, obtained with the simplified heat balance equation of a sample and the "critical temperature" model, is in good conformity with the experimental data. It was found that the delay of reverse transition from the on-state to the off-state controls the conductive channel, within which the crystallites of VO2 are in the metallic phase. The delay time t(doff) of this transition determines the time during which, after turning off the voltage U-0, a conductive channel exists in a sample. The value of t(doff) increases with the increase of U-0. The reason for this behavior is the expansion of conductive channel with the increase of U-0. As a consequence, takes place the increasing number of VO2 crystallites in the metallic phase. Therefore, t(doff) increases due to an increase in the time required for dissipation of the heat released during the transition of the VO2 crystallites from the metallic phase to the semiconducting phase.

Investigation of Dynamic Deformation of Polymer Systems in a Viscoelastic State	FIBRE CHEMISTRY												The process of dynamic deformation of polymer systems with a polymer concentration below the critical value is investigated. The complex viscosity and its components - viscosity and elasticity, were determined over the entire range of changes in the circular frequency, including the section of destruction of the initial structure of the polymer system. It was established that almost until the destruction of the initial structure, the constancy of the complex viscosity is maintained, within which its viscous and elastic components change. It is shown that the cause of the destruction of the initial structure of the polymer system (entanglement network) is its transition from a viscoelastic state to a forced elastic one, when the complex viscosity is almost completely determined by its elastic component. When the ultimate strength of the polymer network is reached, the initial structure is destroyed, accompanied by a decrease in the complex viscosity and its elastic component with their subsequent increase.																			0015-0541	1573-8493				JUL	2019	51	2					77	82		10.1007/s10692-019-10051-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10692-019-10051-2		OCT 2019											WOS:000492654000003

Terahertz transitions between Landau levels in graphene with different concentrations of electrons	FULLERENES NANOTUBES AND CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES												The probability of terahertz transitions between Landau levels for various magnetic fields at 4.2 K is calculated at different positions of Fermi levels corresponding to different concentrations of electrons. A resonant type magnetic field dependence of light absorption at fixed Fermi energy is demonstrated. Besides the ideal case of well-defined Landau levels with small broadening, the effects of resonance degradation due to big broadenings and big fluctuations of Fermi energy along the sample are demonstrated. The maximum values of light absorption coefficients and their resonance positions in magnetic field scale B-max were studied in a wide range of Fermi energies from 0 up to 400 meV at frequency THz of the incident beam. The calculation shows that B-max increases when Fermi energy grows, but there are regions of plateaus resulting in semiladder type of this dependence. The peak values of light absorption manifest a periodic-like dependence on Fermi energy with a huge change in value (in several orders), although the increase in average of maximum value of absorption with Fermi energy is also observed. The possibility to observe photoconductivity response due to photoinduced charge carriers by terahertz transitions between Landau levels is discussed.

The lattice constants of pure Co and Co-W alloy, both with fcc and hcp structure, gradually decrease with the increasing pressure. In general, the bulk modulus(B), shear modulus(G) and Young's modulus(E) of pure Co and Co-W alloy increase approximately linearly with the increasing pressure. W solution brings almost negligible impact on B of fcc and hcp Co, however, effect of W solution on G and E can not be neglected. It is worth to mention that B, G, and E for fcc Co and Co-W alloy are always higher than those for hcp Co and Co-W alloy at the same pressure. According to the calculated results, W solution can improve the ductility and thermodynamic stability of Co, and increase the hcp to fcc phase transition pressure from 102 GPa to 130 GPa.

Interaction of Foam Ceramic with the Alkaline Medium of Concretes	GLASS AND CERAMICS												The activity of foam ceramic and foam glass in terms of the silicate-alkali interaction in concrete was investigated. It was found that in the wet environment in concrete the vitrified walls of the pores of the aggregates are chemically active. The transformations of foam ceramic include gelation of the pore walls with formation of an alkaline aluminosilicate gel followed by its crystallization. This binds the active components on such an aggregate in the crystalline phases, which are inert in a moist environment. The final stage of the transformation of the foam glass is noncrystallizing, alkaline, hydrated, silica gel.

Performance of glyoxal-resorcinol-based aqua gel and its activated carbon for the production of environmental-friendly bagasse composites	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOOD AND WOOD PRODUCTS												This work deals with the evaluation of the ability of resorcinol-glyoxal based aqua-gel (AG) and its activated carbon (ACAG), as new formaldehyde scavenger, to provide low toxic urea formaldehyde(UF)-bagasse composite. Preliminary studies were carried out to evaluate the adsorption capacity of ACAG, via determining its texture parameters and adsorption of formaldehyde. The performance of the investigated scavenger-UF adhesive systems was evaluated in comparison with previously synthesized activated carbons based on gels from different chain length aldehydes. Further, the quality of final bagasse composites was evaluated by mechanical, water resistance and free-HCHO tests. The results show that the investigated ACAG has a promising effect towards HCHO adsorption (149 mg/g) compared to that obtained from previously published gel-activated carbons (max. 109 mg/g). Both AG and ACAG provide improvement in properties of the resulted bagasse composites. The greatest improvement in static bending was noticed by applying AG-UF adhesive system (MOR: 32.2 MPa and MOE: 2026 MPa); these values exceed the ANSI standard requirements for grade H-3, while the internal bond strength (0.51 MPa) exceeds the M-2 grade. Applying the ACAG-UF adhesive system provides greater reduction in free-HCHO of the produced boards (similar to 47%) than the AG-UF adhesive system (27.3%).

Interconnection of Structure with Whiteness and Translucency in Soft Porcelain	GLASS AND CERAMICS												The structures of two types of English soft porcelain (bone china and parian) were investigated. The structural features of these materials that make it possible for the distinct properties of whiteness and translucency - uniformity, high content of the vitreous phase, well-developed interface of particles of the dispersed phase - to be combined in them are identified. It was found that a change in the conditions of firing affects the color characteristics of such porcelains. Parian possesses a more uniform structure than bone china, since the spread in the data on the average intergrain distance is significantly smaller with the same confidence probability 0.95 than in bone china.																			0361-7610	1573-8515				SEP	2019	76	5-6					178	182		10.1007/s10717-019-00160-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10717-019-00160-z		OCT 2019											WOS:000492556500001

The effects of annealing the nanodots in the reducing/oxidizing atmosphere on the nanodot luminescence are investigated. Analysis of the effects together with low-temperature luminescent spectroscopy of the nanodots indicates a significant contribution of oxygen atoms to the formation of luminescence centers in the carbon nanodots studied. The temperature dependence of the degree of the photoinduced linear polarization of the emission of colloidal solutions of carbon nanodots was investigated. Increasing temperature is found to result in the depolarization of nanodot emission. The thermal effect on the polarization degree is well described by the Levshin-Perrin equation, which proves the rotational mechanism of the nanodot emission depolarization. By comparing the experimental data and the theory, the size of the rotating elementary emitters was estimated. The size obtained (similar to 0.9 nm) is appreciably less than the diameter of carbon nanodots under study (similar to 3 nm), which indicates that the atomic groups responsible for the luminescence of carbon nanodots are nonrigidly connected with their cores and can rotate almost independently of them.

Synthesis of Architectural-Cubic Porous Silicon by Electroless Stain Etching in V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and HF Solution	SILICON												Porous silicon (PSi) samples were prepared via electroless stain etching of silicon substrates in HF using V2O5 as an oxidant and ethanol as a surfactant for different etching times. The effects of etching time, the use of ethanol in the etchant as a surfactant, and routine change of the etching solution during the chemical stain etching were studied. The morphologies of the etched silicon surfaces were characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). For short etching duration of 1 to 2 h, few numbers of very large sized pores and inhomogeneous micro pores appeared on the etched silicon. By increasing the etching time to 3 h, relatively larger numbers of homogenous nanopores were formed. The addition of ethanol (surfactant) to the etching solution of V2O5 and HF led to the development of deep pores. Furthermore, routine change of the solution significantly increased the pore volume and pore depth of the sample, with large cubic pores appearing on the surface. Thus, the pore morphology of PSi is significantly influenced by the use of ethanol as a surfactant and the routine change of the etching solution.

Doping sites observation of deep-level impurities in hyperdoped silicon via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												The direct observation of the doping sites of deep-level impurities in hyperdoped silicon is essential to determine the impurity diffusion, distribution, and precipitation via different hyperdoping processes or thermal annealing conditions. This is crucial to clarify the functioning of a mechanism, which can improve the impurity electroactivity. However, this observation, which is usually performed by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), is limited by some restrictions in the microscopic imaging conditions, such as the microscope resolution, the defocus of the objective lens, the specimen thickness, and the projected orientation of the specimen (i.e. the zone axis). Therefore, to eliminate these restrictions, conventional field-emission-gun HRTEM images in combination with image processing (deconvolution) were investigated in order to obtain structure images with atomic resolution. Both the substitutional and the interstitial doping sites of oxygen, chalcogen (sulfur and selenium), and transition metal (titanium and cobalt) impurities in silicon were determined by image contrast analysis. Finally, the favorable conditions for the direct observation of doping sites were defined. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By comparing the phenomena of liquid phase separation during deep undercooling and rapid solidification of Cu-40 wt.% Pb monotectic alloy, the melt of the alloy increases with the undercooling, and the solidification structure appears uneven or even stratified. With the addition of the third element Ni, the liquid phase separation can be effectively inhibited by the change of interfacial energy.

The fabrication method using the existing very-large-scale integration manufacturing process requires a single mask level, and a single metal level without any via enables direct integration with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensing circuitry. An analytical model of magnetic field distribution in a non-spiral microcoil is developed for the first time in this work, which satisfies the form of a Bessel function of the first kind. An electrical model of the non-spiral planar microcoil is also developed and compared with experimental results. Experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical model. Based on the experimental results, using optimised coil geometry, a wireless power transfer link suitable for biomedical wireless power transfer applications is studied. The maximum possible value of coupling factor of the wireless link is found to be 60% for a small separation between the coil and the magnet whereas the minimum value of coupling factor is found to be below 10% for large separations. It is found that introducing Neodymium magnetic shield layer at the receiving coil enhances the coupling factor significantly.

In the GDB, the p-dopant density increases linearly both from top to bottom and right to left. The concentrated negative space charges in the lower-left corner of GDB attract the electric field lines from the channel and barrier towards the gate under OFF-state, which flats the electric field and enhances the breakdown voltage (V-br). Additionally, the low p-dopant density near the top of GDB achieves the device with low ON-state resistance (R-ON). The SBE flats the electric field along the channel above it and introduces a peak electric field near its edge. Simulation results show a V-br of 2150 V and R-ON of 7.05 Omega mm for the proposed device, compared with 1701 V and 7.73 Omega mm for the conventional back electrode RESURF HEMT (BE-RESURF HEMT) with the same gate -drain spacing. Moreover, due to the reduced depletion of 2DEG from the GDB, the proposed device shows slight increases in f(T) and f(max) (8.76 and 14.80 GHz), comparing with the conventional BE-RESURF HEMT (8.24 and 13.84 GHz).					zhang, xiaowei/GQH-5387-2022															1750-0443				OCT 23	2019	14	12					1282	1286		10.1049/mnl.2018.5421	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/mnl.2018.5421													WOS:000503179400015

The two-section DBR lasers, consisting of a gain section and an unpumped Bragg reflector, display an output power above 0.6 W in continuous wave (CW) mode at room temperature. The anomalous spectral data is defined as a longitudinal mode which moves toward shorter wavelengths with increasing temperature or injection current, which is unexpected. Although the longer wavelength modes are expected to start lasing when raising device temperature or injection current, occasional mode hops to a shorter wavelength are seen. These anomalous mode transitions are explained by means of modal analysis. The thermal-induced change of the refractive index implied by an increase in the temperature or injection current yields nearly periodic transitions between cavity modes.

We prepared redox cleavable PLL-g-PEG to switch adhesion on demand. Redox sensitivity was obtained by introducing disulfide linkers between the PLL backbone and PEG strands. This modification was done alone or in combination with an azide end on the PEG strands that enabled in situ conjugations of adhesion peptides or fluorescent labels (by a simple application of commercially available molecules for copper-free click chemistry compatible with cell survival). To balance the functional (adhesion-promoting) vs cell-repellent copolymers, mixed layers of adjusted compositions were obtained by coadsorption from mixed solutions of the cleavable copolymer with noncleavable and repellant PLL-g-PEG. The deposition of copolymers and quantitative cleavage as triggered by reductive conditions (application of solutions of tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine, dithiothreitol, or glutathione) were characterized by QCM-D, XPS, and fluorescence microscopy. In cell culture conditions, redox-triggered cleavage was obtained by a nontoxic application of TCEP for a few minutes, enabling either to release cell attachment points (i.e., cleavage of RGD-presenting areas) or to "open" nonspecific adherent areas (i.e., transition from PEG-presenting areas to adherent PLL-like coatings).

Controlling the structure and mixing properties of anisotropic active particles with the direction of self-propulsion	SOFT MATTER												In the search for advanced materials active particles could offer unique structural and functional properties, with tunable time-dependent characteristics. We demonstrate here that the direction of self-propulsion, relative to the particle orientation, may be as influential for the phase behavior as the pair interactions are for passive particles, and enable dynamic properties that are not available to passive systems. We perform simulations on ensembles of self-propelled squares, and find that squares that self-propel in the direction perpendicular to a side rapidly reach a steady state with a characteristic cluster distribution, positional order, and well-defined diffusion constant. After tuning the direction towards a corner, the particles form large and dense clusters that show a transient collective motion, and display remarkable fluctuations over long time scales, with a distinct periodicity. Clusters of these particles appear unstable beyond a critical size, and susceptible to a catastrophic disintegration. Directionality is found to effect equally sharp transitions in the mixing properties of active squares and passive squares, and the behavior of the passive ensemble. We relate directionality to the collision dynamics and the resulting reaction network of clusters, evolved by a Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, to correlate propulsion direction to the observed phase behavior. Understanding this behavior could offer new design rules for programmable materials, and grant further insights in the dynamic processes that nature employs for self-assembly.					martin, robert/A-7127-2010														1744-683X	1744-6848				OCT 21	2019	15	39					7757	7764		10.1039/c9sm01120j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9sm01120j								31482905					WOS:000496486700002

We first found that 6-enolate, 8-keto-dG offers particular fluorescence emission under the conditions between pH similar to 7 and similar to 11. Thus, a mitochondria-targeting photosensitizer NV-12P was prepared to offer simultaneously photoinduced electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) with 6-enolate, 8-keto-dG. Furthermore, NV-12P can also generate a reactive oxygen species to degrade 6-enolate, 8-keto-dG under irradiation conditions.

The phase composition, microstructure and microwave dielectric properties of (1 - x) Li2Zn3Ti4O12-x CaTiO3 (x = 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 wt%) ceramics were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDS and network analyzer. The XRD and EDS results indicated that the ceramics involved Li2Zn3Ti4O12 and CaTiO3 phases. The SEM micrographs shown that as the CaTiO3 contents increased, the average grain size of the composition ceramics decreased. The microwave dielectric properties of the composition ceramics can be effectively controlled by varying the CaTiO3 contents. The values of dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and tau(f) of the composition ceramics were increased, and the quality factor (Q x f) was decreased with increasing the CaTiO3 contents. Typically, a new temperature stable microwave dielectric material of 0.94 Li2Zn3Ti4O12-0.06 CaTiO3 with excellent microwave dielectric properties of epsilon(r) = 21.7, Q x f = 61,490 GHz, and tau(f) = + 2.68 ppm/degrees C was attained when sintered at 1175 degrees C for 4 h.																			0957-4522	1573-482X				NOV	2019	30	22					20160	20165		10.1007/s10854-019-02391-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10854-019-02391-w		OCT 2019											WOS:000491605200006

Determination of Crack-Tip Opening Displacement in T-Type Wedge Opening Loaded Specimen	EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS												The protective layer at the crack tip of an alloy component can be damaged, and the resistance to crack propagation can be reduced by the combined effects of stress and a corrosive environment. Therefore, the measurement of crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) can be applied to characterize the crack propagation rate (da/dt) during stress corrosion cracking (SCC) experiments. In the present work, CTOD of a T-type wedge opening loaded (T-WOL) specimen with a built-in loading bolt was initially determined using three-dimensional elastic-plastic finite element analysis (FEA). The influence of stress concentration from side groove on CTOD was clearly evaluated, i.e., the fluctuation of CTOD occurred near the groove-tip plane. However, CTOD became stable on >90% of thickness of T-WOL specimen. Therefore, CTOD at mid-thickness plane of T-WOL specimen could be applied for SCC experiment.

The structure and chemical composition of the ferrites were analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The presence of peaks in the XRD patterns was confirmed by the formation of a cubic spinel structure, because the main peaks of the patterns were related to the single-phase cubic spinel structure with PDF-number of 008-0234. The XRD patterns showed a slight shifting in peaks position due to unstable spacing values with increasing Mg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ contents in all ferrites. The mean crystallite size and lattice constant were determined from the Scherer's formula and XRD data. They were found to have been increased by the increase of x concentration. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images were used to analyze the ferrites' structures. In addition, room temperature magnetization and coercivity of ferrites were determined from the hysteresis loops in a magnetic field of 9 kOe by alternative gradient force magnetometer. It was found that the magnetization and coercivity of ferrites with increasing x contents were increased, which is discussed according to the site's occupation of the substituted cations on the sub-lattices. Among all synthesized ferrites, Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.8 showed the highest magnetization and coercively, whereas Ni-0.5(Zn1-xMgx/2Cux/2)(0.5)Fe2O4 with x = 0.0 displayed the lowest corresponding values. The initial permeability of ferrites as a function of frequency were measured over a frequency range of 10 kHz to 10 MHz. In all curves, the initial permeability remained almost constant during increasing frequency until similar to 1 MH,z and then it fell rapidly. This constant trend of the initial permeability shows the high operating frequency of the ferrites.																			0361-5235	1543-186X				FEB	2020	49	2					1104	1109		10.1007/s11664-019-07725-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11664-019-07725-2		OCT 2019											WOS:000491399000002

From the analysis results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Hall-effect measurement, the amorphous GeSn film starts to crystallize at 450 degrees C while the crystallinity enhances at 500 degrees C by employing rapid thermal annealing (RTA) as the film crystallization process. With capping layer on the whole region, the hole concentration becomes too high to turn the JL P-TFTs off. However, by limiting capping layer on source/drain region to increase hole concentration, total series resistance is reduced due to lower sheet resistance and contact resistance, which consequently improves the drive current, I-ON/I-OFF ratio and field-effect mobility. Based on the best process conditions and structure to form the poly-GeSn JL P-TFTs, I-ON/I-OFF ratio up to 5.6 x 10(2) are achieved while peak field-effect mobility of 20.8 cm(2)/Vs is obtained. Moreover, the low thermal budget process of 500 degrees C for 30 sec enables next-generation monolithic 3D-ICs. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Cotter, J; Guldiken, R				Cotter, John; Guldiken, Rasim			Vertical manipulation of fluids through electrostatic formation: model development and experimental validation	MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS												A novel actuation method, called electrostatic formation (ESF), for MEMS and other applications, is introduced. The ESF mechanism uses a droplet of liquid material that is electrostatically deformed. ESF differs from Electrowetting and Electrowetting on Dielectric as the electrode used to apply the voltage is of a smaller diameter than the droplet being manipulated, and the electrode is located above the manipulated fluid. Modeling this movement requires adherence to the Lippmann and Young-Laplace equations simultaneously. In order to understand how the surface tension is specifically manipulated, as is required for the development of a model of representation of the phenomenon, a force-based interpretation of the Lippmann equation is outlined, with focus on how it compares to the force response provided by hydrostatic pressure under the influence of gravitational field forces. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a differential surface charge must be present of which the formulation is complex in nature, likely stemming from the combination of the internal pressure and a localized skin effect caused by an electric double layer that is present at the surface of the transformed liquid. In this study, a target liquid of gallium is manipulated under electrostatic charge in a physical experiment and compared against the geometry suggested by the developed model. By utilizing the assumptions highlighted in this article, a coefficient of variance (R-2) of 0.907 was calculated between the measurements and model. This coefficient of variance was improved to 0.915 through the introduction of varied electrostatic and internal pressure terms.

Geometrical matching and its influence on the melting transition of confined vortices in a mesoscopic triangle of Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+<i>y</i></sub> superconductor	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												To study the melting transition of a vortex crystal (or cluster) consisting of a small number of vortices confined in a mesoscopic-scale superconductor, c-axis magnetoresistance in the highly anisotropic high-T-c superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+y (Bi2212) has been measured using a triangle-shaped stack of intrinsic Josephson junctions, which was trimmed out from a single-crystal flake of Bi2212 via a double-sided etching process using a focused ion beam. We observed oscillations of the melting transition line, in which the oscillating part of the melting temperature has sharp peaks when the number of vortices N exactly coincides with the triangular number n(n + 1)/2 (n is an integer number), at least for N < 50. This is in contrast to the case of square shapes where the enhancements appeared as broad peaks around N = n(2). Furthermore, the field ranges of the N-vortex state expand at the triangular numbers of N, suggesting that the triangular number of vortices has a more stable configuration than the others. Numerical studies on the configuration of vortices in a triangle shape show that geometrical matching with no defect structures is realized at the triangular numbers, whereas an edge dislocation often appears in the other nonmatching cases. The degree of suppression of the melting temperatures at nonmatching numbers is reasonably consistent with the value estimated from the increase in free energy with the introduction of an edge dislocation.

J	Picandet, V; Challamel, N				Picandet, Vincent; Challamel, Noel			Nonlocality of one-dimensional bilinear hardening-softening elastoplastic axial lattices	MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS												The static behaviour of an elastoplastic axial lattice is studied in this paper through both discrete and nonlocal continuum analyses. The elastoplastic lattice system is composed of piecewise linear hardening-softening elastoplastic springs connected between each other via nodes, loaded by concentrated tension forces. This inelastic lattice evolution problem is ruled by some difference equations, which are shown to be equivalent to the finite difference formulation of a continuous elastoplastic bar problem under distributed tension load. Exact solutions of this inelastic discrete problem are obtained from the resolution of this piecewise linear difference equations system. Localization of plastic strain in the first elastoplastic spring, connected to the fixed end, is observed in the softening range. A continuous nonlocal elastoplastic theory is then built from the lattice difference equations using a continualization process, based on a rational asymptotic expansion of the associated pseudo-differential operators. The continualized lattice-based model is equivalent to a distributed nonlocal continuous elastoplastic theory coupled to a cohesive elastoplastic model, which is shown to capture efficiently the scale effects of the reference axial lattice. The hardening-softening localization process of the nonlocal elastoplastic continuous model strongly depends on the lattice spacing, which controls the size of the nonlocal length scales. An analogy with the one-dimensional lattice system in bending is also shown. The considered microstructured elastoplastic beam is a Hencky bar-chain connected by elastoplastic rotational springs. It is shown that the length scale calibration of the nonlocal model strongly depends on the degree of the difference equations of each lattice model (namely axial or bending lattice). These preliminary results valid for one-dimensional systems allow possible future developments of new nonlocal elastoplastic models, including two- or even three-dimensional elastoplastic interactions.

This study investigates the interaction between graphene and aluminum oxide layer (Al2O3) and the influence of Al2O3 on the properties of graphene. The electrical characterization demonstrates the tunability in the resistivity of Al2O3/Gr devices by applying V-g. Al2O3 deposition introduced n-doping in graphene and is affirmed by shifting of charge neutrality point towards negative V-g. The selective coverage of channel, results in the formation of p-n junction within graphene FET which becomes more pronounced upon DUV treatment. Moreover, the study validates the modulation in interface properties of pristine GFET and Al2O3/Gr at different V-g and temperatures. An enhancement in the intervalley and phase coherence scattering rates is observed for Al2O3/Gr device. Therefore, the effect of dielectric layer on graphene based field effect transistors would be of great interest to tune the properties the device.

However, aluminate glasses require high melting temperatures and exhibit poor glass forming ability, causing difficulties while preparation by the melt-quench method. Therefore, it is necessary to establish novel methods to improve melting conditions and glass forming tendencies for aluminate glasses. 40La(2)O(3)-10Nb(2)O(5)-(50-x)Al2O3-xBaO (x = 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10) glasses were prepared by the aerodynamic levitation method. XRD, DTA, and Raman and NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to investigate the effects of BaO on the structure and thermal properties-including crystallization behavior-of lanthanum aluminate glass. The results show that the addition of BaO increases the glass transition temperature (T-g) and stability Delta T of the baseline glass, as Al-Ba-7.5 (40Al(2)O(3)-10Nb(2)O(5)-42.5Al(2)O(3)-7.5BaO) glass has the highest AT value (151 degrees C). The 27 Al MAS NMR spectrum of a high BaO-content glass (Al-Ba-10) shows that about 80% of Al-[IV] and 15% of Al-[V] are present in the glass network. Raman scattering spectra indicate that a peak shown around 790 cm(-1) canbe assigned to the internal stretching vibrations of the Al-non-bridging oxygen (NBO) bonds in depolymerized [AlO4/2] tetrahedrons. The crystallization activation energies were calculated to be 1157.1 kJ/mol and 891.7 kJ/mol (Kissinger method) for Al-Ba-x (x = 0, 7.5) glasses, respectively, which progresses as a diffusion-controlled three-dimensional growth process.

The lead free piezoceramics are gaining importance as there is an urgent demand for replacing the highly toxic PZT family piezoceramics. Ba0.9Ca0.1Zr0.07Ti0.93O3 (BCZT) is one such system. It shows some high electrical properties but suffers with a low Curie temperature, which restricts its usage in low temperature range only. In the present study, the Curie temperature has been improved by 9 degrees C. A polymorphic phase transition (PPT) has also been observed around x = 0.015, consisting of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases, which provides the polarization vector more number of favorable directions. As a result the remnant polarization (P-r), piezoelectric charge coefficient (d(33)) and electromechanical coupling coefficient (k(p)) attain their maximum values of 5.21 mu C/cm(2), 200 pC/N and 24.78% respectively for x = 0.015. This increase in transition temperature and other electrical properties makes BCZT a potential candidate for a lead free piezoelectric system.

Transient analysis of full-space unbounded domains by reciprocal absorbing boundaries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS												In this paper, we explore a combination of the reciprocal absorbing boundary condition with perfectly matched discrete layers for the time-domain analysis of wave motion in the full plane. Coupling of these absorbing boundaries leads to solutions for out-of-plane as well as in-plane excitations of the full plane. Together with numerical transient simulations, harmonic analysis is also carried out for the purpose of verifying the results by comparing with available exact frequency-domain solutions. The proposed combination is investigated through several numerical examples, which demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency.

J	Sadoh, T; Sakai, T; Matsumura, R				Sadoh, Taizoh; Sakai, Takatsugu; Matsumura, Ryo			Low-Temperature (∼250°C) Gold-Induced Lateral Growth of Sn-Doped Ge on Insulator Enhanced by Layer-Exchange Reaction	ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					PRiME Joint Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society, the Electrochemical-Society-of-Japan, and the Korean-Electrochemical-Society	OCT 02-07, 2016	Honolulu, HI	Electrochem Soc, Electrochem Soc Japan, Korean Electrochem Soc				Low-temperature (<= 250 degrees C) formation of Sn-doped Ge (GeSn) (substitutional Sn concentration: 2-3%) on insulator is desired to realize flexible electronics, where high-speed thin-film transistors are integrated on flexible plastic-substrates (softening temperature: similar to 300 degrees C). To achieve this, gold-induced lateral crystallization of amorphous GeSn (a-GeSn) is investigated. Here, a-GeSn (Sn concentration: 0%-20%) on insulator structures, having Au-island patterns, were annealed. For initial Sn concentrations of 0%-5%, high-speed lateral crystallization proceeds around Au-patterns, and large grown regions (similar to 5-20 mu m) are obtained by low-temperature short-time annealing (150 degrees C-250 degrees C, 10 min). However, bottom regions of GeSn are not crystallized at 150 degrees C-200 degrees C, while the whole films including bottom regions are crystallized at 250 degrees C. These phenomena are caused by the following temperature-dependent growth mechanisms. At 150 degrees C-200 degrees C, Au atoms are supplied into surface-regions of a-GeSn films from Au-islands by surface-diffusion, resulting in crystallization of only surface-regions. On the other hand, at 250 degrees C, layer-exchange of Au/GeSn occurs, which increases supply channel of Au for diffusion. This results in complete crystallization of GeSn to the bottom. Substitutional Sn concentrations in grown layers are increased with increasing annealing temperature. As a result, GeSn films (substitutional Sn concentration: similar to 3%) are obtained at similar to 250 degrees C. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

The method takes advantage of weak adherence between the liquid metal and its ultrathin surface oxide layer. During the van der Waals exfoliation process of transferring the ultrathin oxide layer to a desired substrate, nanoscale liquid metal droplets could form due to dynamic wetting failure. Here we have prepared EGaIn nanodroplets on the surface of transferred Ga2O3 ultrathin films. Surface morphology measured by atomic force microscope shows the vast majority of nanodroplets are isolated and randomly distributed, with mean radius below 100 nm. This preparation method is facile, low cost and can be applied in fields such as Ga-catalyzed nanostructures growth and gallium plasmonics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, the researched X2Te3 (X = Sb, Bi) single layer materials and their thermodynamical stabilities are proved through our calculations. The indirect band gaps pulse with the high carrier mobilities are also discussed based on first-principle calculations. On basis of the calculation, the low cleavage energies are about 0.34 Jm(-2) that is comparable with that of graphite, which imply a high possibility to obtain the single layer from exfoliating bulk counterpart. Band gaps are simulated as between 0.65 and 1.31 eV using different functionals, moreover, the band structures with and without SOC effect are all considered. The SOC effect results certify that X2Te3 monolayers are different from their bulk counterparts, they are not topological insulators. The largest electron mobility selected in their impressive carrier mobilites is 27.91 x 10(3) cm(2)V(-1)S(-1) that bears comparison to that of silicene. Moreover, the mechanical properties include Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio are studied too. Meanwhile, the biaxial strain can effectively modify the band gaps. Finally, outstanding visible and near-infrared light absorption abilities mainly from similar to 400 to around 1400 nm may guide single layer X2Te3 to a promises applications in photovoltaics.					zheng, kai/LDF-6248-2024; chen, xianping/K-2955-2016	chen, xianping/0000-0002-6332-0955													0169-4332	1873-5584				OCT 15	2019	491						690	697		10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.06.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.06.023													WOS:000479082900078

Generally, the head check is generated at the gauge corner of the rail surface of the high rail in the curved section. The initiation factors of the head check are thought to be a plastic deformation of the rail surface caused by the severe contact between the wheel and the rail. Hence, the occurrence situation and the initiation factor of the head check is widely known. On the other hand, occurrence of some head check was confirmed on the low rail in the curved section. However, the occurrence situation of the head check on the low rail is not clarified. Furthermore, the initiation factors of this typed head check is not also clarified. In this research, we conducted the on-site investigation and the analysis of the rail which had the head check on its surface, in order to clarify the occurrence situation of the head check on the low rail. In addition, we conducted the wheel and the rail contact analysis by use of multi-body dynamics and the measurement of the wheel and the rail contact forces on the service line to investigate the initiation factors of the head check. The results showed that the head check of the low rail is generated in the curved section with a radius of about 400-800m on the line where the tilting trains are operated. Furthermore, it is thought that the initiation factor of the head check seems to be the longitudinal creep force caused by the large differences between the diameter of the wheel on the high rail and that on the low rail in case of the tilting train running in the curved section.																			0043-1648	1873-2577				OCT 15	2019	436								202989	10.1016/j.wear.2019.202989	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2019.202989													WOS:000487196200006

Up to now, however, there is still lack of a widely applicable strategy to achieve this goal. Herein, we demonstrate a universal method to accomplish electrode surface engineering via graphene oxide (GO) by spraying technology. In our study, a reduced graphene (rGO) layer can be fabricated on the surface of Li metal through the redox reaction of Li metal and GO. Notably, the protective layer on Li-metal anode can be capable of inhibiting the growth of Li dendrite and the symmetrical Li-rGO-Li cell can maintain 500 cycles without short circuits. What is pleasantly surprised, the GO layer can be uniformly coated on the surface of cathode (eg. LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 or NCM). Thanks to the simultaneous improvement of the anode and cathode, the NCM-GO-Li battery exhibits superb long-term cycles and excellent rate capability at high temperature of 60 degrees C.					bai, maohui/L-9522-2019														0272-8842	1873-3956				OCT 15	2019	45	15					19567	19571		10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.06.170													WOS:000483454200177

However, it would result in energy loss. Especially, as the diameter of the silicon rod increases, the free space between the jacket and the silicon rod will vary, and the jacket's effect would be complicated. This work presents a numerical study of the polysilicon chemical vapor deposition (CVD), fines formation, and thermal loss during silane pyrolysis in a Komatsu reactor. The CFD software FLUENT with detailed chemical reaction model of silane decomposition was applied to predict the silicon deposition rates, fines formation and thermal loss produced by a water-cooled jacket. The effects of water-cooled jacket temperature, rod wall temperature, and the distance between water-cooled jacket and rod surface on the polysilicon deposition rate and the fines formation have been investigated. The model was verified by comparing the model predictions with the experimental measurements in the literature. The results show that the jacket wall temperature and rod diameter have a complex influence on the fines formation, CVD growth rate, and thermal loss. The jacket wall temperature should be adjusted as the rod diameter enlarges. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Fujita, T; Doi, T; Arai, Y				Fujita, Takashi; Doi, Toshiro; Arai, Yutaro			Development of Flexible Fiber Conditioner in Chemical Mechanical Planarization	ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A flexible fiber pad conditioner, which conforms well to the pad surface, has been developed. Conventional disc-type conditioners have a potential concern of uniform conditioning across the entire pad surface in terms of intermittent contact by face-to-face contact. In the flexible fiber conditioner, each fiber tip functions independently with constant contact force on the pad, by utilizing the bending effect of the flexible fiber. Therefore, the conditioner performs uniform and fine conditioning, following the height variation in the pad surface. Uniform conditioning was verified by a unique method using surface coloration on a pad with height variation. In addition, it was shown that, using the developed conditioner, the chips generated by pad conditioning were very small, and the pad surface was finely scraped and roughened. It was further demonstrated that the developed flexible fiber conditioner shortened the pad break-in process. Moreover, compared with the conventional disk-type conditioner, the developed flexible fiber conditioner resulted in a uniform polishing profile even in the midst of the break-in process. The results indicate that it is important for the break-in of the polishing pad, to uniformly scrape and roughen the entire area of the pad while following the pad surface, rather than planarizing the surface.

The results suggest that the core width of screw dislocation and edge dislocation of Burgers vector < 100 > is wider than that of < 110 >. Meanwhile, their unstable-stacking-fault energy (gamma(us)) of gamma(us) < 110 > > gamma(us) < 001 > indicates that the unstable-stacking-fault energy performs very important function on the core width of screw dislocation. The easiest slip system of B2-AlPr is < 111 > {110}. The lattice misfit energy is always less than elastic strain energy except the dislocation angle with 54.7 degrees. The phase position of misfit energy and elastic strain energy is always showing opposite phases. However, the misfit energy is greater than elastic strain energy for 54.7 degrees dislocation, and shows the same phase. The misfit energy, elastic strain energy, total energy and the corresponding stress decrease with the increasing of dislocation angle.

We study the propagation of a CW green laser beam through the waveguide structure as a function of beam polarization, laser intensity and sample temperature. It turns out that the plasmonic field created at the interface between AuNPs and POLICRYPS waveguides enables and stabilizes the optical field propagation within the responsive nematic liquid crystal channels. The active role of the liquid crystal is pointed out by a polarization, temperature and beam divergence experimental analysis and evidenced by a peculiar trumpet-shaped discrete diffraction pattern.

Conventionally, external driving is used to create concentration polarization of ions and biomolecules in nanofluidic devices. Here we show that long-range ionic strength gradients intrinsic to all nanofluidic devices, even at equilibrium, also drive a drift of macromolecules. To demonstrate the effect, we confine long DNA to straight nanochannels of constant, rectangular cross-section (100 x 100 nm(2)) which are connected to large microfluidic reservoirs. The motion of DNA is observed in absence of any driving. We find that at low ionic strengths, molecules in nanochannels migrate toward the nano-micro interface, while they are undergoing purely diffusive motion in high salt. Using numerical models, we demonstrate that the motion is consistent with the ionic strength gradient at the micro-nano interface even at equilibrium, and that the dominant cause of the drift is diffusophoresis.

Emergent chirality in multilead Luttinger-liquid junctions out of equilibrium	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We study charge transport through N-lead junctions (N >= 3) of spinless Luttinger-liquid wires with bias voltages applied to Fermi-liquid reservoirs. In particular, we consider a Y junction, which is a setup characteristic of the tunneling experiment. In this setup, the strength of electron-electron interactions in one of the arms ("tunneling tip") is different from that in the other two arms (which form together the "main wire"). For a generic single-particle S matrix of the junction, we find that the bias voltage V applied, even symmetrically, to the main wire generates a current proportional to vertical bar V vertical bar in the tip wire. We identify two mechanisms of this nonequilibrium-induced "emergent chirality" in a setup characterized by the time-reversal- and parity-symmetric Hamiltonian of the junction. These are (i) the emergence of an effective magnetic flux, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and (ii) the emergence of parity-breaking asymmetry of the setup, both proportional to the interaction strength and the sign of the voltage. The current in the tip wire generated by mechanism (i) is reminiscent of the Hall current in the linear response of a system the Hamiltonian of which breaks time-reversal symmetry; however, in the absence of any magnetic field or a local magnetic moment. Similarly, mechanism (ii) can be thought of as an emergent "photogalvanic effect," however, in the presence of inversion symmetry within the main wire. The nonequilibrium chirality implies a rectification of the current in the tip when the main wire is biased by ac voltage.

In the solid-state approach with the use of the Haldane- Anderson density of state model for the 4?H- and 6?H-SiC polytypes, it is shown that the binding energies for N and N-2 are 6 and 3?eV correspondingly. In the quantum-chemical approach with the use of the surface molecule model for N the binding energy values are 6?eV for adsorption on C-face and 4?eV for adsorption on Si-face. It is demonstrated also that the charge transfer between adsorbate and substrate for all the cases considered are negligible.

Its fabrication by means of sand and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate salt is presented, and the results of some characterization tests are discussed. Three families of samples were produced using different types of sands. The samples were tested to identify their mechanical properties and to understand how these properties are affected by the microstructure, the mixing proportions and the temperature of salt when mixing. Furthermore, information on the effects of exposure to humidity was sought. For these purposes, the following experimental campaigns were run and are presented here: (i) sieve tests and X-ray tomography analyzes, (ii) compression tests, and (iii) flexural tests. The results indicated an average strength of 25 MPa in compression and 8 MPa in flexion, with values depending on the above mentioned conditions. Although more research is needed to know the new material in detail, Hyposand seems to develop satisfactory strengths, promising technical accessibility, and minimal consumption of resources.

J	Shin, WJ; Huang, WH; Tao, M				Shin, Woo Jung; Huang, Wen-Hsi; Tao, Meng			Spray-Deposited Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> for Rear Passivation and Optical Trapping in Silicon Solar Cells	ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Low-cost spray deposition is employed to investigate the suitability of spray-deposited Al2O3 for rear passivation and optical trapping in passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) Si solar cells. Structural, optical, and electrical properties of spray-deposited Al2O3 films are investigated. Capacitance-voltage measurements indicate that spray-deposited Al2O3 has a negative charge density of 3.19 x 10(12) cm(-2) for an 80-nm film, suggesting that it can serve as the passivation layer. Optical properties of spray-deposited Al2O3 are identical to the Al2O3/SiNx stack prepared by atomic layer deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, indicating that it can also serve as the optical trapping layer. Atomic force microscopy studies show that spray-deposited Al2O3 is crack and pore free, and its surface roughness has a root-mean-square value of 0.52 nm for an 80-nm film. Spray-deposited Al2O3 is amorphous as determined by X-ray diffraction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that spray-deposited Al2O3 is slightly Al-rich. The resistivity and breakdown field of an 80-nm Al2O3 film are 5.46 x 10(14) Omega-cm and 3.28 MV/cm, respectively, which are stable after 800 degrees C firing. These properties suggest that spray-deposited Al2O3 is a promising candidate to replace the Al2O3/SiNx stack in Si PERC cells. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

To describe the curved incoming and outgoing trajectories, we introduce a general recipe based on an abstraction of the actual impurity scattering process to define the scattering parameters such as the incoming and outgoing momentum and coordinate jump. In this picture, we can conveniently describe the skew scattering and coordinate jump, which will eventually modify the Boltzmann equation. We find an anomalous Hall resistivity different from the conventional Boltzmann-Drude result and a negative magnetoresistivity as a parabolic function of magnetic field. The origin of these results is analyzed. The relevance between our theory and recent simulation and experimental works is also discussed.

Acellular scaffolds would be involved in the extracellular matrix dynamics of the host tissue after in vivo implantation. The remodeling process of acellular scaffold is also the reestablishment of extracellular matrix dynamics in acellular scaffold. In order to study the role of extracellular matrix dynamics on the remodeling process of acellular scaffold, acellular bovine pericardium (S1) and acellular bovine dermis (S2) were prepared. The in vitro characteristics and in vivo performance for dura defect repairing were tested. The results indicated that extracellular matrix dynamics played an important role after surgical implantation of the acellular scaffold. The extracellular matrix dynamics of the acellular scaffold restarted along with the infiltration of the host cells. The thoroughly degradation of S2 showed that an equilibrium extracellular matrix dynamics in the acellular scaffold should be established and successful integration between acellular scaffold and auto-dura could not guarantee tissue regeneration. In addition, there was a close relationship between the in vitro characteristics and the in vivo performance of the acellular scaffold. The in vitro characteristics had big influence on the restoration of extracellular matrix dynamics. Acellular scaffold could actively take part in the extracellular matrix dynamics and remodeling itself subsequently. Therefore, acellular scaffold showed great advantages to other scaffold materials for tissue regeneration.

Polariton particles, pumped both by the nonresonant field and coherent field, form two distinct sources with different frequency for beating to induce the interference in the temporal domain to generate the temporal pulse train. The oscillating period of the temporal pulse train is determined mainly by the intensity of the nonresonant pump fields but not the frequency. The temporal pulse train carries all the information of interference such as the phase difference and the density relationship between two polariton sources, which could be stored and recalled on demand with high efficiency and fidelity by simply switching off and on the coherent field.					chen, ye/HSF-9650-2023	Wang, Gang/0000-0003-0995-2385; Xue, Yan/0000-0002-2771-1887													2469-9950	2469-9969				OCT 9	2019	100	15							155302	10.1103/PhysRevB.100.155302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.100.155302													WOS:000489247900002

Characterization of applied tensile stress to carbon epoxy composites by measuring the variation of transverse thermal conductivity using transmission thermography	JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS												Using the method of step heating thermography, this study seeks to detect and characterize the existence of stress in a beam sample of carbon epoxy composite with the stacking sequence of [0(8)] aided by empirical and simulation approaches. The applied stress in the longitudinal direction of sample, while considering the Poisson's ratio, changes the lateral dimensions of sample. Furthermore, it is shown that the thermal conductivity along the sample thickness varies as a result of stress existence. Accordingly, to obtain a relation between transverse thermal conductivity and longitudinal tensile stress, one should calculate and eliminate the effect of lateral deformation caused by stress. To this end, by combining the experimental and simulation results of composite sample under the action of different tensile loads, an equation describing the variation of thermal conductivity along the sample thickness with respect to applied stress is developed. Using the relation of transverse thermal conductivity variation in terms of applied stress, the finite element modeling is again carried out by rectifying the values of thermal conductivity. Simulation results are compared with experimental ones, indicating very good agreement between the two approaches.

This work establishes the foundation for the development of an efficient platform for the electrochemical hemofiltration and simultaneous sensing of antitumor drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, from physiological medium. The electrochemical filtration system is based on a gold surface-modified electrode using tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine ligands as scavengers of the Pt-based drug complexes. The platinum-phosphine interaction is shown to be more time efficient, as compared to the naturally occurring form of a glutathione-platinum adduct, and displayed a highly cooperative nature of binding. Altogether, we demonstrate that the presence of ligands capable of binding to Pt results in a differential spectroscopic and electrochemical response and the potential to adsorb and monitor the concentration of Pt salts in complex aqueous media.

Thermal stability of interstitial and substitutional Mn in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												In (Ga,Mn)As, a model dilute magnetic semiconductor, the electric and magnetic properties are strongly influenced by the lattice sites occupied by the Mn atoms. In particular, the highest Curie temperatures are achieved upon thermal annealing in a narrow temperature window around 200 degrees C, by promoting the diffusion of interstitial Mn towards the surface. In this work, we determined the thermal stability of both interstitial and substitutional Mn in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As thin films, using the emission channeling technique. At a higher Mn concentration, the temperatures at which substitutional and interstitial Mn become mobile not only decrease, but also become closer to each other. These findings advance our understanding of self-compensation in (Ga,Mn)As by showing that the strong dependence of the Curie temperature on annealing temperature around 200 degrees C is a consequence of balance between diffusion of interstitial Mn and segregation of substitutional Mn.

Two important properties i.e. grain size and step coverage (S/C) of undoped channel hole poly-Si have attracted great attentions in practical manufacturing. The grain size affects the mobility of conductive poly-Si film and large grain size usually leads to high mobility. The step coverage influences the subthreshold swing (SS) and improved step coverage leads to small SS. In this paper, during the growth of poly-Si, the influence of different deposition conditions, such as temperature and gas source ratio between Si2H6 and SiH4, on the grain size and step coverage is investigated comprehensively. Grain size and step coverage are characterized using by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Precession Electron Diffraction (PED). It is found that as the decrease of deposition temperature, both the grain size and step coverage are improved. Compared to gas source SiH4, the employment of Si2H6 is beneficial in achieving large grain size to some degree and no further improvement can be obtained when the flow of Si2H6 is increased to a certain value. However, as-deposited poly-Si exhibits poorer step coverage using Si2H6 in contrast to SiH4. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

First, the static and dynamic mathematical models of the output displacement and input force of the flexure hinge mechanism are established on the basis of J.M. PAROS's theory of flexure hinge design. Second, the geometric size of the flexure hinge is optimised through the numerical simulation analysis method, and the optimal design parameters are obtained in accordance with the requirement of the positioning stroke of the precision positioning worktable and the output displacement of the giant magnetostrictive actuator. Third, the vibration characteristics of the flexure hinge mechanism are analysed, and natural frequencies are obtained on the basis of an established dynamic equation. Finally, the finite element, numerical analysis and experimental verification methods are adopted to verify the accuracy of the established static and dynamic models. Results show that the calculation errors of the X- and Y-direction models are 3.35% and 3.23%, respectively and the magnitude error of dynamic model is 6.7%. These results indicate that the precision of the static model is high. Modal analysis shows that the inherent frequency of the flexure hinge mechanism is 963.76 Hz and that the error of theoretical calculation is only 3.1%. These results indicate that the established dynamic model has high precision. The flexure hinge mechanism demonstrates ideal performance when the damping ratio is 0.6.																			0946-7076	1432-1858				APR	2020	26	4					1223	1234		10.1007/s00542-019-04652-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00542-019-04652-4		OCT 2019											WOS:000489465900002
J	Rissanen, I; Laurson, L				Rissanen, Ilari; Laurson, Lasse			Bursty magnetic friction between polycrystalline thin films with domain walls	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Two magnets in relative motion interact through their dipolar fields, making individual magnetic moments dynamically adapt to the changes in the energy landscape and bringing about collective magnetization dynamics. Some of the energy of the system is irrevocably lost through various coupling mechanisms between the spin degrees of freedom and those of the underlying lattice, resulting in magnetic friction. In this work, we use micromagnetic simulations to study magnetic friction in a system of two thin ferromagnetic films containing quenched disorder mimicking a polycrystalline structure. We observe bursts of magnetic activity resulting from repeated domain wall pinning due to the disorder and subsequent depinning triggered by the dipolar interaction between the moving films. These domain wall jumps result in strong energy dissipation peaks. We study how the properties of the polycrystalline structure such as grain size and strength of the disorder, along with the driving velocity and the width of the films, affect the magnetization dynamics, average energy dissipation, and the statistical properties of the energy dissipation bursts.

The atmospheric presence of smog raises great concerns to human health. Soot also absorbs visible light from solar radiation, likely contributing to the climate change. This study focused on the optical and thermal effects of soot via a numerical simulation approach and included regular biomass, diesel, acetylene, and propane soot and three carbon surrogates for soot. To make the simulation more similar to real soot aerosols, two major submodels were integrated, which involved their core-shell structures and their fractal agglomerate structures. Four kinds of shell materials, including nonabsorbing (water, sulfuric acid, salt) and weak-absorbing (brown carbon) materials, were studied in their different shell thicknesses. The effects of the shell on the absorption enhancement of the bare soot particles and the dependence of absorption on the light wavelength were revealed. The brown carbon shell was found to exhibit greater absorption enhancement, and its absorption was doubled at 360 nm compared to that at 800 nm. Among the three soot aggregates from the different aging processes, the most stable embedding-type soot aggregate was found to have the maximum absorption of the incident light, resulting in an increase in the surrounding temperature by 0.35 K.

Nevertheless, the materials with low expenditure and outstanding catalytic performances are difficult to obtain. Herein, a simple and efficient strategy, which was assisted with external magnetic field, had been proposed for preparation of graphene-coated nickel nanowires (NiNWs/G) nanocomposite magnetic catalyst. The whole fabrication procedure was facile without harsh preparation conditions like high-pressure, high-temperature, strong acid and expensive templates. The NiNWs/G could be easily and quickly prepared in aqueous solution under mild conditions, and the external magnetic force was adopted to induce the unidirectional self-assembly of metal crystals on graphene oxide to form NiNWs/G with aspect ratio more than 50. The possible formation mechanism suggesting that the nanoparticles would aggregate along with direction of the magnetization axis because the dipole magnetic moments of them are in line under magnetic induction lines. The characterization results confirmed the chemical component and morphology of the nanocomposite. The ferromagnetism is determined by hysteresis loop of NiNWs/G. More importantly, the nanocomposite exhibited superior catalytic performance toward reduction of 4-nitrophenol. Therefore, such nanocomposite will be a promising candidate for water treatment and catalyst industry. [GRAPHICS] .

The state-space method is employed to solve this problem. Both the direct and the inverse piezoelectric effects of the piezoelectric material are investigated. The relaxation times and the transient electroelastic fields of displacements, stresses, and electric potential are calculated for three-layered and five-layered smart cylindrical shells. It is found that interfacial diffusion and sliding can effectively reduce the initial high stress concentrations as the evolution time is long enough. The derived solution can be used as benchmark results for various approximate shell theories and numerical methods.

An Assessment of the Evolving Microstructural Model of Inelasticity Coupled With Dislocation- and Disclination-Based Incompatibilities	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME												The evolving microstructural model of inelasticity (EMMI) previously developed as an improvement over the Bammann-Chiesa-Johnson (BCJ) material model is well known to describe the macroscopic nonlinear behavior of polycrystalline metals subjected to rapid external loads such as those encountered during high-rate events possibly near shock regime. The improved model accounts for deformation mechanisms such as thermally activated dislocation motion, generation, annihilation, and drag. It also accounts for the effects of material texture, recrystallization and grain growth and void nucleation, growth, and coalescence. The material incompatibilities, previously disregard in the aforementioned model, manifest themselves as structural misorientation where ductile failure often initiates are currently being considered. To proceed, the representation of material incompatibility is introduced into the EMMI model by incorporating the distribution of the geometrically necessary defects such as dislocations and disclination. To assess the newly proposed formulation, classical elastic solutions of benchmarks problems including far-field stress applied to the boundary of body containing a defect, e.g., voids, cracks, and dislocations, are used to compute the plastic velocity gradient for various states of the material in terms of assumed values of the internal state variables. The full-field state of the inelastic flow is then computed, and the spatial dependence of the dislocations and disclination density is determined. The predicted results shows good agreement with finding of dislocation theory.																			0094-4289	1528-8889				OCT	2019	141	4							041009	10.1115/1.4043627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4043627													WOS:000499948900009

Interdiffusion Effects on Bandstructure in HgTe-CdTe Superlattices for VLWIR Imaging Applications	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS					U.S. Workshop on the Physics and Chemistry of II-VI Materials	OCT 22-25, 2018	Pasadena, CA					In this paper, a systematic study of interdiffusion in (112)B oriented HgTe/CdTe superlattice (SL) structures has been undertaken in order to investigate the viability of employing SL as the absorber layer for very long wavelength infrared (VLWIR, 15 mu m and longer) applications in imaging focal plane arrays. Using numerical analysis, the optimal superlattice parameters and annealing time at the growth temperature (similar to 180 degrees C) are found, which result in better control of the cut-off wavelength in superlattice absorbers compared to the corresponding HgCdTe alloy absorber. Simulations show that, by appropriate adjustment of annealing time, it is possible to achieve the same cut-off wavelength with a larger HgTe well width while the sensitivity of the SL to well width variations remains at 15 meV/nm. Furthermore, the electron effective mass in a SL absorber is larger than a HgCdTe alloy absorber, which results in lower tunneling dark current. This work focuses on optimization of the superlattice absorber using the stationary Schrodinger equation. A complete photodetector device design based on a SL absorber structure will require a comprehensive numerical modeling using a Schrodinger-Poisson solver and drift-diffusion solver, or a combination of both approaches, which will be undertaken in the future.					; Dehdashti, Nima/H-9074-2014	Faraone, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3087-7079; Gu, Renjie/0000-0001-7258-9377; Dehdashti, Nima/0000-0003-1658-8323; Antoszewski, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-6663-9961													0361-5235	1543-186X				OCT	2019	48	10			SI		6159	6168		10.1007/s11664-019-07353-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11664-019-07353-w													WOS:000485885200019

The results show that the change in the length of the TC21 alloy during the continuous heating process results from the transformation of alpha phase with hexagonal close-packed to fl phase with body-centered cubic and macro volume variation which originates from redistribution of alpha-stabilizers and beta-stabilizers in the alloy during the continuous dissolution of a phase. It is found that the content of Al element decreases in the a phase with the dissolution of a phase, but it increases in the beta phase. Additionally, the increasing content of Al element leads to the decrease in volume of beta phase, which is also the main reason for shrinking of the alloy during alpha+beta ->beta phase transformation. However, Mo, Cr and Nb element diffuse to the alpha phase during alpha+beta ->beta phase transformation, so that the composition imbalance is found at the alpha/beta interface.

The phase transformations were studied by dilatometry and then the microstructures were evaluated. Mechanical properties were measured after various cycles of heat treatment. The results showed that the microstructure of this steel, at the cooling rates studied here, includes a mixture of bainite and martensite. The relatively high amounts of the substitutional elements such as Ni, as well as the low carbon content, resulted in the proximity of the bainite and martensite start temperatures. The B-s and M-s temperatures were determined to be 325 and 315 degrees C, respectively. This led to the formation of coalesced bainite in the microstructure. The maximum hardness of the alloy was obtained at the aging temperature of 450 degrees C. Additionally, the optimal combination of yield strength and impact energy was obtained by a single-stage aging treatment at 575 degrees C for 1 h. The reason for the toughness improvement can be attributed to the formation of the precipitated austenite between the martensitic lathes during the aging process.						eshaghi, akbar/0000-0001-8145-8387													2053-1591					OCT	2019	6	10							106514	10.1088/2053-1591/ab3610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab3610													WOS:000480302300014

The total transmission over a range of wavelengths is related to the width of such range, but also to the type of disorder. Less homogeneous disordered structures transmit more light than the ordered counterpart regardless of the wavelengths range width.

Defects and the Formation of Impurity 'Hot Spots' in HgCdTe/CdZnTe	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS												The formation of impurity 'hot spot' macro-defects-localized high impurity level contaminates-is examined. The evolution of macro-defects through their critical stages: as-received CdZnTe substrate, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) prep etch, Te/oxide desorption and stabilization at deposition temp in MBE chamber, thin (200 nm) HgCdTe deposition, and thick (> 4 mu m) MBE HgCdTe deposition, is analyzed. As-received CdZnTe wafers have small and large agglomerations of residual SiO2 and Al2O3 polishing grit. Additionally, macro-defects composed of organic residue, Cd(Zn)Te particulates, and additional impurities are also observed. The MBE preparation etch does not significantly alter the types of defects found on the wafer. The Te/oxide desorption process adds a small number of defects due to colloidal graphite particles. HgCdTe deposition introduces MBE spit defects and Hg droplet residue. There is significant movement of polishing grit and organic macro-defects during the various processing steps. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of MBE spit defects shows they are Cd rich with some of the spit defects containing high concentrations of impurities. The vertical gradient in Te concentration associated with the overgrowth on a metal rich MBE spit defect acts as an impurity pipe for Cu to travel toward the surface to become a 'hot spot' defect.

Metall-Kunststoff-Verbunde: Modellversuche zur OptimierungMetal Plastic Hybrids: Optimisation in model experiments	MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK												Translation abstract Metal plastic hybrids will become more important as components for lightweight constructions. It is reported about optimisation of making three layer hybrids consisted of a steel plate, an adhesion layer based of uretdione powder coating material and a flexible component polyurethane in model experiments. Hybrid formation is performed in a compression moulding process. The adhesion layer and the polyurethane are modified to increase the hybrid bond strength. Peel test are conducted to quantitatively characterize the bond strength and an apparent energy release rate is calculated based on the peel force. For hybrids with widths of 2 mm polyurethane stripes it is possible to increase the apparent energy release rate for about 30 % to 16 N/mm in comparison with a hybrid with unmodified components. These hybrids have the same high bond strength level as the strongest hybrids reported in literature. Concluding the optimisation results are discussed related to their relevancy for the interpretation of the adhesion mechanisms in the interface between adhesion layer and polyurethane.																			0933-5137	1521-4052				OCT	2019	50	10					1181	1195		10.1002/mawe.201800149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mawe.201800149													WOS:000489001400002

Obtained by a Breeding Program	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Featured Application This work could be used as operational scheme to work on the characterization of a medicinal plant, taking into account its characteristic variability. AbstractJatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceaefamily) is a multipurpose plant with considerable potential in biodiesel production, and in cosmetic and medicinal uses. The part of J. curcas usually used is the oil obtained from its seeds, whereas the leaves generally represent the waste material. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and to preliminary investigate the biological activity of J. curcas leaves obtained from plants by a breeding program. To describe genomic structure, molecular markers were applied. For biological study, two genotypes (JA and JB) that are genetically divergent were selected by cluster analysis. A phytochemical analysis was carried out to characterize the chemical composition of the extracts, which resulted rich in biologically active compounds, whereas toxic phorbol esters were absent. Biological assays showed an antiproliferative effect on the Buffalo normal rat liver cell line (BRL-3A), with genotype B being more potent than that of the counterpart (JA). The purified compounds isolated did not show antiproliferative activity, suggesting that the effect observed was due to the phytocomplex and should involve several secondary metabolites. This study highlights that a plant of the same genus and same species that has been cultivated in the same soil and climatic conditions can be characterized by a high variability. This is what makes research in pharmacognosya complex process.

The XRD, Raman, XPS, HRTEM, SEM and EDS mapping were used to characterize the composites and the results indicate that the Fe, C, O and N elements disperse uniformly in N-doped carbon/ amorphous iron oxide composite. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared composite was studied by the photodegradation of MB under solar light, indicated that the composites with nitrogen doped and amorphous structure significantly improved the photocatalytic activity. The amorphous structure of iron oxide played a key role in the improvement of photocatalytic activity. Based on photodegradaiton and photoluminescence spectra results, they were implied that the enhanced performance should be attributed to higher separation efficiency and a longer life time of photoproduced electron and hole pairs by the existence of amorphous structure. The composite prepared by this work has significant application value in photodegradation field.

In this work, we experimentally study the behavior of AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel when bombarded by Ga+ ions in a FIB system. The results show the formation of nanometer sized spiky structures. Utilizing the nanospiking effect, we fabricated a single-tip needle with a measured 15.15 nanometer curvature radius and a microneedle with a nanometer sized spiky surface. The nanospikes can be made straight or angled, depending on the incident angle between the sample and the beam. We also show that the nanospiking effect is present in ferritic AISI 430 stainless steel. The weak occurrence of the nanospiking effect in between nano-rough regions (nano-cliffs) was also witnessed for austenitic AISI 316 and martensitic AISI 431 stainless steel samples.

In this paper, novel fabrication method to define the active region of NEM devices is proposed by forming the trenched mesa-shape pattern in the IMD and depositing aluminum oxide (Al2O3) protecting layer. By applying the proposed process, the void space for mechanical operation of NEM devices can be formed user-controllably without the damage and collapse of CMOS part located below the NEM part.

In the case of the ZrB2-TiB2 binary system, a plot of log pO2vs. 1/T in the temperature range of 500-2000 K and another plot of pO2 (x1014) vs.xTiB2 for T=2000 K are made taking into account the two-extreme possibilities of no solubility and 100% solid solubility between ZrB2 and TiB2, respectively. A plot of log pCOvs. log pO2 is made for 1773 K for the systems ZrB2-SiC and ZrB2-B4C. It was found that the ZrB2-TiB2 ceramics does not have sufficient oxidation resistance in the temperature range of 500-2000 K. ZrB2 of ZrB2-SiC ceramics can be protected under 1 atmosphere oxygen or in air if the liquid borosilicate (with the chosen composition, 70% B2O3-30% SiO2), which is an intermediate product, provides a kinetic barrier to the continuation of oxidation by forming an impervious layer on the exposed surfaces. In contrast, the ZrB2-B4C ceramics does not produce the borosilicate upon oxidation. In view of the volatility of pure liquid B2O3, it is recommended that the ZrB2-B4C ceramics can be used at a lower temperature, perhaps below 1373 K, when the vapour pressure of B2O3 is significantly small.																			0250-4707	0973-7669				OCT	2019	42	5							245	10.1007/s12034-019-1934-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12034-019-1934-x													WOS:000477633500004

However, the applications have been hindered by the exorbitant price and the serious agglomeration. In this work, using wollastonite as reactant, H2SO4 as solvent, and adding sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) as surfactant, sub-100 nm amorphous nano-SiO2 center dot 0.5H(2)O particles with good dispersibility, controllable agglomeration, narrow size distribution, and high yield were prepared by a low-cost and simple chemical method.

J	Chidambaram, V; Bu, L; Chuan, KL				Chidambaram, Vivek; Bu, Lin; Chuan, Kai Liang			Hermetic Sealant Material Possibilities for IR Sensor Packaging	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS												Hermeticity is one of the most critical issues for infrared (IR) sensor packages, since any leakage will impair the functionality of the device. The issues associated with the premature failure of hermetic sealants were studied in detail, both by simulation as well as by experimentation. Alternate prospective hermetic sealant candidates for transistor outline IR sensor packages were identified and evaluated. Hermetic sealant options for wafer-level IR sensor packaging were also investigated, which involves wafer-level hermetic cum vacuum packaging. Metallic hermetic sealant is preferred for this approach, since it facilitates integration with the getter material. However, the primary challenge encountered here is the requirement of high processing temperature for the getter activation. An activated getter adsorbs active gases inside the volume of the packages, resulting in lower internal pressure. It was determined that appropriate micro-alloying of the getter is required to minimize the getter activation temperature. This is achieved by selective micro-alloying of the getter material, which induces more grain boundaries and thereby promotes in-depth diffusion even at lower activation temperature. Integration of getter material with all three different types of metallic wafer-level bonding mechanisms was investigated. This includes eutectic, diffusion and transient liquid-phase bonding mechanisms. Selection of an appropriate bonding mechanism and integration scheme depends on the corresponding structure, layout and temperature rating of the specific IR sensor devices.																			0361-5235	1543-186X				OCT	2019	48	10			SI		6470	6479		10.1007/s11664-019-07427-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11664-019-07427-9													WOS:000485885200055

NCFET enables to implement the internal amplification of gate voltage, resulting in a high on/off-current ratio, and good compatibility with current CMOS technology. The hysteresis window of NCFET, however, is the conspicuous obstacle for its commercialization (especially, for CMOS logic device application). It is well known that there are various factors, which affect the hysteresis window of NCFET, such as the thickness of ferroelectric capacitor, the kinds of ferroelectric material, etc. While the thickness of ferroelectric capacitor and the kinds of ferroelectric material have been widely studied, the impact of ferroelectric capacitor's electrode area on the performance of NCFET has never been investigated.

The proposed 1T-DRAM is made up of a silicon germanium storage region surrounding a silicon fin. When the two materials form a heterojunction, a potential well is formed by the band discontinuity which carriers can be stored. During the program operation, band-to-band tunneling and gate-induced drain leakage occur simultaneously due to the gate and drain bias. Because of these phenomena, the electron-hole pair occurs, and generated holes are stored in the storage region by potential well. The holes formed are positively charged within the storage region, which mitigates the depletion of the channel and improves the operating current. The proposed device realizes the memory operation by the difference of the operating current depending on the presence or absence of the stored holes. In this work, the device is analyzed and optimized in detail. The proposed 1T-DRAM shows excellent performance with a retention time of 161 ms based on 50% of the maximum data margin.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6755	6761		10.1166/jnn.2019.17116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17116								31027024					WOS:000466046800124

Emotion-Driven System for Data Center Management	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Complex Information Systems and infrastructures, like Smart Cities, must be efficiently operated, minimizing inefficiencies and maximizing productivity. Traditional approaches are focused on improving the systems, automating processes and services, leaving aside human and emotions considerations. To achieve this efficient operation, we attempted to cover both sides. We found new ways to capture the information coming from the workforce, in our case, the operations management team, and, merged this information with the data from the IoT sensors from the systems, enabling a holistic view of the entire operations occurring in real-time. In a Data Center environment, we have developed a set of tools for capturing the emotional data in order to detect potential biases caused by the specific mood of the person inside the operations team. We used Artificial Intelligence algorithms for finding the patterns that will help us to manage the system in the future. We compared and verified our findings with the existing references from other disciplines, e.g., Psychology. In this article, we expose some methods to be developed in future studies for supervising and increasing productivity in Data Centers, as a useful example for Smart Cities.

J	Cruz, R; Pineda, L				Cruz, Ricardo; Pineda, Luis			Promoting Optimal User Experience through Composite Challenge Tasks	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Optimal user experience or flow is a theory with great impact on user experience. Promoting flow has become a competitive advantage for interactive systems, including rehabilitation. This can be achieved through an engaging interface that provides a rewarding experience and motivates the user to use the system again. This theory sustains that promoting a state of flow and improving task performance depends heavily on the balance between the challenges posed by the system and the skills deployed by the user. We further claim that balanced mental and motor skills demanded by the task improve flow and task performance. This paper presents an experiment supporting these claims. For this, we built two movement-interaction rehabilitation systems called SIBMER and Macoli (arm in Nahuatl). Both systems have two versions, one with a balanced load of mental and motor skills, and the other with an unbalanced one. Both versions are compared in terms of their potential to promote the state of flow and to improve task performance. Results show that a balance demand of mental and motor skills promotes flow, independently of the task complexity. Likewise, the experiment shows a correlation between flow and performance.

The reactants were mixed and pressed into a precast block in a certain proportion, and pressed it into pure copper melt to complete in situ reaction. When the temperature of melt drops to the near melting point of pure copper, casting is performed to obtain sample material in which the in situ reaction products distributed in copper matrix. The morphology, size and distribution of in situ reaction products were observed by differential thermal analyzer, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The mechanism of influence of La2O3 addition on in-suit reaction of Al-CuO system was studied. The results show that the in situ reaction products of Al-CuO-La2O3 system are mainly Al2O3 particles and a small amount of LaAl11O18 particles. Compared with in situ reaction products of the Al-CuO system, the size and morphology of the Al2O3 particles changed obviously. The size of Al2O3 particles decreased from 30 to 150 nm, and the morphology changed from spherical to irregular.In addition,the Al2O3 particles dispersed evenly in copper matrix.																			2053-1591					OCT	2019	6	10							1065b4	10.1088/2053-1591/ab3ef1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab3ef1													WOS:000484529300004

First, calculations of the interface adhesion energy and Mulliken mean populations show that the aGNR/unilaminar NiO interface has good interface stability. Second, the current-voltage characteristics and the micro formation process of conducting filaments of graphene/NiO/graphene resistive random access memory with resistance layers of different widths are studied. The comprehensive performance of the device is fully exploited, and its storage window can satisfy the requirement of data storage when the width of the resistance layer is 17.6 angstrom. Finally, an increase in the concentration of excess oxygen causes an increase in power consumption and a decline in the current drive capacity, while the stability of the device is improved; moreover, the size of the storage window decreases but still meets the requirement of data storage. In summary, the storage performance is effectively improved by excess oxygen concentration of 3.82%. These results may provide a theoretical basis for rational design and device optimization regarding the resistance layer dimension and excess oxygen.

By means of electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and atomic force microscopy, the influences of the nitrogen flow ratio on the phase constituents and microstructures of CrB2/Cr-B-O-N films were systematically investigated. Mechanical properties including the hardness and elastic modulus were explored by a nano-indentation tester. On increasing the nitrogen flow ratio, the N and O contents in films increased linearly and tended to become saturated, whereas the Cr and B contents decreased. With an increasing nitrogen flow ratio, the microstructure changed from a dense columnar structure to a bulky columnar structure, and then to a fine and stacked dense structure. Meanwhile, the deposition rate also changed with increasing nitrogen flow ratio, owing to the changes in structure. Crystalline phases were observed by the XRD and HRTEM analyses, consisting of several nanometer-size crystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix. The dramatically decreased hardness was attributed to the large fractional volume of the softer amorphous phase BN in films.					wang, qi/HTN-8786-2023; Kim, Kwang Ho/AHH-1526-2022														1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6826	6833		10.1166/jnn.2019.17127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17127								31027037					WOS:000466046800137

Still, there are very limited studies on the metal deposition on polymeric substrates by thermal spray process due to various limitations and problems associated with this aspect, although some reports are available on the fabrication and characterization of bonding layers using low melt temperature materials. With this background, this study was taken up with the objectives of deposition of 309L stainless steel on some polymeric substrates (PP, Nylon 66 and PVC) by electric arc thermal spray process through a prior development of a bond coating. This bond coating was based on epoxy resin/micro silica with scattered and packed metal particles anchored over it, which changed the nature of the substrate surface creating a favorable topology for adhesion and scattering of the sprayed particles. Coatings having an average thickness of 129.06 mu m of stainless steel and 259.06 mu m of bonding layer (epoxy/micro silica) were obtained over a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) substrate, which had the smaller difference of coefficient of thermal expansion with the bond coat. Obtained coating showed good electrical conductivity value. This kind of favorable metallization of plastics could expand its application areas and might be potential candidate to replace expensive metallic or ceramic materials in special applications.

There is an enormous range of possibilities for using structured sheet metals due to their better stability. However, the effective use of these materials as well as their implementation in production requires precise knowledge about specific properties of structured sheet metals. The aim of this work is to obtain new knowledge about stiffness and stability during the deformation of this material. The structured sheet metals were investigated by means of buckling tests. The steel type investigated is a commonly used deep-drawing steel DC04. Six types of structure arrangements were compared to non-structured (flat) specimens as a reference. The influence of the type of structure arrangement as well as the deformation speed on the mechanical properties was investigated.

Assessment of approaches to obtain ebullition pressures for organophilic clay blankets	GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL												The objective of this study is to compare two experimental approaches to characterize the ebullition pressure (or air-entry suction) of initially water-saturated organophilic clay blankets. The first is an indirect approach using the water-retention curve (WRC) and the second is a direct approach using ebullition experiments. TheWRC along with the hydraulic conductivity of organophilic clay blankets in saturated and unsaturated conditions were measured using a flexible-wall permeameter with suction-saturation control. This device was also adapted to measure the ebullition pressure and the air permeability. The comparison of the experimental approaches was performed on organophilic clay blanket specimens in different initial conditions (unrinsed and rinsed to remove loose fines) under high and low effective confining stresses (20 and 5 kPa). The indirect estimates of air-entry suction from the WRC were similar to those obtained from the ebullition tests. This good agreement between the two approaches may add flexibility to the development of design specifications for capping systems. The hydraulic properties were found to be sensitive to rinsing and effective stress, with greater hydraulic conductivity and air permeability for the rinsed specimen due to the removal of fines, and greater air-entry suctions for specimens under higher effective stress.

A linear Gm-cell is proposed and used as a key building block in design of the filter. The linear Gm-cell employs a circuit technique to reduce the nonlinearity of the source follower (SF) stage resulting from unmatched signal swings at the gate and source terminals of the input transistor. The Gm-cell was used to build a biquad bloc, which was utilized to construct a 3rd-order Butterworth low pass filter. The proposed filter consists of a buffer and a biquad stage to form the 3rd-order transfer function. The simulation results of the filter for bandwidth of 10MHz show that the IIP3 of the filter was equal to 29.5 dBm. The minimum in-band noise density was 22.6 nV/root Hz and power consumption was 10.8 mW. The supply voltage of the filter was 1 V.																			1985-5761	2232-1535				OCT	2019	12	4					437	450																WOS:000488875100006

Noninvasive, In Situ Acoustic Diagnosis and Monitoring of Corrosion in Molten-Salt Systems	CORROSION												Diagnosis and monitoring of corrosion at high temperatures are common challenges in many industries, such as conventional power plants and next generation molten-salt reactor (MSR) nuclear power plants. A simple, noninvasive, in situ acoustic technique was developed to monitor wall loss due to corrosion in a model molten-salt vessel, operating at 500 degrees C to 600 degrees C. This work demonstrated the feasibility of high-temperature corrosion monitoring experimentally, and validated the concept with physical and microstructural analysis, modeling, and numerical simulations. The results of this work could form the basis for the development of a general-purpose, extended-range acoustic monitoring and inspection technique for corrosion at high temperatures (with expected upper range of approximately 900 degrees C), which does not currently exist. Such a technique could be critical for the safe operation of MSRs in the future, as well as for rapid, nondestructive testing of new reactor component materials.																			0010-9312	1938-159X				OCT	2019	75	10					1230	1236		10.5006/3253	http://dx.doi.org/10.5006/3253													WOS:000488278500008
J	Gallion, JR; Case, AG; Zoughi, R				Gallion, John R.; Case, Anna G.; Zoughi, Reza			Millimeter Wave Detection of Surface-Breaking Cracks in Steel and Aluminum under Severe Corrosion and Paint	MATERIALS EVALUATION												Many components of critical and heavily utilized infrastructure, such as ships, planes, bridges, and so on, are operating at or beyond their designed lifetime. Replacement is no longer an option, and "retirement for cause" is the current approach to maintenance and replacement. Consequently, there is an ever-increasing demand for efficient and robust nondestructive testing (NDT) methods and techniques that can determine the physical health of these structures. Large structures, which are primarily made of metals, either steel or aluminum, are susceptible to in-service corrosion and stress-induced cracking. Stress-induced cracks, particularly in heavily corroded steel members used in bridges, railroads, storage tanks, and similar structures, are difficult to detect using many of the standard NDT methods, increasing the risk of not being able to detect an existing crack. Microwave signals readily penetrate through dielectric materials such as paint and corrosion byproducts (such as rust) and can interact with the underlying metal, rendering cracks detectable. In this paper, the implementation of a microwave imaging system that utilizes the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) approach to detect surface-breaking cracks (in the form of manufactured narrow notches) in steel and aluminum samples under heavy corrosion and corrosion-preventive paints is investigated. In addition, the influence of signal polarization direction relative to crack direction and the cyclical severity of corrosion inducement are investigated. The resulting SAR images are analyzed and compared to numerical simulations to identify the real-world capabilities and theoretical limitations of the technique.																			0025-5327					OCT	2019	77	10					1245	1257																WOS:000489355400004

B0901) - an important bridge connection in the city of Vienna, Austria - was built between 1962 and 1964. Around 68,000 vehicles a day are crossing the link over the Danube channel every day. The bridge chain was last rebuilt in the course of the extension of the subway line U6 in the early 1990s. In recent decades, due to the importance of traffic and to avoid traffic delays caused by construction work only punctual, absolutely necessary repair work was carried out. However, the extensive loading and the associated state of preservation required, after 50 years of use, a comprehensive bridge repair with partial upgrading. Due to the large number of different bridge systems and building materials of the bridge chain, extensive structural and traffic measures were required to maintain this essential connection. The construction work on the Gurtelbridge, which began in the fall of 2012, was completed on schedule in the fall of 2015 despite the most adverse circumstances surrounding the construction work. In the present publication, the peculiarities of the planning and construction phase are presented in order to benefit from this experience in similar projects.																			0005-9900	1437-1006				OCT	2019	114	10					776	789		10.1002/best.201900039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/best.201900039													WOS:000489028300008

Smart System for the Retrieval of Digital Educational Content	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												The education sector is a major generator, consumer, and depositary of educational content. Thanks to technological advances, today's educators and learners have ubiquitous and on-demand access to information. Technology has made it possible for us to communicate and share information effortlessly from anywhere in the world. However, the availability of vast amounts of heterogeneous educational content will not be useful unless we search, retrieve and integrate it, creating interoperable educational environments. The current challenges to integrating educational content arise from its distribution over several repositories. This research proposes AIREH (architecture for intelligent retrieval of educational content from heterogeneous environments), for the retrieval of digital content through agent-based virtual organizations. This flexible architecture facilitates the search for and integration of heterogeneous content through an information retrieval model that involves both case-based reasoning and federated search. Moreover, AIREH is based on an adaptive organization model for distributed planning, thanks to which, it manages open systems flexibly, dynamically, and effectively. The conducted case study gives very promising results and demonstrates the advantages of using agent-based virtual organizations in the retrieval of labeled digital content. The proposed model is flexible, customizable, comprehensive and efficient.

NBIT is compared with an implicit non-linear finite element (FE) model using LS-DYNA. A split FE model was compared with a quarter FE model to determine the split interface that causes an average difference of 9.0% on the residual von Mises strain field from a 588.6 N indentation. The homogeneous FE quarter model was then compared with the experimental split model using 588.6, 981.0, and 1471.5 N indentation forces. An average displacement difference of 3.92 mu m was found when comparing the experimental split and FE homogeneous samples from a 588.6 N indentation. The internal residual major and minor principal strains from the split experimental sample and homogeneous FE model were compared for each indentation force. The minor principal strain results show the 588.6, 981.0, and 1471.5 N indentation forces resulted in a difference between the experimental split and homogeneous FE model of 28.5%, 34.8%, and 26.0%, respectively. The difference between the comparisons was explained by the inability of the FE model to simulate local non-homogeneous material properties such as grain composition and orientation whereas NBIT does. NBIT can be used for micro- or macro-scale residual strain analysis as the spatial resolution is highly adjustable.																			0094-4289	1528-8889				OCT	2019	141	4							041010	10.1115/1.4044462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4044462													WOS:000499948900010
J	Gou, JN; Zhai, PP; Dong, HY				Gou, Jun-nian; Zhai, Pan-pan; Dong, Hai-ying			Sparse and limited-angle CT image reconstruction using dictionary learning constrained by L1 norm	INSIGHT												Reconstructed images from computed tomography (CT) using the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and simultaneous ART (SART) algorithms often suffer from obvious artefacts when only sparse and limited-angle projection data are available. Using the ability of dictionary learning (DL) in image feature extraction and sparse signal representation, a new iterative reconstruction algorithm, ART-DL-L1, is proposed to overcome the aforementioned limitations. This new algorithm is based on DL and an L1 norm constraint, combined with ART. An alternate iterative solving strategy based on an approach of 'ART first, then adaptive dictionary learning' is suggested and is explicitly described in a flowchart depicting the ART-DL-L1 algorithm. For both a noisy projection of 360 degrees sparse data and limited- angle data of 120 degrees, simulation reconstruction results from the classic Shepp-Logan image obtained using ART-DL-L1 appear to be better than those obtained using SART and total variation (TV) algorithms and also better than the cutting-edge ART-DL-L2 algorithm. Five evaluation metrics corresponding to the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the residuals and the structural similarity (SSIM) index are adopted to estimate the reconstruction effect. The results suggest that the five metrics obtained using ART-DL-L1 outperform those obtained using the other three algorithms. The impact of using patches of various sizes played by the DL part in ART-DL-L1 is considered in the simulations and the patch size achieving the best reconstructed image quality is identified in this case as 25 (5 x 5). Overall, the proposed ART-DL-L1 algorithm may reduce artefacts and suppress noise from incomplete noisy projection CT imaging to some degree.

Although the trapped Fano-mode of the high-Q factor is found in asymmetric SRR, the conventional design limits the scaling down of resonators. As such, excitation and manipulation of multiple trapped modes of SRR is significant for driving innovative designs of terahertz metamaterials and metasurfaces. In this work, we present a novel approach to manipulating multiple terahertz modes by increasing the fractal levels as well as the geometric symmetry of complementary SRR. It is found that the multiple trapped modes become achievable only in the case that the gap of adjacent fractal SRR opposes each other. By increasing the fractal level, the intrinsic resonance modes change slightly, and more trapped modes appear in between the frequency range of the two major intrinsic modes. The map of surface currents and magnetic field distribution reveal that intrinsic LC resonance in the first or second level SRR dominates the intrinsic modes. By contrast, the trapped mode arises from the hybridization of high-order localized dipole oscillation as well as the multiple localized LC resonances. These findings create new design opportunities for scalable metasurfaces across the terahertz spectrum and beyond, with ability to create high-resolution sensors.

J	Gui, YW; Li, QA				Gui, Yunwei; Li, Quanan			Creep behaviors and microstructure evolution of Mg-5Y-2Nd-3Sm-0.5Zr alloys	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												The creep behaviors and microstructure evolution of Mg-5Y-2Nd-3Sm-0.5Zr alloy under the temperature 473 K-523 K and the stress 70 MPa-110 MPa for 100 h were investigated in a typical creep testing machine. The results show that the creep strain of Mg-5Y-2Nd-3Sm-0.5Zr alloy increases with the increase of temperature and stress. The steady-state creep rates at 523 K/70 MPa and 523 K/90 MPa are only 2.3611 x 10(-8)s(-1) and 3.9194 x 10(-8)s(-1), the creep strain after 100 h is only 0.735% and 1.751%, Mg-5Y-2Nd-3Sm-0.5Zr alloy has excellent creep resistance under 523 K. When the stretching temperature is the same, the grain size of the alloy increases with the increase of tensile strength. Under the same tensile strength, with the increase of temperature, the grain size of the alloy increases obviously with the increase of temperature. The creep stress exponents (n) are 0.84 at 473 K, 2.58 at 498 K and 5.13 at 523 K under the creep conditions of 70 MPa-110 MPa. In addition, the creep activation energy Q(c) increases with the increase of stress. The creep activation energies Q(c) are 96.85 kJ mol(-1), 113.48 kJ mol(-1) and 181.24 kJ mol(-1) for 70 MPa, 90 MPa and 110 MPa, respectively. The results of stress exponents and creep activation energies show that the creep mechanism of aging Mg-5Y-2Nd-3Sm-0.5Zr alloy changes from grain boundary slip to dislocation slip with the increase of creep temperature and stress.

The reduction leaching of manganese anode slime and the oxidative decomposition of pyrite and arsenopyrite could be realized simultaneously by the synergistic action of the two ores. The effects of time, mass ratio of two ores, concentration of sulphuric acid and temperature on the leaching rate of manganese were investigated. The optimum technological conditions were determined as follows: the leaching rate of manganese was 85.24% when the concentration of sulphuric acid was 1 moll(-1) and the ratio of two ores (Fe:Mn) was 0.5 at the temperature of 85 degrees C and 120 min. The extraction rate of gold from pretreated gold ore can reach 70% in the process of ultrasonic enhanced leaching. Compared with the direct leaching rate (15.6%) of the original ore, the leaching rate has been greatly improved.

The adsorption characteristics of the functionalized adsorbents for various metal ions were tested for different adsorption times (1 similar to 48 h) in artificial wastewater and artificial seawater. In the case of artificial wastewater, the functionalized adsorbents had no preferential selectivity for metal ions except for Na+ ions, even though the MSNs-AH adsorbent adsorbed most of the metal ions investigated in this work, including Li+, Co2+, Ca2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Zn2+, and Ni2+. In the case of artificial seawater, however, the MSN absorbent showed high selectivity for Li+ ions.

When the Al-Ni precursor is foamed in a hollow pipe, if the temperature distribution inside the precursor is uneven, the pore shape distribution becomes uneven. In free foaming, no anisotropy is observed in the foaming direction and the pore shape is isotropic. However, in the hollow pipe, the pipe expands in the pipe axis direction and fills the pipe. The interfacial adhesion between Al3Ni foam and steel pipe is excellent, and interfacial pore and reaction layer are not observed by SEM. In free foaming, the porosity is 90 %, but it decreases to about 80 % in the foam in the pipe. In the pipe foaming, most of the pore shape appears elongated in the pipe direction in the vicinity of the pipe, and this tendency is more remarkable when the inside pipe diameter is small. It can be seen that the pore size of the foam sample in the pipe is larger than that of free foam, because coarse pores remain after solidification of the foam because the shape of the foam is supported by the pipe. The vertical/horizontal length ratio expands along the pipe axis direction by foaming in the pipe, and therefore circularity is reduced.																			1225-0562	2287-7258				OCT	2019	29	10					617	622		10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.617	http://dx.doi.org/10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.617													WOS:000500930400006

The relationships between the thrust and rotation speed of a screw mixed-flow pump, drag and submerged speed of water-jet propulsion were obtained from flume experiments and numerical calculations, based on which a dynamic model of pump-jet propulsion was established in this paper. As an initial condition, the numerical solution of the submerged speed with respect to time was inputted to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for unsteady calculation based on a user-defined function (UDF). Thus, the relationships between the acceleration, drag, net thrust, propulsion torque and efficiency with respect to time were revealed. The results indicate that the relationship between the thrust and rotational speed of a water-jet propeller is a quadratic function, which agrees well with the experimental values. The variation of submerged speed with respect to time satisfies a hyperbolic tangent function distribution. The acceleration increases sharply at the beginning and then decreases gradually to zero, especially at high rotation speeds of the water-jet pump. The variations in drag and propulsion efficiency with respect to time coincide with the step response of a second-order system with critical damping. The method and results of this study can give a better understanding of the changes in dynamic parameters such as velocity, acceleration, thrust, and drag during the acceleration of a pump-jet submersible and helped to estimate the effects of pump performance on water-jet propulsion kinetic parameters.

In this study, strain foils (SFs) are utilized to measure longitudinal strains at the bottom of a hot mixed asphalt (HMA) layer in an indoor inverted pavement. The validity and reliability of SF-measured strain are investigated through three tests using a heavy vehicle simulator (HVS). The three tests focus on the consistency and stability of strain measured by individual SFs and various SFs installed at similar positions, as well as the consistency of strain measured by SF and an asphalt strain gauge (ASG) at different test speeds, load levels, and loading cycles in an accelerated pavement test (APT). Fast Fourier transform is utilized to filter out interference in the raw SF strain data. Filtered SF-measured strains were converted into ASG-measured strain based on effective gauge lengths. Research results show that converted SF-measured strains did not reveal a significant statistical difference compared with strains simultaneously collected by ASG under different test loads and speeds throughout the APT at 300,000 repetitions. Moreover, individual SF can provide consistent results with the coefficient of variation (CV) less than 3.3 % under different speeds and load levels, and SFs installed at similar positions showed similar average maximum strain variations (MSVs) with a maximum difference of 5.8%. Moreover, the linear correlations between the average MSV and the test load, as well as the speed further verified the validity of SF-measured strain. It is believed that SF could be a viable alternative for strain monitoring in asphalt pavement.

J	Hayes, WW; Manson, JR				Hayes, W. W.; Manson, J. R.			Calculations of Ar scattering from graphite	AIP ADVANCES												Two recent experiments on the scattering of hyperthermal Ar atoms from clean and ordered graphite have been carried out in the classical regime, which is characterized by excitations of large numbers of phonons. The measured data, which consist primarily of angular distribution spectra, are shown here to be well explained by straight-forward classical scattering theory. The calculations confirm that the Ar-graphite scattering at energies of up to 14 eV is a single-hit collision process involving a large number of carbon atoms in the outermost graphene layers. This number is estimated here to be close to 9 carbon atoms. All of the measured angular distributions down to energies of 0.3 eV are supraspecular, but the present calculations predict that the angular distributions will become subspecular at lower energies. Calculations are also presented predicting the expected results of energy-resolved measurements under similar initial conditions. (c) 2019 Author(s).

Their structure and morphology can be controlled by tuning the precursor concentration. Microstructural analysis reveals that all the samples have distinct core/shell structure without impurities, and the NiO shells are built of many irregular nanosheets which enclose the surface of gamma-Fe2O3 core. As the precursor concentration decreases (i.e., more NiO content), the NiO grain grows significantly, and the thickness of NiO shells increases. Magnetic experiments are performed to analyze the influences of different microstructures on magnetic properties of samples and we have the following two results. First, at 5 K, along with increasing thickness of NiO shell, the saturation magnetization increases, while the residual magnetization decreases slightly. Second, the hysteresis loops under cooling field demonstrate that the value of exchange bias effect fluctuates between 13 Oe and 17 Oe. This is mainly because of the NiO shell that (i) is composed of irregular nanosheets with disordered orientations, and (ii) does not form a complete coating around gamma-Fe2O3 core.					zhang, chunmei/IUQ-7038-2023														0025-5408	1873-4227				OCT	2019	118								110495	10.1016/j.materresbull.2019.110495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.materresbull.2019.110495													WOS:000480375000022

The specific insulation materials correspond to rigid closed-cell plastic foams, a type of polyisocyanurate (foam A) and a type of phenolic foam (foam B), whose thermal decomposition and flammability were characterised in previous studies. The assemblies were instrumented with thermocouples. The plasterboard facing was subjected to constant levels of irradiation of 15, 25, and 65 kW m(-2) using the heat-transfer rate inducing system. These experiments serve as (1) an assessment of the fire behaviour of these materials studied at the assembly scale and (2) an identification of the fire hazards that these systems pose in building construction. The manifestation of the hazards occurred via initial pyrolysis reactions and release of volatiles followed by various complex behaviours including char oxidation (smouldering), cracking, and expansion of the foam. Gas-phase conditions may support ignition of the volatiles, sustained burning, and ultimately spread of the flame through the unexposed insulation face. The results presented herein are used to validate the insulation "critical temperature" concept used for a performance-based methodology focused on the selection of suitable thermal barriers for flammable insulation.

Here we explored the feasibility of applying fibrin matrix as high-dose VD carrier for topical application. Our results indicated that VD did not significantly alter the morphological, rheological and degradation characteristics of fibrin matrix except decreasing gelation time by its solvent DMSO. Furthermore, VD could be sustainably released from fibrin for more than 96 hours. Most importantly, fibrin containing high-dose VD increased gastric cancer cells apoptosis in contrast to VD alone of the same concentration, which might be due to the synergistic effects of sustained release of VD and D-dimer, the degradation products of fibrin. This study suggests that local delivery of high-dose calcitriol carried by fibrin matrix might be a promising adjuvant therapy for gastric cancer surgery.																			0885-3282	1530-8022				OCT	2019	34	4					509	522		10.1177/0885328219856248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0885328219856248								31195918					WOS:000483837200005

In this paper a ZnO micro/nanostructured thin film device is grown on a 21 nm silver film-sputtered sapphire substrates (0001) and attempted to be complied as a transmission-mode white-light spectrum tuning device. In details, the growth of the structures as a function of temporal duration and the effects of deposition of a 21 nm silver film atop sapphire substrates to the structural and optical properties of ZnO structures are investigated. Results of SEM imaging reveals that the insertion of the silver film enables synthesis of round ZnO particles at micro or nanoscales depending on the duration of growth time as opposed to the floral pattern associated with plain sapphire substrates. Characterizing material crystallization by XRD spectra found one dominant and two minor peaks along the planes of crystallization (002), and (100) and (101), correspondingly. Also, the characteristic PL peak at 380 nm was confirmed when excited at 325 nm, and the intensity decreases as the duration of growth time increases.

By SEM, EDS, XRD and universal testing machine, the composition, particle size, microstructure and mechanical properties of porous copper alloy under different ball milling times were studied. The results show that the porosity of porous Cu-Sn alloy sample decreases with the increase of Sn powder content from 0% to 4%(mass fraction, the same below). The pore-forming agent K2CO3 does not react with Cu powder and Sn powder, which not only contributes to the formation of pores, but also is easy to be treated in later stage. The compressive resistance of porous copper alloy prepared was higher than that of porous pure copper. With the increase of Sn powder content, the curvature of porous copper alloy increases in the elastic stage, and the pressure value corresponding to plastic deformation increases, indicating that its ability to resist plastic deformation increases. However, the strain range has not changed significantly, indicating that the ductility has not changed much.

The effects of temperature, moisture content and germination index of seeds in the aerobic composting were analyzed. Besides, the effects of sugarcane leaves in different ratios were investigated in the aerobic composting of the biogas residue. The results showed that the maintenance of the high temperature for the fermentation of biogas residue was relatively stable with the addition of sugarcane leaves to biogas residue ratio of 1:5. A period of 24 days was required for the decrease in the composting temperature to reach the stage of stabilization. A lowest moisture ratio of 30.2% was obtained in the composting product. The ratio of addition sugarcane leaves to biogas residue ratio of 1:5 exhibited 90% germination index of seeds of, which was the highest. Furthermore, the maturity degree of the composting was the best in the added 1: 5 ratio. Overall, the addition of sugarcane leaves was beneficial for the decomposition during the composting, thus providing a scientific evidence for the resource utilization of the biogas residue and the quality enhancement of composting products of biogas residue.

The film deposited at room temperature (RT) contained organic defects, which were almost eliminated in the film annealed at 700 degrees C. The film deposited at RT revealed (100) planes with an inter-planar distance of 1.1 nm because of the existence of TBA(+) defects. However, for the films annealed at higher temperatures (>= 400 degrees C), two types of structures formed: (100) planes with 0.55 nm inter-planar distance (group-1 structure), and (100) planes with 1.42 nm inter-planar distance (group-2 structure). The dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) of the film annealed at 700 degrees C was 61 with a low dielectric loss of 1.0%. Variations in the epsilon(r), according to the film thickness, electric field, and temperature were small. This film displayed a high insulating property up to 300 degrees C with a small temperature coefficient of capacitance (-56.7 ppm/K) up to 400 degrees C.

Experimental analysis of nutrient release from the urea explains two major factors responsible for release, diffusion and erosion. It has been proposed a mathematical model involving two moving boundaries for diffusion and erosion front. The mathematical analysis presented in the paper will help in designing improved controlled-release urea to meat plant nutrient uptake requirement. The nutrient release presented in the paper are obtained for constant release rate, zero order release, time required for complete release or life time and decay release time of nutrient release of coated urea.

However, efflorescence generally changes the colour impression of the material surface and of the concrete facade as a whole. This study investigated the efflorescence of carbon aminosilica black (CASB) mortar and the effect of redispersible polymer powder (RPP) on the physical properties of CASB mortar. For this purpose, a flow test and colour evaluation was carried out on white Portland cement paste and mortar mixed with CASB by changing the proportion of RPP. RPP modifies the mechanical properties of the mortar by forming a polymer film in the cementitious matrix. The film prevents the transport of soluble calcium towards the surface and decreases efflorescence. As a result, the colour appearance of CASB mortar improved with increasing RPP content.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6408	6411		10.1166/jnn.2019.17042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17042								31026969					WOS:000466046800072

The interface traps distributed within different energy levels (E-t) in the energy bandgap of a semiconductor material exhibit various influences on the device performances. In this work, InGaAs-based TFETs are simulated to analyze the effects on the on-state current (I-on), off-state current (I-off), threshold voltage (V-th), subthreshold swing (SS), and the ambipolar characteristics according to E-t and type of the interface traps. We have confirmed that I-off and SS are degraded by the interface traps. Further, it can be shown that I-on is mainly affected by the acceptor-like traps and ambipolar behavior is affected by the donor-like traps. All the effects increase as E-t becomes closer to the midgap. The effects of the interface traps with gate underlap and overlap at the source-channel region also have been investigated, considering the device fabrication. Additionally, the analysis of the effect of junction trap created at the source-channel junction has been performed.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6036	6042		10.1166/jnn.2019.17009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17009								31026904					WOS:000466046800007
J	Jaramillo , HE				Jaramillo S, Hector E.			How the height and the area of the annulus fibrosus affect the range of motion behavior: A stochastic analysis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS												The annulus fibrosus has substantial variations in its geometrical properties (among individuals and between levels), and plays an important role in the biomechanics of the spine. Few works have studied the influence of the geometrical properties including annulus area, anterior / posterior disc height, and over the range of motion, but in general these properties have not been reported in the finite element models. This paper presents a probabilistic finite element analyses (Abaqus 6.14.2) intended to assess the effects of the average disc height (h(p)) and the area (A) of the annulus fibrosus on the biomechanics of the lumbar spine. The annulus model was loaded under flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation and analyzed for different combinations of h(p) and A in order to obtain their effects over the range of motion. A set of 50 combinations of h(p) (mean = 18.1 mm, SD = 3.5 mm) and A (mean = 49.8%, SD = 4.6%) were determined randomly according to a normal distribution. A Yeoh energy function was used for the matrix and an exponential function for the fibers. The range of motion was more sensitive to h(p) than to A. With regard to the range of motion the segment was more sensitive in the following order: flexion, axial rotation, extension, and lateral bending. An increase of the h(p) produces an increase of the range of motion, but this decreases when A increases. Comparing the range of motion with the experimental data, on average, 56.0% and 73.0% of the total of data were within the experimental range for the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, respectively. Further, an analytic equation was derived to obtain the range of motion as a function of the h(p) and A. This equation can be used to calibrate a finite element model of the spine segment, and also to understand the influence of each geometrical parameter on the range of motion.

For direct methods, there are no standard testing apparatuses or procedures to measure the tensile strength of soils. This paper presents a modification of a direct tension apparatus and its test results on compacted soil. The major factors affecting tensile strength measurements include the size of the specimen, tensile displacement pulling rate, and the shape of the tensile apparatus mold. The effect of the tensile displacement pulling rate and the behavior of crack propagation due to the shapes of the direct tension mold were investigated. Three wedge types (triangular, trapezoidal, and rectangular) were used in the tests. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was adopted to capture the crack propagation along with the development of tensile stress and to evaluate the wedges suitability. In addition, tests were conducted to measure the tensile strength of soils with different specimen depths and cross-sectional areas. The results show that there was no significant influence of the displacement rate associated with tensile force, crack propagation, and maximum tensile force. Triangular wedges are the best pick for direct tension tests. Tensile strength was found to be size dependent; the cross-sectional area and specimen depth govern the tensile strength of compacted soil mixture. However, it was found that the tensile strength was close to a constant when the area ratio exceeds a critical value.

Then highly spherical NaCl beads were obtained under the shear action of a blender. Afterwards, the "fried" NaCl beads with a particle size distribution of 0.4 similar to 2.4 mm were calcined and sintered at 740 degrees C, and thus the high purity NaCl beads with small amount of micro-pore (pores size 10 similar to 20 mu m) on the surface were obtained. The 0.6-1.0 mm salt beads were selected to form a "salt bed" in a steel die and the aluminum powder was filled into the "salt bed" gap via a tapping method by the Autotap instrument. The tapped mixture was cold pressed under 200 MPa to obtain the green compact parts. Then the salts were dissolved and removed in distilled water and three-dimensional open-cell green Al foam with controllable structure and high reproducibility was derived. After sintering at 460 degrees C for 2 h, the final Al foam was obtained and its relative density and porosity are 0.217 and 78.3%, respectively. The number of connectivity windows between cellular aluminum cells is 4 similar to 6 in average, and the window size is 120 similar to 200 mu m. The compressive load-displacement curve shows that the aluminum foam undergoes an elastic deformation stage, a plateau stress area, and a stress steep increase stage. The curve manifests the characteristics of foam metal compression mechanical properties, and its compressive strength and Young's modulus are 2.42 MPa and 0:38 GPa, respectively.

The structural information and surface morphologies were examined by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The film morphologies were further analyzed by the grayscale fractal study, which could offer full perspectives about the cluster change (like cluster size, cluster amount, cluster height, and so forth) of GZO films with different annealing temperatures. Consequently, the change of cluster amount and size on/in films could be obtained by the fractal spectra. Furthermore, the stress of prepared thin films is also calculated to investigate the relationship between stress and surface morphology after annealing process. For example, it was found the film annealed at 200 degrees C exhibited the slowest change of fractal spectrum (changes with grayscale) and consequently the smallest value of in-plane stress.

The reduction behavior of chromium ore using Si sludge is investigated precisely to determine the effects of carbon addition, reaction time, and reaction temperature. The pellets are dropped into the furnace after temperature stabilized. As the amount of C addition increases, the amounts of CO and CO2 gas generation increase. After the dropping of the pellets, the pellets are heated and the reaction starts at about 1,573 K or higher. The pellets maintain their shape until 10 min after the drop, and then melted. As the holding time increased, the size of the reduced metal particles increased. The chromium ore is rapidly reduced by the Si sludge, and the slag penetrated into the chromium ore and reduction progressed inside. As the reduction temperature increased, the reaction initiation time is shortened and the reaction fraction of the reduction reaction increased. As the reaction temperature increased, agglomeration of reduced ferrochrome metal is promoted.

J	Jyegal, J				Jyegal, Jang			Generalized Einstein relation for nonparabolic multiple energy-band degenerate semiconductors	AIP ADVANCES												A generalized Einstein relation for electron gases of degenerate semiconductors with a system of typically two nonparabolic conduction band structures is derived and formulated in near-equilibrium condition based on using the semiclassical drift-diffusion equation. The result of this derivation shows that the Einstein relation for carrier gases in multiple energy bands generally depends on their mobilities unless the energy band structures are parabolic. The formulated results (a full formula and an approximate single-carrier-gas formula) are typically applied to GaAs and GaSb to calculate the values of the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to mobility for carriers in the lowest and upper conduction bands, and an in-depth investigation is made for the Einstein relation for conduction electrons in these semiconductors. It is shown, in particular, that highly degenerate GaAs exhibits the uncommon, peculiar property of the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to mobility for conduction electrons saturating in two different electron concentration, or Fermi energy, conditions, with increasing electron concentration or Fermi energy. It is also shown that for GaSb, the effect of the upper conduction band is so large that the use of any formula obtained for carriers in a single conduction band is generally unsuitable for describing the Einstein relation for conduction electrons in this semiconductor. In addition, a more generalized Einstein relation extended to a system of three nonparabolic energy band structures is also formulated and proposed in the paper, so as to be used to more accurately describe the Einstein relation for hole gases in degenerate semiconductors.

Ductile-brittle transition temperature shift controlled by grain boundary decohesion and thermally activated energy in Ni-Cr steels	CORROSION REVIEWS					5th International Conference on Stress-Assisted Corrosion Damage	JUL 15-20, 2018	Hernstein, AUSTRIA					Temper embrittlement induced by segregation of metalloid solutes to grain boundary (GB) was evaluated by a shift of the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT). DBTT was found to be linearly correlated with the amount of metalloid on the GB (X-gb) for both dynamic and static displacement rates (d delta/dt) in high and medium hardness steels. Recent first-principles calculations have determined the GB embrittling potency (Delta e(p)) of segregated Sb, Sn and P. In both high and medium hardness steels, the slope (alpha) of DBTT vs. X-gb was found to be linearly dependent on Delta e(p) regardless of the segregated solutes. In high hardness steels, the slope is independent of d delta/dt, while in medium hardness steels the a is dependent on d delta/dt. An Arrhenius plot of d delta/dt vs. the reciprocal DBTT was used to drive the thermal activation energy (E-act), which represents a barrier to plasticity. It was found that E-act correlates to a reduction in the GB fracture surface energy. The Eact depends strongly on GB decohesion in high hardness steels but only weakly depends on it in medium hardness steels.																			0334-6005	2191-0316				OCT	2019	37	5			SI		455	458		10.1515/corrrev-2019-0052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/corrrev-2019-0052													WOS:000489270000007
J	Kang, B; Kang, S				Kang, Byeongguk; Kang, Seunggu			Nanometer-Scale Surface Structure and Sterilization Characteristics of Na/Ag Ion-Exchanged Glass for Anti-Biofouling Application	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												Most objects and structures exposed to a marine environment for more than a month undergo biofouling of the surface. Biofouling is a phenomenon in which micro-organisms attach to marine structures and may result in deterioration of the structure or breakage of the structure due to weight gain. In this study, glass, which can inhibit biofouling of marine structures, was prepared and its germicidal properties were analyzed. For this purpose, Ag ions were implanted into soda-lime-silicate glass by the ion-exchange method. For the glass immersed in seawater, the bactericidal effect of the glass specimen was than evaluated by inoculating the strain and counting the number of viable cells after 12 or 24 h. Experimental variables were ion exchange conditions, time immersed in seawater, and time spent inoculating the strain. In particular, the surface state of the ion exchange glass before and after immersion in seawater was observed at the nanometer level, and the elution amount of Ag ions with time was measured by the ICP mass analysis method. As the ion exchange time increased, the amount of ion exchange increased. The amount of ions was consistent with Fick's first law, which is proportional to the square root of time. When ion-exchanged specimens were immersed in seawater, the amount of Ag ions eluted was on the order of ppm. Si and Na ions were also eluted from the glass. As the ion exchange time increased, crystals of 60 similar to 80 nm, which are presumed to be Na2CO3 phase, formed densely on the surface of the specimen. However, when the glass specimens were immersed in seawater, crystals formed on the surface dissolved and disappeared. Cracks subsequently formed on the surface and finally the surface collapsed. After 30 days, a fresh glass surface appeared again. This is a very interesting result because it shows that the reaction between glass and seawater is very similar to that between aqueous solutions. When the glass implanted with Ag ions is immersed in seawater, the surface dissolves and the glass-network-structure collapses, resulting in considerable Ag ion elution, which enhances bactericidal action in seawater. For example, when a specimen immersed in seawater for 30 days was inoculated with the strain for 24 hours, the number of strains decreased from 2.1x10(6) cells/ml to 0 cell/ml, indicating 100% disinfection ability. In this study, soda-lime-silicate glass with Ag ion implantation by the Na/Ag ion exchange method showed an excellent germicidal effect when in contact with sea water. From this result, it can be expected that long-term marine biological pollution can be suppressed by applying the glass developed in this research to marine structures.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6376	6382		10.1166/jnn.2019.17041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17041								31026964					WOS:000466046800067

From the transmittance spectra, absorption bands due to 4f-4f transition of Pr3+ ions were observed. The samples showed the X-ray induced radioluminescence peaks originating from the 4f-4f transitions of the Pr3+ ion. The scintillation decay times were from 2.07 to 3.12 mu s which are acceptable values for the scintillator.

To this goal, laminated composite samples with a distinct number of layers were bonded using ultrasonic consolidation. Then, tensile and biaxial hydraulic bulge tests at different strain rates and temperature conditions were conducted. The effect of the sample orientation on the mechanical response was also examined. Tensile and hydraulic bulge tests results were compared to observe differences in ultimate tensile strength and strain levels under uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. The effects of loading condition, strain rate, and temperature on the material response were analyzed and discussed on the basis of test results. In general, it was concluded that the maximum elongation values attained were higher for the samples subtracted along the sonotrode movement direction compared to those obtained from the normal to sonotrode movement direction. The elongation was obtained as high as 46% for seven bi-layered samples at high-temperature ranges of 200-300 degrees C. Hydraulic bulge test results showed that elongation improved as the number of bi-layers increased, yet the ultimate strength values did not change significantly indicating an expansion of the formability window.					kaya, irfan/U-7282-2019; CORA, Ömer/AAE-7136-2020; Koc, Muammer/A-3228-2015	CORA, Omer Necati/0000-0003-3564-5493; Koc, Muammer/0000-0001-6543-8116; kaya, irfan/0000-0002-0902-9999														1996-1944				OCT	2019	12	20							3402	10.3390/ma12203402	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma12203402								31627467					WOS:000498404200002

The Elevated-Temperature Strength Enhancement of a Low-Cost β Titanium Alloy Through Thermomechanically-Induced Phase Transformation	JOM												The effects of temperature and thermomechanical loading on the tensile strength and hardness were studied for a rolled, low-cost metastable beta titanium alloy, Ti-13Cr-1Fe-3Al (wt.%). Tensile tests were performed at temperatures between room temperature (RT) and 410 degrees C. The results indicated that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) decreased with increasing temperatures up to 300 degrees C. However, the UTS was 1400 MPa at 410 degrees C, which was approximately 150% higher than the RT UTS. It is believed that the formation of nanoscale omega and alpha precipitates, identified using transmission electron microscopy, hindered the dislocation motion, which resulted in the exceptionally high UTS at 410 degrees C. However, ductility was maintained, as the elongation-to-failure (epsilon(f)) was similar to 10% at 410 degrees C. Dynamic mechanical analysis suggested that phase transformations occurred between 370 degrees C-475 degrees C. To evaluate the effect of the phase transformations on the hardness, the as-received material was heat treated at 400 degrees C, 450 degrees C, and 500 degrees C for 2 h, which resulted in hardness values of approximately 340 Hv, 380 Hv, and 470 Hv, respectively. However, the greatest hardness value (500 Hv) was exhibited by the as-received material after it was tensile tested at 410 degrees C. This suggested that both temperature and loading history affected the phase transformations. As all the samples exhibited a ductile fracture mode, this work indicates that it is possible to maintain both high strength and adequate epsilon(f) for Ti-13Cr-1Fe-3Al (wt.%).

J	Khan, M; Zeng, Y; Boda, MA				Khan, Matiullah; Zeng, Yi; Boda, Muzaffar Ahmad			Step-wise transitions of electrons between valence and conduction bands: a tri-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> approach	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												The unwanted structural changes and isolated unoccupied states in the band structure of TiO2 due to doping could be minimized by proper selection of dopants. A good combination of dopants would improve the optical response in visible regime and remove the isolated states from the band gap while keeping minimum structural distortion. Enhanced visible light absorption and effective utilization of photo-generated carriers would improve the photoactivity of TiO2 under solar irradiations. Mono-doped, co-doped and tri-doped models of molybdenum (Mo), carbon (c), and nitrogen (N) are developed in the structure of anatase TiO2 and the corresponding change in the geometrical structure, band structure, and optical response is noted. The Mo and C co-doping produced least structure modification when compared to a reference TiO2 system. The Mo 3d states are mixed with Ti 3d states reducing the band gap of Mo-doped TiO2. While shifting the Fermi level to the middle of the band gap, the C 2p states are introduced around the middle of the gap of C doped TiO2. The impurity states are occupied and maximum reduction in the band gap is found in Mo, C codoped TiO2. The addition of N in the Mo, C codoped TiO2 modified the band structure by creating isolated states in the band gap. The photo-response of Mo, C, N tri-doped TiO2 is prominent among the simulated models attributed to the step wise transition of electrons by the C 2p and N 2p states. The improved optical response allows more visible photons for absorptions but the isolated states may annihilate it. The Mo, C codoped system provided minimum structure changes with clear band structure and reasonable visible light absorption.

J	Kim, B; Cho, S				Kim, Byunghyun; Cho, Soojin			Hyperspectral Super-Resolution Technique Using Histogram Matching and Endmember Optimization	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												In most hyperspectral super-resolution (HSR) methods, which are techniques used to improve the resolution of hyperspectral images (HSIs), the HSI and the target RGB image are assumed to have identical fields of view. However, because implementing these identical fields of view is difficult in practical applications, in this paper, we propose a HSR method that is applicable when an HSI and a target RGB image have different spatial information. The proposed HSR method first creates a low-resolution RGB image from a given HSI. Next, a histogram matching is performed on a high-resolution RGB image and a low-resolution RGB image obtained from an HSI. Finally, the proposed method optimizes endmember abundance of the high-resolution HSI towards the histogram-matched high-resolution RGB image. The entire procedure is evaluated using an open HSI dataset, the Harvard dataset, by adding spatial mismatch to the dataset. The spatial mismatch is implemented by shear transformation and cutting off the upper and left sides of the target RGB image. The proposed method achieved a lower error rate across the entire dataset, confirming its capability for super-resolution using images that have different fields of view.

Especially, the demand for thermally and chemically stable labeling paper that can be used in a high temperature environment above 300 degrees C and a strong acid and base atmosphere is increasing. In this study, a composite coating solution for the development of labeling paper with excellent thermal and chemical stability is prepared by mixing a silica inorganic binder and titanium dioxide. The silica inorganic binder is synthesized using a sol-gel process and mixed with titanium dioxide to improve whiteness at high-temperature. Adhesion between the polyimide substrate and the coating layer is secured and the surface properties of the coating layer, including the thermal and chemical stability, are investigated in detail. The effects of the coating solution dispersion on the surface properties of the coating layer are also analyzed.

The transistors' electrostatic was analyzed using a 3D TCAD simulation. We firstly optimized physical parameters such as channel radius and thickness. The NP-FETs for 3.5 nm node had better gate controllability due to smaller channel thickness and therefore showed an advantage in subthreshold swing (S.S.). However, parasitic resistance and capacitance, and low bias condition of scaled device lowered on-current level. These problems of smaller device were also related to limitation of RC-delay performance. Accordingly, the scaled device with optimized physical parameters showed similar to 1% decrease in delay performance compared to 5 nm node device. In order to improve RC-delay performance, trenched contact method and channel strain engineering method were separately applied for the same device. For each engineering technique, the on-current boosting was successful, showing similar to 14% faster RC-delay performance with strain engineering and similar to 18% faster RC-delay with trenched contact method.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6771	6775		10.1166/jnn.2019.17108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17108								31027027					WOS:000466046800127

Unlike an above-ground pipe, buried piping is exposed to a corrosion environment because of the water chemistry condition inside the pipe, and to mechanical damage, chemical damage, and heavy-load fatigue caused by the soil outside the pipe. If leakage occurs in buried piping, it is very difficult to find its cause and to repair it in a timely manner. In Korea, after the leakage has been identified, follow-up measures are implemented, such as temporary repair or maintenance. Therefore, the identification of potential damage, which is part of the integrity management of buried piping in soil and concrete, is fairly limited. Therefore, an effective buried-pipe aging management program that is applicable to Korean nuclear power plants and that includes the preventive management of damage is necessary. In this study, US regulation trends were identified through the regulatory requirements and the management documents of licensees to develop regulatory guidelines. Using these results, regulatory guidelines for buried and underground piping/tanks can be developed for the future in-service inspection and license renewal of Korean nuclear power plants.																			1225-7842	2287-402X				OCT	2019	39	5					292	299		10.7779/JKSNT.2019.39.5.292	http://dx.doi.org/10.7779/JKSNT.2019.39.5.292													WOS:000499681600005

Zener diode on poly silicon gate was normally used in power device because Zener diode structure was easy to merge with conditions of vertical structure without adding electrode. However, merged Zener diode can make unnecessary gate capacitance, and then switching characteristics are degraded by added capacitance. In this paper, a stacked punch-through diode (PT diode) with lower capacitance than Zener diode was designed for 900 V power MOSFET. The PT diode was consisted on doped polysilicon gate between the gate pad and the source pad. The electrical characteristics of this device was designed and analyzed by TCAD simulation and experiments. On the basis of this analysis, the stacked PT diode for ESD protection was optimized and compared with conventional Zener diode.

When the level of gate voltage is low, the tunneling width of the TFETs is large. Thus, electrons move via the trap instead of tunneling directly. On the other hand, when the level of gate voltage is high, the tunneling width of the TFETs becomes narrow. Thus, when the gate voltage is low, the noise level of TFETs is high because electrons pass through the trap. However, when the gate voltage is high, electrons pass directly from valence band of source to conduction band of drain, so the noise level is low. Finding the voltage suitable for this TFET is important to determine the optimum conditions for generating BTBT when measuring TFETs and to reduce noise.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6083	6086		10.1166/jnn.2019.16989	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.16989								31026912					WOS:000466046800015

The switching-off process of SF6 arc discharges occurs at the region between the contacts during the opening sequence to interrupt the flow of excessive current in a faulty network. The arc is tolerated in a controlled manner until a natural current zero when the arc discharge is rapidly quenched to restrict the thermal and dielectric reignition to the interruption. An SF6 self-blast switching chamber combines two advantages of blowing by heat expansion of the SF6 and arc rotation by electromagnetic effect of coil to improve the switching performance on thermal and dielectric reignition. The thermal and aerodynamic behaviors of an SF6 rotating switching arc in the chamber physically are complex and difficult to understand only by measurement due to their three-dimensional effects. Since the late nineteen-eighties, significant progress has been made in the method of computational fluid dynamics describing the physical processes occurring in the switching arc. The final goal of computer simulation technology on the arc switching is to predict the switching phenomena on the thermal and dielectric reignition from an engineering point of view. In this paper, we have conducted quasi-three dimensional computations to predict the thermal and dielectric reignition of SF6 rotating arcs occurring after a current zero in the self-blast switching chamber. Through the complete work, the microscopic thermal and aerodynamic behaviors of the remnant arc column after a current zero should be good criteria to predict the thermal and dielectric reignition of the rotating switching arc in the chamber.

The critical current density and flux pinning force of MgB2 were enhanced by coumarin doping. Among the all MgB2 samples, the highest critical current density value was achieved to be 1 x 10(5) A cm(-2) in the self field at 5 K.

Compared to conventional lateral FET devices, VFETs can increase the gate area effectively while minimizing the loss of layout area due to their structural characteristics. Considering VFET devices below 5 nm node, an expansion of the gate area of the device reduces the influence of WFV. However, the effect of GV is exacerbated by weakening gate controllability. In order to analyze the exact variability issues, it is necessary to consider not only the influence by the WFV but also the influence by the GV.

MTBS test beams (1.0x1.0 mm) were prepared from human superficial and deep dentin, which was bonded with a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond) and hybrid composite resin (Clearfil AP-X), with or without flowable lining (Clearfil Majesty ES-Flow). We tested 4 groups according to placement technique (with vs. without flowable liner) and dentin (superficial vs. deep) locations. Cross-sectional 2D images of the bonded interface were obtained before and after the MTBS test. Internal dentin fracture after MTBT was observed as a bright zone in SS-OCT. Flowable lining significantly reduced internal fracture formation in dentin (p<0.05). Dentin location significantly influenced MTBS (p<0.05), and this was reduced by flowable lining usage.

A systematic study of the temperature-dependent magnetization data revealed distinct magnetic anomalies: one was partially-disordered antiferromagnetic (PDAF) at T-N1 similar to 74 K and the second was a completely frozen state of PDAF at T-N2 similar to 18 K. Isothermal sweeping field, and field-cooling induced alteration of the PDAF state are responsible for the anomalous magnetic hysteresis loop in the vicinity of T-N2. Isothermal field-cooling caused significant vertical magnetization shift in the M-H loop is possibly related to the exchange bias like phenomena with field-cooled induced soft ferromagnetic phase in the PDAF phase and also attributed to the frozen state of partially disordered antiferromagnetism. This spin pinning mechanism is stable and robust against the sweeping field cycle, field-cooling and isothermal field-sweeping.

In this paper we point out similar oscillatory effects in Stoner susceptibility which makes the system to oscillate between paramagnetic phase and ferromagnetic phase alternatively as a function of external magnetic field strength. This effect can happen in a material which is tuned near to its magnetic instability. We suggest an experimental set-up to observe this effect.

Post-annealing of titanium coating leads to specific surface characteristics or enhanced mechanical properties. Microstructure characteristics such as grain size, density, morphology, and crystal structure of the coating layer can be changed by post-annealing conditions. These variations affect the structural and functional properties of titanium coating. In this study, titanium coatings measuring 1 mu m in thickness were deposited on a silicon wafer via direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering and the coatings were conducted via post-annealing at different temperatures ranging from 350 degrees C to 800 degrees C. The fabricated specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The mechanical properties were measured via nano-indentation and scanning acoustic microscopy. The mechanical properties of the titanium coatings fabricated at different post-annealing temperatures were evaluated by analyzing the relationships between microstructure and mechanical properties.

The stained specimens were divided into four groups (n=10); without application (Control group), Shield Force plus (SF group), UltraEz (UE group) and Teeth Mate AP paste (TM group) applied before bleaching. Each group was bleached by an in-office bleaching agent. The CIE L*a*b* values were measured by a colorimeter before and after ten consecutive bleaching treatments and the color difference (Delta E) was calculated. There was no statistical difference among Delta E values of Control, UE, and TM groups (p>0.05). There was a significant difference between SF and Control groups (p<0.001). It was concluded that application of TM and UE did not affect the change of tooth shade while SF application impeded the bleaching effect.

The optical characteristics of the fabricated tapered G-SPPWs were experimentally measured and compared with simulation results. The proposed tapered structure can improve tunneling efficiency by reducing insertion loss of the tapered G-SPPWs. The insertion losses of the straight G-SPPW with an 8-mu m gap length and a 2-mu m SPPW width and the tapered G-SPPW with an 8-mu m gap length, a 2-mu m SPPW width, a 6-mu m taper width, and a 3-mu m taper length were measured to be similar to 1.03 and similar to 0.74 dB, respectively.

In this study, we will experimentally verify the effectiveness of the selection of anomalies by the metal magnetic memory method. For this purpose, a comparative experiment with the metal magnetic memory method, phased array ultrasonic inspection, and videoscope inspection was performed on the tube panel specimens obtained at a domestic power plant.

The effect of Al on the morphology and luminescence properties of ZnO crystals was investigated. The spherical shaped ZnO nanocrystals with the sizes of 150-230 nm were formed at 800 degrees C. As the growth temperature increased from 800 to 900 and 1000 degrees C, the morphology of ZnO micro/nanocrystals was changed to belt and plate shape, which indicated that the vertical growth of the crystals was suppressed with the growth temperature. The belt-like crystals had widths of 80-500 nm and lengths of several to several tens of micrometers. The plate-like crystals had widths ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 mu m. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that the ZnO had hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure. A strong ultraviolet emission centered at 380 nm was observed in the cathodoluminescence spectra of all the as-synthesized ZnO crystals. (C) 2019 The Ceramic Society of Japan.

RTA, which is widely used in highly integrated short-channel silicon device manufacturing processes, deteriorates the electrical characteristics of SOI pseudo metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOS-FET) by affecting the interfacial properties between the top silicon and buried oxide layers. In order to replenish these interfacial properties, microwave annealing (MWA) was performed on the device under various conditions. Because MWA utilizes the direct energy transfer (DET) method, the RTA-induced thermal damage on the back interface was effectively removed despite a short processing time. The improvement was comparable to that of conventional thermal annealing at a higher temperature for a long period of time. Therefore, MWA is expected to be a very effective post-RTA heat-treatment technology for fabricating ultrathin-body SOI MOSFETs because of its low thermal budget.

Screwed micro fluidic connections fabricated by ultrasonic hot embossing and welding	MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS												Recent connection methods to micro fluidic chips, such as gluing tubes and hoses into orifices or pressing a gasket on them have been studied to improve the common problem to establish a connection of the macroscopic world to a fluidic micro system. In this study, micro fluidic chips from polycarbonate plates with screwed connections have been fabricated by ultrasonic hot embossing and welding, both as in plain and out of plain arrangements. To fabricate threads in the polymer plates, an M3 screw was ultrasonically welded into a hole in the chip and the screw was turned out after the process. The tightness of micro channels and fittings was proven by pumping ink and yeast cells through the micro channels and by applying air pressure of up to 700 kPa, respectively. The process introduced here is especially advantageous because sealing micro channels and welding in micro fluidic screwed connections is done in a single fabrication step.

In this study, environmentally friendly yellow aqueous ceramic ink is synthesized by mixture of distilled water, yellow ceramic pigment and additives for ink jet printing. The graft polymer, which combines electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance mechanism, is used as a surfactant for dispersion stability of aqueous ceramic ink. Synthesized ceramic ink with graft polymer surfactant shows better dispersion stability than did ceramic ink with PAA surfactant; synthesized ink also shows desirable ink-jet printability with the formation of a single ink droplet during printability test. Finally, ceramic ink printed on glass substrate and ceramic ink with graft polymer surfactant shows a high contact angle without surface treatment on glass substrate. Consequently, it is confirmed that the ceramic ink with graft polymer surfactant can achieve high printing resolution without additional surface treatment process.

Thiol compounds encapsulated inside nanotubes in vacuum drastically change the electric properties of SWNTs by a charge transfer between the two species. The simplicity of the synthetic process offers a viable route for large-scale production of SWNTs with controlled doping states by using mat-type SWNTs. Optical characterization (Raman and near-infrared spectrum) and electric property (conductivity) reveals that a charge transfer between the SWNTs and compounds occurs through the difference in the ionization energy and electron affinity. We confirm an electron density change in SWNTs through optical spectroscopy and conductivity measurement in vacuum.

The polarized charges in the ferroelectric HfO2 spacer induced by program/erase pulse modulate the tunneling barrier between the source and channel; thus, change the threshold voltage (V-t) of TFET.

We report on the performance of membrane- and mediator-free enzymatic glucose biofuel cells (BFCs) fabricated in a sandwiched, patch geometry with carbon nanotube nanopaper bio-electrodes prepared using a compression technique to immobilize the enzymes. A gel electrolyte comprised of agar mixed with glucose is sandwiched between the two bio-electrodes to form a patch. Power densities up to 111.90 mu W/cm(2) at a current density of 334.50 mu A/cm(2) at a voltage of 0.335 V were obtained for a typical single cell BFC of this design. The sandwich BFC also showed good stability with a half-life of about 1.5 days under continuous operation. The relatively high power density for this new design is attributed to the compression-induced immobilization of the enzymes by the nanotubes as indicated by scanning electron microscope images. This compression-induced immobilization of enzymes provides improved direct electron transfer at the carbon nanotube electrodes.

The stiffening or softening of nanomaterials determined by a quantitative model	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												A quantitative model for the size-dependent Young's modulus Y(D) of nanomaterials is established in this work by considering the modulus of single bond and bond number in nanomaterials. Due to bond relaxation, the single bond strength and it's elastic modulus are enhanced as size drops, while bond number is decreased. This makes the Young's moduli of nanomaterials possess different change with size. If compared with bulk Young's modulus Y-0, both the stiffer with Y(D) > Y-0 and the softer with Y(D) < Y-0 for different nanomaterials are predicted.

The results showed that the copper grains and ferrite grains of steel in CCS wires are elongated along the drawing direction and transformed to fiber microstructure. The microstructure of copper and steel in CCS wires experiences recovery, recrystallization and grain growth after annealing treatment. The elongated copper grains and ferrite grains of steel gradually transformed to equiaxed grains and the grain sizes increased with annealing temperature increasing. With the increase of deformation amounts, the misorientation angle of copper and steel changes from large angle to small angle and the texture variation of copper is not obvious, which is inconsistent with the texture change of pure copper wire. However, the texture variation of steel is consistent with that of a single steel wire, mainly the fiber texture in the direction of <110>. With the annealing temperatures increase, the misorientation angle of copper and steel changes from small angle to large angle. The variation of texture with annealing temperature is similar to that of single copper and steel wires. For copper, when annealing temperature is less than 850 degrees C, the intensity fluctuation of texture is not very obvious. The <111>-<211> texture becomes diffused. However, when annealing temperature is more than 850 degrees C, the texture included a number of strong <111> annealing texture and a few of weak <110>. annealing texture.

In this study, a NFC-based foam material was prepared with the goal of controlling its pore structure and physical properties by adding amylopectin. Information of the foam such as the shape, size, number and distribution of pores was obtained. The effects of amylopectin content, solid content and freeze-drying temperature on the microstructure and mechanical stability as well as heat transfer performance of the foam were investigated. The foam material obtained at 30% to 50% amylopectin content featured a 'reinforced concrete structure' with NFC and amylopectin. With the increase of amylopectin content, the pore wall of the foam material gradually formed due to the NFC wrapped by amylopectin, and the pore size increased whereas the number of pores decreased. However, when the amylopectin content reached a high level, the pore size of the foam dwindled, thus the compressive strength and thermal conductivity of the foam were enhanced. The foam material had uniform pore distribution and pore size when prepared with a lower freezing temperature and solid content. Yet when the freezing temperature was very low (-196 degrees C), a closed pore structure appeared.																			1038-6807					OCT-DEC	2019	72	4					182	196																WOS:000606535300002

In most clinical studies, bone density is used as a gold standard in predicting insertion torque. By contrast, trabecular microstructure is ignored. In this study, a microstructure-based numerical computational method with high accuracy and efficiency for the insertion torque of dental implant was proposed by introducing two microscopic variables, namely, volume fraction and fabric tensor. First, two kinds of 3D microstructural solid models with same volume fraction and fabric tensor were established on the basis of the microstructural topology of six reference specimens. Second, a new numerical simulation method based on homogenous theory was used to explore the material models of these 3D microstructural solid models at the microscopic scale. Then, the anisotropic material models of specimens were developed on the basis of the mixture rule. Thereafter, a numerical simulation based on the anisotropic finite element (FE) model was carried out to acquire the insertion torque. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the simulation based on the anisotropic FE model, numerical simulations based on isotropic FE model and micro-computer tomography (micro-CT) FE models were also implemented as comparisons. Comparison of the simulated peak insertion torques of the anisotropic, isotropic, and micro-CT FE models with insertion experiments demonstrated the feasibility and potential of the proposed method. The anisotropic FE model reduced the time consumption by 91.85% and enhanced the accuracy by 11.82% compared with the micro-CT and isotropic FE models, respectively.

Meanwhile, it also has good self-lubricating properties due to the presence of molybdenum disulfide phase inside the material and can be used as friction pair material in the pump. In this paper, the hardness, microstructure, distribution of the self-lubricating phase, friction and wear properties of 1Cr13MoS after heat treatment were studied. After quenching at 1000 degrees C and tempering at 520 degrees C, the hardness of 1Cr13MoS prepared by pyrometallurgy is higher than that of HB 350. The tempering sorbite structure is evenly distributed, and the self-lubricating phase MoS2 is discretely distributed on the substrate with the average size is about 6 mu m, which leads to good friction and wear properties. It is worth noting that the 1Cr13MoS is actually operated as friction pair material on the water pump and has a significant wear improvement effect compared to the conventional 12% chrome steel series.					li, lishaolong/JTV-0939-2023; Song, Jianxun/JHT-2896-2023	Song, Jianxun/0000-0002-6609-1537														1996-1944				OCT	2019	12	19							3171	10.3390/ma12193171	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma12193171								31569744					WOS:000493308500120
J	Li, YL; Chen, J				Li, Yanlei; Chen, Jian			Effect of interaction between impurity elements on silicon purification during Al-Si solvent refining	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												Al-Si solvent refining is a promising method to purify silicon. Boron and phosphorus are key impurity elements during the purifying process. The common raw materials for Al-Si solvent refining are metallurgical grade silicon and industrial aluminum. There are many impurity elements except boron and phosphorus in the metallurgical grade silicon and the industrial aluminum. The effect of these impurity elements on boron and phosphorus removal during Al-Si solvent refining is studied in this work. The hypereutectic Al-Si melts with these impurity elements were solidified, and the hypereutectic Al-Si melts without these impurity elements were solidified at the same cooling rate. Boron and phosphorus contents in purified silicon are determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). It is found that when silicon ratio increases from 20% to 70% in samples without other impurity elements, boron removal rates decrease from 0.4 to 0.3, and phosphorus removal rates decrease from 0.96 to 0.92. When silicon ratio increases from 20% to 40% in samples with other element impurities, boron removal rates decrease from 0.87 to 0.57, and phosphorus removal rates increase from 0.63 to 0.9. The different removal rates between samples with and without other impurity elements are attributed to the interaction between impurity elements. In addition, boron-containing intermediate compound forms and locates in the Al-Si matrix, while phosphorus-containing intermediate compound forms and locates in the primary silicon phase.																			2053-1591					OCT	2019	6	10							1065d7	10.1088/2053-1591/ab3fdb	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab3fdb													WOS:000487708000001

Four surfactants were prepared to modify the glassy carbon electrode, including a cationic surfactant (CTAB), an anionic surfactant (SDBS) and two nonionic surfactants (Tween 80, OP-10). Each modified electrode was applied to detect the p-nitrophenol in sodium acetate buffer solution, and the reduction peak current and reduction peak potential of p-nitrophenol were measured by linear sweep voltammetry under different concentrations of each surfactant. The results show that the cationic surfactant reduced the peak current, reaching the optimal effect at the concentration of 2.95 x10-4 mol/L; the anionic surfactant and nonionic surfactants reduced the peak current, and the reduction effect depends on the micelle effect of the surfactants and other factors; the cationic surfactant suppressed the reduction peak potential at concentrations of 0 similar to 2 x10-4 mol/L, while the other three surfactants cannot reduce the reduction peak potential; the CTAB was proved as the most sensitive material for detecting p-nitrophenol on electrode surface. This research provides a valuable reference for the design of p-nitrophenol sensors.																			0151-9107	1958-5934				OCT	2019	43	5					335	340		10.18280/acsm.430509	http://dx.doi.org/10.18280/acsm.430509													WOS:000499143000009

This paper focuses on central processing unit (CPU)/motherboard interfaces and studies several factors that are believed to have a great impact on TH performance. They include: Enabling load, surface finish quality, and contacting area. Test vehicles (TVs) of Clarkdale package and of Ibex peak motherboard were designed to measure low level contact resistance (LLCR) for catching any failure. Several sets of design of experiments (DOE) were conducted on 85 degrees C/85% relative humidity and test results were analyzed. A proposal that correlates asperity spots and contact tip design with contact resistance was proposed and thus a cost-effective solution for improving electrical performance under TH was deduced.

Both the ceramics exhibit dense microstructures. Compared to the ceramics sintered at 0.5 degrees C/min, those sintered at 9 degrees C/min have smaller grains. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive spectrum reveal that the ceramics exhibit two phases, i.e., BNBTZ phase with perovskite structure and ZnO phase. The movement of the peak position implies enlargement of the crystallite lattice due to the entrance of Zn2+ ions into the lattice.

The results show that the post-yield softening is observed due to the disentanglement of molecular chains, after the stress approaches the yield peak, and a localized temperature rise is induced by the friction between molecular chains; with the progressive increasing of load, the strain hardening occurs due to the preferred orientation of molecular chains in the direction of stretching, which induces the stress and temperature rise increase. In the meantime, it is found that both the yield peak and localized temperature rise are increased significantly with the increase of strain rates; however, the competition exists between the strain softening induced by the dissipation heat generation and the strain hardening, making the sensitivity of localized plastic flow on the strain rate decreased. Based on the finite element software ABAQUS, the finite element model of a plate specimen was established to study the thermo-mechanically coupled behavior on the tensile deformation of SMPU. By comparing the contours of plastic strain field with that of temperature field at different moments, it is found that the forming of the localized plastic flow and temperature rise start from the initial defect and gradually move towards the middle and the expand to the entire sample, simultaneously. Furthermore, the simulated average temperature rise curves at different loading rates are in good agreement with the experimental ones.

However, commercialization of the trivalent chromium method has been hindered because the resulting chromium films exhibit inferior mechanical properties compared to hexavalent chromium coated film. In this study, we enhanced the properties of trivalent chromium electroplated film using a pulse-reverse (PR) method. Firstly, the cathodic current density needed to produce a shiny surface was optimized using direct current (DC) electroplating. After optimizing the cathodic current density, the appropriate anodic current density for PR electroplating needed to achieve optimum crack density and corrosion resistance was investigated. The chromium coating prepared using PR electroplating exhibited higher corrosion resistance than that prepared by DC electroplating, because it suppressed crack formation. Concerning the electrochemical corrosion behavior in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, the optimized sample (PR2) electroplated at an anodic current density of 0.04 A cm(-2) showed a corrosion potential shift of 129.9 mV to the anodic direction, and an increase in electrochemical corrosion resistance which was bigger than the chromium film prepared using DC electroplating. This optimization of electrochemical variables opens a new way to obtain improved electrodeposited film with low crack density and high corrosion resistance.																			1738-8228					OCT	2019	57	10					641	647		10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.10.641	http://dx.doi.org/10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.10.641													WOS:000489226600004

Both growth rates and Al/N ratios affect crystal qualities of AlN films. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of (10 (1) over bar5) X-ray rocking curves (XRCs) change from 0.22 to 0.31 degrees with changing of the Al/N ratios, but the curves of (0002) XRCs change from 0.04 to 0.45 degrees with changing of the Al/N ratios. This means that structural deformation due to dislocations is slightly affected by the Al/N ratio in the (10 (1) over bar5) XRCs but affected strongly for the (0002) XRCs. From the viewpoint of growth rate, the AlN films with high growth rate (HGR) show better crystal quality than the low growth rate (LGR) films overall, as shown by the FWHM values of the (0002) and (10 (1) over bar5) XRCs. Based on cross-sectional transmission electron microscope observation, the HGR sample with an Al/N ratio of 3.1 shows more edge dislocations than there are screw and mixed dislocations in the LGR sample with Al/N ratio of 3.5.																			1225-0562	2287-7258				OCT	2019	29	10					579	585		10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.579	http://dx.doi.org/10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.579													WOS:000500930400001

Substitutions of (SiO4)(4-) ions with (GeO4)(4-) in Ca-4(La4Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 ceramic increased its densification temperature and thus led to a significant grain growth; however, replacement of Ca2+ and (PO4)(3-) ions by Mg2+ ions and (VO4)(3-) ions, respectively, decreased its densification temperature and resulted in grain refinement. Various rare-earth-metal and (WO4)(2-) ion substitutions on La3+ and Pr3+ and (PO4)(3-) sites, respectively, of Ca-4(La4Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 ceramic had no impact on the sintering temperature. In the case of Ca-4(La4Pr2)(SiO4)(4)(PO4)(2)O-2 apatite with Mg2+ and (WO4)(2-) ion substitutions, second phases were observed in the x-ray diffraction patterns; however, only the pure hexagonal apatite phase with space group P6(3)/m was visible in all the other systems.

Under the high voltage conditions, a high energy impulse causes breakdown discharge resulting in test equipment failure. In this article, several unique types of LC and RC filtering circuit models are proposed to protect the nonlinear dielectric conductivity measurement system. Simulation of the proposed design models are carried out using "MATLAB Simulink". The simulation results revealed that all LC and RC filtering circuit models have a protective function for the test equipment, and can buffer the voltage-raising amplitude. By comparison, it is observed that the LC filtering circuit model has a better buffer-function than RC filtering circuit model. The LC filtering circuit can make the voltage-output curve more lenitive, and significantly increase the safety of measurement system. In addition, the comparison of single LC/RC and pi LC/RC filtering circuit models show that the pi LC/RC filtering circuit model has a better buffer function. Furthermore, in the high electric-field breakdown the pi LC/RC model can make a less steeper voltage-output curve. The filtering principles of these kinds of filtering circuit models were discussed, and the correctness of simulation results were validated by experiments. (c) 2019 Author(s).

J	Liu, JF; Dai, JF; Zhu, XJ; Sun, XY				Liu Jifei; Dai Jianfeng; Zhu Xiaojun; Sun Xiangyang			Electrochemical Performance of Flexible and Free-standing NiO Carbon Composite Nanofiber as Negative Electrodes	RARE METAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING												The key to solving pulverization and stripping from collector caused by volume expansion of high performance electrode lies in the preparation of flexible electrode, which has excellent interface structure and electron/ion mass transfer capacity. A unique process has been used to prepare high-performance transition metal oxide (nickel oxide) coupled carbon fiber mat flexible electrode, which can be directly applied for lithium-ion battery assembly. Due to the high theoretical specific capacitance of nickel oxide, unique low dimensional characteristics and large draw ratios for internal stress dispersion of carbon fiber mat, NiO carbon nanofiber (NiO-CNF) delivers excellent cyclic characteristic and better rate electrochemical performance, which is simultaneously much higher than NiO nanofiber (NiO NF) without carbon. NiO-CNF and NiO NF have reversible capacities of 418 mAh.g(-1) and 242 mA.g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C, respectively. These electrochemical properties can be attributed to diffusion kinetics and external stress buffering provided by the cross-linked structures.																			1875-5372					OCT	2019	48	10					3366	3371																WOS:000494079600045

In this work, chalcogenide glassy and glass-ceramic samples with compositions of 40GeSe(2)-(30-x)Ga2Se3-xSb(2)Se(3)-30NaI (x=0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10) were prepared and characterized through various techniques. The maximum room-temperature sodium-ion conductivity is obtained to be 1.27x10(-6) S/cm for 40GeSe(2)-30Ga(2)Se(3)-30NaI sample. The compositional dependence of structural evolution is studied by Raman spectra. The correlation between sodium-ion conduction property and structure is discussed, which would provide further understanding for the structural effect on sodium-ion conduction properties of chalcogenide glasses.

The alloys were prepared according to the 3-level L9 Taguchi orthogonal table. The signal-to-noise ratios and analysis of variance were used to determine the optimal composition. The microstructures of the Mg-Y-Zn-Al alloys were investigated using an optical microscope, an x-ray diffractometer, a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersion spectra. The optimal composition of theMg-Y-Zn-Al alloys is 1.2 at% Y content, 0.75 Y/Zn mole ratio and 0.9 wt% Al-5Ti-1B content which corresponds to Mg-4.1Y-4.1Zn-0.9(Al-5Ti-1B) (wt%) with the best mechanical properties. The ultimate tensile strength and elongation of Mg-4.1Y-4.1Zn-0.9(Al-5Ti-1B) (wt%) are 195.35 MPa and 9.45, respectively. The Y content had the largest impact on the ultimate tensile strength and the significant factor that influencing elongation is the Al-5Ti-1B content. Alloys were mainly composed of alpha-Mg, X phase, Mg4Y2ZnAl3, TiB2 and Al2Y. The TiB2 and Al2Y, which are formed by the addition of Al-5Ti-1B, can act as heterogeneous nucleation to refine alpha-Mg grains. The excellent properties of the alloy could be attributed to fine-grain strengthening and second phase strengthening caused by a large amount of X phase and Mg4Y2ZnAl3 discontinuously distributed at the grain boundaries.

The current study reports basic principles of chemical enhancement with aluminium sulphate coagulant in biofilm-MBR (Bf-MBR) based on results of total recycle tests performed at different dosages of the chemical enhancer and properties characterization of filtrates, supernatants and sediments. It demonstrates a possibility to achieve lower membrane fouling rates with dosing of aluminium sulphate coagulant into MBBR and IFAS mixed liquors by extending operational cycles by 20 and 80 time respectively as well as increasing operating permeability of membrane separation by 1.3 times for IFAS. It has been found that charge neutralization is the dominating mechanism of aluminium sulphate action as a chemical enhancer in Bf-MBR, however, properties of the membrane surface influencing charge repulsion of foulants should be considered together with the secondary ability of the coagulant to improve consolidation of sediments.

Comparative experimental study of the mechanical and fracture properties of Portland limestone and Corsehill sandstone	FRATTURA ED INTEGRITA STRUTTURALE-FRACTURE AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY												An experimental investigation of the mechanical and fracture characteristics of Portland limestone and Corsehill sandstone is undertaken, aiming at enhancing understanding of the structural behaviour of these natural building stones commonly used in both new and restoration projects in Edinburgh, Scotland. A series of three-point bending and four-point bending tests on appropriately cut prismatic samples, in the presence of U-shape notches, were performed and results were interpreted following the concepts of crack mouth opening displacement and fracture energy. The critical crack opening displacement could be further investigated as a fracture criterion, independently of the method used for its determination. At a second stage, the effect of specimen shape and size on flexural strength, deflection at mid-span, crack mouth opening displacement and fracture energy was studied for Portland limestone. Despite the scattering of results, trends observed comprise (a) the negative correlation between the flexural strength of Portland limestone and the specimen span length and (b) the positive correlation between fracture energy and specimen size. Conclusions drawn are in good agreement with similar ones for other quasi-brittle materials and contribute to the assessment of the fracture behaviour of full size structural members that are often beyond the range of possible failure testing.																				1971-8993				OCT	2019		50					438	450		10.3221/IGF-ESIS.50.37	http://dx.doi.org/10.3221/IGF-ESIS.50.37													WOS:000487286700037

Namely, based on the method of reflected and transmitted caustics, the conditions for the development of double initial and contact caustic curves are established as functions of six independent parameters, while easy-to-use closed-form expressions are given for obtaining the contact length. An experimental protocol is then implemented in the case a. thin cylindrical transparent disc is compressed between the jaws of the International Society for Rock Mechanics suggested device for the execution of the Brazilian-disc test. The experimental method of caustics can provide the contact length quite accurately, even in the case of double curves which seem that are not always a consequence of a wide contact region.																				1971-8993				OCT	2019		50					451	470		10.3221/IGF-ESIS.50.38	http://dx.doi.org/10.3221/IGF-ESIS.50.38													WOS:000487286700038

This treatment is currently carried out empirically in the fields, and leads to variability in the color, (micro)structure and intrinsic properties (thermal properties) of hemp fibers. The present study aims to compare unretted and retted hemp fibres harvested at the end of flowering. The results show that retting induces a change in the color of fibres from light green to dark gray due to the activity of the microbial community at the stem surface. A separation of the fibre bundles into elementary fibres occurs with the degradation of the cementing compounds present in the middle lamella. The cellulose and its crystallinity degree increased from 68 to 75 % and 85 to 89 %, respectively, with a removal of non-cellulosic materials, which leads to an improvement of the thermal stability for the retted fibres.

Optical characterization of curved silicon PV modules with dichroic polymeric films	SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS												Non-traditional photovoltaic (PV) modules, such as solar shingles, facades and skins, are expected to increase in market share as the solar industry matures and moves to fill building integrated photovoltaics niches. The advent of building integration and the application of photovoltaics to multiple surfaces come with fabrication challenges and inherent geometrical, optical and thermal constraints. In this paper, we investigate the curved lamination process and the integration of a dichroic polymeric film within the laminate for the particular case of a large-scale optical collector called a "PVMirror". PVMirror is a concentrating solar power (CSP)/PV hybrid design that combines the high efficiency of PV and storage capability of CSP using a dichroic film. The film does not degrade upon lamination and exhibits good adhesion to encapsulants. Multiple lamination approaches, such as tuning the thickness of the encapsulant, are shown to significantly reduce the impact of the lamination process on the shape error of PVMirror modules, which could also be applied to the fabrication of other non-traditional PV modules.

J	Min, J; Kang, S				Min, Junki; Kang, Seunggu			Soaking Properties of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Slag-Based-Geopolymers and Their Nanometer-Scale Microstructures	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												In this study, non-foamed and foamed geopolymers based on IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) slag were prepared and their water resistance properties were examined in an immersion test in order to assess their suitability for water applications such as bridge pier, seawall, tetrapod. Particularly, the immersion characteristics were investigated according to the aging time at room temperature during the production process of the geopolymer. The pH changes of the immersion liquid were analyzed considering the immersion time, and the microstructural changes on the nanometer level of the surface of the geopolymer were observed before and after the immersion. Various shapes of crystals of the zeolite phase formed in the geopolymers prepared in this study, such as needle-like crystals with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 40 nm and lengths of 200 to 300 nm, and plate-shaped crystals overlapped with each other, which is thought to be due to the uneven composition of the slag used as a raw material or to local compositional changes of the alkali activator. By measuring the pH of immersion liquid, the following facts can be seen: foamed geopolymers synthesized from IGCC slag require a room-temperature curing period of at least 7 days, whereas non-foamed specimens require a room-temperature curing period of at least 28 days to consume alkaline activators. This is due to the increase in the specific surface area of the foamed specimen as the specimen is expanded, which thereby increases the contact area between the alkali activator and the slag. The foamed specimens, however, produced larger cracks and pores when immersed in water, while a smaller cracks and pores occurred in the non-foamed specimens.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6309	6315		10.1166/jnn.2019.17046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17046								31026953					WOS:000466046800056

Eight sample types were fabricated with various Cu opening sizes and solder pastes. The Cu opening sizes of the component and substrate were 200 mu m or 380 mu m, respectively, and the component formed a Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (SAC305) solder bump which was placed on the Sn-58Bi solder paste or epoxy Sn-58Bi solder paste printed on the substrate and then reflowed. The microstructures of the solder joints were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the chemical compositions were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron probe X-ray micro-analyzer (EPMA). Epoxy was formed around the solder joints after the reflow process, improving the bonding strength of the epoxy-contained solder joints. Specifically, the bonding strength of the epoxy Sn-58Bi solder joints increased about 2.9 times in the 200 mu m (opening size of component)/380 mu m (opening size of substrate) sample. When the opening size of the component and substrate differed, a fracture occurred at the smaller opening size. On the other hand, a fracture occurred at the substrate side for the SAC305 (solder paste of component)/Sn-58Bi (solder paste of substrate) solder joints, while a fracture occurred at the interface between SAC305 and Sn-58Bi at the SAC305/epoxy Sn-58Bi solder joints for samples with the same opening size between the component and substrate.					kim, nayoung/IWV-4038-2023														1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6437	6443		10.1166/jnn.2019.17063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17063								31026974					WOS:000466046800077
J	Miodowska, J; Bielski, J				Miodowska, Justyna; Bielski, Jan			The Influence of Loading Program on the Stimulated Callus Mineralization	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												The aim of this work is to describe the change of physical properties of the callus material with the use of the proposed mathematical model for callus remodeling. Callus tissue can be considered as a biomaterial where it's properties change over time due to the stimulated healing process. The proposed model is based on the mechanical stimulus theory. It is used to estimate the stress-stimulated change in the callus, Young's modulus, and the density in the case of a mandible fracture. Three healing loading programs are discussed and compared: optimal, intermittent, and intermittent with residual load. Here, the optimal loading program is understood as the in-time change of stimulating loads, which results in the shortest necessary healing time and, simultaneously, in the most uniform distribution of material density in the analyzed domain. The necessary healing time is a period after which the callus density (and hence the Young's modulus) reaches the desired value. The results of the study suggest a significant difference in the value of the callus maximal density between all three analyzed loading programs for a given healing time interval. The highest values of the density are obtained using the optimal loading program, however, all three programs provide satisfactory density distributions. The analytical results are compared with the callus density estimation based on the computer tomography (CT) medical data.

Effect of low temperature annealing on the properties of nano Ni-Ti alloys	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												Binary 1:1 Ni-Ti alloy has been the work horse for many industrial and of late biomedical applications amongst all shape memory alloys. Apart from being employed for endovascular applications like stents and filters, they are also used as orthodontic braces and in endodontic tools. Ni-Ti drills and files are used in a few procedures with sterilization between uses. However, the effect of these sterilizing heat-treatments on the properties of the tools is not clearly investigated. In addition to this, satisfactory metallurgical explanations for the wear resistance of these alloys in absent in the literature. Therefore, this paper attempts to define the transformational temperatures for the Ni-Ti as-received and low temperature heat-treated conditions have been investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Attempts are made to justify their suitability for endodontic applications by evaluating their mechanical strength parameters using the Tensile and Wear tests. It was found that the samples showed did not show much variations in strength when subjected to tensile tests whereas the same was not observed for DSC tests. Ambient temperature x-ray diffraction studies indicate the presence of Austenitic and Martensitic phases in all the samples. DSC results are strongly affected by presence of internal stresses but stress-induced-martensitic forms in all the samples with equal facility.

During this process, nanobubbles are initially produced inside the silver chloride NPs, which immediately begin to move within the amorphous phase. Besides, silver atoms inside the silver chloride NPs start to migrate out the occupied volume leaving a space behind, which is filled by crystalline regions of silver chloride located between the pre-existing silver NPs. During the observation time, fast-nucleation, movement, growth, and fast-dissolution of silver NPs take place. Specific space correlation with silver mass loss (or gain) when a new NP is formed (or dissolved), was detected in different regions during the reaction.

The switching voltage increases from 4,874 to 5,494 V/cm when the doping content of Yb2O3 is less than 0.1 mol%, whereas further doping decreases this value. The ZVMN ceramic semiconductors doped with 0.1 mol% Yb2O3 reveal an excellent nonohmic coefficient as high as 70. The donor density of ZnO gain increases in the range of 2.46-7.41x10(17) cm(-3) with increasing doping content of Yb2O3 and the potential barrier height and surface state density at the grain boundaries exhibits a maximum value (1.25 eV) at 0.1 mol%. The dielectric constant (at 1 kHz) decreases from 592.7 to 501.4 until the doping content of Yb2O3 reaches 0.1 mol%, whereas further doping increases it. The value of tans increases from 0.209 to 0.268 with the doping content of Yb2O3.																			1225-0562	2287-7258				OCT	2019	29	10					586	591		10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.586	http://dx.doi.org/10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.586													WOS:000500930400002

J	Nasir, SU; Shahzad, A				Nasir, Sana Ullah; Shahzad, Asim			Effects of stabilization patterns on the static and fatigue behavior of glass fiber non-crimp fabric composites	JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS												Experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate static tensile and tension-tension fatigue response of unidirectional glass fiber non-crimp fabric composites subject to seven different stabilization patterns (two multiaxial and five uniaxial stabilizing yarns). The effect of stabilization patterns on non-crimp fabric is crucial as they produce different mesoscale bundle shapes and bundle volume fractions which may affect the static and fatigue properties of non-crimp fabric composites. The studies show that tensile modulus and fatigue life decline with increasing amount of uniaxial stabilizations. Different stabilizations with different bundle shapes influence the final composite properties through various factors than just the volume fraction. The multiaxial stabilizations with higher static tensile strength have shorter fatigue life as compared to uniaxial stabilizations with lower tensile strength. As the areal weight of stabilizing yarns increases, fatigue life decreases at all stress levels which show the deleterious effects of stabilizations on the fatigue behavior of composites. Areal weight and orientation of stabilizing yarns should be optimally selected for the anticipated performance of the non-crimp fabric composites.

It is a rare sulfate mineral. During the past, only the crystal structure of palmierite mineral was dealt with. In the present work, palmierite was synthesized by co-precipitation route and doped with cobalt at different molar concentrations. Powder x-Ray Diffraction studies were carried out to understand the crystalline nature and lattice distortion of the as-synthesized pure and doped samples. The materials were subjected to FTIR and Raman analysis to identify the functional groups present in it. The morphological studies were carried out. The room temperature PL spectra shows dominant emission peaks at 360 nm, 521 nm and 595 nm. The cobalt doped samples has high dielectric constant value of 12128 while the pure palmierite has the value of 10375 but both the samples have very low loss factor of 0.5 at low frequency region. The loss factor also shifted towards low frequency region on doping. The dielectric behaviour of palmierite has interesting outcome upon doping and the results were discussed.																				2053-1591				OCT	2019	6	10							104005	10.1088/2053-1591/ab39a5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab39a5													WOS:000482551300001

An Agarose-Curdlan Nanogel that Carries Etanercept to Target and Neutralises TNF-α Produced by Dectin-1-Expressing Immune Cells	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS												Etanercept (ETA) has been used as a drug to neutralise tumour necrotic factor alpha (TNF-alpha) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet there are limitations concerning its low specific drug targeting and side effects. In this study, agarose-curdlan encapsulating etanercept (ACE) gel was successfully formulated and evenly distributed as nano-particles of 30-100 nm diameter, exhibiting an ETA encapsulation efficiency of 73.8% and an ETA-releasing efficiency of 50% after 52 h. The number of dectin-1-overexpressing macrophage cells, RAW264.7, exposed to ACE that migrated in the Boyden chamber assay was equal to that exposed to either agarose-curdlan or curdlan nanogels, but substantially higher than those exposed to agarose gel and water-soluble ETA by 67 and 141 fold, respectively (p < 0.05), suggesting the targeting effect of curdlan on dectin-1. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the ETA released from the ACE nanogel could neutralise TNF-alpha secreted by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7. Moreover, at 24 h and 72 h, the released ETA showed 1.3- to 4.4-fold greater effectiveness, respectively, than water-soluble ETA. This study demonstrates that the ACE nanogel can attract immune cells and slowly release ETA to efficiently neutralise the TNF-alpha produced by these cells and, thus, could be a promising ETA carrier for targeted RA treatment.

The density functional theory was performed in the B3LYP/6-311 + + G(d,p) level on the dimer up to the octamer chains of oligo(EDOT) in the neutral and both ionic states. The extent of pi-conjugation length, lower HOMO-LUMO band gap, charge delocalization along backbone, and bathochromic shift in the UV-visible spectra for oligo(EDOT) showed that the ethylenedioxy substitution remarkably improved the poly(EDOT) characteristics. The temperature dependency of electrical conductivity and thermodynamic stability for oligo (EDOT) was studied in the temperature range of 50-400 K. The calculated conductivity for poly(EDOT) was compared with the available experimental measurements. More satisfactory properties were obtained in both the p- and n-doped phases, reflecting the electron and hole transport facilities for conductivity.																			0379-6779					OCT	2019	256								116118	10.1016/j.synthmet.2019.116118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.synthmet.2019.116118													WOS:000488143700015

Al has attracted attention as a reflector for high efficiency UV emitters because of its high reflectance in the UV region. To improve the efficiency of UV emitter, we generated periodic microhole arrays on the p-AlGaN layer, which serve as a scattering center in the flip chip structure and enhance the light extraction efficiency. The light output power of the fabricated flip chip-based UV emitter with ITO nano grains/Al reflector and microhole arrays on the p-AlGaN layer is significantly improved by 72% and 45% at an injection current of 20 mA, compared to that of UV emitter with only Al reflector and ITO nano grains/Al reflector.					lee, hyoju/M-1792-2017; Lee, Jong/D-8530-2011; Kim, Hyoun/AAH-2115-2020														1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6112	6118		10.1166/jnn.2019.17023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17023								31026918					WOS:000466046800021

New multilayer graphene-based flash memory	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												In the present work, it is proposed to use multilayer graphene (MLG) as a charge storage layer in the non-volatile memory based on the Si/ZrO2/MLG/SiO2/Si structure. The write/erase, retention characteristics and charge density kinetics in the MLG of the memory element are calculated. Due to the metallic properties of MLG and the blocking layer made of high-k dielectric, the voltage drop on them in the write/erase mode is decreased. At the same time, the increase in the voltage drop in the SiO2 tunneling layer grows, in its turn, the Fowler-Nordheim current, which leads to a higher memory element performance. The big work function for electrons (similar to 5 eV) in MLG contributes to a better charge storage in it. According to our calculations, for write/erase voltages of +/- 11 V, there is a 5V memory window, and the memory window value will be equal to 3 V in 10 years.

J	Ozbek, ASA; Weerheijm, J; van Breugel, K				Ozbek, Ayda Safak Agar; Weerheijm, Jaap; van Breugel, Klaas			Impact behavior of model porous concretes	MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES												In this work, findings of a numerical study performed to investigate the impact behavior of porous concrete, modeled as a four phase cementitious composite consisting of aggregates, cement paste, interfacial transition zones (ITZ) and air, are presented. The numerical analyses contributed to the process of designing a special type of concrete for safety purposes i.e. as a protective building material to be used in safety walls outside important buildings or munition magazines for storing explosives. In case of an explosion, large concrete fragments that are formed, cause a very important threat. Therefore, in the scope of a research project, designing a special type of concrete having sufficient strength, but fracturing into small fragments under impact loading was aimed. In the numerical analyses, model porous concretes, in which the amounts and properties of pores and aggregates could be varied individually, were used to see the sole effect of each parameter. According to the results, it was found that at constant total porosity, the impact strength increased with decreasing pore size while multiple fragmentation was observed. On the other hand, the impact strengths of porous concretes with different size aggregates (with constant total aggregate content and porosity) were approximately the same when no ITZ was defined. However, when ITZ was present, the impact strength was found to decrease as the aggregates were finer. This trend was also valid for the respective full concretes. Representative experimental results of porous concretes were also presented in order to support the numerical results.

Based on present experiment and calculated surface energies, firstly, it has confirmed that F-terminated FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface (FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002)-F) is more stable than FeF-terminated FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface (FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002)FeF) when Delta mu F varies from -1.92 eV to -0.30 eV. Then, by analysis of the interfacial structure and adsorption energies, it was proposed that GNS is incline to stand vertically on the FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface via C-F bond. However, structural stability of FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O/GNS heterostructure is gradually weakened with increasing the number of GNS layers. Therefore, we further reported the important role of optimal doping element (Hf) in strengthening the vertical adsorption behavior of GNS on FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface via thorough doping element search. And it turns out interfacial structure with hexa-coordinate polyhedron consists of Hf, F and O atoms is formed by strong hybridization of atomic orbits, which induces the interaction between FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (002) surface and GNS to be profoundly strengthened.

The enhanced production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P with the conventional multistage process needs at least two bioreactors. Shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of the bioreactor from the cell growth of E. coli KACC 91335P to those for its production of CMCase were investigated for development of the simple and economic process with the high productivity and low cost. The production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P with shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed from the cell growth to its production of CMCase in a 100 L pilot-scale bioreactor was 1.36 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for the production of CMCase and it was even 1.54 times higher than that with a fixed optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed for cell growth. The best time for the shift in the optimal conditions was found to be the mid-log phase of cell growth. Owing to the mixed-growth-associated production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P, shifts in the optimal conditions of the aeration rate and agitation speed of bioreactors from the cell growth to its production of CMCase seemed to result in relatively more cells for the participation in its production of CMCase, which in turn enhanced its production of CMCase. The process with a simple control for shifts in the aeration rate and agitation speed of a bioreactor for the enhanced production of CMCase by E. coli KACC 91335P on the pilot-scale can be directly applied to the industrial-scaled production of cellulase.

Waveguide sensors have used many different kinds of waveguide geometries, and a sensor using a finite-width plate has been reported recently. The waveguide sensor with a finite-width plate uses a Lamb wave, the guided wave formed in the plate, but it has different propagation characteristics from those in an infinitely wide plate, because of the narrow plate width. Therefore, for the design and performance improvement of the waveguide sensor, it is necessary to understand and study the propagation characteristics of the Lamb wave in the finite-width plate. In this study, theories about the Lamb wave in a finite-width plate were investigated, and the dispersion curves in a finite-width plate were numerically calculated. From the obtained dispersion curves, the existence of the width modes and the variations of dispersion characteristics depending on the plate width were identified. It was demonstrated experimentally that the theoretically predicted high-order width modes were generated at once and propagated together in the laser-scanning experiments on Lamb wave propagation measurements in a finite-width plate.

J	Park, SJ; Lim, DY; Song, JH				Park, Seong-Jun; Lim, Dae-Young; Song, Jeong-Hwan			Effect of Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation Conditions on Oxide Coatings Properties of Die-Cast AZ91D Mg Alloy	KOREAN JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH												Oxide coatings are formed on die-cast AZ91D Mg alloy through an environmentally friendly plasma electrolytic oxidation(PEO) process using an electrolytic solution of NaAlO2, KOH, and KF. The effects of PEO condition with different duty cycles (10 %, 20 %, and 40 %) and frequencies(500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz) on the crystal phase, composition, microstructure, and micro-hardness properties of the oxide coatings are investigated. The oxide coatings on die-cast AZ91D Mg alloy mainly consist of MgO and MgAl2O4 phases. The proportion of each crystalline phase depends on various electrical parameters, such as duty cycle and frequency. The surfaces of oxide coatings exhibit as craters of pancake-shaped oxide melting and solidification particles. The pore size and surface roughness of the oxide coating increase considerably with increase in the number of duty cycles, while the densification and thickness of oxide coatings increase progressively. Differences in the growth mechanism may be attributed to differences in oxide growth during PEO treatment that occur because the applied operating voltage is insufficient to reach breakdown voltage at higher frequencies. PEO treatment also results in the oxide coating having strong adhesion properties on the Mg alloy. The micro-hardness at the cross-section of oxide coatings is much higher not only compared to that on the surface but also compared to that of the conventional anodizing oxide coatings. The oxide coatings are found to improve the micro-hardness with the increase in the number of duty cycles, which suggests that various electrical parameters, such as duty cycle and frequency, are among the key factors controlling the structural and physical properties of the oxide coating.																			1225-0562	2287-7258				OCT	2019	29	10					609	616		10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.609	http://dx.doi.org/10.3740/MRSK.2019.29.10.609													WOS:000500930400005

Herein, we report on the bioinspired silicification of the nanostructured surfaces of hexagonally close-packed silica bead (hc-SB) arrays using a liquid-phase deposition (LPD) method. This process, governed by the kinetics of silicification, was controlled using the concentration of the reactants and the reaction temperature and monitored in real time using a quartz-crystal microbalance, which allowed the investigation of the silicification on the surface during the LPD reaction. These heterogeneous LPD reactions on hc-SB arrays were optimized to mimic natural 3D hierarchical structures. Anisotropic silicification of the nanostructures occurred owing to differences in the energy and local concentration of silicic acid on the nanostructured surface. A 3D hierarchical pore network was realized via a heterogeneous LPD reaction by controlling the size, location, and arrangement of the SBs. We believe that our silicification process on nanostructured surfaces can lead to great improvements in the bioinspired morphogenesis-based engineering of 3D hierarchical structures.																			0743-7463					OCT 1	2019	35	39					12656	12664		10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b01998	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b01998								31490695					WOS:000488993300008

However, the authors intended the deposition of the SiCOH films, which does not need the post-deposition process to form the pores by using the dual precursors having different structures. The octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) have different structures which were of the ring shape and the linear shape, respectively. The OMCTS and TEOS were used to fabricate the plasma polymerized low dielectric constant SiCOH film by using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system in this work. A ratio of OMCTS and TEOS was adjusted by controlling flow rates of precursor carrier gases into the process chamber. The SiCOH films, which were deposited with dual precursors, showed the very low dielectric constants (relative dielectric constant k similar to 2.06 and 2.09) at plasma power of 10 W. All the fabricated SiCOH films showed the proper leakage current densities below 10(-6) A/cm(-2) at 1 MV/cm as the intermetallic dielectric material.

Most of these systems characterize the entire network traffic within a single profile. This work proposes a user-level anomaly-based intrusion detection methodology using only the user's network traffic. The proposed profile is a collection of TopK rankings of reached services by the user. To detect unexpected behaviors, the real-time traffic is organized into TopK rankings and compared to the profile using similarity measures. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed methodology was capable of detecting a particular kind of malware attack in all the users tested.

Restoring stone monuments: Enlightening critical details by the combined use of innovative sensing techniques	FRATTURA ED INTEGRITA STRUTTURALE-FRACTURE AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY												The experience gathered during the implementation of long series of laboratory experimental protocols, aiming to study the mechanical response of restored structural elements, is summarized. Conclusions are drawn concerning the proper exploitation of the laboratory results in field applications in the frame of on-going restoration projects of ancient stone monuments. The need of continuous bidirectional interaction between the scientific personnel working in the site and the scientists working in the laboratory is emphasized. The role of the Digital Image Correlation technique in quantifying parasitic effects influencing the laboratory data is proven decisive. The need to use modem sensing techniques, providing data from the interior of loaded restored complexes (simulating restored structural elements), like the Pressure Stimulated Currents and the Acoustic Emissions ones, according to a combined manner is highlighted. The capability of these two techniques to monitor the damage evolution within the mass of the elements tested and to provide clear pre-failure indicators renders them flexible tools in the hands of engineers designing the restoration projects.																				1971-8993				OCT	2019		50					560	572		10.3221/IGF-ESIS.50.47	http://dx.doi.org/10.3221/IGF-ESIS.50.47													WOS:000487286700047

Scattering of spinon excitations by potentials in the one-dimensional Heisenberg model	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												By a semianalytical Bethe ansatz method and a T-matrix approach we study the scattering of a spinon, the elementary quantum many-body topological excitation in the one-dimensional (1D) Heisenberg model, by local and phonon potentials. In particular, we contrast the scattering of a spinon to that of a free spinless fermion in the XY model to highlight the effect of strong correlations. For the one-spinon scattering in an odd-site chain, we find regular behavior of the scattering coefficients. In contrast, in an even-site chain there is a transfer of transmission probability between the two spinon branches that grows exponentially with system size. We link the exponent of the exponential behavior to the dressed charge that characterizes the critical properties of the 1D Heisenberg model, an interplay of topological and critical properties. The aim of this study is a microscopic understanding of spinon scattering by impurities, barriers, or phonons, modeled as prototype potentials, an input in the analysis of quantum spin transport experiments.

Control of the metal-to-insulator transition by substrate orientation in nickelates	AIP ADVANCES												We proved that the critical thickness for metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) of LaNiO3 could be controlled by substrate orientation. By means of density functional theory calculations, films grown on SrTiO3 substrates with (001), (110) and (111) orientations have different amount of charge transfer across the interface. Different charge transfer induces different interfacial conductivity behavior and at the same time modifies the carrier density of adjacent LaNiO3 films. The manipulation of MIT by substrate orientation can be achieved through interfacial charge transfer induced interfacial conductive layer with the modified conductivity of LNO layer.

Exact solutions are derived for the case where the generalized screw dislocation is located in the matrix under a remote anti-plane shear stress field, an in-plane electric field, and a magnetic field. Based on the complex variable method, the complex potentials of both the matrix and the inhomogeneity are obtained in series, and analytic expressions for the generalized stress and strain field, the image force, the generalized stress intensity factor of the blunt crack tip, and the energy release rate are derived explicitly. The presented solutions include some previous solutions, such as pure elastic, piezoelectric, piezomagnetic, and circular inclusions. Typical numerical examples are presented and the influences of the dislocation position, the volume of inhomogeneity, and the elliptic hole on these physical quantities are discussed. The results show that the magneto-electro-elastic coupling effect has a great influence on the image force and the equilibrium position of dislocation, especially when the dislocation approaches the interface; the coupling effect makes the image force on the screw dislocation follow different variation laws in piezoelectric-piezomagnetic composite materials compared with elastic materials.

The first step for estimation energy balance is monitoring of dissipated part of energy (heat generation). One of the most effective techniques for investigation of temperature evolution on the surface of deformed body is infrared thermography. The work is devoted to the experimental study of energy dissipation in cracked samples made of titanium Grade 2 under multiaxial cyclic loading. To explain the experimentally obtained correlation between fatigue crack rate and power of heat dissipation we developed a phenomenological model describing the evolution of plastic work at the crack tip under arbitrary loading. The theoretical and experimental data about heat dissipation exhibit a good quantitative agreement.

The results reveal that the addition of EDTA makes the reduction potential of Bi(III) shift negatively, but does not affect the reduction potential of Sb(III) and Te(IV), which makes the deposition potential of Bi(III), Sb(III) and Te(IV) close to each other. The addition of tartaric acid makes the reduction potential of Bi(III) negatively shift a little and the reduction potential of Sb(III) shift negatively, but does not affect the reduction potential of Te(IV), which makes the deposition potential of Bi(III), Sb(III) and Te(IV) far away from each other. Meanwhile, the role of EDTA is to increase the solubility of Bi(III), and tartaric acid is expected to improve the solubility of Sb(III), EDTA and tartaric acid could enhance the stability of Bi(III)-Sb(III)-Te(IV) ternary mixture.

The simulation of cracking of stainless steel piping under the conditions of intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) is based on the improved modified piping reliability analysis including seismic events (PRUSE) code. The IGSCC is characterized by a unique damage parameter that depends on residual stresses and environmental conditions. Case studies: of IGSCC failures in nuclear power plants are presented and the contribution of environmental effects on crack initiation and leakage is discussed.

An investigation on the performance of Di-isopropyl benzyl derivative of Poly (3, 4-propylene dioxythiophene) thin film based electrochromic pixels displays	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												Electrochromic (EC) smart pixel display was designed and fabricated using a novel monomer di-4-isopropyl benzyl substituted (3, 4-propylene dioxythiophene) (ProDOT-IPBz(2)). The polymer thin film showed absorption between 450 and 650 nm at a fully reduced state. The absorption peak narrowed down slightly towards longer wavelength region (850-900 nm) at the oxidation states. Siju et al has reported the coloration efficiency (CE) of the thin film as similar to 305 cm(2) C-1. The ProDot-IPBZ(2) thin film was used to fabricate EC pixel display of 2 x 2 pixel array on a patterned ITO coated glass. The optical color contrast of the EC pixel display is 40% at 600 nm, with a switching time of about 2 s and 2.5 s respectively. The CE of EC pixel was found to be 555 cm(2) C-1 at 600 nm in the fully doped state. This EC pixel switched for more than 1000 cycles with good color contrast (< 5% T). EC pixel displays showed transmissive, magenta and violet colored states at applied potentials of 1.5, -1.0 and -2.0 V respectively. This EC pixel display is efficient with faster response time and better color contrast.

The wear response of the investigated materials has been explained on the basis of microstructure, wear surface heating and wear-mechanism. The wear mechanism in composite has been explained schematically with supporting wear surface and subsurface micrographs.

J	Reader, CJ; Johnson, G				Reader, C. Jim; Johnson, Gary			Factors Affecting Sealer Performance CONCRETE	COATINGSTECH					Waterborne Symposium	FEB 24-MAR 01, 2019	New Orleans, LA					It is often assumed that solvent-basedI sealers give better performance than water-based formulations on concrete because the solvent-based sealers are thought to better penetrate into the concrete matrix. In practice, it can be difficult to measure actual penetration of a sealer into concrete, as dyes and colorants used to highlight the sealer may show different migration properties than the polymeric binder. Con focal Raman spectroscopy mapping has been used to map the depth of penetration of solvent-based, 100% solids, and water-based sealers that employ acrylic and epoxy binders. This mapping shows that neither solvent-based nor water-based formulations showed any significant penetration into the concrete substrate beyond the first few microns of the open surface. A study has also been carried out using a model waterborne acrylic sealer formulation to determine whether additives might influence the penetration of the sealer into the concrete or other factors that could affect the performance of the waterborne coating. This work has shown that the addition of anti-foaming, coalescing surfactants can improve the protective properties of the coating by improving air release and increasing film network formation at the concrete surface.																			1547-0083					OCT	2019	16	10					36	+																WOS:000490033000013

Orientation Relationships of Pure Tin on Single Crystal Germanium Substrates	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS												The limited number of independent beta-Sn grain orientations resulting from the difficulty in nucleating beta-Sn during solidification of Sn-based solders has a large effect on the resulting beta-Sn grain size and, hence, on overall solder joint performance and reliability. This study analyzes the efficacy of Ge as a heterogeneous nucleation agent for beta-Sn by observing the morphologies and orientation relationships of as-deposited, solid-state annealed, and liquid-state annealed pure Sn films on single crystal Ge (100), (110), and (111) substrates. Results from scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction showed that the as-deposited Sn films all deposited with a Sn (001)|| z-axis texture, regardless of the underlying Ge substrate orientation. Solid-state annealing at 150 degrees C for 5 min did not result in significant dewetting of the Sn films, and the films maintained their as-deposited texture of Sn (001)|| z-axis, regardless of the underlying Ge substrate orientation. Liquid-state annealing at 235 degrees C for 1 min resulted is large-scale dewetting of the Sn films and re-orientation of the Sn films on the various Ge substrates. After solidification, the Ge (100) and (110) single crystal substrates produced patches of dewetted grains of the same orientation but there were no consistent Sn grain textures after liquid-state annealing, suggesting no single orientation relationship. In contrast, solidification on Ge (111) single crystal substrates resulted in isolated grains with a single Sn film texture and an orientation relationship of. Density Functional Theory simulations of the experimentally observed Ge (111) sample orientation relationship and the Ge/Sn cube-on-cube orientation relationship suggest favorable relative interfacial binding energies for both interface orientations.

In this study, the consequences of hemp retting on the ease of fibre extraction and tensile properties of elementary hemp fibres is explored. Stem peeling experiments are combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the influence of the retting degree in plants. After studying the evolution of fracture energy at the fibre/woody core interphase within the stem, this work investigates interphase fracture mechanisms during peeling experiments which aims to understand the evolution of fibre bundle cohesion during retting. A drastic drop of fracture energy reveals the impact of retting on the ease of peeling the outer tissue of the stem (containing fibre bundles). The positive impact of retting on various fibre defects combined together leads to a 33 % increase in the tangent modulus between non-retted and retted fibres, highlighting the importance of understanding the retting process to open up to new markets for biocomposites.

The investigated samples were 30 and 100 nm in diameter. The magnetization process depends on the angle at which the external magnetic field is applied. Fe77.5Si7.5B15 amorphous nanowires with smaller diameters exhibit larger coercivity than (Co0.94Fe0.06)(72.5)Si12.5B15 ones, irrespective of the angle at which the external field is applied. Moreover, both types of nanowires have similar remanence values at 30 nm diameters. However, nanowires with larger diameters (100 nm), exhibit a more complex behavior, since the (Co0.94Fe0.06)(72.5)Si12.5B15 samples exhibit a slightly larger coercivity as compared to the Fe77.5Si7.5B15 ones. The magnetization reversal process is influenced by the interplay between the preponderant factors that affect the overall magnetic properties of amorphous nanowires with different compositions and dimensions.

In view to explore their possible utilization in opto-electronic devices, we have firstly performed calculations using one of the most accurate prescriptions, namely full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method. For a better accuracy, computations have been carried out using different exchange-correlation potentials including the most accurate modified Becke-Johnson potential with hybrid functional features. Computations have been performed for various electronic and optical properties such as energy bands, total and partial density of states, real and imaginary parts of dielectric tensors, absorption spectra, reflection, refraction and energy loss spectra for both chalcopyrite compounds. We have compared our data with the existing experimental and theoretical calculations for both compounds, which validates the accuracy of present computations. Both chalcopyrites are observed to have a direct band gap nature (Cu2InAlSe4: 1.14 eV and Cu2InGaSe4: 0.96 eV).

Effect of non-180° polarization invariants on the exchange bias of tetragonal ⟨001⟩ and rhombohedral ⟨111⟩ orientations of bismuth ferrite epitaxial thin films	BULLETIN OF MATERIALS SCIENCE												BiFeO3 (BFO) is the only room temperature multiferroic material that has been extensively studied due to its multifunctional properties. BFO with a canted G-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering exhibits strong exchange bias characteristics with NiFe which offers the potential to design and utilize devices working based on multiferroic features. In the past, it was known that the presence of 180 degrees domain walls of BFO hinders a plausible exchange bias interaction. To understand the role of the strain-induced effects on such 180 degrees domain walls and its effect on the exchange bias, NiFe, a soft ferromagnetic layer, was grown on the epitaxial BFO AFM layers. An approximately 80nm BFO layer was grown epitaxially in both the tetragonal (001) phase on the LaAlO3 (001) substrate and the rhombohedral (111) phase on the SrTiO3 (111) substrate, with a thin (10nm) layer of Ni80Fe20 on top of it. An exchange bias of 510 Oe was observed in the tetragonal phase of BFO with a c/a ratio of 1.22, which is comparable with the exchange bias shown by the (111) oriented rhombohedral phase (360 Oe). Both the tetragonal (001) and rhombohedral (111) layers possess ferroelectric polarization normal to the sample surface and so the domain walls are mostly 180 degrees oriented which is expected to have a minimum effect on the exchange bias. However, the weak strain-induced structural variants in the (111) oriented rhombohedral BFO and the monoclinic distortion present in the tetragonal BFO introduce non-180 degrees domain walls in the system. These variants arising due to the structural distortion are expected to play a key role in defining the ferroelectric domain wall nature, thereby exhibiting exchange bias characteristics.

In this paper, the split-ring resonator array-based evanescent amplification in the microwave regime is implemented for strongly enhancing radiation from an electrically small radiator. The electrically small radiator considered here is a chip inductor loaded open coplanar waveguide antenna. This weakly radiating source when placed in the vicinity of split-ring resonator array, it is seen that the radiated power could be greatly enhanced. The split-ring resonator array working under the magnetic resonant excitation could amplify evanescent fields emitted by the source. Field probing reveals that the split-ring resonator array could convert the amplified evanescent waves into propagating ones resulting in significantly enhanced radiation from the source.

This inclusion was modeled with a round plate (radius R and thickness h). Disintegration of silicon inclusion was assumed to be possible due to discrepancy of elasticity modulus and linear expansion thermal coefficient caused by the evolving dynamic instability. In conditions of high-speed cooling a silicon plate is subjected to compression stresses, since linear expansion coefficient of aluminum is above that of silicon. If these forces applied, instability and fracture of a plate are registered. Using methods of elasticity theory it was found out that the value of these stresses is around 1 GPa. The initial stage of this instability was analyzed by methods of Theory of Plates and Shells. In terms of this theory, a critical stress (similar to 10(7)-10(9) Pa) was determined close to the clamped ends of a plate and hinged plates. So, it was concluded, that a suggested mechanism of silicon particles disintegration in the heat-impact zone of an electron beam seems to be the most probable one. Relay-Taylor instability on the inclusion and matrix border is thought to be another mechanism of particles disintegration. According to the linear analysis of this instability, a wavelength with the maximal growth speed of disturbances is similar to 4 mu m, for inclusions similar to 1 mu m these findings exceed significantly the experimental data.

This deposition angle provides the highest void fraction according to the published literature on the basis of rearrangement of atoms resulting from the diffusion or thermal vibration and the available crystallographic sites and surface energy on the substrate/growing film surface for relaxation of an adatom. Structural characteristics of the films were obtained using atomic force microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy while their crystallography was investigated by x-ray diffraction analysis. Optical spectra of the samples were measured from which optical constants were deduced. The direct band gap energies were obtained and compared with the reported theoretical calculations and experimental results. The band gap energies obtained from the process of plotting (alpha h upsilon)(2) versus h upsilon are in agreement with the reported values in the literature. Band gap energies obtained from dT/d lambda versus h upsilon eV method are in agreement with experimental values and with the theoretical band gap energy of 4.1 eV as well as those obtained from (alpha h upsilon)(2) versus h upsilon method, while those obtained from dR/d lambda versus h upsilon eV are in good agreement with theoretical band gap energy of 3.86 eV.

While the bulk measurements did not show any variations in dc resistance as a function of applied magnetic field (zero magnetoresistance), the point-contact measurements revealed giant-magnetoresistance-like changes in the resistance of small volumes (10(6)-10(9)nm(3)) associated with the contacts. A high-density current applied to the contacts was found to affect the point-contact magnetoresistance - the magnetic field where resistive switching occurs was found to shift with the applied dc bias. The magnetotransport effects observed on the microscopic scale could be attributed to specific local configurations of magnetic domains in CoSiBFeNb and effects of spin-transfer torque on the domain configurations.																			0304-8853	1873-4766				OCT 1	2019	487								165279	10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165279													WOS:000471754300025

A CNT/Ni nanocomposite was fabricated by two steps, dehydration of polyol and oxidation of acetaldehyde with the formation of diacetyl. Oxygen functionalized CNTs offer direct nucleation sites for Ni particles and strong chemical bonding between CNT and Ni particles. By controlling nucleation sites and nuclear growth, we successfully fabricated three different types of nanocomposite powders, CNT implanted Ni, Ni coated CNTs, and Ni decorated CNTs. Each type of powder was developed for various applications. During the sintering process, the implanted type retained CNT's crystal structure. As a conductive filler to other matrix, the coated and decorated type offered homogeneous dispersion and an enhanced conductive network.

We demonstrate an ON / OFF ratio of about 40, which is caused by metal insulator transition (MIT) of VO2 thin film.

Conventionally, a cowl cross member has been made of steel and aluminum, but recently researchers tested multi-material such as aluminum and plastic. We studied a new model of the cowl cross member made of composite and non ferrous materials. For products with a high degree of freedom in design, generally, the method of topology optimization is advantageous and for the partial bracket part of the cowl cross member had a degree of freedom in the design, a topology optimization is appropriate. Considering the characteristics of the cowl cross members, we need research to minimize the weight while having the performance of noise, vibration and harshness(NVH). Taking the mounting status of the product into consideration, we used an assembly model to optimize the cowl cross member. But this method took too much time so we considered simple cowl cross member assemble conditions using the direct matrix input method(DMI) with the Craig-Bampton Nodal Method. This method is capable of considering the status of the assembly without assembling the model, which reduced the solving time and increased the accuracy comparison with a cowl cross member without DMI.

The proposed gas-forming core-shell nanocapsules are based on a shell structure composed of a polyacrylonitrile/polymethylmethacrylate copolymer, where the core contains vaporizable cyclic hydrocarbons (i.e., methylcyclohexane). These stable functional nanocapsules were spherical in shape, with an average particle size of similar to 110 nm. Interestingly, using the proposed synthetic method, it was also possible to prepare nanoparticles with varying particle sizes and copolymer ratios through a simple pre-emulsification stage and careful control of the monomer ratio employed. Upon mixing the resulting core-shell nanocapsules uniformly with the optical adhesive films, desorption was observed between layers following heat treatment. Furthermore, the high optical transmittance of the optical adhesive film was retained due to the small size of the core-shell nanoparticles. It was therefore apparent that the proposed method should be applicable for the preparation of future optical films where functional core-shell nanocapsules are required.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6256	6263		10.1166/jnn.2019.17034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17034								31026945					WOS:000466046800048

Unlike some of the previously reported studies, in which the PBTI lifetime of TFET is much longer than that of MOSFET, in this study, the PBTI lifetime of TFET is found to be shorter than that of MOSFET. This result is very interesting, because degradation of electrical parameters of TFET is mainly affected by local traps near the source junction rather than global traps in the channel region. Large degradation of the electrical parameters of TFET due to PBTI stress would result from large fluctuation of the vertical electric field caused by traps near the source junction. This electric field fluctuation near the local region in TFET has more impact on electrical parameter degradation than channel conductivity fluctuation in MOSFET. Therefore, to improve the reliability characteristics of TFET, evaluation of PBTI characteristics and improvement of the quality of gate oxide near the source junction are essential.																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6131	6134		10.1166/jnn.2019.16992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.16992								31026922					WOS:000466046800025

Moreover, the in vitro release, cytotoxicity and cellular uptake were equally determined. The results showed that PAA-SS-GA-NPs had a small particle size (91.5 +/- 9.19 nm), had a high drug loading efficiency ((32.5 +/- 2.3) %) and greatly improved the water solubility of GA (over 9700-fold).

Photo-induced electronic transition and effect of thickness on the resistivity of Li-doped ZnO thin films	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												Zn1-xLixO (x = 0, 0.005, 0.010 and 0.015) thin films were grown on single-crystal sapphire (Al2O3) substrates (001) by pulsed laser deposition method. We prepared two sets of thin films. In set-1, the doping of Li was varied. A fractional Li-doping causes a systematic rise in the temperature-dependent resistivity of the films. Further, the ultraviolet (UV) light (365 nm) exposure on these films causes a variety of effects. We observed a UV light-induced metal-semiconductor transition in otherwise semiconducting films. The transition manifests in a temperature range above 200 K to 300 K. In set-2, thin films of maximum doping (1.5%) were prepared by varying the thickness. The structural study revealed that the films are crystalline and oriented towards c-axis of wurtzite ZnO. The temperature-dependent resistivity measurements show the increase in resistivity with an increase in the thickness of the films.

During the preceding months an intensive inspection of the whole structure was conducted. Results showed that a considerable part of the reinforcement was irreparably affected by nitrate induced stress crack corrosion. Therefore, the elephant's house had to be closed and a temporary support was installed. The present paper illustrates the outstanding achievements during design and erection of the elephant's house and explains the mechanisms and consequences of nitrate induced stress crack corrosion of the reinforcement.

It can be assumed that this development will also continue in national and international regulations. What is missing, however, are practical and at the same time economic tests of the material resistance, which can be carried out within the framework of initial type testing, conformity testing and identity testing. In this context, the present article summarizes the currently available tests for determining the material resistance to chloride penetration (rapid penetration test RCP-Test, rapid migration test RCM-Test, test of electrolytic resistance) and critically examines them with regard to test accuracy, time expenditure and suitability for practical use. On the basis of these findings, a new testing method is developed on the basis of the existing RCM test set-up, which can be used within the scope of initial type testing and is referred to as the Modified Chloride Migration Test MCM-Test. In this test, the charge flow is determined at a variable initial voltage during a specified test duration; the resulting material value is referred to as the SCFR (Specific Charge Flow Rate) value. In 32 test series with 17 different concretes it was shown that the correlation between SCFR value and chloride migration coefficient D-RCM was very good. For conformity and identity testing, a test based on electrolytic resistance measurement is proposed, which also shows a good correlation with the D-RCM value regardless of the binder combination.

Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is considered to be a model system for this examination. Although SrTiO3 is an intermediate compound between SrO and TiO2, the solubilities of SrO and TiO2 in SrTiO3 are extremely low. Excess SrO and excess TiO2 lead to the formation of second phases as Sr3Ti2O7 and TiO2, respectively, within SrTiO3. TiO2 exists as particulates, and its presence marginally affects the microwave dielectric properties of SrTiO3. The Sr3Ti2O7 lamella is located on the long axis of the elongated SrTiO3 grain. With the formation of the Sr3Ti2O7 lamella, the permittivity decreases, and the product of quality factor and resonant frequency increases.

With this method the bridge supporting structure is additionally strengthened by active temporary struts positioned over the length of the structure and therefore increasing the load capacity. Even though this strengthening method has been successfully implemented for decades, it is still unknown in many countries of EU. Most of the companies, which apply this strengthening method follow old simplified rules and models [1] (1980), which restrict its efficiency. The old model insufficiently describes the actual behavior of the strengthening with the results sometimes ending on the unsafe side. The introduced new approach for short-term bridge strengthening is based on the monitoring of real bridge structures and temporary support structures during the crossing of heavy transports. A mathematical model, which suitably represents the behavior of real structures, is introduced. Furthermore a safety hydraulic element invented at Brno University of Technology (VUT FAST), which can be used with the strengthening system is presented.

Monotonic and cyclic behavior of polyamide 66/hectorite nanocomposites in marine environment	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS												Product design for safe performance and operation in harsh environments triggers the importance of understanding property degradation due to prolonged exposure of advanced composite materials to such environments. The effect of seawater immersion on monotonic tensile, stress relaxation, and cyclic bending fatigue response of polyamide 66 nanocomposites containing 0%, 1%, and 5% hectorite organoclay were investigated. Seawater equilibrated nanocomposites demonstrated less moisture absorption compared to their pure counterparts. The imbibed seawater significantly increased the ductility, and reduced the tensile modulus and strength of nanocomposites. A nine-parameter Prony series viscoelastic constitutive model was used to estimate the influence of seawater on the viscoelastic behavior based on stress relaxation data. The phenomenological model evaluated a drop of 82% in the instantaneous and the residual elastic moduli indicating a significant plasticizing effect of seawater. However, the amount of increase in the rubbery nature of polyamide is observed from the reduction in stress relaxation time of first Maxwell element by about 40%. Nanocomposites exhibited improved fatigue life with an increase in organoclay content even after equilibration in seawater. The fracture surface observation of seawater equilibrated bending fatigue specimen revealed rubbery behavior indicating the positive difference between cyclic steady-state temperature and material glass transition temperature.

Composite materials of TiO2 with graphene are normally shown by the gradual quenching of photoluminescence intensity as a result of carrier lifetime extension, which is important to enhance photocatalytic activity. Herein we report an observation of the intensity enhancement of the green PL emission in a composite TiO2 nanotube (TNT) and graphene produced through facile hydrothermal synthesis. The heterojunction formation of graphene and TNT makes the excited photoelectrons easy to diffuse from TNT to graphene. Hence, the recombination rate of mobile electrons in graphene and trapped holes located on the nanotube surface is enhanced due to the high mobility of electrons in graphene.

Although specifically designed for active textiles, the characterization device is broadly applicable for studying the performance of actuators including but not limited to Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires, SMA springs, and electroactive polymers. The characterization device may be operated in several modes that enable a wide variety of experimental protocols to be automated. These modes include but are not limited to automatic displacement and displacement rate mode, automatic force mode, and manual displacement mode. For active textiles that actuate by electrical stimulus or by resistive heating, the electronic system has five independent motor drivers. For each driver, the voltage drop across its outputs and current are measured, enabling the measurement of textile power consumption and other electrical properties. The validation of the Active Textile Characterization Device uses a contractile SMA knitted textile actuated by four motor drivers through resistive heating. Several protocols were successfully conducted to demonstrate the experimental flexibility of the system. During these experiments, knit length, knit tension, current through the knit, voltage drop across the knit, and room temperature were measured with respect to time. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Experimental characterisation of fatigue crack growth based on the CTOD measured from crack tip displacement fields using DIC	FRATTURA ED INTEGRITA STRUTTURALE-FRACTURE AND STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY												The current work presents an experimental study on the use of the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) to evaluate its ability to characterise fatigue crack growth. A methodology is developed to measure and to analyse the CTOD from experimental data. The vertical displacements obtained by implementing digital image correlation (DIC) on growing fatigue cracks are used to measure the CTOD. Two fatigue tests at stress ratios of 0.1 and 0.6 were conducted on compact tension (CT) specimens manufactured from a 1 mm thick sheet of commercially pure titanium. A sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of the position selected behind the crack tip for the MOD measurement was performed. The analysis of a full loading cycle allowed identifying the elastic and plastic components of the CTOD. The plastic CTOD was found to be directly related to the nonlinear zone (i.e., plastic deformation) generated at the crack tip during fatigue propagation. Moreover, a linear relationship between da/dN and Delta CTODp independent of the stress ratio was found. Results show that the CTOD can be used as a viable alternative to the stress intensity factor range (Delta K) in characterising fatigue crack propagation since the parameter considers the fatigue threshold and crack shielding in an intrinsic way.

The latter realizes the interactive erasure animation, which involves shaking the mobile terminal, visualizations of the erasure animation on the shared display terminal, and dynamic and personalized data editing. The experimental results show that the system can realize various styles of personalized erasure animation and can respond to more than 2000 shaking actions simultaneously and present the corresponding erasure animations on the shared display terminal in real time.

In this work, we propose a composite structure consisting of binary Au nanodisk arrays on top of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) of TiO2/SiO2 1D photonic crystal; the structure supports the confined dual hybrid TP modes that benefited from the excitation of a localized lattice collective resonance on the vicinity of the nanoparticles array. The hybrid TP modes possess enhanced confinement, controllable hybrid TP frequency, and broadened spectral width compared with that of TP mode within the gold film/DBR structure. Moreover, the hybrid TP mode that due to the in-phased localized lattice resonance is dominated when the nanodisk radius increases, while the hybrid TP mode resulted from weak coupling of in-phased and anti-phased localized lattice resonance is weakened, especially when the radii of binary arrays approach identical. Thus, the tunable dual confined TP states can be realized through adjusting the arrays radii rather than changing the properties of DBR. Importantly, the enhancement of confined hybrid TP modes with controllable resonant frequency has a potential application in perfect absorption.

Symmetric growth of ZnO nanorod arrays on both the top and bottom polar surfaces of ZnO nanobelts suggests that the two polar planes have high surface energy and are metastable, which can promote preferred orientation growth along +/- [0001] directions. Hierarchical ZnO nanostructures will be served as interconnects and functional components in the "bottom up" design to build up functional devices.																			0947-8396	1432-0630				OCT	2019	125	10							700	10.1007/s00339-019-2996-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00339-019-2996-8													WOS:000485918800002

Humidity sensitive properties of paracetamol	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												A common coldrex, paracetamol, was used as humidity sensing material. The capacitance-type humidity sensor was fabricated by aerosol deposition method. The humidity sensitive properties were investigated through dielectric measurements. Our results reveal that the sensor has exciting performances in high relative humidity. Both -OH and -NH groups have contributions to water absorption. The -OH groups lead to a water-containing surface layer giving rise to pronounced Maxwell-Wagner response, which in turn, yields the humidity response that can be easily adjusted by an external electric field. This work indicates that the paracetamol is a promising humidity sensing material.																				2053-1591				OCT	2019	6	10							105104	10.1088/2053-1591/ab403b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab403b													WOS:000487696200001

The results show that solution heating rate has a strong influence on microstructure, quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties. As solution heating rate rises, the grain microstructure transforms from the elongated grains to equiaxed grains and the fraction of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) also decreases. Moreover, the equivalent average grain size first decreases, and then increases. The relationship between solution heating rate and mechanical property is monotonic, not depending on strain rate. As solution heating rate rises, the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation decrease. In contrast to quasi-static loading, dynamic loading always tends to improve strengths and elongation. In addition, compared with the quasi-static tensile specimens, the dynamic tensile specimens possess a larger number of dislocations. Regardless of strain rate and solution heating rate, all the tensile specimens exhibit the ductile fracture mode. As solution rate rises, the dimples decrease and become shallow gradually. The dimples in dynamic fracture zone are larger and deeper than those in the quasi-static fracture zone.

Exploiting Acoustic Anisotropy to Detect Recrystallization in a Ni Single Crystal Using Ultrasonic Nondestructive Inspection	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE												Ultrasonic inspection was used to detect regions of recrystallization (RX) within a single crystal of Ni. RX can produce polycrystalline regions within single-crystal (SX) materials. Because RX regions act as initiator sites for failure by fatigue-crack growth in otherwise SX Ni-based superalloys, RX is an issue of direct concern for the service life of high-performance turbine blades. Detection and discrimination of RX regions in single-crystal materials are significant challenges for current nondestructive inspection technologies. The present study leverages the elastic anisotropy of single crystals, which produces acoustic anisotropy, to ultrasonically detect and characterize RX regions produced within single-crystal specimens. Single crystals of pure Ni were processed to create controlled regions of RX. These specimens were ultrasonically examined in an immersion tank using a high-resolution, polyvinylidene fluoride transducer to detect acoustic impedance changes across the boundaries between different crystals (i.e., grains) within the RX region. Data from time-of-flight and absolute peak amplitude measurements were used to create acoustic images that were compared against electron microscope images of the RX regions. The ultrasonic inspection technique described here successfully detected not only the locations of RX regions, but also the approximate sizes and shapes of the RX regions.																			1059-9495	1544-1024				OCT	2019	28	10					6298	6306		10.1007/s11665-019-04326-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11665-019-04326-2													WOS:000492598900037
J	Wesolowski, J; Malara, S				Wesolowski, Jan; Malara, Szymon			Structure and properties of innovative zinc alloys for continuous hot-dip galvanizing	OCHRONA PRZED KOROZJA												The paper presents the results of production in laboratory conditions developed at the Department of Technology of Metals and Alloys Processing of the Lukasiewicz Research Network - Institute of Non-Ferrous Metals of three zinc alloys for continuous galvanizing. The research on the structure and properties of these alloys, such as density, freezing point, hardness, fractographic studies are presented. The developed alloys area very good alternative to current solutions in this area. The tested alloys were made on the basis of pure zinc with additions of aluminum, manganese, magnesium and antimony. The alloys solidify in the temperature range from 417 to 337 degrees C, and their hardness varies from 71 to 77 HB. The density of alloys ranges from 6.32 to 7.05 g/cm(3). The structure and mechanical properties of the tested alloys are determined mainly by the percentage of aluminum. The increase of this additive in the alloy from 0.5 to 5% by mass causes an increase of hardness and a change in structure to dendritic with eutectic 8-Al and a-Zn phases. All tested alloys exhibit brittle fracture character, regardless of the alloying additions amount (from 0.7 to 5.5% wt.). The addition of 5% aluminum and 0.5% magnesium to pure zinc reduces the solidification point of the material by more than 30 degrees C in comparison to pure zinc. In addition, it increases more than three times the temperature range from liquidus to solidus in comparison to other alloys tested.																			0473-7733	2449-9501				OCT	2019	62	10					332	337		10.15199/40.2019.10.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.15199/40.2019.10.1													WOS:000494270600002

The NCFET is designed using HfZrO2 (HZO) ferroelectric materials and the Nanoplate FET (NPFET) presented as a next generation device. We use the 3-D TCAD Sentaurus simulator to analyze characteristics of the NCFET. The NCFET designed considering the stable condition overcomes the Boltzmann limit (i.e., the physical limit in the S.S., which is 60 mV/decade at 300 K) through the steep subthreshold swing (S.S.) and exhibits negative Drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) phenomenon. When examining the characteristics of NPFET and NCFET according to LExt and Lov, the NCFET exhibits gate capacitance (C-gg) tendency opposite to that of the NPFET. The NCFET with the scaled V-DD has a significant advantage over the gate delay (tau(d)). The NCFET has better performance in environments where conventional device is more vulnerable to short channel effects (SCEs).																			1533-4880	1533-4899				OCT	2019	19	10					6736	6740		10.1166/jnn.2019.17104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/jnn.2019.17104								31027020					WOS:000466046800120

The results show that the apparent viscosity of CBT pure resin can be accurately obtained by using the gradient cooling method. The apparent viscosity of CBT pure resin is increased with the decrease of temperature, and is decreased with the increase of the rotating speed, and shows a significant shear thinning phenomenon at 170-180 degrees C. The reaction rate of the CBT/catalyst resin system is increased with the increase of the catalyst content, and the molding window time is shortened. Under the same concentration conditions, the CBT/T9 system with higher tin content has a faster reaction rate than the CBT500/DBTL system. With the increase of molding temperature, the reaction rate of CBT/catalyst system shows the trend of slowing down. This may be due to the increased volatilization of the catalyst and the decreased crystallization rate at higher molding temperature. Finally, the effects of different catalyst types, different concentrations and molding temperatures on the molding window time of CBT resin system were studied.																			1001-4381					OCT	2019	47	10					154	159		10.11868/j.issn.1001-4381.2018.000806	http://dx.doi.org/10.11868/j.issn.1001-4381.2018.000806													WOS:000495989300020

In order to determine the optimal ratio, eight experimental groups were set up for comparative testing. For further improving the performance of the biocomposite film, the three-dimensional network skeleton construction and targeted repairing technology of the material were designed. The specimens were characterized by a HD camera, a universal examination machine, a research grade inverted microscope, and a thermogravimetric analyzer. The results indicate that the agglomeration of powders reduces the tensile strength of the material, and the elongation at break depends on the properties of the polyolefin matrix itself. The reinforced biocomposite film has a 13.7MPa tensile strength and a 243% elongation at break. It has slightly better mechanical properties than ordinary materials, which can be used as an economical, thermally stable, and environmentally friendly material to manufacture new packaging and courier bags.																			8756-0879	1530-8014				OCT	2019	35	4					354	379		10.1177/8756087919846206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/8756087919846206													WOS:000486870500002

The electrical tunnel current passing through the switch is calculated and the growth of Ag nanowires between two electrodes is simulated. Our calculations show the switching time (the time that is required to decrease the resistance of switch below the resistance quantum R-Q approximate to 6.5 k ohm) exponentially decreases as the applied voltage increases that agrees very well with experimental findings. Furthermore, we assumed the Ag2S layer is a few atomic layer thick so the diffusion time of Ag+ ions within the Ag2S layer can be neglected compared to the formation of Ag nanowires. As a result, the switching time decreases exponentially as temperature increases. The switching time is calculated while different DC voltages are applied to the switch over temperature range of T = 300-350 K. The results imply both of the voltage- and the temperature-dependent behavior of the gap-type Ag-Ag2S-Pt atomic switch is dominated by the Coulomb blockade (CB) effect of Ag nanowires as electrons require energy to overcome the CB energy of Ag nanowires to sustain the growth of Ag nanowires.

The Mg-Cu-Gd-Nd bulk metallic glasses with a diameter of 2 mm are fabricated by injection casting using Mg-Nd byproduct. The compressive fracture strength and total strain are 850 MPa and 1.8%, respectively, for the Mg66.5-xCu28.5GdxNd5 (x=8, 10 at%) bulk metallic glasses. The activation energy of the Mg56.5Cu28.5Gd10Nd5 bulk metallic glass using Mg-Nd byproduct is similar to that of conventional Mg56.5Cu28.5Gd10Nd5 bulk metallic glass using pure elements, indicating that the thermal stability in the supercooled liquid region is similar. From the results, the recycling process for NdFeB magnet scrap can be considered a cost effective method for the formation of Mg-based bulk metallic glasses. It can therefore be concluded that the newly developed Mg-Cu-Gd-Nd bulk metallic glasses using Mg-Nd byproduct obtained from the recycling process of NdFeB magnet scrap have potential for industrial application.																			1738-8228					OCT	2019	57	10					617	623		10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.10.617	http://dx.doi.org/10.3365/KJMM.2019.57.10.617													WOS:000489226600001

A detailed investigation that the effect of subsequent set pulse on the set resistance distribution is presented. The improper subsequent set pulse amplitude and duration cause the cooling process of phase change material to deviate from the crystallization requirements, which leads to poor set resistance distribution. The optimal cooling current (OCC) can generate a linear decrease of the temperature, it is necessary for optimum crystallization. The thermal simulation suggests that the optimal subsequent set pulse has a similar temperature evolution to OCC. Hence the optimal subsequent set pulse enables minimum resistance, and its amplitudes are from 400 to 80 mu A and each pulse duration is 50 ns.

Effect of prior austenite on reversed austenite stability and mechanical properties of low carbon medium manganese steel heavy plateEinfluss von Primaraustenit auf Sekundaraustenit-Stabilitat und mechanische Eigenschaften einer schweren Metallplatte mit niedrigem Kohlenstoff- und mittlerem Mangangehalt	MATERIALWISSENSCHAFT UND WERKSTOFFTECHNIK												The effect of prior austenite on reversed austenite stability and mechanical properties of Fe-0.06C-0.2Si-5.5Mn-0.4Cr (wt.%) annealed steels was elucidated. With the decrease of austenitizing temperature from 1250 degrees C to 980 degrees C, the prior austenite changed from complete recrystallization to partial recrystallization, and the average austenite size was reduced. The volume fraction of reversed austenite was increased from 26.32 % to 30.25 % because of high density of grain boundaries and dislocations. The martensite transformation temperature of annealed steels was increased from similar to 115 degrees C to similar to 150 degrees C, and both of thermal and mechanical stability of reversed were reduced. There was no significant different in tensile properties, however, the impact toughness was enhanced from 100 J to 180 J at -60 degrees C. The excellent impact toughness in annealed steel (austenitized at 980 degrees C) was obtained because of higher density of high misorientation grain boundaries, more volume fraction of reversed austenite and reduced segregation at grain boundaries.

The results revealed that a primary austenite precipitation reaction (L -> gamma), ternary eutectic reaction (L -> gamma + M-2 (B, C) + M2C), and secondary boron carbide precipitation reaction (gamma -> M (B, C) and gamma -> M-3 (B, C)) occurred during the solidification process of the steel. These reactions occurred at characteristic temperatures of 1350 degrees C, 1220 degrees C, 1100 degrees C, and 1000 degrees C, respectively. The precipitation reaction of primary austenite yielded a primary austenite dendrite and a eutectic structure distributed along the grain boundary. The ternary eutectic reaction products were austenite, M-2 (B, C) and M2C, which were distributed in the grain boundaries in a manner consistent with interdependence and mixed growth. Similarly, the secondary M-3 (B, C) boron carbide, converted from the (Fe, Cr)(3)C carbide, was precipitated from the austenite matrix. The solidification process consisted of four stages: diffusion of alloying elements, aggregation of alloying elements at grain boundaries, nucleation of M-3 (B, C) phases and growth of M-3 (B, C) phases. This new high-boron high-speed steel can be widely used in rolls and other fields where wear resistance is required.

Strain fields in cracked bodies under antiplane shear for a generalised non-hardening material law	MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS												An exact, closed form, solution is derived for the non-linear stress distribution in a cracked body under antiplane shear deformation. A generalised, non work-hardening, law is introduced to describe the material behaviour, and the stress and strain fields are derived in closed form. Such a new generalised material law includes the effect of a new parameter, a, which allows the transition from the ideally elastic behaviour (low strain regime) to the pure non-linear behaviour (large strain regime) to be modulated. A discussion is carried out on the features of the new solution and on the behaviour of stresses and strains close to and far away from the crack tip.

Abstract This article presents a performance evaluation of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS), in which the system and its components can have different performance levels ranging from perfect functioning to total failure. An original multistate transition process for the FMS's main component, Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools, proposed in the current article and treated as an aging process because of its increasing failure rate is investigated. The Markov reward approach is utilized to analyze the availability of CNC machine tools and sensitivity analysis of each non-operational state to the machine's downtime. To overcome the "state explosion problem" in the subsequent FMS performance evaluation process, an application of the Lz-transform method is proposed to determine the performance evaluation and availability of such aging multistate FMS. An illustrated case is presented to demonstrate the performance evaluation process. The results show that the suggested methods can be implemented in engineering decision making and construction of various aging multistate FMS related to demands, availability, and output performance.

It was found that the grains were severely broken up and elongated by cold rolling, and the degree of the mechanical anisotropy of the Ti6Al4V alloy was increased. For the cold-rolled Ti6Al4V alloy, recovery and recrystallization occurred during annealed treatment under 840 degrees C for 40 min. The thickness reduction ratio of 10% and 30% of the cold-rolled sheets only partially recrystallized. occurred partial recrystallization. When the thickness reduction ratio reaches 50%, the deformation band structure disappears. Compared to the cold rolled Ti6Al4V alloy, the mechanical anisotropy of the annealed Ti6Al4V alloy was weaker, mainly related to the texture components. The (0001) < 10 (1) over bar0 >, ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > and (11 (2) over bar5) < 10 (1) over bar0 > components dominate the texture of the cold rolled Ti6Al4V alloy. Among them, ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > and (11 (2) over bar5) < 10 (1) over bar0 > texture components inherit the original microstructure, and the intensity of that was increased with thickness reduction ratio increased. However, the intensity and volume fraction of the texture ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > components rapidly increased and the intensity of the texture (11 (2) over bar5) < 10 (1) over bar0 > and (0001) < 10 (1) over bar0 > components were weakened by the annealed treatment. During the annealing treatment, the texture component ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > orientation is gradually strengthened by consuming other scatted orientations. In addition, it can be found that an increase in the intensity and volume fraction of ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar0) < 10 (1) over bar0 > texture component has a positive effect on improving the mechanical anisotropy of the Ti6Al4V alloy.					zhang, guihua/GVU-4494-2022	Jiang, Haitao/0000-0003-0974-6629													2053-1591					OCT	2019	6	10							1065b7	10.1088/2053-1591/ab3f89	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab3f89													WOS:000485188300001

The microstructure and hydrogen storage properties of the materials were analyzed systematically by XRD, SEM, EDS, the electrochemical and kinetic measurements. The results show that the crystallinities of the composites with rare earth oxides decrease, and the distribution of the rare earth oxide catalysts on the surface of alloys is uniform. The maximum discharge capacities of the composites with rare earth oxides rise evidently,the discharge capacity of the sample containing Tb4O7 reaches to 871mAh . g(-1) at room temperature, and the composites can also keep higher cycling stability. The CeO2 and Tb4O7 catalysts can enhance the abilities of charge transfer on the surface of alloys, and improve the transmission rate of H atoms in the bulk of Mg2Ni alloy obviously. The rare earth oxides catalysts can also increase the gaseous hydrogen absorption capacity. The hydrogen storage capacity of the sample with Tb4O7 reaches to 2. 02% (mass fraction) at 250 degrees C, which is the maximum hydrogen absorption capacity among these samples, but the hydriding rate is relatively slow at lower temperature. The catalytic effect of the rare earth oxides is mainly related to the changeable valences of the rare earth ions, that is, the more likely of the valences change of the ions, the better the catalytic activities exhibit. The catalytic activities in descending order are Tb4O7, CeO2 and Nd2O3.					tang, cheng/KLD-8823-2024														1001-4381					OCT	2019	47	10					90	96		10.11868/j.issn.1001-4381.2018.000266	http://dx.doi.org/10.11868/j.issn.1001-4381.2018.000266													WOS:000495989300011

The purpose of this paper is to study the relations between the impact resistance and tensile properties of cement-based materials reinforced by polyvinyl alcohol fiber (PVA-FRCM). A drop-weight test and uniaxial tension test were performed. The relations were studied based on the experimental results, including the relation between the blow number and the tensile stress at the first visible cracking (sigma (c)) and the relation between the blow number and the tensile strain at the ultimate failure (epsilon (f)). Results showed that the blow number for the first visible crack for disc impact specimens increases obviously with the increase of sigma (c) of slab specimens. The crater diameter and blow number for ultimate failure of the disc specimens increase with the increase of epsilon (f) of slab specimens. For the PVA-FRCM specimens with larger sigma (c) and epsilon (f), much more blows are needed to cause both the first visible crack and ultimate failure. Polyvinyl alcohol fibers can reinforce impact resistance and tensile properties of cement-based materials.

Experimental results indicate that the initial yield stress of the alloy decreases as the temperature increases, while its work-hardening behavior displays temperature insensitivity. Considering such properties of the alloy, the dependence of the initial critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) on temperature is taken into account in the polycrystal plasticity modelling. Good coincidence is obtained between modelling and the experimental results. The determined values of CRSS for slip systems are comparable to the published data. The proposed polycrystalline model provides an alternative method for better understanding the microstructure-property relationship of alpha + beta titanium alloys at different temperatures in the future.

The introduction of the vinylene group led to clearly redshifted and broader absorption and a smaller bandgap. FICBF-Se and FICBF-SeVi exhibited optical bandgaps of 1.68 and 1.54 eV, respectively. Solar cells using polymer PBDB-T as a donor and FICBF-Se as an acceptor demonstrated a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.25% with a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 11.61 mA cm(-2). However, the device based on PBDB-T/FICBF-SeVi only delivered a PCE of 3.63% with a J(sc) of 9.08 mA cm(-2), which should be mainly because the vinylene group decreased the crystallinity and its active layer morphology showed no distinct phase separation.

J	Zhang, SE; Li, S; Yu, XY				Zhang, Shu-e; Li, Shuai; Yu, Xingyuan			Sensor for measuring the liquid film thickness on the inner wall of a cylindrical cavity	AIP ADVANCES												To measure the steam wetness in a steam turbine accurately, the measurement error caused by the deposited water film on the inner wall of the wetness sensor should be deducted. A hyperbolic slot-shaped resonant cavity sensor for measuring the thickness of the liquid film on the inner wall of a cylindrical cavity is designed in this paper. We establish the relationship between the liquid film thickness and resonant frequency theoretically by the medium perturbation method and verify the feasibility of measuring the liquid film thickness in the TE111 mode. The mathematical model of the current density distribution line at the end of the cavity in the TE111 mode is deduced by the method of the vector field equation. Based on the mathematical model, the sensor is designed by Full-wave simulation software. The simulation results show that the electromagnetic leakage rate of the sensor is basically 0% and the sampling error is no more than -1.3%. The liquid film thickness has a linear relationship with the frequency offsets. The experimental results show that it is feasible to accurately measure the liquid film thickness on the inner wall of a cylindrical cavity by measuring the resonant frequency of the resonator. When the thicknesses of the liquid film are within 100 um, the measuring error does not exceed 0.245, which is about 50% lower than the conductivity method. (c) 2019 Author(s).

This state can be realized using spin-1 and spin-1/2 Heisenberg models and bosonic particles. Here we explore the emergent Haldane phase in an alternating bond Z(3) parafermion chain, which is different from the previous proposals from fundamental statistics and symmetries. We show that this emergent phase can also be characterized by a modified long-range string order, as well as fourfold degeneracy in the ground-state energies and entanglement spectra. This phase is protected by both the charge conjugate and parity symmetry, and the edge modes are shown to satisfy parafermionic statistics in which braiding of the two edge modes yields a 2 pi/3 phase. This model also supports rich phases, including a topological ferromagnetic parafermion (FP) phase, trivial paramagnetic parafermion phase, classical dimer phase, and gapless phase. The boundaries of the FP phase are shown to be gapless and critical with central charge c = 4/5. Even in the topological FP phase, it is also characterized by long-range string order; thus we observe a drop of string order across the phase boundary between the FP phase and the Haldane phase. This work opens a new way for finding of exotic topological phases with parafermions.

The results show that the coarse-grained Ti40 alloy exhibits good superplasticity under the test conditions and the maximum elongation of 436% is obtained under the condition of 840 degrees C, 1 x 10(-3) s(-1). The deformation conditions can be divided into three areas: none superplasticity area, dynamic recovery area and dynamic recrystallization area based on the Zener-Hollomon factor and elongation combined with the microstructure analysis. The critical strain model and dislocation density evolution model of dynamic recrystallization were established based on Sellars model and KM equation, respectively. The dynamic recovery mechanism is dominated by dislocation motion-dislocation cells-polygonization-subgrain formation, while the recrystallization mechanism is mainly the continuous dynamic recrystallization resulting from high-angle grain boundaries caused by the subgrains rotation.

We report an alternating magnetic stirring and ultrasonication process that can effectively reduce the size of particles in the colloid. A two-step spin coating process can improve thin film uniformity. A two-step spin coating process consists of two main steps: aggregation and gradual evolution. Aggregation is achieved by a single coating, which causes the colloidal to particles agglomerate into uneven clusters on the substrate. The gradual evolution step improves the quality of the films by filling the pinholes left by the initial coating.

J	Zhang, ZY; Zhao, JQ; Chi, YX				Zhang, Zhongya; Zhao, Jiaqing; Chi, Yuxi			Single-camera special stereo-digital image correlation applied for accurate virtual fields method identification	STRAIN												A single-camera special stereo-DIC (SS-DIC) is proposed for accurate virtual fields method (VFM) identification. The single-camera SS-DIC allows accurate surface 3D deformation measurements using a single colour camera and a specially designed colour separation device. It not only effectively eliminates the unavoidable out-of-plane movement/rotation due to unideal in-plane loading but also delivers uniformly distributed measurement points that brings great simplicity and convenience for internal virtual work calculation in VFM. In addition, since only a single camera is used for stereovision, the proposed SS-DIC system requires no complicated synchronisation devices. The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method are evaluated by heterogeneous deformation experiments of a holed aluminium alloy and 304 stainless steel plate. Combined with a high-speed colour camera, the proposed method is expected to be a simple and practical method for the calibration of material constitutive model under intermediate and high strain rate conditions using VFM.

The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by measuring the photo-degradation of methylene blue (MB). The components, morphology and surface compositions were investigated. The effects of synthesized temperatures and synthesized atmospheres on photocatalytic degradation of MB were investigated in detail. The photocatalytic results revealed that the ZnO prepared in the aerobic atmosphere at 800 degrees C had the optimum photocatalytic performance. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance of ZnO prepared in aerobic atmosphere with low specific surface area is apparently better than that prepared in anaerobic atmosphere with large specific surface area. This abnormal phenomenon was explained in detail by a physical model. This work provides a new way to obtain ZnO photocatalyst with special morphologies for improving photocatalytic efficiency.					jiangtao, li/HTL-7510-2023; Chen, Hongbing/HJH-2443-2023														2053-1591					OCT	2019	6	10							105043	10.1088/2053-1591/ab3940	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab3940													WOS:000482551800012

At mono- and bilayer thicknesses, hBN can function as a tunnel barrier for electronic spectroscopy measurements. Noise spectroscopy is of particular interest, as noise can be a sensitive probe for electronic correlations not detectable by first-moment current measurements. In addition to the expected Johnson-Nyquist thermal noise and nonequilibrium shot noise, low frequency (<100 kHz) noise measurements in Au/hBN/Au tunneling structures as a function of temperature and bias reveal the presence of thermally excited dynamic defects, as manifested through a flicker noise contribution at high bias that freezes out as temperature is decreased. In contrast, broad-band high frequency (similar to 250MHz - 580MHz) measurements on the same device show shot noise with no flicker noise contribution. The presence of the flicker noise through multiple fabrication approaches and processing treatments suggests that the fluctuators are in the hBN layer itself. Device-to-device variation and the approximate 1/f dependence of the flicker noise constrain the fluctuator density to on the order of a few per square micron. (c) 2019 Author(s).

Effect of melt non-stoichiometry on chromium entry into Cr:Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> crystals	JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH												The study of chromium doped forsterite Cr:Mg2SiO4 laser crystals grown from non-stoichiometric melts has been accomplished. Concentration series of the crystals were grown by Czochralski technique from the melts with different MgO/SiO2 molar ratios. The unit cell parameters of the crystals and their hydrostatic densities were measured, and the actual molar weights of the samples were calculated. Both the revealed hydrostatic densities and the actual molar weights appeared to be essentially less than the corresponding values for the stoichiometric Mg2SiO4. Cr4+ content in the crystals, acquired from the optical absorption spectra, linearly increases with increment of MgO excess in the parent melt within whole studied compositions range, whereas the increment of Cr3+ in the same crystals comes to the saturation. This difference in the Cr4+ and Cr3+ behavior opens the potential possibility to optimize the Cr4+/Cr3+ concentrations ratio and to improve in the future lasing properties of the crystals.

Our results indicate that cellulase concentration is an important parameter for the ethanol fermentation of corn stalks. When the cellulase concentration was 0.30 g/L, the ethanol yield reached a maximum of 39.04 g, and the anaerobic fermentation using the corn stalk residues showed the peak gas production at, as early as, 3 d. Moreover, with this concentration, the methane production per volatile solid (VS) was 26.82 mL.g(-1), and the cumulative gas production was the highest among all experiments, reaching 270.01 mL.g(-1), a high value indicating a high gas-production potential. Through mass balance analysis, we revealed that when the cellulase concentration was 0.30 g/L, the removal efficiency of total solids (TS) and VS (59.12% and 79.07%, respectively) were the highest in the bio-conversion process of corn stalks. This study can serve as a reference for the future ethanol fermentation projects using corn stalks.

Due to its effective and harmless treatment, resource and minimization, the anaerobic fermentation with the restaurant garbage has wide application in the future. In this study, the gas production characteristics have been studied with the change of fermentation system C/N ratio by changing the ratio of sludge and restaurant garbage. In addition, the influence on the fermentation system has been studied. The fermentation technology could thus be optimized by the function simulation of the whole fermentation process. It showed that the addition of sludge could relief the inhibition effect of the system and thus increased the production of methane. The simulated data of gas production were in good agreement with measured data, illustrating that the established model could satisfactorily describe the influence of different ratios of sludge and restaurant garbage on the production of methane. The anaerobic digestion process with the combination of restaurant garbage and sludge could be simulated with satisfactory effect in all, providing information for the anaerobic digestion technology with the combination of restaurant garbage and sludge.

However, there is less research about the interlaminar toughening mechanism of PNF up to now. The finite element model based on cohesive zone model (CZM), which represents the PNF thickness and property, was constructed to predict the delamination onset and propagation of CFRP. In the double cantilever beams test, the main conclusions are as follows: There is little effect of thickness of PNF on the peak load in mode I delamination of CFRP, but the resistance of propagation reaches the maximum when the thickness is equal to 20 mu m. The shape of the delamination front can be directly obtained from the simulations by studying the distribution of the normal traction. For a specific ply-orientation composite, once delamination begins to propagate, the figure of delamination front is consistent. With the increase of the PNF/CFRP ply angle from [0(12)/0(12)] to [0(12)/90(12)], the propagation distance and peak load are reduced correspondingly.

The MLRL is formed by the diffusion of carbon atoms that diffuse from gray cast iron into the TiNb alloy. During the diffusion reaction, the MLRL is gradually formed in situ on the surface of the TiNb alloy. Thus, there is a good bonding interface between the MLRL and the substrate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis indicates that the MLRL is composed of three layers; the outer layer is micro-nano carbide particles, the middle layer is multi-sized carbide particles, and the inner layer is gradient micro-nano carbide particles. EDS results indicate that the different particles have different ratios of Ti/(Ti + Nb). The XRD results indicate that the MLRL is mainly composed of (Ti-x,Nb1-x)C particles; (t)he diffraction peaks are located at 2 theta positions between the corresponding peaks of TiC and NbC. Nanoindention test results show that the hardness of the MLRL obviously increases (compared to that of TiC or NbC); the highest micro-hardness of the MLRL is nearly 2366 HV0.05. Benefited from the solid-solution strengthening, the multi-sized and layered structures, the relationship between the strength and toughness of MLRL can be improved. Meanwhile the high hardness and volume fraction of (Ti-x,Nb1-x)C will obviously enhance the wear resistance of the reinforced layer.					jiangtao, li/HTL-7510-2023	Zhong, Lisheng/0000-0002-3315-0043													2053-1591					OCT	2019	6	10							106512	10.1088/2053-1591/ab348a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ab348a													WOS:000480302300012

The addition of MgO in excess of its solubility in the FeCo alloy results in the formation of amorphous grain boundaries, leading to a dramatic increase of the resistivity with values over 20 times that of pure FeCo films. As a result, a large self-bias ferromagnetic resonance frequency f(FMR) of up to 9.87 GHz is obtained in the absence of an external magnetic field (H = 0 A/m) and an electric field tuning frequency range of 4.55 GHz was achieved in the as-deposited films at an electric field of 7 kV/cm. The high resistivity and high fFMR in these heterostructures provide great opportunities for application in self-bias tunable monolithic microwave integrated circuit devices.

The oxide thickness and roughness were investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, and its composition was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was observed that after the fast growth of thin oxide layer with the thickness 1.7 nm the growth of oxide layer is proportional to a square root of the immersion time. The oxidation was described by a model in which the oxidation rate is limited by the drift of positive Cd ions from the CdTe-oxide interface into water. The penetration of Na and erosion of CdTe immersed in saturated NaCl solution was investigated by secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements on samples treated in NaCl solution for different time intervals.

Specifically, float glass was used as the insert, Chemlok CH456 and CH489 were utilized as the glass primer, and soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was adopted as the material for injection molding. The adhesive force of the mounting brackets was measured, and the adhesive behavior of the mounting brackets was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicated that the adhesive force of the mounting brackets obtained by insert injection molding can be as high as 1027 N. The results showed that the primer located in fracture regions was torn from PVC and the glass. Double-interface adhesion was found between the glass, the primer, and PVC. In particular, the primer and the glass surface formed strong adhesion by mechanical locking, diffusion existed between PVC and the primer, and the diffusion depth was greater than 10 mu m. This process greatly shortens the production cycle of the mounting brackets for auto safety glass and greatly improves the adhesive quality of the mounting brackets.																			0021-8464	1545-5823				APR 4	2021	97	5					456	476		10.1080/00218464.2019.1670168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218464.2019.1670168		SEP 2019											WOS:000488175300001

Multiple scattering enabled superdirectivity from a subwavelength ensemble of resonators	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												An ensemble of resonators arranged on a subwavelength scale is usually considered as a bulk effective medium, known as a metamaterial, and can offer unusual macroscopic properties. Here, we take a different approach and limit ourselves to the study of only a few number of such elementary components and demonstrate that they still offer uncommon opportunities. Typically, owing to the multiple scattering and the phase shift that the resonances offer, we observe fields that vary at scales completely independent of the wavelength in free space. By smartly tuning the resonance frequencies, we can design at will the complex current distribution in those resonators. This way, we design a superdirective antenna, i.e., an antenna that is surprisingly more directive than its size would foreshadow. This approach is verified numerically and experimentally in the context of microwaves, but this applies to any wave field where subwavelength resonators exist.

A reference compound of a typical tread recipe, filled with silica and carbon black, was used as a reference due to the acknowledged effect of TESPT in silica incorporation in elastomers. A silica sample without silane was also prepared. Silica was then completely substituted by MK, producing two samples, with and without silane. The samples were tested for crosslink density, rheometry, and morphology, and the vulcanization reaction parameters were determined and evaluated. Silane improved the interaction between MK and the polymer matrix, evidenced by the increase in crosslink density and vulcanization reaction rate, the same effect silane causes on silica-filled composites.

On the other hand, MK seems not to be as reinforcing as silica, considering that maximum torque is related to the stiffness of the material, with MK exhibiting lower values for this parameter.

J	Szabó, G; Váradi, K				Szabo, Gyula; Varadi, Karoly			Instability analysis of a filament-wound composite tube subjected to compression/bending	ADVANCED COMPOSITES LETTERS												The aim of this study is to investigate the global buckling of a relatively long composite cord-rubber tube subjected to axial compression and its cross-sectional instability due to bending by a macromechanical nonlinear finite element (FE) model (nonlinear buckling analysis). Composite reinforcement layers are modelled as transversely isotropic ones, while elastomer liners are described by a hyperelastic material model that assumes incompressibility. Force-displacement, equivalent strain, equivalent stress results along with oblateness and curvature results for the complete process have been presented. It is justified that bending leads to ovalization of the cross section and results in a loss of the load-carrying capacity of the tube. Strain states in reinforcement layers have been presented, which imply that the probable failure modes of the reinforcement layers are both delamination and yarn-matrix debonding. There is a significant increase in strains due to cross-sectional instability, which proves that the effect of cross-sectional instability on material behaviour of the tube is crucial. A parametric analysis has been performed to investigate the effect of the member slenderness ratio on cross-sectional instability of the composite tube. It shows that Brazier force is inversely proportional to the slenderness ratio. It further shows that higher oblateness parameters occur in case of a lower slenderness ratio and that cross-sectional instability takes place at a lower dimensionless displacement in case of a lower slenderness ratio. FE results have been validated by a compression/bending test experiment conducted on a tensile test machine.

The thickness of the (i) a-Si:H buffer layer is varied between 2 and 50 nm, well beyond the values used in heterojunction solar cells. The change in this thickness plays a role on band bending at the heterointerface and therefore impacts the level of inversion of carrier population at the c-Si surface. Measurements are compared with 1D analytical calculations and 2D electrical modeling. It is demonstrated that the deep defect density, related to silicon dangling bonds, in the (i) a-Si:H layer strongly increases from 1 x 10(17) to 4 x 10(18) cm(-3) when the (i) a-Si:H layer thickness is decreased from 50 to 2 nm. This result is interpreted in terms of defect formation and dependence of the defect density upon the position of the Fermi level with respect to the valence band edge. Quantitative analysis in the framework of the defect-pool model demonstrates that the strong increase of defect density is also promoted by an increase in the width of the valence band tail in the thin (i) a-Si:H layer, suggesting that a very thin layer also suffers from increased disorder.

J	Moon, KW; Kim, C; Yoon, J; Hwang, C				Moon, Kyoung-Woong; Kim, Changsoo; Yoon, Jungbum; Hwang, Chanyong			Deterministic switching of magnetization by chiral buckling	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												The current-induced magnetization dynamics is an important subject in spintronics research. It contains many interesting physical phenomena and has a high potential for spintronic applications. Most magnetic memory devices are based on the magnetization switching operation. Thus, finding the switching mechanism, as well as the exact understanding of it, is an essential implement for spintronic devices. Here, we show that the current can switch the magnetization via chiral buckling. To destabilize the uniform magnetization, a critical current value is needed. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) produces a shift in this critical current and the sign of this shift also depends on the domain polarity. Thus, a certain current can select a certain domain polarity. During the switching process, a fluctuation of magnetization is exponentially amplified by the current that forms the magnetization buckling. We explain these phenomena by linear stability analysis and show that two distinct switching operations are possible depending on the DMI.

The high concentration of the H-atoms in the plasma assist the silicon atoms on the growing film surface to crystallize. Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) method was used to determine the nano-scale structures of nc-SiOx:H thin films, for varying hydrogen dilution ratios. The size, shape and the distribution of the nano-formations are found to depend strongly on the preparation conditions. From FTIR absorption and Raman scattering experiments, atomic oxygen and hydrogen contents and also the crystal ratio of the samples are evaluated. As results of nano-structural analyses, the morphologies, sizes and distributions of the nano-aggregations are found to be closely related to the crystallization of the films. From the SAXS results of the samples prepared at the hydrogen dilution ratio of 90%, the nano-aggregations are found to form in uniformly distributed core-shells. However, as the hydrogen dilution is increased to higher ratios to 95% and further to 99%, the nano-scaled fractals are deduced to form. The oxygen and hydrogen contents in nc-SiOx:H are strictly related to the crystal ratio of the samples. The crystal ratio is determined by the hydrogen dilution ratio during the deposition. The two-phase structure of nc-SiOx:H samples and the dependence on the hydrogen dilution ratio may suggest these materials are candidates for phase change materials. Depending on the deposition parameters, smaller nc-Si structures may be prepared which may have different (lower) electron densities required to melt the amorphous region and make the phase change possible due to explosive crystallization.

Glass nanoparticles (NPs) were modified with (3-mercaptopropyl) trimetoxisilane followed by the graft polymerisation of N,N-dimethylacrylamide and allylamine and then with bromoacetic acid. The grafted polymers on the glass NPs were characterised by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and elemental analysis. Surface morphology was investigated via transmission electron microscopy. The optimum pH for cadmium adsorption and the adsorption capacity of the nanoadsorbent were 6.5 and 46.70 mg g(-1), respectively.

J	Roy, A; Mohanta, B				Roy, Alok; Mohanta, Bidhan			Facile phyto-mediated synthesis of gold nanoparticles using <i>Eupatorium odoratum</i> leaf extract and its size-dependent catalytic activity	MICRO & NANO LETTERS												In this work, gold nanoparticles have been prepared using the leaf extract of Eupatorium odoratum assisted with microwave irradiation. The role of pH on the synthesis of gold nanoparticles has also been studied. At higher value of pH, size of nanoparticles got highly diminished, going below 10 nm. A probable mechanism of formation of such small nanoparticles has been proposed in this Letter. The effects of different parameters such as reaction time, temperature and pH variation on the final morphology of gold nanoparticles have been investigated. The characterisation of the samples has been carried out by transmission electron microscope, UV-Vis absorption spectroscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscope and zeta potential analysis. Further, a comparative study of catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles of two different sizes was performed by monitoring the reduction of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Experimental study showed that smaller nanoparticles are more efficient in their catalytic activity than their larger counter parts. The consistency in sizes and shapes, higher stability and rapid synthesis are the major advantages of this synthesis method. Thus, this procedure of synthesis of gold nanoparticles may offer an attractive alternative to the existing ones and opens a full range of possibilities for various analytical applications.																				1750-0443				SEP 25	2019	14	11					1163	1168		10.1049/mnl.2019.0020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/mnl.2019.0020													WOS:000489576900009

In this work, electrodes were exposed to a simulated dissolver solution containing a representative fraction of low-activity actinides and fission products in 11.5 N nitric acid in a mock-up of the service dissolver vessel. Platinum nanoparticles were coated onto anodised titanium coupons through a seed-mediated hydrothermal method. The coated coupons were then exposed in the simulated dissolver solution for about 1185 h at 110 degrees C. Morphological and compositional analyses confirmed the presence of metallic Pt nanoparticles on the electrode surface with some localised cracking. The electrochemically active surface area of the Pt-nanoparticle coated anodised titanium coupon after exposure was found to be twice that of polycrystalline platinum thus establishing the durability and efficiency of the coating on the electrode.

The catalytic efficiency of the as-prepared AgNPs-decorated Fe3O4@C particles was evaluated using a model reaction based on the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) by an excess of NaBH4. The kinetic data of the reduction reaction could be explained by the assumption of a pseudo-first-order reaction with regard to 4-NP. Also the particles are catalytically more active due to their extremely high-density AgNPs immobilised on the surfaces of Fe3O4@C particles. Significantly, the Fe3O4@C@Ag catalysts can be easily separated from the reaction media by applying an external magnet, and can be reused for several cycles.

Robustness of superconducting properties to transition metal substitution and impurity phases in Fe<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>V<i><sub>x</sub></i>Se	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We have performed transverse- and zero-field muon spin rotation/relaxation experiments, as well as magnetometry measurements, on samples of Fe1-xVxSe and their Li + NH3 intercalates Li-0.6(NH2)(0.2) (NH3)(0.8) Fe1-xVxSe. We examine the low vanadium substitution regime: x = 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02. The intercalation reaction significantly increases the critical temperature (T-c) and the superfluid stiffness for all x. The nonintercalated samples all exhibit T-c approximate to 8.5 K while the intercalated samples all show an enhanced T-c > 40 K. Vanadium substitution has a negligible effect on T-c, but seems to suppress the superfluid stiffness for the nonintercalated samples and weakly enhance it for the intercalated materials. The optimal substitution level for the intercalated samples is found to be x = 0.01, with T-c approximate to 41 K and lambda(ab)(0) approximate to 0.18 mu m. The nonintercalated samples can be modeled with either a single d-wave superconducting gap or with an anisotropic gap function based on recent quasiparticle imaging experiments, whereas the intercalates display multigap nodal behavior which can be fitted using s + d- or d + d-wave models. Magnetism, likely from iron impurities, appears after the intercalation reaction and coexists and competes with the superconductivity. However, it appears that the superconductivity is remarkably robust to the impurity phase, providing an avenue to stably improve the superconducting properties of transition metal substituted FeSe.

Herein, we developed a novel catalyst through a one-pot hydrothermal process combined with an ion-exchange method to synthesize Cu-SSZ-13/HT-SiC composite and applied in denitration catalytic reaction. TMAdaOH and Cu-TEPA were used as templates to prepare the precursor for Cu-SSZ-13, respectively. Results showed that, with participation of HT-SiC, SSZ-13 crystal was successfully obtained by using TMAdaOH template, while it would get only amorphous structure by using Cu-TEPA template. NH3-SCR(Selective Catalytic Reduction, SCR) exhibited catalytic activity and stability of Cu-SSZ-13/HT-SiC in medium and high temperature zones was more effective than those of Cu-SSZ-13 without HT-SiC, and NO consumption by the former was about 11-fold of the latter at 500 degrees C. Moreover, compared with Cu-SSZ-13/alpha-SiC catalyst prepared with pure SiC (alpha-SiC), Cu-SSZ-13/HT-SiC shows better catalytic activity in the whole temperature range. These favorable performances are attributed not only to the good thermal conductivity and thermal stability of SiC, but also to the 7.34wt% Fe component contained in HT-SiC, which acts as an active site for reducing NO in NH3-SCR. This method not only provides a way to reuse the SiC waste, but also enhances denitrification activity of Cu-SSZ-13 in medium and high operating temperature.

The photocatalytic degradation ability of B-T/GFC composite in organic pollutants cutting waste solution is better than those of pure black TiO2 (B-T) and P25.

The valence electron structure (VES) parameters that affect adiabatic shearing sensitivity were studied in this paper. The results show the bond energy and lattice electron number are related to adiabatic shearing sensitivity. Adiabatic shearing sensitivity increases with the increase of bond energy, and the decrease of lattice electron number. For pure copper, the bond energy is smaller and the lattice electron number is higher, so its adiabatic shearing sensitivity is low. The shape of chip is approximate ribbon. For aluminum bronze (QAl9-4), the bond energy is increased and the lattice electron number is decreased due to aluminum (Al) addition, so its adiabatic shearing sensitivity is higher than that of pure copper. The serrated chip divided uniformly by Adiabatic Shear Band (ASB) was formed. The basis can be provided for optimizing process parameters, improving and selecting materials with different cutting performance by studying the specific alloy elements on the influence of adiabatic shearing sensitivity to predict the chip morphology to some extent in VES level.					li, jinquan/GYV-2960-2022	li, jinquan/0000-0002-5396-7851													1091-0344	1532-2483				JAN 2	2020	24	1					26	41		10.1080/10910344.2019.1652309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10910344.2019.1652309		SEP 2019											WOS:000487112500001

Silicon carbide (SiC) formation occurred in all cases and was slightly favored in the case of microwave heating under Ar/H-2. The resulting microstructures were influenced by the heating process and atmosphere; the SiC existed in the form of needles with conventional heating under vacuum. SiC small polygonal grains were present after microwave heating under Ar/H-2. Both the atmosphere and the electromagnetic field influence the SiC morphology. Despite this difference, the hardness and toughness of composites obtained by both heating techniques were similar.

Comparison of downward and upward offshoring strategies in changing consumers' brand perception by brand tiers	JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE												Offshoring strategies raise a critical question to defining the country images of brands, as offshoring results in discrepancies between the country-of-brand origin (COB) and the country-of-manufacture (COM) by relocating COM from the home to another country. Based on cognitive dissonance theory and social exchange theory, this study assesses the outcomes of apparel brands' differing types of offshoring strategies by tracing consumers' brand perception as these change after the revelation of offshoring information, particularly by comparing those outcomes between an upscale brand and a midmarket brand. Results from an experimental study revealed that a brand originating from a developed country's offshoring from a developing country can significantly decrease brand credibility and prestige, while a brand originating from an emerging country's offshoring from a developed country does not significantly improve those brand assets in either the upscale or the midmarket brand contexts. The paper concludes with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications along with suggestions for future research.

Alumina powder synthesis was achieved by a low cost process (recrystallisation of alum).The effect of the pore forming agent on the true porosity, bulk density and thermal conductivity of porous alumina was characterized. The results show that the true porosity increased with the increasing addition of yeast cells. The bulk density and thermal conductivity at room temperature decreased with the increasing yeast addition. A genetic algorithm method was used to minimize the thermal conductivity of the macro-porous alumina based on the amount of yeast cells used, the sintering temperature, and the hold time. The genetic algorithm found that the best thermal conductivity achievable was equal to 0.152 Watt/m. degrees C at 20wt% concentration of yeast, a sintering temperature of 1230 degrees C and 1.5 hours of soaking time. The experimental value was 0.14 Watt/m. degrees C and the slight variance between these values were postulated to be due to experimental error in the measurements.

Visualizing Biomaterial Degradation by <i>Candida albicans</i> Using Embedded Luminescent Molecules To Report on Substrate Digestion and Cellular Uptake of Hydrolysate	ACS APPLIED BIO MATERIALS												Microbial pathogens use hydrolases as a virulence strategy to spread disease through tissues and colonize medical device surfaces; however, visualizing this process is a technically challenging problem. To better understand the role of secreted fungal hydrolases and their role in Candida albicans virulence, we developed an in situ model system using luminescent Re(I) and Ir(III) containing probe molecules embedded in a biodegradable (poly(lactic-coglycolic acid), PLGA) polymer and tracked their uptake using epifluorescent imaging. We found that secretion of esterases can explain how physically embedded probes are acquired by fungal cells through the degradation of PLGA since embedded probes could not be liberated from nonbiodegradable polystyrene (PS). It was important to verify that epifluorescent imaging captured the fate of probe molecules rather than naturally occurring fungal autofluorescence. For this, we exploited the intense luminescent signals and long spectral relaxation times of the Re and Ir containing probe molecules, resolved in time using a gated imaging system. Results provide a visual demonstration of a key virulence trait of C. albicans: the use of hydrolases as a means to degrade materials and acquire hydrolysis products during fungal growth and hyphal development. These results help to explain the role of nonspecific hydrolases using a degradable material that is relevant to the study of fungal pathogenesis on biotic (tissues) surfaces. Additionally, understanding how fungal pathogens condition surfaces by using nonspecific hydrolases is important to the study of fungal attachment on abiotic surfaces, the first step in biofilm formation on medical devices.

Oxidative Degradation of Polypropylene Mesh in <i>E. coli</i> Environment	ACS APPLIED BIO MATERIALS												Medical implants of polypropylene (PP) are commonly used in many surgical procedures to support tissues. Previous studies on polypropylene meshes removed from patients demonstrated biodegradation relative to the amount of time after implantation. Among the many possible factors, bacterial colonization is believed to be one of the causes for the biodegradation of PP. To gain insights on this hypothesis, PP mesh samples were tested in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) media containing Escherichia coli (E. coli) to observe possible degradation in a controlled single-organism environment. Mesh samples were immersed in either an LB media with E. coli or a control solution, and the biodegradation was measured at 1-, 2-, and 3-month intervals. The samples were then harvested from both LB media with E. coli and the control media for analysis, and results were then compared with pristine polypropylene mesh. The experimental results demonstrate qualitative and quantitative bioerosion, increased oxygen content, and enhanced hydrophilicity over the surface of the mesh structure, thus confirming the oxidative degradation in vitro.					; Biewer, Michael/A-4332-2018	Gamage, Prabhath/0000-0003-2975-0908; Biewer, Michael/0000-0001-5249-6341; Stefan, Mihaela/0000-0003-2475-4635													2576-6422					SEP 16	2019	2	9					4027	4036		10.1021/acsabm.9b00547	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsabm.9b00547								35021336					WOS:000616371400034
J	Walani, N; Agrawal, A				Walani, Nikhil; Agrawal, Ashutosh			Stability of lipid membranes with orthotropic symmetry	MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS												Lipid membranes routinely undergo protein-mediated morphological remodeling during vital processes such as cellular transport and division. These membrane remodeling proteins can be broadly classified into two categories: one that generates a spherical shape and another that generates a cylindrical shape. To gain physical insights into membrane shape transitions, it is important to investigate the stability of membranes in the presence of these two types of proteins. However, the existing membrane theory is mostly restricted to the class of membranes that interact with the sphere shape-generating proteins and possess isotropic symmetry. In this work, we use curvature elasticity of the lipid membranes to derive the stability criterion for membranes that interact with the cylindrical-shape-generating proteins that possess orthotropic symmetry. We derive the convexity condition followed by the stability criterion for a generalized form of strain energy that can entertain material heterogeneity. The proposed framework would allow for a rigorous analysis of a broader set of membrane-protein interactions during key cellular processes.

Crystallization rate is classified into 3 stages based on the doping time, the mechanisms involved, and the rate determining step. The crystallization rate is saturated at around 10 mu m/h after 2 min doping time. The main mechanism for the rate saturation is due to the high internal epsilon-field caused by the heavy doping. The direction of the internal epsilon-field in the case of p-type doping is opposite to that of n-type doping, which causes the final saturated crystallization rate to be higher in the case of p-type doping, and lower in the case of n-type doping, compared to the intrinsic a-Si. The B2H6-doped samples with an epsilon-field show an uni-directional needle network microstructure with a preferred orientation of < 111 > direction in (110) plane. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Both sulfides have the same crystallographic phase, based on the monoclinic Cr3S4 type structure and vary in atomic coordinates; FeTi2S4 retains the ideal atomic positions proposed for the Cr3S4 phase, while in Fe2TiS4 the metal displacements from ideal sites are noticeable. Mossbauer spectra reveal different magnetic behaviors; in FeTi2S4 there is a transition from paramagnetic to magnetic ordering at temperature Tc = 145 K, giving rise to unusually low hyperfine magnetic field of 2.5 T (at 77 K) if compared with values of iron magnetic moments reported previously, this behavior is explained on the basis of blocking Fe localized magnetic moments by the Spin density wave (SDW) originated from 3d Ti atoms. In Fe2TiS4 a transition from paramagnetic to (SDW) arises at Tc = 290 K, the SDW is spread in both Fe and Ti metals through [1 0 1] crystallographic plane and undergoes a transition of first order from Incommensurate SDW (ISWD) to Commensurate SDW (CSDW) at T-IG = 255 K. The atomic positions in the unit cell are correlated to the magnetic behavior in both sulfides.

J	Fortin, P; Holdcroft, S				Fortin, Patrick; Holdcroft, Steven			Energy level alignment and interfacial dipole layer formation at the P3HT:PCBM-Electrolyte interface in organic photoelectrochemical cells	SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS												The influence of PCBM on the electronic energy levels of P3HT:PCBM photocathodes was investigated in a nonaqueous electrolyte using a benzoquinone redox couple. The presence of PCBM introduces a density of interface states at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, consequently leading to the formation of an interfacial dipole layer and decrease in the built-in potential developed at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface. Photoelectrochemical measurements reveal a decrease in photovoltage from 0.26 V to 0.16 V and cathodic shift in onset potential from -0.27 V to -0.34 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) as PCBM content of the P3HT:PCBM photocathode is increased from 0 through 50 wt%. Additionally, depletion layer widths decreased from 90 nm to 50 nm. When the thickness of the active layer was controlled to coincide with the depletion layer thickness (e.g., 90 nm), photocurrent densities at pristine P3HT photocathodes were found to be higher than for P3HT:PCBM photocathodes. This suggests that the built-in electric field within the active layer is seemingly capable of effective exciton dissociation in the absence of a fullerene acceptor.

Their crystalline structure and phase purity were examined by X-ray diffraction and Raman analysis. The evolution of HfxZn1-xO in rod-like configuration was inferred through scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The band gap values of HfxZn1-xO were estimated using Tauc's plot to be around 2.89-3.11 eV. The association of multiple defects within the hafnia based nanorods was further substantiated through luminescence results via sub-band signals in near visible region. Nyquist and bode plots of HfxZn1-xO nanorods were extracted from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic results to evaluate the role of grain boundaries on their conductivity values. The electrical properties of HfxZn1-xO nanorods including their carrier density were estimated by capacitance vs. voltage (1/C-2 vs. V) measurements. The photoswitching potential of n-HfxZn1-xO was investigated by spin casting the nanostructures on p-Si and investigating the diode's charge transfer characteristics.

After silicon doping with an optimized electron concentration, thin-film layer of GaN showed exceptional electrical properties including charge carrier mobility of 161 cm(2) V(-1)s(-1), electrical conductivity of 1.4x10(6) S cm(-1), and sheet resistance of 11.1 Omega cm(-2). Organic solar cells based on n-GaN exhibited power conversion efficiency comparable to those based on a conventional ITO/ZnO bilayered cathode. Furthermore, the n-GaN substrates exhibited reusability; due to excellent chemical stability of n-GaN, the reconstructed organic solar cells maintained their initial performance after the substrates were recycled.

Secondly, the gel transforms into urchin-like hollow microspheres precursor through a solvent-induced self-transformation process. Finally, Al2O3:Eu3+ hollow microsphere phosphors are obtained after a low temperature calcination procedure.

Development and qualification of a computer-aided method for the evaluation of failure modes in adhesively bonded joints	JOURNAL OF ADHESION												Many destructive test methods are used to prove the resistance against loads occurring in a bonded joint during its life cycle. In addition to the determined mechanical properties, the evaluation of the failure behavior is an important quality criterion. Maximum adhesive strength is achieved with cohesive failure and this joint strength can be predicted. Based on this fact it is more important to determine the failure percentages objectively and reproducibly. In addition, adhesive-specific, characteristic structures are formed in cohesive fracture surfaces which indicate the failure-relevant, locally acting loads. In industrial practice, there is no evaluation method to objectively evaluate and analyze the failure ratio of an adhesively bonded joint. The innovation of the developed, computer-aided analysis of the fracture surfaces involves the objective determination of the failure ratio according to international standards and the further analysis of the failure-relevant fracture processes. This enables the adhesive user to evaluate a large number of test specimens in a time-efficient, objective and automated manner. The automated evaluation method calculates the failure mode proportions based on digital images of the fracture surface. The segmentation and classification use a histogram-based color differentiation. The region growing algorithms were optimized and tested with a database of different adhesives and materials. Furthermore, it is possible to get knowledge about load conditions of the destroyed joint by analyzing the fracture surface. To quantify the relationship between load conditions and the resulting fracture structure a topographical 3d method and a 2d imaging method is investigated. The differentiation between the load angle and testing temperatures shows significant, adhesive-specific characteristics.

J	Shin, D; Fischetti, MV; Demkov, AA				Shin, Donghan; Fischetti, Massimo, V; Demkov, Alexander A.			Electron pairing by remote-phonon scattering in oxide-supported graphene	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Using first-principles calculations we have previously shown that placing graphene on a (111)-oriented perovskite SrTiO3 (STO) surface provides a possible doping mechanism [D. Shin and A. A. Demkov, Phys. Rev. B 97, 075423 (2018)]. Further theoretical analysis presented here suggests that coupling of electrons in graphene to interfacial hybrid plasmon/optical modes via remote-phonon scattering may result in an effective attractive electron-electron interaction that, in turn, could lead to electron pairing and superconductivity. Specifically, we consider top-gated graphene supported by STO. Using the full dynamic polarizability within the random phase approximation for the entire system (including the hybrid modes arising from the coupling of the graphene plasmons to the optical phonons of the STO substrate and gate insulator), we estimate the superconducting transition temperature in the strong-coupling limit.																			2469-9950	2469-9969				SEP 13	2019	100	12							125417	10.1103/PhysRevB.100.125417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.100.125417													WOS:000485762700005

Each system is connected to source and drain particle reservoirs and the electron-photon coupling is described by the Tavis-Cummings model. The generalized master equation approach provides the reduced density operator of the double system in the dressed-states basis. It is shown that the photon-mediated coupling between the two subsystems leaves a signature on their transient and steady-state currents. In particular, a suitable bias applied on subsystem S-b induces a photon-assisted current in the other subsystem S-a which is otherwise in the Coulomb blockade. We also predict that a transient current passing through one subsystem triggers a charge transfer between the optically active levels of the second subsystem even if the latter is not connected to the leads. As a result of backaction, the transient current through the open system develops Rabi oscillations (ROs) whose period depends on the initial state of the closed system.

In particular, probing distortions in the Cu-O bonding is of great importance for exploring the coupling between the charge and the lattice, a key mechanism for superconductivity and other functionality in correlated materials. Here we study a superlattice modulation in the Tb2Cu0.83Pd0.17O4 "214" material, which possesses no superconductivity itself but has the parent structure of the R2CuO4 (R = a rare-earth element) superconducting cuprate group. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we find that this superlattice modulation is formed by Cu ion displacements in a direction perpendicular to the Cu-O planes. The superlattice modulation undergoes a reversible electronic smectic-nematic phase transition under electron-beam illumination. With the help of in situ TEM results, our findings imply that the superlattice modulation in this material arises from spatially modulated charge ordering at the Cu sites.

Although the method is simple, the phenomenon itself requires the control of many parameters that change throughout the process. Therefore, we require a unified understanding of polymers for the fabrication of ordered porous films. In this study, to clarify the required molecular structures of polymers to form a regular porous structure, we systematically explored poly(methacrylate)s with cyanobiphenyl moieties connected by dodecyl groups in the side chain (P11CB); these could form a hexagonal ordered porous structure on the entire film surface. The comparison of P11CB and P11B, which is a P11CB without cyano groups, showed that the local polar groups in hydrophobic polymers promote the formation of ordered porous films. Furthermore, no holes were formed in films of P0CB which is a P11CB without alkyl spacers due to its hydrophilicity. Long alkyl chains resulted in changed hydrophilic polymers to hydrophobic polymers. The introduction of long alkyl chains as a spacer between the biphenyl moiety and polymer backbone is preferred in the cases of particularly few amounts of biphenyl groups in the polymer. The biphenyl groups showed the ability to improve film formability.

The observation and the follow-up of the loading history and the characterization of the damage accumulation were evaluated in the presence of an artificial surface defect. The results made it possible to highlight a strong nonlinearity of the damage accumulation. However, the absence of sequence effects encountered in a defect-free material has been found. In the perspective of developing an approach to evaluate the influence of the defects on cumulative damage under variable amplitude loading, this work consists of coupling a multiaxial fatigue criterion adapted to defective materials with a law of uniaxial damage solicited under variable amplitudes loading. A cumulative damage law has been used to analyze the validity of the proposed method. Introducing the equivalent multiaxial fatigue stress due to the presence of the defect allowed us to predict the residual lifetime of a defective material, and to find the effects of sequences usually observed for variable amplitude loading for the defect-free material. A coherent agreement is observed between the results predicted by the improved model and those obtained from the experimental investigations on specimens containing artificial surface defect subjected to purely alternating tension and torsion under increasing and decreasing load levels.

The study incorporates a polymerization process that produces a cross-linking of the PANI chains, yielding an extended disordered branched lattice. The presence of the phenazine structure is fundamental and allows the polymer to acquire extra dimensions, which permits a transition to the metallic phase when doping is increased as the Fermi level goes through the mobility edge into a region of extended states. This PANI system is described assuming that the polymerization process gives rise to a structure that could be represented by a Bethe lattice. It is observed, as indicated by the experiments, that the conductivity increases as a function of the pH of the acid solution when agents like bipolarons are introduced.

However, TFE molecules undergo bond cleavage and ionization in the presence of the RF-CF4 plasma environment. The abundant fluorine radicals grafted onto the paper surface, via the substitution and opening of the bonds in the cellulose polymers, yielded CFx (x: 1-3) functionalities, as observed by XPS and ATR-FTIR analyses. Lower power (100 W) and treatment times (0.5 min) were sufficient to obtain very highly fluorinated surfaces. The change in the morphology of the surface by the exposure to plasma was complicated because the localized deposition and re-deposition of the plasma-generated molecules on the paper were superimposed on the surface reactions and degradation (etching) at the paper surface.

Using a dimensional- and momentum-cutoff regularized renormalization group and unbiased large-scale Monte Carlo numerical simulations, we establish the phase diagram for the S = 1 impurity with all relevant terms included. We show that a threefold-degenerate S = 1 impurity coupled to a critical bath has a nondegenerate ground state with a quantized charge, in qualitative contrast to the spin-1/2 case where the impurity is partially screened. We then argue that all impurities with odd-2S degeneracy share the same universal physics as the spin-1/2 case and all impurities with even-2S degeneracy are the same as the spin-1 case. We validate our conjecture with unbiased Monte Carlo simulations up to S = 2. A physical consequence of this even-odd effect is that two spin-1/2 impurities in the critical bath form a long-range entangled state at a low temperature, which can be realized in ultracold atoms in an optical lattice.

On construction of SPD stress-strain curve for bronze Cu85-Pb5-Sn5-Zn5	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING												Stress-strain (SS) curve is a necessary ingredient of any mathematical model describing metal forming processes. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) imposes additional requirements on SS-tests because some of deformation mechanisms, such as shear band sliding, micro-cracks, etc., prove to be suppressed due to specific character of stress-strain state: complex loading path, all-round high pressure, and high gradients of stress and strain tensor fields. In this work, a novel method of SPD SS-curve construction combining the classical uniaxial compression test with microhardness measurements is proposed. The barreling effect is negligibly small owing to specific experimental conditions. This renders spatially uniform the stress-strain state and allows avoiding the inverse finite element modeling. The cast leaded tin bronze alloy Cu85-Pb5-Sn5-Zn5 has been studied during upsetting process. An experimental force-displacement diagram appears to be strictly linear up to the moment of destruction under uniaxial compression. The dendritic structure evolution in both axial and cross sections of a cylindrical sample was studied by optical microscope. Local distortions in elements of this structure are evidence of spatial fluctuations in plastic strain at macroscopic level. Microhardness in these sections was also measured. Shear bands appear at strain epsilon(p) approximate to 0.14 and they are responsible of the softening behavior. In this work, softening is contrary to the experiments on deep rolling treatment where the monotonic increase in microhardness was observed. Microhardness measurements allow expanding the total strain into dislocation sliding and shear band sliding summands. This expansion makes it possible to discard the shear band sliding item and obtain an initial segment of SS-curve (up to strain epsilon(p) = 0.32 for bronze Cu85-Pb5-Sn5-Zn5) available for SPD simulation.

J	Wakayama, H				Wakayama, Hiroaki			Nanoscale Structures and Hydrogen Storage Capacity of Fe-C-H Produced by Milling Graphite with Steel Balls in a Hydrogen Atmosphere	JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS												To elucidate the influence of Fe on the interaction between carbon and hydrogen in graphite nanocrystals, graphite nanocrystals were mechanically milled with steel balls in a hydrogen atmosphere, and the potential of the material produced to store hydrogen was evaluated. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra revealed that milling reduced the graphene size and increased the average distance between graphene layers. Elemental analysis showed that milling increased both the H/C and Fe/C ratios in the material. After being milled in a hydrogen atmosphere, samples released hydrogen at a lower temperature than before milling. Thermal decomposition occurred in two stages-235 to 475 degrees C and 692 to 749 degrees C-and yielded a total of 1.0 wt% hydrogen. It is hypothesized that these two stages corresponded to hydrogen released from Fe3C structures and from the Fe-catalyzed graphitization reaction, respectively. Before milling, samples slowly released a total of 0.5 wt% hydrogen over a temperature range from about 300 to over 900 degrees C. Fe-C-H materials are attractive for hydrogen storage because they are composed of carbon and iron, which are inexpensive and abundant elements on Earth, and they have a high hydrogen weight density of 11 wt%.

Since repeated deposition simulates the factory-scale in-line processing, amorphous aluminum-doped SiOxNy layers with thickness of about 250 nm were deposited by reactive pulsed DC sputtering in a multi-pass process with repeated linear movement of a glass substrate under an Al-alloyed Si target. Using specular X-ray reflectivity we show periodic fluctuations of the material density throughout the entire thickness of the resulting coating. The number of periods corresponds to the number of passes of the substrate through the plasma of the magnetron. Fitting results suggest a model consistent with a periodic alternation of the O/N ratio. These subtle stoichiometric fluctuations in the SiOxNy layer composition were confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis with nanoscale resolution, and with detailed elemental maps of characteristic X-rays of the layered cross-section. Our study demonstrates the superior sensitivity of the relatively simple nondestructive X-ray reflectivity method for industrial line-process inspection compared to ellipsometry.

To reveal the bond nature of the Raman red shift in complex-alloyed nanocrystals, we propose the concept of a basic bond unit for nanocrystalline alloy systems. An alloyed nanocrystal can be decomposed into basic bond units according to a bond-by-bond approach. A local-mode model of alloyed nanocrystals is developed, which is applied to determine the Raman red shift of the destination bonds in a basic bond unit. Using this theory, the Raman spectra of CdSexS1-x nanocrystals are obtained. The calculated Raman curves are in good agreement with the experimental ones, indicating that the concept of basic bond unit can well demonstrate the chemical bond nature of the Raman spectra of the alloyed nanocrystals. Based on the strategy of breaking up the whole alloyed nanocrystal into basic bond units, the nanosize effect of Raman shifts may be accurately predicted even just by a pocket calculator.

Frustrated plane-polarized dipoles in one dimension	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We investigate the zero-temperature quantum phases of a quasi-one-dimensional zigzag chain of dipoles that are polarized in a plane by an external electric field. Since the Hamiltonian contains nearest-neighbor and nextnearest-neighbor hopping and interaction terms, this model allows frustration, which induces phases that can be interesting and unusual. By using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm, we produce a complex phase diagram. This is an extension of an earlier work by Wang et al. [Phys. Rev. A 96, 043615 (2017)].

Direct silicon bonding is a way to produce artificial interfaces, in particular incommensurate ones. We focus on a technology-driven tilt grain boundary in silicon. While the Fibonacci sequence, linked to the golden ratio, is a prototype of the quasicrystalline structures, a silver-ratio sequence allows us to analyze this incommensurate interface. The fourfold coordination of the Si atoms is kept at the interface.

However, the achievement of high density of ordered end-O structures on TM surfaces is still challenging so far. In this paper, based on the evidence of ultrahigh vacuum-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we successfully prepared the high density of ordered end-O structures on Ni(110) surfaces through breaking the long Ni-O chains to short Ni-O chains by NO adsorption on (2 x 1)Ni-O/Ni(110) reconstructed surfaces. The mechanism of end-O formation has been interpreted: at low NO coverage at 90 K, NO molecules tiltedly adsorb on Ni atoms in Ni-O chains causing a strong distortion; when NO coverage is increased close to saturation (similar to 0.5 ML), the accumulated stress of Ni-O chains finally breaks the Ni-O bonds, resulting in the release of the host Ni atoms in Ni-O chains to the hollow sites and the formation of two end-O for each released Ni. Furthermore, the ordering of end-O structures on Ni(110) surfaces can be greatly enhanced by the annealing of the sample to 250 K. Such an approach to prepare the high density of ordered end-O structures is expectedly applied to other TM surfaces.

This work proposes a consistent approach to design Bragg gratings employing the concept of graded profile in a planar hybrid metal-insulator-metal plasmonic waveguide. A comparative study of various width modulations such as triangular, parabolic and rectangular profiles is presented. The most striking observation is that Bragg gratings with parabolic profile offer best performance in terms of compact track length (3.48 mu m), wide stopband (168 nm) and good transmission characteristics with fewer side lobes. Additionally, a nanocavity analysis is performed by introducing a defect length of 140 nm in the Bragg grating structure with parabolic profile. A peak transmission of 89% is observed at the resonance wavelength of 1550 nm.

Poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles have been extensively proposed for delivering drugs into the brain and have shown their ability to cross the blood brain barrier in vitro and in vivo. However, the application of nanoparticles could be limited by their potential side effects. In this study, two glioblastoma cell lines with the poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles were treated at different concentrations. Through MTT assay, the viability of treated cells was quantified. Induction of apoptosis was analysed by flowcytometry as well as quantitative PCR assay for the expression of BCL2 family genes. The results of this study showed that the treatment with poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles induced neither apoptosis nor necrosis in these cells. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed that poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles treatment caused significant changes in the expression of some BCL2 family members. In conclusion, it seems that poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles treatment at non-toxic dose can change the expression of some apoptosis-related genes in glioblastoma cells while has no significant effect on their viability.

J	Kim, YH; Lee, JR				Kim, Yong-Ho; Lee, Jung-Ryul			Carbon rod missing inspection method of multidimensional carbon preform based on image processing	ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS												This paper shows that just taking a picture of the carbon preform can be a powerful detection method of missing rod. The poor quality of the carbon preforms including missing rods cannot provide tailored composite to meet desired properties. By the way, the carbon preform is manufactured manually now and often there happen a mistake that a carbon rod is omitted. Therefore, an effective solution for guaranteeing the quality of the carbon preform is needed. For that reason, this paper proposes new inspection method that can detect the missing rods of multidirectional carbon preform. This method utilized some image processing techniques to simplify the image of carbon preform. In this method, the carbon preform image is modified so that the carbon rods and background can be easily separated. Thus, this new method found all missing rods and marked missing space with red circle. Moreover, because the inspection method suggested in this paper can be easily converted into the form of software, it is expected to be applied effectively to the fields of manufacture of the multidirectional carbon preform.

It evaluates critical values of triaxiality for various convex and non-convex failure criteria, unlike the existing model. It shows the effects of Poisson's ratio and intermediate principal stress for materials whose strength in tension and compression is either equal or unequal. Further, on this basis, the crack initiation angles are predicted for various crack inclinations and compared with those obtained from other fracture criteria. The plastic zone shapes supplement the results. Critical yield stress factor, a significant parameter at the crack tip got lowered as the difference among the three principal stresses reduced to a minimum. The crack initiation angles obtained from the model showed good agreement with those obtained from G-, S-, and T-criterion.						kacker, ruchin/0000-0003-0268-7347													8756-758X	1460-2695				FEB	2020	43	2					250	264		10.1111/ffe.13119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ffe.13119		SEP 2019											WOS:000484853100001

Investigation of the axial compressive behavior of Kevlar fibers using the dynamic loop test	TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL												A dynamic loop test method for measuring strain rate-dependent fiber properties was developed. During dynamic loop testing, the fiber ends are accelerated at constant levels of 20.8, 50 and 343 m/s(2). The test method is used to study Kevlar (R) KM2-600, which fails in axial compression due to kink band formation. The compressive failure strain and strain rate at the onset of kink band formation is calculated from the critical loop diameter (D-C ), which is monitored throughout the test using a high-speed camera. The results showed that compressive failure strain increases with strain rates from quasi-static to a maximum strain rate of 116 s(-1) by a factor of similar to 3. Kink angles (phi) and kink band spacing (D-s) were 60 degrees +/- 2 degrees and 16 +/- 3 mu m, respectively, over the strain rates tested. Rate-dependent mechanisms of compressive failure by kink band formation were discussed.

Modeling of spatial growth of SnO<sub>2</sub> nanowires on silicon substrates by VLS technique	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS												The growth of SnO2 nanowires on silicon substrates using a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) technique has been theoretically modeled. Since VLS is a catalyst-based method, we have initially modeled the gold droplet using a modified Young's equation to be more suitable for SnO2 nanowires. Apart from the droplet geometry, the flow profile of the source vapor can also affect the overall formation of nanowires. This effect is more predominant for solid sources of SnO vapor where highly variable density and length of nanowires are observed. To understand this complex phenomenon, we describe a spatial growth model to predict the observed profile of SnO2 nanowires at different locations on silicon substrates. The model is based on gas transportation over the nanosized catalyst droplets, leading to a gradual reduction in both the length and density of the grown wires. This theoretical model is applied to a randomly patterned distribution of gold catalysts, and the results are consistent with the experimental findings. Since gold is used as the growth catalyst for tin oxide nanowires, the parameters of gold droplets atop silicon nanowire and Young's angle are extracted.

Potassium alkanoates, KCx, (potassium undecanoate, KC11, potassium dodecanoate, KC12, and potassium tridecanoate, KC13) were chosen as the surfactant molecules. The lyotropic mixtures, which were composed of KCx/potassium sulfate (K2SO4)/decanol (DeOH)/water/brucine, where brucine is a chiral dopant molecule, were studied. Partial phase diagrams were constructed to show how the surfactant alkyl chain affects the phase topologies in the phase diagrams. It was observed that the presence of a longer surfactant alkyl chain in the mixture favors the stabilization of the larger discotic cholesteric, Ch(D), and cholesteric biaxial, Ch(B), phase domains. The phase transitions from the uniaxial cholesteric to biaxial cholesteric phase were shifted to lower temperatures.
