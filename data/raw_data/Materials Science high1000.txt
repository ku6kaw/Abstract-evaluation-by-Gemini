J	Geim, AK; Novoselov, KS				Geim, A. K.; Novoselov, K. S.			The rise of graphene	NATURE MATERIALS												Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.

Single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> transistors	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Two-dimensional materials are attractive for use in next-generation nanoelectronic devices because, compared to one-dimensional materials, it is relatively easy to fabricate complex structures from them. The most widely studied two-dimensional material is graphene(1,2), both because of its rich physics(3-5) and its high mobility(6). However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including transistors(7). Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon films(8-13) or requires high voltages(14,15). Although single layers of MoS2 have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8 eV (ref. 16), previously reported mobilities in the 0.5-3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) range(17) are too low for practical devices. Here, we use a halfnium oxide gate dielectric to demonstrate a room-temperature single-layer MoS2 mobility of at least 200 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), similar to that of graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate transistors with room-temperature current on/off ratios of 1 x 10(8) and ultralow standby power dissipation. Because monolayer MoS2 has a direct bandgap(16,18), it can be used to construct interband tunnel FETs19, which offer lower power consumption than classical transistors. Monolayer MoS2 could also complement graphene in applications that require thin transparent semiconductors, such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.

J	Ferrari, AC; Robertson, J				Ferrari, AC; Robertson, J			Interpretation of Raman spectra of disordered and amorphous carbon	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												The model and theoretical understanding of the Raman spectra in disordered and amorphous carbon are given. The nature of the G and D vibration modes in graphite is analyzed in terms of the resonant excitation of pi states and the long-range polarizability of pi bonding. Visible Raman data on disordered, amorphous, and diamond like carbon are classified in a three-stage model to show the factors that control the position, intensity, and widths of the G and D peaks. It is shown that the visible Raman spectra depend formally on the configuration of the sp(2) sites in sp(2)-bonded clusters. In cases where the sp(2) clustering is controlled by the sp(3) fraction, such as in as-deposited tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) or hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films, the visible Raman parameters can be used to derive the sp(3) fraction.																			2469-9950	2469-9969				MAY 15	2000	61	20					14095	14107		10.1103/PhysRevB.61.14095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.61.14095													WOS:000087284900099

The room temperature values of the thermal conductivity in the range similar to(4.84 +/- 0.44) x 10(3) to (5.30 +/- 0.48) x 10(3) W/mK were extracted for a single-layer graphene from the dependence of the Raman G peak frequency on the excitation laser power and independently measured G peak temperature coefficient.

Here we establish that such dynamic structural complexity in a prototypical two-dimensional lead iodide perovskite gives rise to the coexistence of diverse excitonic resonances, each with a distinct degree of polaronic character. By means of high-resolution resonant impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy, we identify vibrational wavepacket dynamics that evolve along different configurational coordinates for distinct excitons and photocarriers. Employing density functional theory calculations, we assign the observed coherent vibrational modes to various low-frequency (less than or similar to 50 cm(-1)) optical phonons involving motion in the lead iodide layers. We thus conclude that different excitons induce specific lattice reorganizations, which are signatures of polaronic binding. This insight into the energetic/configurational landscape involving globally neutral primary photoexcitations may be relevant to a broader class of emerging hybrid semiconductor materials.

For an economical use of water and solar energy, catalysts that are sufficiently efficient, stable, inexpensive and capable of harvesting light are required. Here, we show that an abundant material, polymeric carbon nitride, can produce hydrogen from water under visible-light irradiation in the presence of a sacrificial donor. Contrary to other conducting polymer semiconductors, carbon nitride is chemically and thermally stable and does not rely on complicated device manufacturing.

Improved Synthesis of Graphene Oxide	ACS NANO												An improved method for the preparation of graphene oxide (GO) is described. Currently, Hummers' method (KMnO4, NaNO3, H2SO4) is the most common method used for preparing graphene oxide. We have found that excluding the NaNO3, increasing the amount of KMnO4, and performing the reaction in a 9:1 mixture of H2SO4/H3PO4 improves the efficiency of the oxidation process. This improved method provides a greater amount of hydrophilic oxidized graphene material as compared to Hummers' method or Hummers' method with additional KMnO4. Moreover, even though the GO produced by our method is more oxidized than that prepared by Hummers' method, when both are reduced in the same chamber with hydrazine, chemically converted graphene (CCG) produced from this new method is equivalent in its electrical conductivity. In contrast to Hummers' method, the new method does not generate toxic gas and the temperature is easily controlled. This improved synthesis of GO may be important for large-scale production of GO as well as the construction of devices composed of the subsequent CCG.

A prerequisite for exploiting most proposed applications for graphene is the availability of processable graphene sheets in large quantities. The direct dispersion of hydrophobic graphite or graphene sheets in water without the assistance of dispersing agents has generally been considered to be an insurmountable challenge.

J	Henkelman, G; Arnaldsson, A; Jónsson, H				Henkelman, Graeme; Arnaldsson, Andri; Jonsson, Hannes			A fast and robust algorithm for Bader decomposition of charge density	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE												An algorithm is presented for carrying out decomposition of electronic charge density into atomic contributions. As suggested by Bader [R. Bader, Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory, Oxford University Press, New York, 1990], space is divided up into atomic regions where the dividing surfaces are at a minimum in the charge density, i.e. the gradient of the charge density is zero along the surface normal. Instead of explicitly finding and representing the dividing surfaces, which is a challenging task, our algorithm assigns each point on a regular (x, y, z) grid to one of the regions by following a steepest ascent path on the grid. The computational work required to analyze a given charge density grid is approximately 50 arithmetic operations per grid point. The work scales linearly with the number of grid points and is essentially independent of the number of atoms in the system. The algorithm is robust and insensitive to the topology of molecular bonding. In addition to two test problems involving a water molecule and NaCl crystal, the algorithm has been used to estimate the electrical activity of a cluster of boron atoms in a silicon crystal. The highly stable three-atom boron cluster, B3I is found to have a charge of -1.5 e, which suggests approximately 50% reduction in electrical activity as compared with three substitutional boron atoms.

J	Kokubo, T; Takadama, H				Kokubo, T; Takadama, H			How useful is SBF in predicting in vivo bone bioactivity?	BIOMATERIALS												The bone-bonding ability of a material is often evaluated by examining the ability of apatite to form on its surface in a simulated body fluid (SBF) with ion concentrations nearly equal to those of human blood plasma. However, the validity of this method for evaluating bone-bonding ability has not been assessed systematically. Here, the history of SBF, correlation of the ability of apatite to form oil various materials in SBF with their in vivo bone bioactivities, and some examples of the development of novel bioactive materials based on apatite formation in SBF are reviewed. It was concluded that examination of apatite formation on a material in SBF is useful for predicting the in vivo bone bioactivity of a material, and the number of animals used in and the duration of animal experiments call be reduced remarkably by using this method.

Our group has pioneered a new carbon material that we call chemically modified graphene (CMG). CMG materials are made from 1-atom thick sheets of carbon, functionalized as needed, and here we demonstrate in an ultracapacitor cell their performance, Specific capacitances of 135 and 99 F/g in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively, have been measured. In addition, high electrical conductivity gives these materials consistently good performance over a wide range of voltage scan rates. These encouraging results illustrate the exciting potential for high performance, electrical energy storage devices based on this new class of carbon material.

Experimentally identifying and characterizing new functional two-dimensional materials is challenging, but also potentially rewarding. Here, we fabricate field-effect transistors based on few-layer black phosphorus crystals with thickness down to a few nanometres. Reliable transistor performance is achieved at room temperature in samples thinner than 7.5 nm, with drain current modulation on the order of 10(5) and well-developed current saturation in the I-V characteristics. The charge-carrier mobility is found to be thickness-dependent, with the highest values up to similar to 1,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) obtained for a thickness of similar to 10nm. Our results demonstrate the potential of black phosphorus thin crystals as a new two-dimensional material for applications in nanoelectronic devices.

Detection of individual gas molecules adsorbed on graphene	NATURE MATERIALS												The ultimate aim of any detection method is to achieve such a level of sensitivity that individual quanta of a measured entity can be resolved. In the case of chemical sensors, the quantum is one atom or molecule. Such resolution has so far been beyond the reach of any detection technique, including solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity(1-4). The fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due to thermal motion of charges and defects(5), which lead to intrinsic noise exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many orders of magnitude. Here, we show that micrometre-size sensors made from graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene's surface. The adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic field or mechanical strain are required.

Nanocrystals of Cesium Lead Halide Perovskites (CsPbX<sub>3</sub>, X = Cl, Br, and I): Novel Optoelectronic Materials Showing Bright Emission with Wide Color Gamut	NANO LETTERS												Metal halides perovskites, such as hybrid organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbI3, are newcomer optoelectronic materials that have attracted enormous attention as solution-deposited absorbing layers in solar cells with power conversion efficiencies reaching 20%. Herein we demonstrate a new avenue for halide perovskites by designing highly luminescent perovskite-based colloidal quantum dot materials. We have synthesized monodisperse colloidal nanocubes (4-15 nm edge lengths) of fully inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I or mixed halide systems Cl/Br and Br/I) using inexpensive commercial precursors. Through compositional modulations and quantum size-effects, the bandgap energies and emission spectra are readily tunable over the entire visible spectral region of 410-700 nm. The photoluminescence of CsPbX3 nanocrystals is characterized by narrow emission line-widths of 12-42 nm, wide color gamut covering up to 140% of the NTSC color standard, high quantum yields of up to 90%, and radiative lifetimes in the range of 1-29 ns. The compelling combination of enhanced optical properties and chemical robustness makes CsPbX3 nanocrystals appealing for optoelectronic applications, particularly for blue and green spectral regions (410-530 nm), where typical metal chalcogenide-based quantum dots suffer from photodegradation.

However, efforts to make transparent conducting films from graphene have been hampered by the lack of efficient methods for the synthesis, transfer and doping of graphene at the scale and quality required for applications. Here, we report the roll-to-roll production and wet-chemical doping of predominantly monolayer 30-inch graphene films grown by chemical vapour deposition onto flexible copper substrates. The films have sheet resistances as low as similar to 125 Omega square(-1) with 97.4% optical transmittance, and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, indicating their high quality. We further use layer-by-layer stacking to fabricate a doped four-layer film and measure its sheet resistance at values as low as similar to 30 Omega square(-1) at similar to 90% transparency, which is superior to commercial transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxides. Graphene electrodes were incorporated into a fully functional touch-screen panel device capable of withstanding high strain.

Alloys containing 16 and 20 components in equal proportions are multiphase, crystalline and brittle both as-cast and after melt spinning. A five component Fe20Cr20Mn20Ni20Co20 alloy forms a single fcc solid solution which solidifies dendritically. A wide range of other six to nine component late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys exhibit the same majority fcc primary dendritic phase, which can dissolve substantial amounts of other transition metals such as Nb, Ti and V More electronegative elements such as Cu and Ge are less stable in the fcc dendrites and are rejected into the interdendritic regions. The total number of phases is always well below the maximum equilibrium number allowed by the Gibbs phase rule, and even further below the maximum number allowed under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. Glassy structures are not formed by casting or melt spinning of late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys, indicating that the confusion principle does not apply, and other factors are more important in promoting glass formation.

Resolving surface chemical states in XPS analysis of first row transition metals, oxides and hydroxides: Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												Chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of first row transition metals and their oxides and hydroxides is challenging due to the complexity of their 2p spectra resulting from peak asymmetries, complex multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structure, and uncertain, overlapping binding energies. Our previous paper [M. C. Biesinger et al., Appl. Surf. Sci. 257 (2010) 887-898.] in which we examined Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn species, has shown that all the values of the spectral fitting parameters for each specific species, i.e. binding energy (eV), full wide at half maximum (FWHM) value (eV) for each pass energy, spin-orbit splitting values and asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, are not all normally provided in the literature and data bases, and are necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis. A more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve fitting was developed based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of literature references and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. This paper extends this approach to the chemical states of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni metals, and various oxides and hydroxides where intense, complex multiplet splitting in many of the chemical states of these elements poses unique difficulties for chemical state analysis. The curve fitting procedures proposed use the same criteria as proposed previously but with the additional complexity of fitting of multiplet split spectra which has been done based on spectra of numerous reference materials and theoretical XPS modeling of these transition metal species. Binding energies, FWHM values, asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, multiplet peak separation and peak area percentages are presented. The procedures developed can be utilized to remove uncertainties in the analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Silicon is an attractive anode material for lithium batteries because it has a low discharge potential and the highest known theoretical charge capacity (4,200 mAh g(-1); ref. 2). Although this is more than ten times higher than existing graphite anodes and much larger than various nitride and oxide materials(3,4), silicon anodes have limited applications(5) because silicon's volume changes by 400% upon insertion and extraction of lithium, which results in pulverization and capacity fading(2). Here, we show that silicon nanowire battery electrodes circumvent these issues as they can accommodate large strain without pulverization, provide good electronic contact and conduction, and display short lithium insertion distances. We achieved the theoretical charge capacity for silicon anodes and maintained a discharge capacity close to 75% of this maximum, with little fading during cycling.

Boron nitride substrates for high-quality graphene electronics	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Graphene devices on standard SiO2 substrates are highly disordered, exhibiting characteristics that are far inferior to the expected intrinsic properties of graphene(1-12). Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality(13,14), this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2. These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity. The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics(15) and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.

Phosphorene: An Unexplored 2D Semiconductor with a High Hole Mobility	ACS NANO												We introduce the 2D counterpart of layered black phosphorus, which we call phosphorene, as an unexplored p-type semiconducting material. Same as graphene and MoS2, single-layer phosphorene is flexible and can be mechanically exfoliated. We find phosphorene to be stable and, unlike graphene, to have an inherent, direct, and appreciable band gap. Our ab initio calculations indicate that the band gap is direct, depends on the number of layers and the in-layer strain, and is significantly larger than the bulk value of 0.31-036 eV. The observed photoluminescence peak of single-layer phosphorene in the visible optical range confirms that the band gap is larger than that of the bulk system. Our transport studies indicate a hole mobility that reflects the structural anisotropy of phosphorene and complements n-type MoS2. At room temperature, our few-layer phosphorene field-effect transistors with 1.0 mu m channel length display a high on-current of 194 mA/mm, a high hole field-effect mobility of 286 cm(2) N.s, and an on/off ratio of up to 10(4). We demonstrate the possibility of phosphorene integration by constructing a 2D CMOS inverter consisting of phosphorene PMOS and MoS2 NMOS transistors.

J	Inoue, A				Inoue, A			Stabilization of metallic supercooled liquid and bulk amorphous alloys	ACTA MATERIALIA												Bulk metallic materials have ordinarily been produced:by melting and solidification processes for the last several thousand years. However, metallic liquid is unstable at temperatures below the melting temperature and solidifies immediately into crystalline phases. Consequently, all bulk engineering alloys are composed of a crystalline structure. Recently, this common concept was exploded by the findings of the stabilization phenomenon of the supercooled liquid for a number of alloys in the Mg-, lanthanide-, Zr-, Ti-, Fe-, Co-, Pd-Cu- and Ni-based systems. The alloys with the stabilized, supercooled liquid state have three features in their alloy components, i.e. multicomponent systems, significant atomic size ratios above 12%, and negative heats of mixing. The stabilization mechanism has also been investigated from experimental data of structure analyses and fundamental physical properties. The stabilization has enabled the production of bulk amorphous alloys in the thickness range of 1-100 mm by using various casting processes. Bulk amorphous Zr-based alloys exhibit high mechanical strength, high fracture toughness and good corrosion resistance and have been used for sporting goods materials. The stabilization also leads to the appearance of a large supercooled liquid region before crystallization and enables high-strain rate super-plasticity through Newtonian flow. The new Fe- and Go-based amorphous alloys exhibit a large super-cooled liquid region and good soft magnetic properties which are characterized by low coercive force and high permeability. Furthermore, homogeneous dispersion of nanoscale -particles into Zr-based bulk amorphous alloys was found to cause an improvement of tensile strength without detriment to good ductility. The discovery of the stabilization phenomenon, followed by the clarification of the stabilization criteria of the supercooled liquid, will promise the future definite development of bulk amorphous alloys as new basic science and engineering materials.

As these nanoparticles are generally considered to be biologically and chemically inert, they are typically coated with metal catalysts, antibodies or enzymes to increase their functionality as separation agents. Here, we report that magnetite nanoparticles in fact possess an intrinsic enzyme mimetic activity similar to that found in natural peroxidases, which are widely used to oxidize organic substrates in the treatment of wastewater or as detection tools. Based on this finding, we have developed a novel immunoassay in which antibody-modified magnetite nanoparticles provide three functions: capture, separation and detection.

High-yield production of graphene by liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Fully exploiting the properties of graphene will require a method for the mass production of this remarkable material. Two main routes are possible: large-scale growth or large-scale exfoliation. Here, we demonstrate graphene dispersions with concentrations up to similar to 0.01 mg ml(-1), produced by dispersion and exfoliation of graphite in organic solvents such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone. This is possible because the energy required to exfoliate graphene is balanced by the solvent-graphene interaction for solvents whose surface energies match that of graphene. We confirm the presence of individual graphene sheets by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. Our method results in a monolayer yield of similar to 1 wt%, which could potentially be improved to 7-12 wt% with further processing. The absence of defects or oxides is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron, infrared and Raman spectroscopies. We are able to produce semi-transparent conducting films and conducting composites. Solution processing of graphene opens up a range of potential large-area applications, from device and sensor fabrication to liquid-phase chemistry.

A highly ordered nanostructured carbon-sulphur cathode for lithium-sulphur batteries	NATURE MATERIALS												The Li-S battery has been under intense scrutiny for over two decades, as it offers the possibility of high gravimetric capacities and theoretical energy densities ranging up to a factor of five beyond conventional Li-ion systems. Herein, we report the feasibility to approach such capacities by creating highly ordered interwoven composites. The conductive mesoporous carbon framework precisely constrains sulphur nanofiller growth within its channels and generates essential electrical contact to the insulating sulphur. The structure provides access to Li+ ingress/egress for reactivity with the sulphur, and we speculate that the kinetic inhibition to diffusion within the framework and the sorption properties of the carbon aid in trapping the polysulphides formed during redox. Polymer modification of the carbon surface further provides a chemical gradient that retards diffusion of these large anions out of the electrode, thus facilitating more complete reaction. Reversible capacities up to 1,320m Ah g(-1) are attained. The assembly process is simple and broadly applicable, conceptually providing new opportunities for materials scientists for tailored design that can be extended to many different electrode materials.

The DSC is currently the most efficient(2) and stable(3) excitonic photocell. Central to this device is a thick nanoparticle film that provides a large surface area for the adsorption of light-harvesting molecules. However, nanoparticle DSCs rely on trap-limited diffusion for electron transport, a slow mechanism that can limit device efficiency, especially at longer wavelengths. Here we introduce a version of the dye-sensitized cell in which the traditional nanoparticle film is replaced by a dense array of oriented, crystalline ZnO nanowires. The nanowire anode is synthesized by mild aqueous chemistry and features a surface area up to one-fifth as large as a nanoparticle cell. The direct electrical pathways provided by the nanowires ensure the rapid collection of carriers generated throughout the device, and a full Sun efficiency of 1.5% is demonstrated, limited primarily by the surface area of the nanowire array.

Polymer solar cells have shown potential to harness solar energy in a cost-effective way. Significant efforts are underway to improve their efficiency to the level of practical applications. Here, we report highly efficient polymer solar cells based on a bulk heterojunction of polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) and methanofullerene. Controlling the active layer growth rate results in an increased hole mobility and balanced charge transport. Together with increased absorption in the active layer, this results in much-improved device performance, particularly in external quantum efficiency. The power-conversion efficiency of 4.4% achieved here is the highest published so far for polymer-based solar cells. The solution process involved ensures that the fabrication cost remains low and the processing is simple. The high efficiency achieved in this work brings these devices one step closer to commercialization.

Anomaly Detection	CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA												The paper presents a revolutionary framework for the modeling, detection, characterization, identification, and machine-learning of anomalous behavior in observed phenomena arising from a large class of unknown and uncertain dynamical systems. An evolved behavior would in general be very difficult to correct unless the specific anomalous event that caused such behavior can be detected early, and any consequence attributed to the specific anomaly following its detection. Substantial investigative time and effort is required to back-track the cause for abnormal behavior and to recreate the event sequence leading to such abnormal behavior. The need to automatically detect anomalous behavior is therefore critical using principles of state motion, and to do so with a human operator in the loop. Human-machine interaction results in a capability for machine self-learning and in producing a robust decision-support mechanism. This is the fundamental concept of intelligent control wherein machine-learning is enhanced by interaction with human operators.

The samples were fractured in vacuum and high resolution XPS spectra of the fractured surfaces were measured. The peak positions and peak shape parameters of Fe 3p for Fe2+ and Fe3+ were derived from the Fe 3p XPS spectra of the standard samples of 2FeO center dot SiO2 and Fe2O3, respectively. Using these parameters, the Fe 3p peaks of Fe3O4 and Fe1-yO are analysed. The results indicate that high resolution XPS techniques can be used to determine the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios in metal oxides.

Among the most promising nanomaterials with antibacterial properties are metallic nanoparticles, which exhibit increased chemical activity due to their large surface to volume ratios and crystallographic surface structure. The study of bactericidal nanomaterials is particularly timely considering the recent increase of new resistant strains of bacteria to the most potent antibiotics. This has promoted research in the well known activity of silver ions and silver-based compounds, including silver nanoparticles. The present work studies the effect of silver nanoparticles in the range of 1-100 nm on Gram-negative bacteria using high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Our results indicate that the bactericidal properties of the nanoparticles are size dependent, since the only nanoparticles that present a direct interaction with the bacteria preferentially have a diameter of similar to 1-10 nm.

Despite tremendous efforts, developing oxygen electrode catalysts with high activity at low cost remains a great challenge. Here, we report a hybrid material consisting of Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on reduced graphene oxide as a high-performance bi-functional catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although Co3O4 or graphene oxide alone has little catalytic activity, their hybrid exhibits an unexpected, surprisingly high ORR activity that is further enhanced by nitrogen doping of graphene. The Co3O4/N-doped graphene hybrid exhibits similar catalytic activity but superior stability to Pt in alkaline solutions. The same hybrid is also highly active for OER, making it a high-performance non-precious metal-based bi-catalyst for both ORR and OER. The unusual catalytic activity arises from synergetic chemical coupling effects between Co3O4 and graphene.

Our method is based on the density-functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the well tested SIESTA approach (which uses nonlocal norm-conserving pseudopotentials to describe the effect of the core electrons, and linear combination of finite-range numerical atomic orbitals to describe the valence states). We fully deal with the atomistic structure of the whole system, treating both the contact and the electrodes on the same footing. The effect of the finite bias (including self-consistency and the solution of the electrostatic problem) is taken into account using nonequilibrium Green's functions. We relate the nonequilibrium Green's function expressions to the more transparent scheme involving the scattering states. As an illustration, the method is applied to three systems where we are able to compare our results to earlier ab initio DFT calculations or experiments, and we point out differences between this method and existing schemes. The systems considered are: (i) single atom carbon wires connected to aluminum electrodes with extended or finite cross section, (ii) single atom gold wires, and finally (iii) large carbon nanotube systems with point defects.

MXenes are produced by selective etching of the A element from the MAX phases, which are metallically conductive, layered solids connected by strong metallic, ionic, and covalent bonds, such as Ti2AlC, Ti3AlC2, and Ta4AlC3.

NANO ENERGY												Charges induced in triboelectric process are usually referred as a negative effect either in scientific research or technological applications, and they are wasted energy in many cases. Here, we demonstrate a simple, low cost and effective approach of using the charging process in friction to convert mechanical energy into electric power for driving small electronics. The triboelectric generator (TEG) is fabricated by stacking two polymer sheets made of materials having distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with metal films deposited on the top and bottom of the assembled structure. Once subjected to mechanical deformation, a friction between the two films, owing to the nano-scale surface roughness, generates equal amount but opposite signs of charges at two sides. Thus, a triboelectric potential layer is formed at the interface region, which serves as a charge "pump" for driving the flow of electrons in the external toad if there is a variation in the capacitance of the system. Such a flexible polymer TEG gives an output voltage of up to 3.3 V at a power density of similar to 10.4 mW/cm(3). TEGs have the potential of harvesting energy from human activities, rotating tires, ocean waves, mechanical vibration and more, with great applications in self-powered systems for personal electronics, environmental monitoring, medical science and even large-scale power.

The rational design of the central fused ring unit of these acceptor molecules is crucial to maximize device performance. Here, we report a new class of non-fullerene acceptor, Y6, that employs a ladder-type electron-deficient-core-based central fused ring (dithienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole) with a benzothiadiazole (BT) core to fine-tune its absorption and electron affinity. OPVs made from Y6 in conventional and inverted architectures each exhibited a high efficiency of 15.7%, measured in two separate labs. Inverted device structures were certified at Enli Tech Laboratory demonstrated an efficiency of 14.9%.

J	Nikoobakht, B; El-Sayed, MA				Nikoobakht, B; El-Sayed, MA			Preparation and growth mechanism of gold nanorods (NRs) using seed-mediated growth method	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												A method is used for preparing gold NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 10 for which the surface plasmon absorption maxima are between 600 and 1300 nm. This method has been adapted from a previously published seed-mediated growth method (Jana et al. Adv. Mater. 2001, 13, 1389). The disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e., formation of noncylindrical NRs, phi-shaped particles, and formation of a large fraction of spherical particles) have been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one. In a single-component surfactant system, the silver content of the growth solution was used to grow NRs to a desired length. This results in reproducible formation of NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. To grow longer NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown in this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs. Effects of the silver ion and the cosurfactant along with the growth mechanism of NRs are discussed.

These devices exhibit remarkable thermal stability. We attribute the improved performance to changes in the bulk heterojunction material induced by thermal annealing. The improved nanoscale morphology, the increased crystallinity of the semiconducting polymer, and the improved contact to the electron-collecting electrode facilitate charge generation, charge transport to, and charge collection at the electrodes, thereby enhancing the device efficiency by lowering the series resistance of the polymer solar cells.

Although graphene(1) is the most well-studied two-dimensional material, single layers of other materials, such as insulating BN (ref. 2) and semiconducting MoS2 (refs 3,4) or WSe2 (refs 5,6), are gaining increasing attention as promising gate insulators and channel materials for field-effect transistors. Because monolayer MoS2 is a direct-bandgap semiconductor(7,8) due to quantum-mechanical confinement(7,9,10), it could be suitable for applications in optoelectronic devices where the direct bandgap would allow a high absorption coefficient and efficient electron-hole pair generation under photo-excitation. Here, we demonstrate ultrasensitive monolayer MoS2 phototransistors with improved device mobility and ON current. Our devices show a maximum external photoresponsivity of 880 AW(-1) at a wavelength of 561 nm and a photoresponse in the 400-680 nm range. With recent developments in large-scale production techniques such as liquid-scale exfoliation(11-13) and chemical vapour deposition-like growth(14,15), MoS2 shows important potential for applications in MoS2-based integrated optoelectronic circuits, light sensing, biomedical imaging, video recording and spectroscopy.

However, we recently demonstrated that a pseudocapacitive mechanism occurs when lithium ions are inserted into mesoporous and nanocrystal films of orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T-Nb2O5; refs 1,2). Here, we quantify the kinetics of charge storage in T-Nb2O5: currents that vary inversely with time, charge-storage capacity that is mostly independent of rate, and redox peaks that exhibit small voltage offsets even at high rates. We also define the structural characteristics necessary for this process, termed intercalation pseudocapacitance, which are a crystalline network that offers two-dimensional transport pathways and little structural change on intercalation. The principal benefit realized from intercalation pseudocapacitance is that high levels of charge storage are achieved within short periods of time because there are no limitations from solid-state diffusion. Thick electrodes (up to 40 mu m thick) prepared with T-Nb2O5 offer the promise of exploiting intercalation pseudocapacitance to obtain high-rate charge-storage devices.

J	Pei, SF; Cheng, HM				Pei, Songfeng; Cheng, Hui-Ming			The reduction of graphene oxide	CARBON												Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene. Different reduction processes result in different properties of reduced GO (rGO), which in turn affect the final performance of materials or devices composed of rGO. In this contribution, we review the state-of-art status of the reduction of GO on both techniques and mechanisms. The development in this field will speed the applications of graphene.

It is this property which entices automobile manufacturers to replace denser materials, not only steels, cast irons and copper base alloys but even aluminium alloys by magnesium based alloys. The requirement to reduce the weight of car components as a result in part of the introduction of legislation limiting emission has triggered renewed interest in magnesium. The growth rate over the next 10 years has been forecast to be 7% per annum. A wider use of magnesium base alloys necessitates several parallel programs. These can be classified as alloy development, process development/improvement and design considerations. These will be discussed briefly and followed by some examples of the increasing uses of magnesium and future trends. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, we consider another contribution, that of the capacitive effects, which become increasingly important at nanoscale dimensions. Nanocrystalline TiO2 (anatase) was studied over a dimensional regime where both capacitive and lithium intercalation processes contribute to the total stored charge. An analysis of the voltammetric sweep data was used to distinguish between the amount of charge stored by these two processes. At particle sizes below 10 nm, capacitive contributions became increasingly important, leading to greater amounts of total stored charge (gravimetrically normalized) with decreasing TiO2 particle size. The area normalized capacitance was determined to be well above 100,mu F/cm(2), confirming that the capacitive contribution was pseudocapacitive in nature. Moreover, reducing the particle size to the nanoscale regime led to faster charge/discharge rates because the diffusion-controlled lithium ion intercalation process was replaced by faradaic reactions which occur at the surface of the material. The charge storage and kinetics benefits derived from using nanoscale metal oxides provide an interesting direction for the design of materials that offer both power density and energy density.

The number of S-Mo-S layers of the samples was independently determined by contact-mode atomic force microscopy. Two Raman modes, E-2g(1) and A(1g), exhibited sensitive thickness dependence, with the frequency of the former decreasing and that of the latter increasing with thickness. The results provide a convenient and reliable means for determining layer thickness with atomic-level precision. The opposite direction of the frequency shifts, which cannot be explained solely by van der Waals interlayer coupling, is attributed to Coulombic interactions and possible stacking-induced changes of the intralayer bonding. This work exemplifies the evolution of structural parameters in layered materials in changing from the three-dimensional to the two-dimensional regime.

Topological semimetal and Fermi-arc surface states in the electronic structure of pyrochlore iridates	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We investigate novel phases that emerge from the interplay of electron correlations and strong spin-orbit interactions. We focus on describing the topological semimetal, a three-dimensional phase of a magnetic solid, and argue that it may be realized in a class of pyrochlore iridates (such as Y(2)Ir(2)O(7)) based on calculations using the LDA + U method. This state is a three-dimensional analog of graphene with linearly dispersing excitations and provides a condensed-matter realization of Weyl fermions that obeys a two-component Dirac equation. It also exhibits remarkable topological properties manifested by surface states in the form of Fermi arcs, which are impossible to realize in purely two-dimensional band structures. For intermediate correlation strengths, we find this to be the ground state of the pyrochlore iridates, coexisting with noncollinear magnetic order. A narrow window of magnetic "axion" insulator may also be present. An applied magnetic field is found to induce a metallic ground state.

Sodium-Ion Batteries	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												The status of ambient temperature sodium ion batteries is reviewed in light of recent developments in anode, electrolyte and cathode materials. These devices, although early in their stage of development, are promising for large-scale grid storage applications due to the abundance and very low cost of sodium-containing precursors used to make the components. The engineering knowledge developed recently for highly successful Li ion batteries can be leveraged to ensure rapid progress in this area, although different electrode materials and electrolytes will be required for dual intercalation systems based on sodium. In particular, new anode materials need to be identified, since the graphite anode, commonly used in lithium systems, does not intercalate sodium to any appreciable extent. A wider array of choices is available for cathodes, including high performance layered transition metal oxides and polyanionic compounds. Recent developments in electrodes are encouraging, but a great deal of research is necessary, particularly in new electrolytes, and the understanding of the SEI films. The engineering modeling calculations of Na-ion battery energy density indicate that 210 Wh kg1 in gravimetric energy is possible for Na-ion batteries compared to existing Li-ion technology if a cathode capacity of 200 mAh g1 and a 500 mAh g1 anode can be discovered with an average cell potential of 3.3 V.

J	Eda, G; Fanchini, G; Chhowalla, M				Eda, Goki; Fanchini, Giovanni; Chhowalla, Manish			Large-area ultrathin films of reduced graphene oxide as a transparent and flexible electronic material	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												The integration of novel materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes and nanowires into devices has been challenging, but developments in transfer printing and solution-based methods now allow these materials to be incorporated into large-area electronics(1-6). Similar efforts are now being devoted to making the integration of graphene into devices technologically feasible(7-10). Here, we report a solution-based method that allows uniform and controllable deposition of reduced graphene oxide thin films with thicknesses ranging from a single monolayer to several layers over large areas. The opto-electronic properties can thus be tuned over several orders of magnitude, making them potentially useful for flexible and transparent semiconductors or semi-metals. The thinnest films exhibit graphene-like ambipolar transistor characteristics, whereas thicker films behave as graphite-like semi-metals. Collectively, our deposition method could represent a route for translating the interesting fundamental properties of graphene into technologically viable devices.

The photophysics of such photoactive devices is based on the photo-induced charge transfer from donor-type semiconducting conjugated polymers to acceptor-type conjugated polymers or acceptor molecules such as Buckminsterfullerene, C-60. This photo-induced charge transfer is reversible, ultrafast (within 100 fs) with a quantum efficiency approaching unity, and the charge-separated state is metastable (up to milliseconds at 80 K). Being similar to the first steps in natural photosynthesis, this photo-induced electron transfer leads To a number of potentially interesting applications, which include sensitization of the photoconductivity and photovoltaic phenomena. Examples of photovoltaic architectures are presented and their potential in terrestrial solar energy conversion discussed. Recent progress in the realization of improved photovoltaic elements with 3 % power conversion efficiency is reported.

J	Klimes, J; Bowler, DR; Michaelides, A				Klimes, Jiri; Bowler, David R.; Michaelides, Angelos			Van der Waals density functionals applied to solids	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												The van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of M. Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)] is a promising approach for including dispersion in approximate density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals. Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature. However, despite many applications, standard general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional "hard" matter such asmetals, ionic compounds, and insulators are lacking. Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and molecules on the surfaces of solids. Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring. We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers. However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs. Although the tests reported here are for hard solids, not normally materials for which dispersion forces are thought to be important, we find a systematic improvement in cohesive properties for the alkali metals and alkali halides when nonlocal correlations are accounted for.

They are used to power electric and hybrid electric vehicles and to store wind and solar energy in smart grids. Electrochemical devices with high energy and power densities can currently be powered only by batteries with organic liquid electrolytes. However, such batteries require relatively stringent safety precautions, making large-scale systems very complicated and expensive. The application of solid electrolytes is currently limited because they attain practically useful conductivities (10(-2) S cm(-1)) only at 50-80 degrees C, which is one order of magnitude lower than those of organic liquid electrolytes(3-8). Here, we report a lithium superionic conductor, Li(10)GeP(2)S(12) that has a new three-dimensional framework structure. It exhibits an extremely high lithium ionic conductivity of 12 mS cm(-1) at room temperature. This represents the highest conductivity achieved in a solid electrolyte, exceeding even those of liquid organic electrolytes. This new solid-state battery electrolyte has many advantages in terms of device fabrication (facile shaping, patterning and integration), stability (non-volatile), safety (non-explosive) and excellent electrochemical properties (high conductivity and wide potential window)(9-11).					; Hirayama, Masaaki/B-5781-2011	Kato, Yuki/0000-0002-2402-9815; KAMAYA, NORIAKI/0000-0003-0394-7593; Yonemura, Masao/0000-0002-4444-1997; Hirayama, Masaaki/0000-0003-4804-4208													1476-1122					SEP	2011	10	9					682	686		10.1038/NMAT3066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT3066								21804556					WOS:000294156800012

Analysis of nanoparticle delivery to tumours	NATURE REVIEWS MATERIALS												Targeting nanoparticles to malignant tissues for improved diagnosis and therapy is a popular concept. However, after surveying the literature from the past 10 years, only 0.7% (median) of the administered nanoparticle dose is found to be delivered to a solid tumour. This has negative consequences on the translation of nanotechnology for human use with respect to manufacturing, cost, toxicity, and imaging and therapeutic efficacy. In this article, we conduct a multivariate analysis on the compiled data to reveal the contributions of nanoparticle physicochemical parameters, tumour models and cancer types on the low delivery efficiency. We explore the potential causes of the poor delivery efficiency from the perspectives of tumour biology (intercellular versus transcellular transport, enhanced permeability and retention effect, and physicochemical-dependent nanoparticle transport through the tumour stroma) as well as competing organs (mononuclear phagocytic and renal systems) and present a 30-year research strategy to overcome this fundamental limitation. Solving the nanoparticle delivery problem will accelerate the clinical translation of nanomedicine.

Most of the existing carrier materials show poor drug loading (usually less than 5 wt% of the transported drug versus the carrier material) and/or rapid release of the proportion of the drug that is simply adsorbed (or anchored) at the external surface of the nanocarrier. In this context, porous hybrid solids, with the ability to tune their structures and porosities for better drug interactions and high loadings, are well suited to serve as nanocarriers for delivery and imaging applications. Here we show that specific non-toxic porous iron(III)-based metal-organic frameworks with engineered cores and surfaces, as well as imaging properties, function as superior nanocarriers for efficient controlled delivery of challenging antitumoural and retroviral drugs (that is, busulfan, azidothymidine triphosphate, doxorubicin or cidofovir) against cancer and AIDS. In addition to their high loadings, they also potentially associate therapeutics and diagnostics, thus opening the way for theranostics, or personalized patient treatments.

Several band combinations for spectral analysis have been tested, and a combination of four Lorentzian-shaped bands (G, D1, D2, D4) at about 1580, 1350, 1620, and 1200 cm(-1), respectively, with a Gaussian-shaped band (W) at similar to 1500 cm(-1) was best suited for the first-order spectra. The second-order spectra were best fitted with Lorentzian-shaped bands at about 2450, 2700, 2900, and 3100 cm(-1). Spectral parameters (band positions, full widths at half maximum, and intensity ratios) are reported for several types of industrial carbon black (Degussa Printex, Cabot Monarch), diesel soot (particulate matter from modern heavy duty vehicle and passenger car engine exhaust, NIST SRM1650), spark-discharge soot (Palas GfG100), and graphite. Several parameters, in particular the width of the D1 band at similar to 1350 cm(-1), provide structural information and allow to discriminate the sample materials, but the characterisation and distinction of different types of soot is limited by the experimental reproducibility of the spectra and the statistical uncertainties of curve fitting. The results are discussed and compared with X-ray diffraction measurements and earlier Raman spectroscopic studies of comparable materials, where different measurement and fitting procedures had been applied.

The removal of the "A" group layer from the MAX phases results in 2-D layers that we are labeling MXenes to denote the loss of the A element and emphasize their structural similarities with graphene.

It is shown that only the Raman frequencies of E-2g(1) and A(1g) peaks vary monotonously with the layer number of ultrathin MoS2 flakes, while intensities or widths of the peaks vary arbitrarily. The coupling between electronic transitions and phonons are found to become weaker when the layer number of MoS2 decreases, attributed to the increased electronic transition energies or elongated intralayer atomic bonds in ultrathin MoS2. The asymmetric Raman peak at 454 cm-1, which has been regarded as the overtone of longitudinal optical M phonons in bulk MoS2, is actually a combinational band involving a longitudinal acoustic mode (LA(M)) and an optical mode (A(2u)). Our findings suggest a clear evolution of the coupling between electronic transition and phonon when MoS2 is scaled down from three- to two-dimensional geometry.

Bright light-emitting diodes based on organometal halide perovskite	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Solid-state light-emitting devices based on direct-bandgap semiconductors have, over the past two decades, been utilized as energy-efficient sources of lighting. However, fabrication of these devices typically relies on expensive high-temperature and high-vacuum processes, rendering them uneconomical for use in large-area displays(1,2). Here, we report high-brightness light-emitting diodes based on solution-processed organometal halide perovskites. We demonstrate electroluminescence in the near-infrared, green and red by tuning the halide compositions in the perovskite. In our infrared device, a thin 15 nm layer of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite emitter is sandwiched between larger-bandgap titanium dioxide (TiO2) and poly(9,9'-dioctyl-fluorene) (F8) layers, effectively confining electrons and holes in the perovskite layer for radiative recombination. We report an infrared radiance of 13.2 W sr(-1) m(-2) at a current density of 363 mA cm(-2), with highest external and internal quantum efficiencies of 0.76% and 3.4%, respectively. In our green light-emitting device with an ITO/PEDOT: PSS/CH3NH3PbBr3/F8/Ca/Ag structure, we achieved a luminance of 364 cd m(-2) at a current density of 123 mA cm(-2), giving external and internal quantum efficiencies of 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. We show, using photoluminescence studies, that radiative bimolecular recombination is dominant at higher excitation densities. Hence, the quantum efficiencies of the perovskite light-emitting diodes increase at higher current densities. This demonstration of effective perovskite electroluminescence offers scope for developing this unique class of materials into efficient and colour-tunable light emitters for low-cost display, lighting and optical communication applications.

Resolving surface chemical states in XPS analysis of first row transition metals, oxides and hydroxides: Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												Chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of first row transition metals and their oxides and hydroxides is challenging due to the complexity of the 2p spectra resulting from peak asymmetries, complex multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structure, and uncertain, overlapping binding energies. A review of current literature shows that all values necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis are usually not provided. This paper reports a more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve-fitting the various chemical states in a variety of Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn metals, oxides and hydroxides. The curve-fitting procedures proposed are based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of the literature references, and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. Binding energies, full-width at half maximum (FWHM) values, spin-orbit splitting values, asymmetric peak-shape fitting parameters, and, for Cu and Zn, Auger parameters values are presented. The quantification procedure for Cu species details the use of the shake-up satellites for Cu(II)-containing compounds and the exact binding energies of the Cu(0) and Cu(I) peaks. The use of the modified Auger parameter for Cu and Zn species allows for corroborating evidence when there is uncertainty in the binding energy assignment. These procedures can remove uncertainties in analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A series of graphene-based composites(4-6) and macroscopic structures(7-11) have been recently fabricated using chemically derived graphene sheets. However, these composites and structures suffer from poor electrical conductivity because of the low quality and/or high inter-sheet junction contact resistance of the chemically derived graphene sheets. Here we report the direct synthesis of three-dimensional foam-like graphene macrostructures, which we call graphene foams (GFs), by template-directed chemical vapour deposition. A GF consists of an interconnected flexible network of graphene as the fast transport channel of charge carriers for high electrical conductivity. Even with a GF loading as low as similar to 0.5 wt%, GF/poly(dimethyl siloxane) composites show a very high electrical conductivity of similar to 10 S cm(-1), which is similar to 6 orders of magnitude higher than chemically derived graphene-based composites(4). Using this unique network structure and the outstanding electrical and mechanical properties of GFs, as an example, we demonstrate the great potential of GF/poly(dimethyl siloxane) composites for flexible, foldable and stretchable conductors(12).

Similar morphological changes occurred in both E.coli and S. aureus cells after Ag+ treatment. The cytoplasm membrane detached from the cell wall. A remarkable electron-light region appeared in the center of the cells, which contained condensed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. There are many small electron-dense granules either surrounding the cell wall or depositing inside the cells. The existence of elements of silver and sulfur in the electron-dense granules and cytoplasm detected by X-ray microanalysis suggested the antibacterial mechanism of silver: DNA lost its replication ability and the protein became inactivated after Ag+ treatment. The slighter morphological changes of S. aureus compared with E. coli recommended a defense system of S. aureus against the inhibitory effects of Ag+ ions. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Exfoliation of bulk MoS2 via Li intercalation is an attractive route to large-scale synthesis of monolayer crystals. However, this method results in loss of pristine semiconducting properties of MoS2 due to structural changes that occur during Li intercalation. Here, we report structural and electronic properties of chemically exfoliated MoS2. The metastable metallic phase that emerges from Li intercalation was found to dominate the properties of as-exfoliated material, but mild annealing leads to gradual restoration of the semiconducting phase. Above an annealing temperature of 300 degrees C, chemically exfoliated MoS2 exhibit prominent band gap photoluminescence, similar to mechanically exfoliated monolayers, indicating that their semiconducting properties are largely restored.

J	Takeuchi, A; Inoue, A				Takeuchi, A; Inoue, A			Classification of bulk metallic glasses by atomic size difference, heat of mixing and period of constituent elements and its application to characterization of the main alloying element	MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS												Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have been classified according to the atomic size difference. heat of mixing (Delta H-mix) and period of the constituent elements in the periodic table. The BMGs discovered to date are classified into seven groups on the basis of a previous result by Inoue. The seven groups are as follows: (G-I) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM-Al/Ga, (G-II) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM-Metalloid (G-III) Al/Ga-LTM/BM-Metalloid, (G-IV) IIA-ETM/Ln-LTM/BM, (G-V) LTM/BM-Metalloid, (G-VI) ETM/Ln-LTM/BM and (G-VII) IIA-LTM/BM. where ETM. Ln, LTM, BM and IIA refer to early transition, lantlianide, late transition, group IIIB-IVB and group IIA-group metals, respectively. The main alloying element of ternary G-I, G-V and G-VII, ternary G-II and G-IV, and tertiary G-VI BMGs is the largest, intermediate and smallest atomic radius compared to the other alloying elements, respectively. The main alloying element of tertiary BMGs belonging to G-I. G-V. G-VI and G-VII is an element in the atomic pair with the largest and negative value of Delta H-mix (<(Delta H)under bar >(mix)(LN)). while the main element of ternary BMGs belonging to G-II and G-IV is independent of the atomic pair with <(Delta H)under bar >(mix)(LN). The characteristics of the main element derived for the ternary BMGs are directly applicable to multicomponent BMGs belonging to G-I. G-II, G-IV (Mg-based BMGs), G-V and G-VII. The main element can be the larger-sized element in the atomic pair with <(Delta H)under bar >(mix)(LN) or in the same group as the other elements for multicomponent BMGs belonging to G-III. G-IV (Be-containing Zr-based BMG) and G-VI. The main element of BMGs belonging to G-VI tends to change from the element with the smallest atomic radius in a ternary system to an element with a relatively large atomic size in a in multicomponent system. The change is due to an increase in glass-forming ability through multicomponent alloying of BMGs belonging to G-VI. The results of the classification of BMGs obtained in the present study are important for further development of BMGs, with the results providing a road map for the development of new BMG compositions.

Software and computers have now developed to a level where such calculations can be used as tools for material and process development. In the present paper some of the latest software developments at Thermo-Calc Software are presented together with application examples. It is shown how advanced thermodynamic calculations have become more accessible since: - A more user-friendly windows version of Thermo-Calc, TCW, has been developed. - There is an increasing amount of thermodynamic databases for different materials available. - Thermo-Calc can be accessed from user-written software through several different programming interfaces are available which enables access to the thermodynamic software from a user-written software. Accurate data for thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria can then easily be incorporated into software written in e.g. C++, Matlab and FORTRAN. Thermo-Calc Software also produces DICTRA, a software for simulation of diffusion controlled phase transformations. Using DICTRA it is possible to simulate processes such as homogenization, carburising, microsegregation and coarsening in multicomponent alloys. The different models in the DICTRA software are briefly presented in the present paper together with some application examples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fu, L; Kane, CL				Fu, Liang; Kane, C. L.			Topological insulators with inversion symmetry	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Topological insulators are materials with a bulk excitation gap generated by the spin-orbit interaction that are different from conventional insulators. This distinction is characterized by Z(2) topological invariants, which characterize the ground state. In two dimensions, there is a single Z(2) invariant that distinguishes the ordinary insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase. In three dimensions, there are four Z(2) invariants that distinguish the ordinary insulator from "weak" and "strong" topological insulators. These phases are characterized by the presence of gapless surface (or edge) states. In the two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall phase and the three-dimensional strong topological insulator, these states are robust and are insensitive to weak disorder and interactions. In this paper, we show that the presence of inversion symmetry greatly simplifies the problem of evaluating the Z(2) invariants. We show that the invariants can be determined from the knowledge of the parity of the occupied Bloch wave functions at the time-reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone. Using this approach, we predict a number of specific materials that are strong topological insulators, including the semiconducting alloy Bi1-xSbx as well as alpha-Sn and HgTe under uniaxial strain. This paper also includes an expanded discussion of our formulation of the topological insulators in both two and three dimensions, as well as implications for experiments.

Since the original discovery, more than 20 different compositions have been synthesized by the selective etching of MAX phase and other precursors and many more theoretically predicted. They offer a variety of different properties, making the family promising candidates in a wide range of applications, such as energy storage, electromagnetic interference shielding, water purification, electrocatalysis, and medicine. These solution-processable materials have the potential to be highly scalable, deposited by spin, spray, or dip coating, painted or printed, or fabricated in a variety of ways. Due to this promise, the amount of research on MXenes has been increasing, and methods of synthesis and processing are expanding quickly. The fast evolution, of the material can also be noticed in the wide range of synthesis and processing protocols that determine the yield of delamination, as well as the quality of the 2D flakes produced. Here we describe the experimental methods and best practices we use to synthesize the most studied MXene, titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), using different etchants and delamination methods. We also explain effects of synthesis parameters on the size and quality of Ti3C2Tx and suggest the optimal processes for the desired application.

Computational high-throughput screening of electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen evolution	NATURE MATERIALS												The pace of materials discovery for heterogeneous catalysts and electrocatalysts could, in principle, be accelerated by the development of efficient computational screening methods. This would require an integrated approach, where the catalytic activity and stability of new materials are evaluated and where predictions are benchmarked by careful synthesis and experimental tests. In this contribution, we present a density functional theory-based, high-throughput screening scheme that successfully uses these strategies to identify a new electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER). The activity of over 700 binary surface alloys is evaluated theoretically; the stability of each alloy in electrochemical environments is also estimated. BiPt is found to have a predicted activity comparable to, or even better than, pure Pt, the archetypical HER catalyst. This alloy is synthesized and tested experimentally and shows improved HER performance compared with pure Pt, in agreement with the computational screening results.

Control of valley polarization in monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> by optical helicity	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Electronic and spintronic devices rely on the fact that free charge carriers in solids carry electric charge and spin. There are, however, other properties of charge carriers that might be exploited in new families of devices. In particular, if there are two or more minima in the conduction band (or maxima in the valence band) in momentum space, and if it is possible to confine charge carriers in one of these valleys, then it should be possible to make a valleytronic device(1-4). Valley polarization, as the selective population of one valley is designated, has been demonstrated using strain(5,6) and magnetic fields(7-10), but neither of these approaches allows dynamic control. Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve complete dynamic valley polarization in monolayer MoS2 (refs 11,12), a two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric crystal with direct energy gaps at two valleys(13-16).

Here we experimentally demonstrate a nanoscale silicon-based memristor device and show that a hybrid system composed of complementary metal oxide semiconductor neurons and memristor synapses can support important synaptic functions such as spike timing dependent plasticity.

Photocurrent generated from the phototransistor is solely determined by the illuminated optical power at a constant drain or gate voltage. The switching behavior of photocurrent generation and annihilation can be completely finished within ca. 50 ms, and it shows good stability. Especially, the single-layer MoS2 phototransistor exhibits a better photoresponsivity as compared with the graphene-based device.

Single sheet functionalized graphene by oxidation and thermal expansion of graphite	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												A detailed analysis of the thermal expansion mechanism of graphite oxide to produce functionalized graphene sheets is provided. Exfoliation takes place when the decomposition rate of the epoxy and hydroxyl sites of graphite oxide exceeds the diffusion rate of the evolved gases, thus yielding pressures that exceed the van der Waals forces holding the graphene sheets together. A comparison of the Arrhenius dependence of the reaction rate against the calculated diffusion coefficient based on Knudsen diffusion suggests a critical temperature of 550 degrees C which must be exceeded for exfoliation to occur. As a result of their wrinkled nature, the functionalized and defective graphene sheets do not collapse back to graphite oxide but are highly agglomerated. After dispersion by ultrasonication in appropriate solvents, statistical analysis by atomic force microscopy shows that 80% of the observed flakes are single sheets.

Spintronic devices, for example, make use of the spin of electrons(1,2). Valleytronics is a more recent development that relies on the fact that the conduction bands of some materials have two or more minima at equal energies but at different positions in momentum space(3-5). To make a valleytronic device it is necessary to control the number of electrons in these valleys, thereby producing a valley polarization(6-11). Single-layer MoS2 is a promising material for valleytronics because both the conduction and valence band edges have two energy-degenerate valleys at the corners of the first Brillouin zone(12). Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve a valley polarization of 30% in pristine monolayer MoS2. Our results, and similar results by Mak et al.(13), demonstrate the viability of optical valley control and valley-based electronic and optoelectronic applications in MoS2 monolayers.

Herein is shown that g-C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness of around 2 nm can be easily obtained by a simple top-down strategy, namely, thermal oxidation etching of bulk g-C3N4 in air. Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, the highly anisotropic 2D-nanosheets possess a high specific surface area of 306 m2 g-1, a larger bandgap (by 0.2 eV), improved electron transport ability along the in-plane direction, and increased lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers because of the quantum confinement effect. As a consequence, the photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4 nanosheets have been remarkably improved in terms of OH radical generation and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Monitoring dopants by Raman scattering in an electrochemically top-gated graphene transistor	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												The recent discovery of graphene(1-3) has led to many advances in two-dimensional physics and devices(4,5). The graphene devices fabricated so far have relied on SiO2 back gating(1-3). Electrochemical top gating is widely used for polymer transistors(6,7), and has also been successfully applied to carbon nanotubes(8,9). Here we demonstrate a top-gated graphene transistor that is able to reach doping levels of up to 5x10(13) cm(-2), which is much higher than those previously reported. Such high doping levels are possible because the nanometre-thick Debye layer(8,10) in the solid polymer electrolyte gate provides a much higher gate capacitance than the commonly used SiO2 back gate, which is usually about 300 nm thick(11). In situ Raman measurements monitor the doping. The G peak stiffens and sharpens for both electron and hole doping, but the 2D peak shows a different response to holes and electrons. The ratio of the intensities of the G and 2D peaks shows a strong dependence on doping, making it a sensitive parameter to monitor the doping.					sood, ajay/JAO-2185-2023; Geim, Andre/J-7888-2012; Saha, Srijan/J-7552-2012; Novoselov, Kostya/G-9581-2014; Pisana, Simone/E-1788-2011	hai yan, he/0000-0003-0366-6185; Novoselov, Kostya/0000-0003-4972-5371; Pisana, Simone/0000-0002-9291-6061													1748-3387	1748-3395				APR	2008	3	4					210	215		10.1038/nnano.2008.67	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2008.67								18654505					WOS:000254744300012

Today, several metallic materials including the important engineering materials steel, aluminium and titanium may be processed to full dense parts with outstanding properties. In this context, the present overview article describes the complex relationship between AM processes, microstructure and resulting properties for metals. It explains the fundamentals of Laser Beam Melting, Electron Beam Melting and Laser Metal Deposition, and introduces the commercially available materials for the different processes. Thereafter, typical microstructures for additively manufactured steel, aluminium and titanium are presented. Special attention is paid to AM specific grain structures, resulting from the complex thermal cycle and high cooling rates. The properties evolving as a consequence of the microstructure are elaborated under static and dynamic loading.

J	Hollister, SJ				Hollister, SJ			Porous scaffold design for tissue engineering	NATURE MATERIALS												A paradigm shift is taking place in medicine from using synthetic implants and tissue grafts to a tissue engineering approach that uses degradable porous material scaffolds integrated with biological cells or molecules to regenerate tissues. This new paradigm requires scaffolds that balance temporary mechanical function with mass transport to aid biological delivery and tissue regeneration. Little is known quantitatively about this balance as early scaffolds were not fabricated with precise porous architecture. Recent advances in both computational topology design ( CTD) and solid free- form fabrication ( SFF) have made it possible to create scaffolds with controlled architecture. This paper reviews the integration of CTD with SFF to build designer tissue- engineering scaffolds. It also details the mechanical properties and tissue regeneration achieved using designer scaffolds. Finally, future directions are suggested for using designer scaffolds with in vivo experimentation to optimize tissue- engineering treatments, and coupling designer scaffolds with cell printing to create designer material/ biofactor hybrids.

However, the OER activities of thermodynamically stable rutile iridium oxide (r-IrO2) and rutile iridium oxide (r-RuO2), normalized to catalyst mass or true surface area are not well-defined. Here we report a synthesis of r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of similar to 6 nm, and examine their OER activities in acid and alkaline solutions. Both r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 NPs were highly active for OER, with r-RuO2 exhibiting up to 10 A/g(oxide) at 1.48 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. When comparing the two, r-RuO2 NPs were found to have slightly higher intrinsic and mass OER activities than r-IrO2 in both acid and basic solutions. Interestingly, these oxide NPs showed higher stability under OER conditions than commercial Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts. Our study shows that these r-RuO2 and r-IrO2 NPs can serve as a benchmark in the development of active OER catalysts for electrolyzers, metal-air batteries, and photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.

Functionalized graphene sheets for polymer nanocomposites	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Polymer-based composites were heralded in the 1960s as a new paradigm for materials. By dispersing strong, highly stiff fibres in a polymer matrix, high-performance lightweight composites could be developed and tailored to individual applications(1). Today we stand at a similar threshold in the realm of polymer nanocomposites with the promise of strong, durable, multifunctional materials with low nanofiller content(2-11). However, the cost of nanoparticles, their availability and the challenges that remain to achieve good dispersion pose significant obstacles to these goals. Here, we report the creation of polymer nanocomposites with functionalized graphene sheets, which overcome these obstacles and provide superb polymer-particle interactions. An unprecedented shift in glass transition temperature of over 40 degrees C is obtained for polyacrylonitrile) at 1 wt% functionalized graphene sheet, and with only 0.05 wt% functionalized graphene sheet in poly methyl methacrylate) there is an improvement of nearly 30 degrees C. Modulus, ultimate strength and thermal stability follow a similar trend, with values for functionalized graphene sheet - poly methyl methacrylate) rivaling those for single-walled carbon nanotube-poly methyl methacrylate) composites.

Questions about their potential cytotoxicity, however, remain unanswered. While cytotoxicity of bulk cadmium selenide (CdSe) is well documented, a number of groups have suggested that CdSe QDs are cytocompatible, at least with some immortalized cell lines. Using primary hepatocytes as a liver model, we found that CdSe-core QDs were indeed acutely toxic under certain conditions. Specifically, we found that the cytotoxicity of QDs was modulated by processing parameters during synthesis, exposure to ultraviolet light, and surface coatings. Our data further suggest that cytotoxicity correlates with the liberation of free Cd2+ ions due to deterioration of the CdSe lattice. When appropriately coated, CdSe-core QDs can be rendered nontoxic and used to track cell migration and reorganization in vitro. Our results provide information for design criteria for the use of QDs in vitro and especially in vivo, where deterioration over time may occur.

Efficiency enhancement in low-bandgap polymer solar cells by processing with alkane dithiols	NATURE MATERIALS												High charge-separation efficiency combined with the reduced fabrication costs associated with solution processing and the potential for implementation on flexible substrates make 'plastic' solar cells a compelling option for tomorrow's photovoltaics. Attempts to control the donor/acceptor morphology in bulk heterojunction materials as required for achieving high power-conversion efficiency have, however, met with limited success. By incorporating a few volume per cent of alkanedithiols in the solution used to spin-cast films comprising a low-bandgap polymer and a fullerene derivative, the power-conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells (air-mass 1.5 global conditions) is increased from 2.8% to 5.5% through altering the bulk heterojunction morphology. This discovery can potentially enable morphological control in bulk heterojunction materials where thermal annealing is either undesirable or ineffective.

The toxicity of starch-coated silver nanoparticles was studied using normal human lung fibroblast cells (IMR-90) and human glioblastoma cells (U251). The toxicity was evaluated using changes in cell morphology, cell viability, metabolic activity, and oxidative stress. Ag-np reduced ATP content of the cell caused damage to mitochondria and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. DNA damage, as measured by single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) and cytokinesis blocked micronucleus assay (CBMN), was also dose-dependent and more prominent in the cancer cells. The nanoparticle treatment caused cell cycle arrest in G(2)/M phase possibly due to repair of damaged DNA. Annexin-V propidium iodide (PI) staining showed no massive apoptosis or necrosis. The transmission electron microscopic ITEM) analysis indicated the presence of Ag-np inside the mitochondria and nucleus, implicating their direct involvement in the mitochondrial toxicity and DNA damage. A possible mechanism of toxicity is proposed which involves disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by Ag-np leading to production of ROS and interruption of ATP synthesis, which in turn cause DNA damage. It is anticipated that DNA damage is augmented by deposition, followed by interactions of Ag-np to the DNA leading to cell cycle arrest in the G(2)/M phase. The higher sensitivity of U251 cells and their arrest in G2/M phase could be explored further for evaluating the potential use of Ag-np in cancer therapy.

Chemical analysis of graphene oxide films after heat and chemical treatments by X-ray photoelectron and Micro-Raman spectroscopy	CARBON												Several nanometer-thick graphene oxide films deposited on silicon nitride-on silicon substrates were exposed to nine different heat treatments (three in Argon, three in Argon and Hydrogen, and three in ultra-high vacuum), and also a film was held at 70 degrees C while being exposed to a vapor from hydrazine monohydrate. The films were characterized with atomic force microscopy to obtain local thickness and variation in thickness over extended regions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to measure significant reduction of the oxygen content of the films; heating in ultra-high vacuum was particularly effective. The overtone region of the Raman spectrum was used, for the first time, to provide a "fingerprint" of changing oxygen content. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, construction of graphene self-assembled macrostructures with three-dimensional networks has never been realized. In this paper, we prepared a self-assembled graphene hydrogel (SGH) via a convenient one-step hydrothermal method. The SGH is electrically conductive, mechanically strong, and thermally stable and exhibits a high specific capacitance. The high-performance SGH with inherent biocompatibility of carbon materials is attractive in the fields of biotechnology and electrochemistry, such as drug-delivery, tissue scaffolds, bionic nanocomposites, and supercapacitors.

A perpendicular-anisotropy CoFeB-MgO magnetic tunnel junction	NATURE MATERIALS												Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJS) with ferromagnetic electrodes possessing a perpendicular magnetic easy axis are of great interest as they have a potential for realizing next-generation hight-density non-volatile memory and logic chips with high thermal stability and low critical current for current-induced magnetization switching(1-3). To attain perpendicular anisotropy, a number of material system have been explored as electrodes, which include rare-earth/transition-metal alloys(4,5), L1(0)-ordered (Co, Fe)-Pt alloys(3,6,7) and Co/(Pd, Pt) multilayers(1,8-10). However, none of them so far satisfy high thermal stability at reduced dimension, low-current current-induced magnetization switching and high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio all at the same time. Here, we use interfacial perpendicular anisotropy between the ferro-magnetic electrodes and the tunnel barrier of the MTJ by employing the material combination of CoFeB-MgO, a system widely adopted to produce a giant tunnel magnetoresistance ratio in MTJs with in-plane anisotropy(11-13). This approach requires no material other than those used in conventional in-plane-anisotropy MTJs. The perpendicular MTJs consisting of Ta/CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/Ta show a high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, over 120%, high thermal stability at dimension as low as 40 nm diameter and a low switching current of 49 mu A.

Here we synthesize and explore the biological applications of nano-graphene oxide (NGO), i.e., single-layer graphene oxide sheets down to a few nanometers in lateral width. We develop functionalization chemistry in order to impart solubility and compatibility of NGO in biological environments. We obtain size separated pegylated NGO sheets that are soluble in buffers and serum without agglomeration. The NGO sheets are found to be photoluminescent in the visible and infrared regions. The intrinsic photoluminescence (PL) of NGO is used for live cell imaging in the near-infrared (NIR) with little background. We found that simple physisorption via pi-stacking can be used for loading doxorubicin, a widely used cancer drug onto NGO functionalized with antibody for selective killing of cancer cells in vitro. Owing to its small size, intrinsic optical properties, large specific surface area, low cost, and useful non-covalent interactions with aromatic drug molecules, NGO is a promising new material for biological and medical applications.

Graphitic carbon nitride materials: variation of structure and morphology and their use as metal-free catalysts	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY												Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, can be made by polymerization of cyanamide, dicyandiamide or melamine. Depending on reaction conditions, different materials with different degrees of condensation, properties and reactivities are obtained. The firstly formed polymeric C3N4 structure, melon, with pendant amino groups, is a highly ordered polymer. Further reaction leads to more condensed and less defective C3N4 species, based on tri-s-triazine (C6N7) units as elementary building blocks. High resolution transmission electron microscopy proves the extended two-dimensional character of the condensation motif. Due to the polymerization-type synthesis from a liquid precursor, a variety of material nanostructures such as nanoparticles or mesoporous powders can be accessed. Those nanostructures also allow fine tuning of properties, the ability for intercalation, as well as the possibility to give surface-rich materials for heterogeneous reactions. Due to the special semiconductor properties of carbon nitrides, they show unexpected catalytic activity for a variety of reactions, such as for the activation of benzene, trimerization reactions, and also the activation of carbon dioxide. Model calculations are presented to explain this unusual case of heterogeneous, metal-free catalysis. Carbon nitride can also act as a heterogeneous reactant, and a new family of metal nitride nanostructures can be accessed from the corresponding oxides.

These materials are high-k dielectrics with degenerate or thermally activated n-type semiconductivity. Conventional super-exchange or double-exchange interactions cannot produce long-range magnetic order at concentrations of magnetic cations of a few percent. We propose that ferromagnetic exchange here, and in dilute ferromagnetic nitrides, is mediated by shallow donor electrons that form bound magnetic polarons, which overlap to create a spin-split impurity band. The Curie temperature in the mean-field approximation varies as (xdelta)(1/2) where x and delta are the concentrations of magnetic cations and donors, respectively. High Curie temperatures arise only when empty minority-spin or majority-spin d states lie at the Fermi level in the impurity band. The magnetic phase diagram includes regions of semiconducting and metallic ferromagnetism, cluster paramagnetism, spin glass and canted antiferromagnetism.

A simplified rotational-invariant formulation is adopted. The calculation of the Hubbard U entering the expression of the functional is discussed and a linear response approach is proposed that is internally consistent with the chosen definition for the occupation matrix of the relevant localized orbitals. In this way we obtain a scheme whose functionality should not depend strongly on the particular implementation of the model in ab initio calculations. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method, computing structural and electronic properties of a few systems including transition and rare-earth correlated metals, transition metal monoxides, and iron silicate.

A key limitation to this technology is its low energy density and for this reason there is considerable interest in exploring pseudocapacitive materials where faradaic mechanisms offer increased levels of energy storage. Here we show that the capacitive charge-storage properties of mesoporous films of iso-oriented alpha-MoO3 are superior to those of either mesoporous amorphous material or non-porous crystalline MoO3. Whereas both crystalline and amorphous mesoporous materials show redox pseudocapacitance, the iso-oriented layered crystalline domains enable lithium ions to be inserted into the van der Waals gaps of the alpha-MoO3. We propose that this extra contribution arises from an intercalation pseudocapacitance, which occurs on the same timescale as redox pseudocapacitance. The result is increased charge-storage capacity without compromising charge/discharge kinetics in mesoporous crystalline MoO3.

Trends in electrocatalysis on extended and nanoscale Pt-bimetallic alloy surfaces	NATURE MATERIALS												One of the key objectives in fuel-cell technology is to improve and reduce Pt loading as the oxygen-reduction catalyst. Here, we show a fundamental relationship in electrocatalytic trends on Pt3M (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Ti, V) surfaces between the experimentally determined surface electronic structure (the d-band centre) and activity for the oxygen-reduction reaction. This relationship exhibits 'volcano-type' behaviour, where the maximum catalytic activity is governed by a balance between adsorption energies of reactive intermediates and surface coverage by spectator (blocking) species. The electrocatalytic trends established for extended surfaces are used to explain the activity pattern of Pt3M nanocatalysts as well as to provide a fundamental basis for the catalytic enhancement of cathode catalysts. By combining simulations with experiments in the quest for surfaces with desired activity, an advanced concept in nanoscale catalyst engineering has been developed.

During the hydrothermal reaction, both of the reduction of graphene oxide and loading of P25 were achieved. The as-prepared P25-graphene photocatalyst possessed great adsorptivity of dyes, extended light absorption range, and efficient charge separation properties simultaneously, which was rarely reported in other TiO2-carbon photocatalysts. Hence, in the photodegradation of methylene blue, a significant enhancement in the reaction rate was observed with P25-graphene, compared to the bare P25 and P25-CNTs with the same carbon content.

Quantifying Defects in Graphene via Raman Spectroscopy at Different Excitation Energies	NANO LETTERS												We present a Raman study of Ar+-bombarded graphene samples with increasing ion doses. This allows us to have a controlled, increasing, amount of defects. We find that I the ratio between the D and G peak intensities, for a given defect density, strongly depends on the laser excitation energy. We quantify this effect and present a simple equation for the determination of the point defect density in graphene via Raman spectroscopy for any visible excitation energy. We note that, for all excitations, the D to G intensity ratio reaches a maximum for an interdefect distance similar to 3 nm. Thus, a given ratio could correspond to two different defect densities, above or below the maximum. The analysis of the G peak width and its dispersion with excitation energy solves this ambiguity.

Engineering the surface structure of MoS<sub>2</sub> to preferentially expose active edge sites for electrocatalysis	NATURE MATERIALS												Controlling surface structure at the atomic scale is paramount to developing effective catalysts. For example, the edge sites of MoS2 are highly catalytically active and are thus preferred at the catalyst surface over MoS2 basal planes, which are inert. However, thermodynamics favours the presence of the basal plane, limiting the number of active sites at the surface. Herein, we engineer the surface structure of MoS2 to preferentially expose edge sites to effect improved catalysis by successfully synthesizing contiguous large-area thin films of a highly ordered double-gyroid MoS2 bicontinuous network with nanoscaled pores. The high surface curvature of this catalyst mesostructure exposes a large fraction of edge sites, which, along with its high surface area, leads to excellent activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This work elucidates how morphological control of materials at the nanoscale can significantly impact the surface structure at the atomic scale, enabling new opportunities for enhancing surface properties for catalysis and other important technological applications.

The availability of conducting thin films with these properties could lead to the development of skin-like sensors(4) that stretch reversibly, sense pressure (not just touch), bend into hairpin turns, integrate with collapsible, stretchable and mechanically robust displays(5) and solar cells(6), and also wrap around non-planar and biological(7-9) surfaces such as skin(10) and organs(11), without wrinkling. We report transparent, conducting spray-deposited films of single-walled carbon nanotubes that can be rendered stretchable by applying strain along each axis, and then releasing this strain. This process produces spring-like structures in the nanotubes that accommodate strains of up to 150% and demonstrate conductivities as high as 2,200 S cm(-1) in the stretched state.

In order to stay at the forefront of knowledge, a DFT software project can benefit enormously from widespread collaboration, if handled properly. Also, modern software engineering concepts can considerably ease its development. The ABINIT project relies upon these ideas: freedom of sources, reliability, portability, and self-documentation are emphasised, in the development of a sophisticated plane-wave pseudopotential code. We describe ABINITv3.0, distributed under the GNU General Public License. The list of ABINITv3.0 capabilities is presented, as well as the different software techniques that have been used until now: PERL scripts and CPP directives treat a unique set of FORTRAN90 source files to generate sequential (or parallel) object code for many different platforms; more than 200 automated tests secure existing capabilities; strict coding rules are followed; the documentation is extensive, including online help files, tutorials, and HTML-formatted sources.

Their key limitation has been extremely low electronic conductivity, until now believedto be intrinsic to this family of compounds. Here we show that controlled cation non-stoichiometry combined with solid-solution doping by metals supervalent to Li+ increases the electronic conductivity of LiFePO4 by a factor of similar to10(8).

Such materials have typically been prepared by engineering conventional rigid materials such as silicon, rather than by developing new materials. Here, we report a class of wearable and stretchable devices fabricated from thin films of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes. When stretched, the nanotube films fracture into gaps and islands, and bundles bridging the gaps. This mechanism allows the films to act as strain sensors capable of measuring strains up to 280% (50 times more than conventional metal strain gauges), with high durability, fast response and low creep. We assembled the carbon-nanotube sensors on stockings, bandages and gloves to fabricate devices that can detect different types of human motion, including movement, typing, breathing and speech.

The unique mechanical properties of these fibers provided important clinical repair options for many applications. During the past 20 years, some biocompatibility problems have been reported for silkworm silk; however, contamination from residual sericin (glue-like proteins) was the likely cause. More recent studies with well-defined silkworm silk fibers and films suggest that the core silk fibroin fibers exhibit comparable biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo with other commonly used biomaterials such as polylactic acid and collagen. Furthermore, the unique mechanical properties of the silk fibers, the diversity of side chain chemistries for 'decoration' with growth and adhesion factors, and the ability to genetically tailor the protein provide additional rationale for the exploration of this family of fibrous proteins for biomaterial applications. For example, in designing scaffolds for tissue engineering these properties are particularly relevant and recent results with bone and ligament formation in vitro support the potential role for this biomaterial in future applications. To date, studies with silks to address biomaterial and matrix scaffold needs have focused on silkworm silk. With the diversity of silk-like fibrous proteins from spiders and insects, a range of native or bioengineered variants can be expected for application to a diverse set of clinical needs.

J	Qi, XL; Hughes, TL; Zhang, SC				Qi, Xiao-Liang; Hughes, Taylor L.; Zhang, Shou-Cheng			Topological field theory of time-reversal invariant insulators	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We show that the fundamental time-reversal invariant (TRI) insulator exists in 4+1 dimensions, where the effective-field theory is described by the (4+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and the topological properties of the electronic structure are classified by the second Chern number. These topological properties are the natural generalizations of the time reversal-breaking quantum Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions. The TRI quantum spin Hall insulator in 2+1 dimensions and the topological insulator in 3+1 dimensions can be obtained as descendants from the fundamental TRI insulator in 4+1 dimensions through a dimensional reduction procedure. The effective topological field theory and the Z(2) topological classification for the TRI insulators in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions are naturally obtained from this procedure. All physically measurable topological response functions of the TRI insulators are completely described by the effective topological field theory. Our effective topological field theory predicts a number of measurable phenomena, the most striking of which is the topological magnetoelectric effect, where an electric field generates a topological contribution to the magnetization in the same direction, with a universal constant of proportionality quantized in odd multiples of the fine-structure constant alpha=e(2)/hc. Finally, we present a general classification of all topological insulators in various dimensions and describe them in terms of a unified topological Chern-Simons field theory in phase space.

Organic semiconductors and colloidal quantum dots are considered the main candidates for this application. However, stumbling blocks in organic lasing(1-4) include intrinsic losses from bimolecular annihilation and the conflicting requirements of high charge carrier mobility and large stimulated emission; whereas challenges pertaining to Auger losses and charge transport in quantum dots(5-7) still remain. Herein, we reveal that solution-processed organic-inorganic halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3 where X = Cl, Br, I), which demonstrated huge potential in photovoltaics(8-11), also have promising optical gain. Their ultra-stable amplified spontaneous emission at strikingly low thresholds stems from their large absorption coeffcients, ultralow bulk defect densities and slow Auger recombination. Straightforward visible spectral tunability (390-790 nm) is demonstrated. Importantly, in view of their balanced ambipolar charge transport characteristics(8), these materials may show electrically driven lasing.

Transfer of Large-Area Graphene Films for High-Performance Transparent Conductive Electrodes	NANO LETTERS												Graphene, a two-dimensional monolayer of sp(2)-bonded carbon atoms, has been attracting great interest due to its unique transport properties. One of the promising applications of graphene is as a transparent conductive electrode owing to its high optical transmittance and conductivity. In this paper, we report on an improved transfer process of large-area graphene grown on Cu foils by chemical vapor deposition. The transferred graphene films have high electrical conductivity and high optical transmittance that make them suitable for transparent conductive electrode applications.

Approaching ballistic transport in suspended graphene	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												The discovery of graphene(1,2) raises the prospect of a new class of nanoelectronic devices based on the extraordinary physical properties(3-6) of this one-atom-thick layer of carbon. Unlike two-dimensional electron layers in semiconductors, where the charge carriers become immobile at low densities, the carrier mobility in graphene can remain high, even when their density vanishes at the Dirac point. However, when the graphene sample is supported on an insulating substrate, potential fluctuations induce charge puddles that obscure the Dirac point physics. Here we show that the fluctuations are significantly reduced in suspended graphene samples and we report low-temperature mobility approaching 200,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for carrier densities below 5 x 10(9) cm(-2). Such values cannot be attained in semiconductors or non-suspended graphene. Moreover, unlike graphene samples supported by a substrate, the conductivity of suspended graphene at the Dirac point is strongly dependent on temperature and approaches ballistic values at liquid helium temperatures. At higher temperatures, above 100 K, we observe the onset of thermally induced long-range scattering.

Theoretic studies show that intentional doping is a promising route for this goal, and the doped graphene might promise fascinating properties and widespread applications. However, there is no experimental example and electrical testing of the substitutionally doped graphene up to date. Here, we synthesize the N-doped graphene by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. We find that most of them are few-layer graphene, although single-layer graphene can be occasionally detected. As doping accompanies with the recombination of carbon atoms into graphene in the CVD process, N atoms can be substitutionally doped into the graphene lattice, which is hard to realize by other synthetic methods. Electrical measurements show that the N-doped graphene exhibits an n-type behavior, indicating substitutional doping can effectively modulate the electrical properties of graphene. Our finding provides a new experimental instance of graphene and would promote the research and applications of graphene.

J	Zhang, JT; Zhao, ZH; Xia, ZH; Dai, LM				Zhang, Jintao; Zhao, Zhenghang; Xia, Zhenhai; Dai, Liming			A metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are traditionally carried out with noble metals (such as Pt) and metal oxides (such as RuO2 and MnO2) as catalysts, respectively. However, these metal-based catalysts often suffer from multiple disadvantages, including high cost, low selectivity, poor stability and detrimental environmental effects. Here, we describe a mesoporous carbon foam co-doped with nitrogen and phosphorus that has a large surface area of similar to 1,663 m(2) g(-1) and good electrocatalytic properties for both ORR and OER. This material was fabricated using a scalable, one-step process involving the pyrolysis of a polyaniline aerogel synthesized in the presence of phytic acid. We then tested the suitability of this N,P-doped carbon foam as an air electrode for primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Primary batteries demonstrated an open-circuit potential of 1.48 V, a specific capacity of 735 mAh g(Zn)(-1) (corresponding to an energy density of 835 Wh kg(Zn)(-1)), a peak power density of 55 mW cm(-2), and stable operation for 240 h after mechanical recharging. Two-electrode rechargeable batteries could be cycled stably for 180 cycles at 2 mA cm(-2). We also examine the activity of our carbon foam for both OER and ORR independently, in a three-electrode configuration, and discuss ways in which the Zn-air battery can be further improved. Finally, our density functional theory calculations reveal that the N,P co-doping and graphene edge effects are essential for the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of our material.

Most of these applications require only polycrystalline material; however, recent successes in producing large-area single crystals have opened up the possibility of producing blue and W light emitters, and high-temperature, high-power transistors. The main advantages of ZnO as a light emitter are its large exciton binding energy (60 meV), and the existence of well-developed bulk and epitaxial growth processes; for electronic applications, its attractiveness lies in having high breakdown strength and high saturation velocity. optical UV lasing, at both low and high temperatures, has already been demonstrated. although efficient electrical lasing must await the further development of good, p-type material.

Graphite is a practical anode material used for LIB, because of its capability for reversible lithium ion intercalation in the layered crystals, and the structural similarities of GNS to graphite may provide another type of intercalation anode compound. While the accommodation of lithium in these layered compounds is influenced by the layer spacing between the graphene nanosheets, control of the intergraphene sheet distance through interacting molecules such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) or fullerenes (C-60) might be crucial for enhancement of the storage capacity. The specific capacity of GNS was found to be 540 mAh/g, which is much larger than that of graphite, and this was increased up to 730 mAh/g and 784 mAh/g, respectively, by the incorporation of macromolecules of CNT and C-60 to the GNS.

J	Silling, SA				Silling, SA			Reformulation of elasticity theory for discontinuities and long-range forces	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS												Some materials may naturally form discontinuities such as cracks as a result of deformation. As an aid to the modeling of such materials, a new framework for the basic equations of continuum mechanics, called the 'peridynamic' formulation, is proposed. The propagation of linear stress waves in the new theory is discussed, and wave dispersion relations are derived. Material stability and its connection with wave propagation is investigated, It is demonstrated by an example that the reformulated approach permits the solution of fracture problems using the same equations either on or off the crack surface or crack tip. This is an advantage for modeling problems in which the location of a crack is not known in advance. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To mimic the tactile sensing properties of natural skin, large arrays of pixel pressure sensors on a flexible and stretchable substrate are required. We demonstrate flexible, capacitive pressure sensors with unprecedented sensitivity and very short response times that can be inexpensively fabricated over large areas by microstructuring of thin films of the biocompatible elastomer polydimethylsiloxane. The pressure sensitivity of the microstructured films far surpassed that exhibited by unstructured elastomeric films of similar thickness, and is tunable by using different microstructures. The microstructured films were integrated into organic field-effect transistors as the dielectric layer, forming a new type of active sensor device with similarly excellent sensitivity and response times.

J	Ritchie, RO				Ritchie, Robert O.			The conflicts between strength and toughness	NATURE MATERIALS												The attainment of both strength and toughness is a vital requirement for most structural materials; unfortunately these properties are generally mutually exclusive. Although the quest continues for stronger and harder materials, these have little to no use as bulk structural materials without appropriate fracture resistance. It is the lower-strength, and hence higher-toughness, materials that find use for most safety-critical applications where premature or, worse still, catastrophic fracture is unacceptable. For these reasons, the development of strong and tough (damage-tolerant) materials has traditionally been an exercise in compromise between hardness versus ductility. Drawing examples from metallic glasses, natural and biological materials, and structural and biomimetic ceramics, we examine some of the newer strategies in dealing with this conflict. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between the mechanisms that individually contribute to strength and toughness, noting that these phenomena can originate from very different lengthscales in a material's structural architecture. We show how these new and natural materials can defeat the conflict of strength versus toughness and achieve unprecedented levels of damage tolerance within their respective material classes.

J	Lam, DCC; Yang, F; Chong, ACM; Wang, J; Tong, P				Lam, DCC; Yang, F; Chong, ACM; Wang, J; Tong, P			Experiments and theory in strain gradient elasticity	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS												Conventional strain-based mechanics theory does not account for contributions from strain gradients. Failure to include strain gradient contributions can lead to underestimates of stresses and size-dependent behaviors in small-scale structures. In this paper, a new set of higher-order metrics is developed to characterize strain gradient behaviors. This set enables the application of the higher-order equilibrium conditions to strain gradient elasticity theory and reduces the number of independent elastic length scale parameters from five to three. On the basis of this new strain gradient theory, a strain gradient elastic bending theory for plane-strain beams is developed. Solutions for cantilever bending with a moment and line force applied at the free end are constructed based on the new higher-order bending theory. In classical bending theory, the normalized bending rigidity is independent of the length and thickness of the beam. In the solutions developed from the higher-order bending theory, the normalized higher-order bending rigidity has a new dependence on the thickness of the beam and on a higher-order bending parameter, b(h). To determine the significance of the size dependence, we fabricated micron-sized beams and conducted bending tests using a nanoindenter. We found that the normalized beam rigidity exhibited an inverse squared dependence on the beam's thickness as predicted by the strain gradient elastic bending theory, and that the higher-order bending parameter, bh, is on the micron-scale. Potential errors from the experiments, model and fabrication were estimated and determined to be small relative to the observed increase in beam's bending rigidity. The present results indicate that the elastic strain gradient effect is significant in elastic deformation of small-scale structures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Contrary to previous applications, the longitudinal expression is utilized, resulting in dielectric properties that are largely independent of the applied potentials. The improved accuracy of the present approach is demonstrated by comparing the longitudinal and transversal expressions of the polarizability matrix for a number of cubic semiconductors and one insulator, i.e., Si, SiC, AlP, GaAs, and diamond (C), respectively. The methodology is readily extendable to more complicated nonlocal Hamiltonians or to the calculation of the macroscopic dielectric matrix including local field effects in the random phase or density functional approximation, which is demonstrated for the previously mentioned model systems. Furthermore, density functional perturbation theory is extended to the PAW method, and the respective results are compared to those obtained by summation over the conduction band states.

These include its ability to absorb similar to 2% of incident light over a broad wavelength range despite being just one atom thick(7). Here, we demonstrate ultrafast transistor-based photodetectors made from single- and few-layer graphene. The photoresponse does not degrade for optical intensity modulations up to 40 GHz, and further analysis suggests that the intrinsic bandwidth may exceed 500 GHz. The generation and transport of photocarriers in graphene differ fundamentally from those in photodetectors made from conventional semiconductors as a result of the unique photonic and electronic properties of the graphene. This leads to a remarkably high bandwidth, zero source-drain bias and dark current operation, and good internal quantum efficiency.

Classification of topological insulators and superconductors in three spatial dimensions	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We systematically study topological phases of insulators and superconductors (or superfluids) in three spatial dimensions. We find that there exist three-dimensional (3D) topologically nontrivial insulators or superconductors in five out of ten symmetry classes introduced in seminal work by Altland and Zirnbauer within the context of random matrix theory, more than a decade ago. One of these is the recently introduced Z(2) topological insulator in the symplectic (or spin-orbit) symmetry class. We show that there exist precisely four more topological insulators. For these systems, all of which are time-reversal invariant in three dimensions, the space of insulating ground states satisfying certain discrete symmetry properties is partitioned into topological sectors that are separated by quantum phase transitions. Three of the above five topologically nontrivial phases can be realized as time-reversal invariant superconductors. In these the different topological sectors are characterized by an integer winding number defined in momentum space. When such 3D topological insulators are terminated by a two-dimensional surface, they support a number (which may be an arbitrary nonvanishing even number for singlet pairing) of Dirac fermion (Majorana fermion when spin-rotation symmetry is completely broken) surface modes which remain gapless under arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian that preserve the characteristic discrete symmetries, including disorder. In particular, these surface modes completely evade Anderson localization from random impurities. These topological phases can be thought of as three-dimensional analogs of well-known paired topological phases in two spatial dimensions such as the spinless chiral (p(x)+/- ip(y))-wave superconductor (or Moore-Read Pfaffian state). In the corresponding topologically nontrivial (analogous to "weak pairing") and topologically trivial (analogous to "strong pairing") 3D phases, the wave functions exhibit markedly distinct behavior. When an electromagnetic U(1) gauge field and fluctuations of the gap functions are included in the dynamics, the superconducting phases with nonvanishing winding number possess nontrivial topological ground-state degeneracies.

Intrinsic and extrinsic performance limits of graphene devices on SiO<sub>2</sub>	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												The linear dispersion relation in graphene(1,2) gives rise to a surprising prediction: the resistivity due to isotropic scatterers, such as white-noise disorder(3) or phonons(4-8), is independent of carrier density, n. Here we show that electron-acoustic phonon scattering(4-6) is indeed independent of n, and contributes only 30 V to graphene's room-temperature resistivity. At a technologically relevant carrier density of 1 x10(12) cm(-2), we infer a mean free path for electron-acoustic phonon scattering of > 2 mm and an intrinsic mobility limit of 2 x 10(5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1). If realized, this mobility would exceed that of InSb, the inorganic semiconductor with the highest known mobility ( similar to 7.7 x 10(4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1); ref. 9) and that of semiconducting carbon nanotubes ( similar to 1 x 10(5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1); ref. 10). A strongly temperature-dependent resistivity contribution is observed above similar to 200 K ( ref. 8); its magnitude, temperature dependence and carrier-density dependence are consistent with extrinsic scattering by surface phonons at the SiO2 substrate11,12 and limit the room-temperature mobility to similar to 4 x 10(4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), indicating the importance of substrate choice for graphene devices13.

A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e. g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li-Sn-S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.

Moreover, aqueous Zn-ion batteries have an energy storage advantage over alkali-based batteries as they can employ Zn metal as the negative electrode, dramatically increasing energy density. However, their development is plagued by a limited choice of positive electrodes, which often show poor rate capability and inadequate cycle life.

More work has been done using microporous carbons than with the other materials and most of the commercially available devices use carbon electrodes and an organic electrolytes. The energy density of these devices is 3-5 Wh/kg with a power density of 300-500 W/kg for high efficiency (90-95%) charge/discharges. Projections of future developments using carbon indicate that energy densities of 10 Wh/kg or higher are likely with power densities of 1-2 kW/kg. A key problem in the fabrication of these advanced devices is the bonding of the thin electrodes to a current collector such the contact resistance is less than 0.1 Omega cm(2) Special attention is given in the paper to comparing the power density characteristics of ultracapacitors and batteries.

They have a fundamental role in the dynamic responses of electron systems and form the basis of research into optical metamaterials(1-3). Plasmons of two-dimensional massless electrons, as present in graphene, show unusual behaviour(4-7) that enables new tunable plasmonic metamaterials(8-10) and, potentially, optoelectronic applications in the terahertz frequency range(8,9,11,12). Here we explore plasmon excitations in engineered graphene microribbon arrays. We demonstrate that graphene plasmon resonances can be tuned over a broad terahertz frequency range by changing micro-ribbon width and in situ electrostatic doping. The ribbon width and carrier doping dependences of graphene plasmon frequency demonstrate power-law behaviour characteristic of two-dimensional massless Dirac electrons(4-6). The plasmon resonances have remarkably large oscillator strengths, resulting in prominent room-temperature optical absorption peaks. In comparison, plasmon absorption in a conventional two-dimensional electron gas was observed only at 4.2 K (refs 13,14). The results represent afirst look at light-plasmon coupling in graphene and point to potential graphene-based terahertz metamaterials.

Despite extensive research efforts, the development of all-solid-state batteries still falls short of expectation largely because of the lack of suitable candidate materials for the electrolyte required for practical applications. Here we report lithium superionic conductors with an exceptionally high conductivity (25 mS cm(-1) for Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3), as well as high stability (similar to 0V versus Li metal for Li9.6P3S12). A fabricated all-solid-state cell based on this lithium conductor is found to have very small internal resistance, especially at 100 degrees C. The cell possesses high specific power that is superior to that of conventional cells with liquid electrolytes. Stable cycling with a high current density of 18C (charging/discharging in just three minutes; where C is the C-rate) is also demonstrated.

J	Ferrari, AC; Robertson, J				Ferrari, AC; Robertson, J			Resonant Raman spectroscopy of disordered, amorphous, and diamondlike carbon	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												The Raman spectra of a wide range of disordered and amorphous carbons have been measured under excitation from 785 to 229 nm. The dispersion of peak positions and intensities with excitation wavelength is used to understand the nature of resonant Raman scattering in carbon and how to derive the local bonding and disorder from the Raman spectra. The spectra show three basic features, the D and G around 1600 and 1350 cm(-1) for visible excitation and an extra T peak, for UV excitation, at similar to 1060 cm(-1). The G peak, due to the stretching motion of sp(2) pairs, is a good indicator of disorder. It shows dispersion only in amorphous networks, with a dispersion rate proportional to the degree of disorder. Its shift well above 1600 cm(-1) under UV excitation indicates the presence of sp(2) chains. The dispersion of the D peak is strongest in ordered carbons. It shows little dispersion in amorphous carbon, so that in UV excitation it becomes like a density-of-states feature of vibrations of sp(2) ringlike structures. The intensity ratio I(D)/I(G) falls with increasing UV excitation in all forms of carbon, with a faster decrease in more ordered carbons, so that it is generally small for UV excitation. The T peak, due to sp(3) vibrations, only appears in UV Raman, lying around 1060 cm(-1) for H-free carbons and around 980 cm(-1) in hydrogenated carbons. In hydrogenated carbons, the sp(3) C-H-x stretching modes around 2920 cm(-1) can be clearly detected for UV excitation. This assignment is confirmed by deuterium substitution.																			2469-9950	2469-9969				AUG 15	2001	64	7							075414	10.1103/PhysRevB.64.075414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.64.075414													WOS:000170500900094

J	Holzapfel, GA; Gasser, TC; Ogden, RW				Holzapfel, GA; Gasser, TC; Ogden, RW			A new constitutive framework for arterial wall mechanics and a comparative study of material models	JOURNAL OF ELASTICITY												In this paper we develop a new constitutive law for the description of the (passive) mechanical response of arterial tissue. The artery is modeled as a thick-walled nonlinearly elastic circular cylindrical tube consisting of two layers corresponding to the media and adventitia (the solid mechanically relevant layers in healthy tissue). Each layer is treated as a fiber-reinforced material with the fibers corresponding to the collagenous component of the material and symmetrically disposed with respect to the cylinder axis. The resulting constitutive law is orthotropic in each layer. Fiber orientations obtained from a statistical analysis of histological sections from each arterial layer are used. A specific form of the law, which requires only three material parameters for each layer, is used to study the response of an artery under combined axial extension, inflation and torsion. The characteristic and very important residual stress in an artery in vitro is accounted for by assuming that the natural (unstressed and unstrained) configuration of the material corresponds to an open sector of a tube, which is then closed by an initial bending to form a load-free, but stressed, circular cylindrical configuration prior to application of the extension, inflation and torsion. The effect of residual stress on the stress distribution through the deformed arterial wall in the physiological state is examined. The model is fitted to available data on arteries and its predictions are assessed for the considered combined loadings. It is explained how the new model is designed to avoid certain mechanical, mathematical and computational deficiencies evident in currently available phenomenological models. A critical review of these models is provided by way of background to the development of the new model.

Photodegradation Performance of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> Fabricated by Directly Heating Melamine	LANGMUIR												The g-C3N4 photocatalyst was synthesized by directly heating the low-cost melamine. The methyl orange dye (MO) was selected as a photodegrading goal to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of as-prepared g-C3N4. The comparison experiments indicate that the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 can be largely improved by the Ag loading. The strong acid radical ion (SO42- or NO3-) can promote the degrading rate of MO for g-C3N4 photocatalysis system. The MO degradation over the g-C3N4 is mainly attributed to the photoreduction process induced by the photogenerated electrons. Our results clearly indicate that the metal-free g-C3N4 has good performance in photodegradation of organic pollutant.					李, 朝升/J-4034-2016; Zou, Zhigang/AFG-8475-2022; zhang, jingxing/KCY-4726-2024	Yan, Shicheng/0000-0002-3432-9117													0743-7463					SEP 1	2009	25	17					10397	10401		10.1021/la900923z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la900923z								19705905					WOS:000269197500107

We perform this analysis on structures composed of periodic arrangements of wires, split ring resonators (SRRs), and both wires and SRRs. We find the recovered frequency-dependent epsilon and mu are entirely consistent with analytic expressions predicted by effective medium arguments. Of particular relevance are that a wire medium exhibits a frequency region in which the real part of epsilon is negative, and SRRs produce a frequency region in which the real part of mu is negative. In the combination structure, at frequencies where both the recovered real parts of epsilon and mu are simultaneously negative, the real part of the index of refraction is also found to be unambiguously negative.

Stanley			Memristive switching mechanism for metal/oxide/metal nanodevices	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Nanoscale metal/oxide/metal switches have the potential to transform the market for nonvolatile memory and could lead to novel forms of computing. However, progress has been delayed by difficulties in understanding and controlling the coupled electronic and ionic phenomena that dominate the behaviour of nanoscale oxide devices. An analytic theory of the 'memristor' (memory-resistor) was first developed from fundamental symmetry arguments in 1971, and we recently showed that memristor behaviour can naturally explain such coupled electron-ion dynamics. Here we provide experimental evidence to support this general model of memristive electrical switching in oxide systems. We have built micro- and nanoscale TiO2 junction devices with platinum electrodes that exhibit fast bipolar nonvolatile switching. We demonstrate that switching involves changes to the electronic barrier at the Pt/TiO2 interface due to the drift of positively charged oxygen vacancies under an applied electric field. Vacancy drift towards the interface creates conducting channels that shunt, or short-circuit, the electronic barrier to switch ON. The drift of vacancies away from the interface annilihilates such channels, recovering the electronic barrier to switch OFF. Using this model we have built TiO2 crosspoints with engineered oxygen vacancy profiles that predictively control the switching polarity and conductance.					Williams, R.

Trends in activity for the water electrolyser reactions on 3<i>d</i> M(Ni,Co,Fe,Mn) hydr(oxy)oxide catalysts	NATURE MATERIALS												Design and synthesis of materials for efficient electrochemical transformation of water to molecular hydrogen and of hydroxyl ions to oxygen in alkaline environments is of paramount importance in reducing energy losses in water-alkali electrolysers. Here, using 3d-M hydr(oxy)oxides, with distinct stoichiometries and morphologies in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) regions, we establish the overall catalytic activities for these reaction as a function of a more fundamental property, a descriptor, OH-M2+delta bond strength (0 <= delta <= 1.5). This relationship exhibits trends in reactivity (Mn < Fe < Co < Ni), which is governed by the strength of the OH-M2+delta energetic (Ni < Co < Fe < Mn). These trends are found to be independent of the source of the OH, either the supporting electrolyte (for the OER) or the water dissociation product (for the HER). The successful identification of these electrocatalytic trends provides the foundation for rational design of 'active sites' for practical alkaline HER and OER electrocatalysts.

Many researchers are devoting considerable effort to finding materials with larger bandgaps than that of GaN. Here we show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising material for such laser devices because it has a direct bandgap in the ultraviolet region. We obtained a pure hBN single crystal under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, which shows a dominant luminescence peak and a series of s-like exciton absorption bands around 215 nm, proving it to be a direct-bandgap material. Evidence for room-temperature ultraviolet lasing at 215 nm by accelerated electron excitation is provided by the enhancement and narrowing of the longitudinal mode, threshold behaviour of the excitation current dependence of the emission intensity, and a far-field pattern of the transverse mode.

Second, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that the manganese oxidation state was varying from III to IV for the reduced and oxidized forms of thin film electrodes, respectively, during the charge/discharge process. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data also show that Na+ cations from the electrolyte were involved in the charge storage process of MnO2 thin film electrodes. However, the Na/ Mn ratio for the reduced electrode was much lower than what was anticipated for charge compensation dominated by Na+, thus suggesting the involvement of protons in the pseudofaradaic mechanism. An important finding of this work is that, unlike thin film electrodes, no change of the manganese oxidation state was detected for a thicker composite electrode because only a very thin layer is involved in the charge storage process.

The influences of temperature and microstructure on the tensile properties of a CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy	ACTA MATERIALIA												An equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy, which crystallizes in the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, was produced by arc melting and drop casting. The drop-cast ingots were homogenized, cold rolled and recrystallized to obtain single-phase microstructures with three different grain sizes in the range 4-160 mu m. Quasi-static tensile tests at an engineering strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1) were then performed at temperatures between 77 and 1073 K. Yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation to fracture all increased with decreasing temperature. During the initial stages of plasticity (up to similar to 2% strain), deformation occurs by planar dislocation glide on the normal fcc slip system, {1 1 1} < 1 1 0 >, at all the temperatures and grain sizes investigated. Undissociated 1/2 < 1 1 0 > dislocations were observed, as were numerous stacking faults, which imply the dissociation of several of these dislocations into 1/6 < 1 1 2 > Shockley partials. At later stages (similar to 20% strain), nanoscale deformation twins were observed after interrupted tests at 77 K, but not in specimens tested at room temperature, where plasticity occurred exclusively by the aforementioned dislocations which organized into cells. Deformation twinning, by continually introducing new interfaces and decreasing the mean free path of dislocations during tensile testing ("dynamic Hall-Petch"), produces a high degree of work hardening and a significant increase in the ultimate tensile strength. This increased work hardening prevents the early onset of necking instability and is a reason for the enhanced ductility observed at 77 K. A second reason is that twinning can provide an additional deformation mode to accommodate plasticity. However, twinning cannot explain the increase in yield strength with decreasing temperature in our high-entropy alloy since it was not observed in the early stages of plastic deformation. Since strong temperature dependencies of yield strength are also seen in binary fcc solid solution alloys, it may be an inherent solute effect, which needs further study.

Replacing noble metal-based electrocatalysts with highly efficient and inexpensive non-noble metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts is critical for the practical applications of these technologies. Here we report a general approach for the synthesis of hollow frameworks of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes derived from metal-organic frameworks, which exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity and stability for oxygen reduction and evolution than commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. The remarkable electrochemical properties are mainly attributed to the synergistic effect from chemical compositions and the robust hollow structure composed of interconnected crystalline nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes.

Due to their unique physicochemical, optical and electrical properties, a wide variety of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have been designed to drive various reduction and oxidation reactions under light irradiation with suitable wavelengths. In this review, we have systematically summarized the photocatalytic fundamentals of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, including fundamental mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis, advantages, challenges and the design considerations of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. The versatile properties of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are highlighted, including their crystal structural, surface phisicochemical, stability, optical, adsorption, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and electronic properties. Various design strategies are also thoroughly reviewed, including band-gap engineering, defect control, dimensionality tuning, pore texture tailoring, surface sensitization, heterojunction construction, co-catalyst and nanocarbon loading. Many important applications are also addressed, such as photocatalytic water splitting (H-2 evolution and overall water splitting), degradation of pollutants, carbon dioxide reduction, selective organic transformations and disinfection. Through reviewing the important state-of-the-art advances on this topic, it may provide new opportunities for designing and constructing highly effective g-C(3)N(4-)based photocatalysts for various applications in photocatalysis and other related fields, such as solar cell, photoelectrocatalysis, electrocatalysis, lithium battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell and separation and purification.

Owing to their superb mechanical and electrical properties, many potential applications have been proposed for them. However, polydispersity and poor solubility in both aqueous and non-aqueous solution impose a considerable challenge for their separation and assembly, which is required for many applications. Here we report our finding of DNA-assisted dispersion and separation of carbon nanotubes. Bundled single-walled carbon nanotubes are effectively dispersed in water by their sonication in the presence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements provide evidence for individually dispersed carbon nanotubes. Molecular modelling suggests that ssDNA can bind to carbon nanotubes through pi-stacking, resulting in helical wrapping to the surface. The binding free energy of ssDNA to carbon nanotubes rivals that of two nanotubes for each other. We also demonstrate that DNA-coated carbon nanotubes can be separated into fractions with different electronic structures by ion-exchange chromatography. This finding links one of the central molecules in biology to a technologically very important nanomaterial, and opens the door to carbon-nanotube-based applications in biotechnology.																			1476-1122					MAY	2003	2	5					338	342		10.1038/nmat877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat877								12692536					WOS:000182679900023

Lead halide perovskite nanowire lasers with low lasing thresholds and high quality factors	NATURE MATERIALS												The remarkable performance of lead halide perovskites in solar cells can be attributed to the long carrier lifetimes and low non-radiative recombination rates, the same physical properties that are ideal for semiconductor lasers. Here, we show room-temperature and wavelength-tunable lasing from single-crystal lead halide perovskite nanowires with very low lasing thresholds (220 nJ cm(-2)) and high quality factors (Q similar to 3,600). The lasing threshold corresponds to a charge carrier density as low as 1.5 x 1016 cm(-3). Kinetic analysis based on time-resolved fluorescence reveals little charge carrier trapping in these single-crystal nanowires and gives estimated lasing quantum yields approaching 100%. Such lasing performance, coupled with the facile solution growth of single-crystal nanowires and the broad stoichiometry-dependent tunability of emission colour, makes lead halide perovskites ideal materials for the development of nanophotonics, in parallel with the rapid development in photovoltaics from the same materials.					zhu, y/IVU-7833-2023; Trinh, Minh/A-9740-2009; Jin, Song/B-4300-2008; Wu, Xiaoxi/Q-5877-2016	Trinh, Minh Tuan/0000-0001-8393-5669; Wu, Xiaoxi/0000-0002-1900-8964; Gong, Zizhou/0000-0002-8835-385X; Jin, Song/0000-0001-8693-7010													1476-1122	1476-4660				JUN	2015	14	6					636	U115		10.1038/NMAT4271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT4271								25849532					WOS:000354801500028

The mechanical properties measured were the Young's modulus, ultimate tensile strength, fracture toughness, fracture energy, and the material's resistance to fatigue crack propagation. The results indicate that grapheme platelets significantly out-perform carbon nanotube additives. The Young's modulus of the graphene nanocomposite was similar to 31% greater than the pristine epoxy as compared to similar to 3% increase for single-walled Carbon nanotubes. The tensile strength of the baseline epoxy was enhanced by similar to 40% with graphene platelets compared to similar to 14% improvement for multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The mode I fracture toughness of the nanocomposite with graphene platelets showed similar to 53% increase over the epoxy compared to similar to 20% improvement for multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The fatigue resistance results also showed significantly different trends. While the fatigue suppression response of nanotube/epoxy composites degrades dramatically as the stress intensity factor amplitude is increased, the reverse effect is seen for graphene-based nanocomposites. The superiority of graphene platelets over carbon nanotubes in terms of mechanical properties enhancement may be related to their high specific surface area, enhanced nanofiller-matrix adhesion/interlocking arising from their wrinkled (rough) surface, as well as the two-dimensional (planar) geometry of graphene platelets.

J	Leyland, A; Matthews, A				Leyland, A; Matthews, A			On the significance of the <i>H/E</i> ratio in wear control:: a nanocomposite coating approach to optimised tribological behaviour	WEAR												Although hardness has long been regarded as a primary material property which defines wear resistance, there is strong evidence to suggest that the elastic modulus can also have an important influence on wear behaviour. In particular, the elastic strain to failure, which is related to the ratio of hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E), has been shown by a number of authors to be a more suitable parameter for predicting wear resistance than is hardness alone. There is presently considerable interest in the development of nanostructured and nanolayered coatings, due to the fact that materials with extreme mechanical properties (which are difficult to synthesise by other methods) can be created, particularly when using plasma-assisted vacuum processing techniques. Until now, scientific research has been directed mainly towards the achievement of ultra-high hardness, with associated high elastic modulus, the latter of which, conventional fracture mechanics theory would suggest, is also desirable for wear improvement (by preventing crack propagation). In this study, we discuss the concept of nanocomposite coatings with high hardness and low elastic modulus, which can exhibit improved toughness, and are therefore better suited for optimising the wear resistance of 'real' industrial substrate materials (i.e. steels and Light alloys, with similarly low moduli). Recent advances in the development of ceramic-ceramic, ceramic-amorphous and ceramic-metal nanocomposite coatings are summarised and discussed in terms of their relevance to practical applications. We also discuss the significance of elastic strain to failure (which is related to H/E) and fracture toughness in determining tribological behaviour and introduce the topic of metallic nanocomposite coatings which, although not necessarily exhibiting extreme hardness, may provide superior wear resistance when deposited on the types of substrate material which industry needs to use.

By offering fast charging and discharging rates, and the ability to sustain millions of cycles(2-5), electrochemical capacitors bridge the gap between batteries, which offer high energy densities but are slow, and conventional electrolytic capacitors, which are fast but have low energy densities. Here, we demonstrate microsupercapacitors with powers per volume that are comparable to electrolytic capacitors, capacitances that are four orders of magnitude higher, and energies per volume that are an order of magnitude higher. We also measured discharge rates of up to 200 V s(-1), which is three orders of magnitude higher than conventional supercapacitors. The microsupercapacitors are produced by the electrophoretic deposition of a several-micrometre-thick layer of nanostructured carbon onions(6,7) with diameters of 6-7 nm. Integration of these nanoparticles in a microdevice with a high surface-to-volume ratio, without the use of organic binders and polymer separators, improves performance because of the ease with which ions can access the active material. Increasing the energy density and discharge rates of supercapacitors will enable them to compete with batteries and conventional electrolytic capacitors in a number of applications.

Chemical oxidation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes	CARBON												The effect of oxidation on the structural integrity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes through acidic (nitric acid and a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide) and basic (ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide) agents has been studied. In order to purify the as-received material, a non-oxidative treatment (with hydrochloric acid) was also applied. Electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis clearly revealed that the nitric acid-treated material under reflux conditions suffered the highest degree of degradation, such as, nanotube shortening and additional defect generation in the graphitic network. Basic oxidative treatment led to the complete removal of amorphous carbon and metal oxide impurities but the structural integrity was found to be intact. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to confirm the different functionalities produced for each oxidation agent, whereas titration measurements determined the relative concentration of carboxylic functions onto the graphitic surface. Moreover, a general relationship between the chemical treatment and the amount of non-graphitic carbon was established by means of Raman spectroscopy measurements. The possibility of controlling the required amount of functionality, carboxylic and hydroxyl, via these oxidation procedures is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ZnO nanowire UV photodetectors with high internal gain	NANO LETTERS												ZnO nanowire (NW) visible-blind UV photodetectors with internal photoconductive gain as high as G similar to 10(8) have been fabricated and characterized. The photoconduction mechanism in these devices has been elucidated by means of time-resolved measurements spanning a wide temporal domain, from 10(-9) to 10(2) s, revealing the coexistence of fast (tau similar to 20 ns) and slow (tau similar to 10 s) components of the carrier relaxation dynamics. The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the NW surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears to be effective even at the shortest time scale investigated of t < 1 ns. Despite the slow relaxation time, the extremely high internal gain of ZnO NW photodetectors results in gain-bandwidth products (GB) higher than similar to 10 GHz. The high gain and low power consumption of NW photodetectors promise a new generation of phototransistors for applications such as sensing, imaging, and intrachip optical interconnects.

However, all top-performance devices are at present processed using halogenated solvents, which are environmentally hazardous and would thus require expensive mitigation to contain the hazards. Attempts to process organic solar cells from non-halogenated solvents lead to inferior performance. Overcoming this hurdle, here we present a hydrocarbon-based processing system that is not only more environmentally friendly but also yields cells with power conversion efficiencies of up to 11.7%. Our processing system incorporates the synergistic effects of a hydrocarbon solvent, a novel additive, a suitable choice of polymer side chain, and strong temperature-dependent aggregation of the donor polymer. Our results not only demonstrate a method of producing active layers of organic solar cells in an environmentally friendly way, but also provide important scientific insights that will facilitate further improvement of the morphology and performance of organic solar cells.

In contrast to graphene, monolayer MoS2 is a non-centrosymmetric material with a direct energy gap(2,5). Strong photoluminescence(2,3) a current on/off ratio exceeding 10(8) in field-effect transistors(6), and efficient valley and spin control by optical helicity(7-9) have recently been demonstrated in this material. Here we report the spectroscopic identification in a monolayer MoS2 field-effect transistor of tightly bound negative trions, a quasiparticle composed of two electrons and a hole. These quasiparticles, which can be optically created with valley and spin polarized holes, have no analogue in conventional semiconductors. They also possess a large binding energy (similar to 20 meV), rendering them significant even at room temperature. Our results open up possibilities both for fundamental studies of many-body interactions and for optoelectronic and valleytronic applications in 2D atomic crystals.

Anisotropy of building blocks and their assembly into complex structures	NATURE MATERIALS												A revolution in novel nanoparticles and colloidal building blocks has been enabled by recent breakthroughs in particle synthesis. These new particles are poised to become the `atoms' and `molecules' of tomorrow's materials if they can be successfully assembled into useful structures. Here, we discuss the recent progress made in the synthesis of nanocrystals and colloidal particles and draw analogies between these new particulate building blocks and better-studied molecules and supramolecular objects. We argue for a conceptual framework for these new building blocks based on anisotropy attributes and discuss the prognosis for future progress in exploiting anisotropy for materials design and assembly.

Key structural parameters are the boundary spacing, between grain boundaries in the former case and between dislocation boundaries and high angle boundaries in the latter. An analysis of experimental data supports the Hall-Petch relation for undeformed metals over a grain size range from about 20 nm to hundreds of micrometers. For deformed metals, boundary strengthening is not a constant and the Hall-Petch relation must be modified. (C) 2004 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatially resolved raman spectroscopy of single- and few-layer graphene	NANO LETTERS												We present Raman spectroscopy measurements on single- and few-layer graphene flakes. By using a scanning confocal approach, we collect spectral data with spatial resolution, which allows us to directly compare Raman images with scanning force micrographs. Single-layer graphene can be distinguished from double- and few-layer by the width of the D' line: the single peak for single-layer graphene splits into different peaks for the double-layer. These findings are explained using the double-resonant Raman model based on ab initio calculations of the electronic structure and of the phonon dispersion. We investigate the D line intensity and find no defects within the flake. A finite D line response originating from the edges can be attributed either to defects or to the breakdown of translational symmetry.

TiO<sub>2</sub>-graphene nanocomposites.: UV-assisted photocatalytic reduction of graphene oxide	ACS NANO												Graphene oxide suspended in ethanol undergoes reduction as it accepts electrons from UV-irradiated TiO2 suspensions. The reduction is accompanied by changes in the absorption of the graphene oxide, as the color of the suspension shifts from brown to black. The direct interaction between TiO2 particles and graphene sheets hinders the collapse of exfoliated sheets of graphene. Solid films cast on a borosilicate glass gap separated by gold-sputtered terminations show an order of magnitude decrease in lateral resistance following reduction with the TiO2 photocatalyst. The photocatalytic methodology not only provides an on-demand UV-assisted reduction technique but also opens up new ways to obtain photoactive graphene-semiconductor composites.

Recent research has focused on the exfoliation of layered materials and then restacking the two-dimensional exfoliated nanosheets to form electrodes with enhanced electrochemical response(7-11). Here, we show that chemically exfoliated nanosheets of MoS2 containing a high concentration of the metallic 1T phase can electrochemically intercalate ions such as H+, Na+ and K+ with extraordinary efficiency and achieve capacitance values ranging from similar to 400 to similar to 700 F cm(-3) in a variety of aqueous electrolytes. We also demonstrate that this material is suitable for high-voltage (3.5 V) operation in non-aqueous organic electrolytes, showing prime volumetric energy and power density values, coulombic efficiencies in excess of 95%, and stability over 5,000 cycles. As we show by X-ray diffraction analysis, these favourable electrochemical properties of 1T MoS2 layers are mainly a result of their hydrophilicity and high electrical conductivity, as well as the ability of the exfoliated layers to dynamically expand and intercalate the various ions.

Hydrogen-treated rutile TiO2 (H:TiO2) nanowires were prepared by annealing the pristine TiO2 nanowires in hydrogen atmosphere at various temperatures in a range of 200-550 degrees C. In comparison to pristine TiO2 nanowires, H:TiO2 samples show substantially enhanced photocurrent in the entire potential window. More importantly, H:TiO2 samples have exceptionally low photocurrent saturation potentials of -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs RHE), indicating very efficient charge separation and transportation. The optimized H:TiO2 nanowire sample yields a photocurrent density of similar to 1.97 mA/cm(2) at -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, in 1 M NaOH solution under the illumination of simulated solar light (100 mW/cm(2) from 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter). This photocurrent density corresponds to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of similar to 1.63%. After eliminating the discrepancy between the irradiance of the xenon lamp and solar light, by integrating the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the H:TiO2 nanowire sample with a standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum, the STH efficiency is calculated to be similar to 1.1%, which is the best value for a TiO2 photoanode. IPCE analyses confirm the photocurrent enhancement is mainly due to the improved photoactivity of TiO2 in the UV region. Hydrogen treatment increases the donor density of TiO2 nanowires by 3 orders of magnitudes, via creating a high density of oxygen vacancies that serve as electron donors. Similar enhancements in photocurrent were also observed in anatase H:TiO2 nanotubes. The capability of making highly photoactive H:TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes opens up new opportunities in various areas, including PEC water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.

Graphene has strong cytotoxicity toward bacteria. To better understand its antimicrobial mechanism, we compared the antibacterial activity of four types of graphene-based materials (graphite (Gt), graphite oxide (GtO), graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) toward a bacterial model Escherichia coli. Under similar concentration and incubation conditions, GO dispersion shows the highest antibacterial activity, sequentially followed by rGO, Gt, and GtO. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and dynamic light scattering analyses show that GO aggregates have the smallest average size among the four types of materials. SEM images display that the direct contacts with graphene nanosheets disrupt cell membrane. No superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is detected. However, the four types of materials can oxidize glutathione, which serves as redox state mediator in bacteria. Conductive rGO and Gt have higher oxidation capacities than insulating GO and GtO. Results suggest that antimicrobial actions are contributed by both membrane and oxidation stress. We propose that a three-step antimicrobial mechanism, previously used for carbon nanotubes, is applicable to graphene-based materials. It includes initial cell deposition on graphene-based materials, membrane stress cared by direct contact with sharp nanosheets, and the ensuing superoxide anion-independent oxidation. We envision that physicochemical properties of graphene-based materials, such as density of functional groups, size, and conductivity, can be precisely tailored to either reducing their health and environmental risks or increasing their application potentials.

The absorbance has been predicted to be independent of frequency. In principle, the interband optical absorbtion in zero-gap graphene could be saturated readily under strong excitation due to Pauli blocking. Here, use of atomic layer graphene as saturable absorber in a mode-locked fiber laser for the generation of ultrashort soliton pulses (756 fs) at the telecommunication band is demonstrated. The modulation depth can be tuned in a wide range from 66.5% to 6.2% by varying the graphene thickness. These results suggest that ultrathin graphene films are potentially useful as optical elements in fiber lasers. Graphene as a laser mode locker can have many merits such as lower saturation intensity, ultrafast recovery time, tunable modulation depth, and wideband tunability.

The general approach to the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene (NG), such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) performed in gas phases, requires transitional metal catalysts which could contaminate the resultant products and thus affect their properties. In this paper, we propose a facile, catalyst-free thermal annealing approach for large-scale synthesis of NG using low-cost Industrial material melamine as the nitrogen source. This approach can completely, avoid the contamination of transition metal catalysts, and thus the intrinsic catalytic performance of pure NGs can be investigated. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectrum analysis of the resultant products shows that the atomic percentage of nitrogen In doped graphene samples can be adjusted up to 10.1%. Such a high doping level has not been reported previously. High-resolution N1s spectra reveal that the as-made NG mainly contains pyridine-like nitrogen atoms. Electrochemical characterizations clearly demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic activity of NG toward die oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) In alkaline electrolytes, which is Independent of nitrogen doping level. The present catalyst-free approach opens up the possibility for the synthesis of NG in gram-scale for electronic devices and cathodic materials for fuel cells and biosensors.

J	French, AD				French, Alfred D.			Idealized powder diffraction patterns for cellulose polymorphs	CELLULOSE												Cellulose samples are routinely analyzed by X-ray diffraction to determine their crystal type (polymorph) and crystallinity. However, the connection is seldom made between those efforts and the crystal structures of cellulose that have been proposed with synchrotron X-radiation and neutron diffraction over the past decade or so. In part, this desirable connection is thwarted by the use of different conventions for description of the unit cells of the crystal structures. In the present work, powder diffraction patterns from cellulose I alpha, I beta, II, IIII, and IIIII were calculated based on the published atomic coordinates and unit cell dimensions contained in modified "crystal information files" (.cif) that are supplied in the Supplementary Information. The calculations used peak widths at half maximum height of both 0.1 and 1.5A degrees 2 theta, providing both highly resolved indications of the contributions of each contributing reflection to the observable diffraction peaks as well as intensity profiles that more closely resemble those from practical cellulose samples. Miller indices are shown for each contributing peak that conform to the convention with c as the fiber axis, a right-handed relationship among the axes and the length of a < b. Adoption of this convention, already used for crystal structure determinations, is also urged for routine studies of polymorph and crystallinity. The calculated patterns are shown with and without preferred orientation along the fiber axis. Diffraction intensities, output by the Mercury program from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, have several uses including comparisons with experimental data. Calculated intensities from different polymorphs can be added in varying proportions using a spreadsheet program to simulate patterns such as those from partially mercerized cellulose or various composites.																			0969-0239	1572-882X				APR	2014	21	2			SI		885	896		10.1007/s10570-013-0030-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-013-0030-4													WOS:000333213800005

In spite of what has been achieved so far, a complete understanding of how cells interact with nanostructures of well-defined sizes, at the molecular level, remains poorly understood. Here we show that gold and silver nanoparticles coated with antibodies can regulate the process of membrane receptor internalization. The binding and activation of membrane receptors and subsequent protein expression strongly depend on nanoparticle size. Although all nanoparticles within the 2-100 nm size range were found to alter signalling processes essential for basic cell functions ( including cell death) 7, 40- and 50-nm nanoparticles demonstrated the greatest effect. These results show that nanoparticles should no longer be viewed as simple carriers for biomedical applications, but can also play an active role in mediating biological effects. The findings presented here may assist in the design of nanoscale delivery and therapeutic systems and provide insights into nanotoxicity.

Hydrogen evolution can be easily achieved by electrolysis at large potentials that can be lowered with expensive platinum-based catalysts. Replacement of Pt with inexpensive, earth-abundant electrocatalysts would be significantly beneficial for clean and efficient hydrogen evolution. To this end, promising results have been reported using 2H (trigonal prismatic) XS2 (where X = Mo or W) nanoparticles with a high concentration of metallic edges. The key challenges for XS2 are increasing the number and catalytic activity of active sites. Here we report monolayered nanosheets of chemically exfoliated WS2 as efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution with very low overpotentials. Analyses indicate that the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of WS2 is associated with the high concentration of the strained metallic 1T (octahedral) phase in the as-exfoliated nanosheets. Our results suggest that chemically exfoliated WS2 nanosheets are interesting catalysts for hydrogen evolution.

Silicon has a large charge storage capacity and this makes it an attractive anode material, but pulverization during cycling and an unstable solid-electrolyte interphase has limited the cycle life of silicon anodes to hundreds of cycles(6-11). Here, we show that anodes consisting of an active silicon nanotube surrounded by an ion-permeable silicon oxide shell can cycle over 6,000 times in half cells while retaining more than 85% of their initial capacity. The outer surface of the silicon nanotube is prevented from expansion by the oxide shell, and the expanding inner surface is not exposed to the electrolyte, resulting in a stable solid-electrolyte interphase. Batteries containing these double-walled silicon nanotube anodes exhibit charge capacities approximately eight times larger than conventional carbon anodes and charging rates of up to 20C (a rate of 1C corresponds to complete charge or discharge in one hour).

Graphene Plasmonics: A Platform for Strong Light-Matter Interactions	NANO LETTERS												Graphene plasmons provide a suitable alternative to noble-metal plasmons because they exhibit much tighter confinement and relatively long propagation distances, with the advantage of being highly tunable via electrostatic gating. Here, we propose to use graphene plasmons as a platform for strongly enhanced light-matter interactions. Specifically, we predict unprecedented high decay rates of quantum emitters in the proximity of a carbon sheet, observable vacuum Rabi splittings, and extinction cross sections exceeding the geometrical area in graphene nanoribbons and nanodisks. Our theoretical results provide the basis for the emerging and potentially far-reaching field of graphene plasmonics, offering an ideal platform for cavity quantum electrodynamics, and supporting the possibility of single-molecule, single-plasmon devices.

Among the various types of metasurfaces, geometric metasurfaces, which consist of an array of plasmonic nanorods with spatially varying orientations, have shown superior phase control due to the geometric nature of their phase profile(12,13). Metasurfaces have recently been used to make computer-generated holograms(14-19), but the hologram efficiency remained too low at visible wavelengths for practical purposes. Here, we report the design and realization of a geometric metasurface hologram reaching diffraction efficiencies of 80% at 825 nm and a broad bandwidth between 630 nm and 1,050 nm. The 16-level-phase computer-generated hologram demonstrated here combines the advantages of a geometric metasurface for the superior control of the phase profile and of reflectarrays for achieving high polarization conversion efficiency. Specifically, the design of the hologram integrates a ground metal plane with a geometric metasurface that enhances the conversion efficiency between the two circular polarization states, leading to high diffraction efficiency without complicating the fabrication process. Because of these advantages, our strategy could be viable for various practical holographic applications.					zhang, shuang/G-5224-2011; Li, Guixin/AAZ-9865-2020; Kenney, Mitchell/I-1462-2019; Zheng, Guoxing/W-9129-2019; Zentgraf, Thomas/G-8848-2013	Zentgraf, Thomas/0000-0002-8662-1101; Zheng, Guoxing/0000-0002-3226-4735; Zhang, Shuang/0000-0003-4556-2333; Kenney, Mitchell/0000-0002-5009-9729													1748-3387	1748-3395				APR	2015	10	4					308	312		10.1038/NNANO.2015.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NNANO.2015.2								25705870					WOS:000353365600012

Surface enhanced Raman scattering enhancement factors: a comprehensive study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C												This paper presents an in-depth study of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) enhancement factors (EFs) and cross-sections, including several issues often overlooked. In particular, various possible rigorous definitions of the SERS EFs are introduced and discussed in the context of SERS applications, such as analytical chemistry and single molecule SERS. These definitions highlight the importance of a careful characterization of the non-SERS cross-sections of the probes under consideration. This aspect is illustrated by experimental results for the non-SERS cross-sections of representative SERS probes along with average SERS EFs for the same probes. In addition, the accurate experimental determination of single molecule enhancement factors is tackled with two recently developed techniques, namely: bi-analyte SERS (BiASERS) and temperature-dependent SERS vibrational pumping. We demonstrate that SERS EFs as low as 10(7), as opposed to the figure of 10(14) often claimed in the literature, are sufficient for the observation of single molecule SERS signals, with maximum single molecule EFs typically on the order of similar to 10(14).

However, aqueous Zn chemistry persistently suffers from irreversibility issues, as exemplified by its low coulombic efficiency (CE) and dendrite growth during plating/stripping, and sustained water consumption. In this work, we demonstrate that an aqueous electrolyte based on Zn and lithium salts at high concentrations is a very effective way to address these issues. This unique electrolyte not only enables dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping at nearly 100% CE, but also retains water in the open atmosphere, which makes hermetic cell configurations optional. These merits bring unprecedented flexibility and reversibility to Zn batteries using either LiMn2O4 or O-2 cathodes-the former deliver 180 W h kg(-1) while retaining 80% capacity for > 4,000 cycles, and the latter deliver 300 W h kg(-1) (1,000 W h kg(-1) based on the cathode) for > 200 cycles.

Storing and efficiently using electricity generated by intermittent sources and the transition of our transportation fleet to electric drive depend fundamentally on the development of EES systems with high energy and power densities. Supercapacitors are promising devices for highly efficient energy storage and power management, yet they still suffer from moderate energy densities compared to batteries. To establish a detailed understanding of the science and technology of carbon/carbon supercapacitors, this review discusses the basic principles of the electrical double-layer (EDL), especially regarding the correlation between ion size/ion solvation and the pore size of porous carbon electrodes. We summarize the key aspects of various carbon materials synthesized for use in supercapacitors. With the objective of improving the energy density, the last two sections are dedicated to strategies to increase the capacitance by either introducing pseudocapacitive materials or by using novel electrolytes that allow to increasing the cell voltage. In particular, advances in ionic liquids, but also in the field of organic electrolytes, are discussed and electrode mass balancing is expanded because of its importance to create higher performance asymmetric electrochemical capacitors.

The highest efficiencies have been achieved using blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a fullerene derivative(8-12), but performance depends critically on the material properties and processing conditions. This variability is believed to be influenced by the self-organizing properties of P3HT, which means that both optical(13,14) and electronic(15,16) properties are sensitive to the molecular packing. However, the relationship between molecular nanostructure, optoelectronic properties of the blend material and device performance has not yet been demonstrated. Here we focus on the influence of polymer regioregularity (RR) on the molecular nanostructure, and hence on the resulting material properties and device performance. We find a strong influence of RR on solar-cell performance, which can be attributed to enhanced optical absorption and transport resulting from the organization of P3HT chains and domains. Further optimization of devices using the highest RR material resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 4.4%, even without optimization of electrodes(7).

J	Barsan, N; Weimar, U				Barsan, N; Weimar, U			Conduction model of metal oxide gas sensors	JOURNAL OF ELECTROCERAMICS												Tin dioxide is a widely used sensitive material for gas sensors. Many research and development groups in academia and industry are contributing to the increase of (basic) knowledge/(applied) know-how. However, from a systematic point of view the knowledge gaining process seems not to be coherent. One reason is the lack of a general applicable model which combines the basic principles with measurable sensor parameters. The approach in the presented work is to provide a frame model that deals with all contributions involved in conduction within a real world sensor. For doing so, one starts with identifying the different building blocks of a sensor. Afterwards their main inputs are analyzed in combination with the gas reaction involved in sensing. At the end, the contributions are summarized together with their interactions. The work presented here is one step towards a general applicable model for real world gas sensors.

Biomimetic 4D printing	NATURE MATERIALS												Shape-morphing systems can be found in many areas, including smart textiles(1), autonomous robotics(2), biomedical devices(3), drug delivery(4) and tissue engineering(5). The natural analogues of such systems are exemplified by nastic plant motions, where a variety of organs such as tendrils, bracts, leaves and flowers respond to environmental stimuli (such as humidity, light or touch) by varying internal turgor, which leads to dynamic conformations governed by the tissue composition and microstructural anisotropy of cell walls(6-10). Inspired by these botanical systems, we printed composite hydrogel architectures that are encoded with localized, anisotropic swelling behaviour controlled by the alignment of cellulose fibrils along prescribed four-dimensional printing pathways. When combined with a minimal theoretical framework that allows us to solve the inverse problem of designing the alignment patterns for prescribed target shapes, we can programmably fabricate plant-inspired architectures that change shape on immersion in water, yielding complex three-dimensional morphologies.

Among the many affected areas of materials science, this ` graphene fever' has influenced particularly the world of electrochemical energy-storage devices. Despite widespread enthusiasm, it is not yet clear whether graphene could really lead to progress in the field. Here we discuss the most recent applications of graphene both as an active material and as an inactive component - from lithium-ion batteries and electrochemical capacitors to emerging technologies such as metal-air and magnesium-ion batteries. By critically analysing state-of-the-art technologies, we aim to address the benefits and issues of graphene-based materials, as well as outline the most promising results and applications so far.

The technique is based on density functional theory using norm conserving nonlocal pseudopotentials to define the atomic core and nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF's) to calculate the charge distribution. The modeling of an open device system is reduced to a calculation defined on a finite region of space using a screening approximation. The interaction between the device scattering region and the electrodes is accounted for by self-energies within the NEGF formalism. Our technique overcomes several difficulties of doing first principles modeling of open molecular quantum coherent conductors. We apply this technique to investigate single wall carbon nanotubes in contact with an Al metallic electrode. We have studied the current-voltage characteristics of the nanotube-metal interface from first principles. Our results suggest that there are two transmission eigenvectors contributing to the ballistic conductance of the interface, with a total conductance G approximate toG(0) where G(0)=2e(2)/h is the conductance quanta. This is about half of the expected value for infinite perfect metallic nanotubes.

Mechanical properties of Nb<sub>25</sub>Mo<sub>25</sub>Ta<sub>25</sub>W<sub>25</sub> and V<sub>20</sub>Nb<sub>20</sub>Mo<sub>20</sub>Ta<sub>20</sub>W<sub>20</sub> refractory high entropy alloys	INTERMETALLICS												Two refractory high entropy alloys with compositions near Nb25Mo25Ta25W25 and V20Nb20Mo20Ta20W20, were produced by vacuum arc-melting. Despite containing many constituents, both alloys had a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure that remained not only stable after exposure to 1400 degrees C, but also disordered, as confirmed by the absence of superlattice reflections in neutron diffraction data. Compressive flow properties and microstructure development of these alloys were determined from room temperature up to 1600 degrees C. Limited compressive plasticity and quasi-cleavage fracture at room temperature suggest that the ductile-to-brittle transition for these alloys occurs above room temperature. At 600 degrees C and above, both alloys showed extensive compressive plastic strain. The yield stress of both alloys dropped by 30-40% between room temperature and 600 degrees C, but was relatively insensitive to temperature above 600 degrees C, comparing favorably with conventional superalloys.

Using highly sensitive photothermal deflection and photocurrent spectroscopy, we measure the absorption spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films at room temperature. We find a high absorption coefficient with particularly sharp onset. Below the bandgap, the absorption is exponential over more than four decades with an Urbach energy as small as 15 meV, which suggests a well-ordered microstructure. No deep states are found down to the detection limit of similar to 1 cm(-1). These results confirm the excellent electronic properties of perovskite thin films, enabling the very high open-circuit voltages reported for perovskite solar cells. Following intentional moisture ingress, we find that the absorption at photon energies below 2.4 eV is strongly reduced, pointing to a compositional change of the material.

Essential device properties such as lifetime, series resistance and optical properties must be improved simultaneously to reduce recombination, resistive and optical losses. Here, we use industrially compatible processes to fabricate large-area silicon solar cells combining interdigitated back contacts and an amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction. The photoconversion efficiency is over 26% with a 180.4 cm(2) designated area, which is an improvement of 2.7% relative to the previous record efficiency of 25.6%.

Isolation and characterization of few-layer black phosphorus	2D MATERIALS												Isolation and characterization of mechanically exfoliated black phosphorus flakes with a thickness down to two single-layers is presented. A modification of the mechanical exfoliation method, which provides higher yield of atomically thin flakes than conventional mechanical exfoliation, has been developed. We present general guidelines to determine the number of layers using optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a fast and reliable way. Moreover, we demonstrate that the exfoliated flakes are highly crystalline and that they are stable even in free-standing form through Raman spectroscopy and TEM measurements. A strong thickness dependence of the band structure is found by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The exciton binding energy, within an effective mass approximation, is also calculated for different number of layers. Our computational results for the optical gap are consistent with preliminary photoluminescence results on thin flakes. Finally, we study the environmental stability of black phosphorus flakes finding that the flakes are very hydrophilic and that long term exposure to air moisture etches black phosphorus away. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the aging of the flakes is slow enough to allow fabrication of field-effect transistors with strong ambipolar behavior. DFT calculations also give us insight into the water-induced changes of the structural and electronic properties of black phosphorus.					van der Zant, Herre/J-9467-2016; Vicarelli, Leonardo/ABB-9843-2021; Steele, Gary/AGW-7220-2022; Prada, Elsa/A-4792-2010; Island, Joshua/P-4686-2014; Palacios, Juan Jose/A-9872-2011; Groenendijk, Dirk/B-1092-2015; Alvarez, Jose/H-4696-2015; Castellanos-Gomez, Andres/E-7852-2010	Prada, Elsa/0000-0001-7522-4795; Island, Joshua/0000-0002-6074-9414; Steele, Gary/0000-0003-1032-6226; Vicarelli, Leonardo/0000-0002-1443-784X; Palacios, Juan Jose/0000-0003-2378-0866; Groenendijk, Dirk/0000-0002-0967-1375; Alvarez, Jose/0000-0001-5178-4309; Castellanos-Gomez, Andres/0000-0002-3384-3405													2053-1583					SEP	2014	1	2							025001	10.1088/2053-1583/1/2/025001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2053-1583/1/2/025001													WOS:000353650400006

The prepared F-doped TiO2 powders were characterized by differential thermal analysis-thermogravimetry (DTA-TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra (PL), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and BET surface areas. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the photocatalytic oxidation of acetone in air. The results showed that the crystallinity of anatase was improved upon F- doping. Moreover, fluoride ions not only suppressed the formation of brookite phase but also prevented phase transition of anatase to rutile. The F-doped TiO2 samples exhibited stronger absorption in the UV-visible range with a red shift in the band gap transition. The photocatalytic activity of F-doped TiO2 powders prepared by this method exceeded that of Degussa P25 when the molar ratio of NH4F to H2O was kept in the range of 0.5-3.

It has the potential for technological applications as a successor of silicon in the post Moore's law era(5-7), as a single-molecule gas sensor(8), in spintronics(9-11), in quantum computing(12) or as a terahertz oscillator(13). For such applications, uniform ordered growth of graphene on an insulating substrate is necessary. The growth of graphene on insulating silicon carbide (SiC) surfaces by high-temperature annealing in vacuum was previously proposed to open a route for large-scale production of graphene-based devices(5,6). However, vacuum decomposition of SiC yields graphene layers with small grains (30-200 nm; refs 14-16). Here, we show that the ex situ graphitization of Si-terminated SiC(0001) in an argon atmosphere of about 1 bar produces monolayer graphene films with much larger domain sizes than previously attainable. Raman spectroscopy and Hall measurements confirm the improved quality of the films thus obtained. High electronic mobilities were found, which reach mu = 2,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at T = 27 K. The new growth process introduced here establishes a method for the synthesis of graphene films on a technologically viable basis.

J	Wang, JC; Kaskel, S				Wang, Jiacheng; Kaskel, Stefan			KOH activation of carbon-based materials for energy storage	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY												Because of their availability, adjustable microstructure, varieties of forms, and large specific surface area, porous carbon materials are of increasing interest for use in hydrogen storage adsorbents and electrode materials in supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur cells from the viewpoint of social sustainability and environmental friendliness. Therefore, much effort has been made to synthesize and tailor the microstructures of porous carbon materials via various activation procedures (physical and chemical activation). In particular, the chemical activation of various carbon sources using KOH as the activating reagent is very promising because of its lower activation temperature and higher yields, and well-defined micropore size distribution and ultrahigh specific surface area up to 3000 m(2) g(-1) of the resulting porous carbons. In this feature article, we will cover recent research progress since 2007 on the synthesis of KOH-activated carbons for hydrogen and electrical energy storage (supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur batteries). The textural properties and surface chemistry of KOH-activated carbons depend on not only the synthesis parameters, but also different carbon sources employed including fossil/biomass-derived materials, synthetic organic polymers, and various nanostructured carbons (e.g. carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon aerogels, carbide-derived carbons, graphene, etc.). Following the introduction to KOH activation mechanisms and processing technologies, the characteristics and performance of KOH-activated carbons as well as their relationships are summarized and discussed through the extensive analysis of the literature based on different energy storage systems.					wang, Jiacheng/A-8458-2008; Kaskel, Stefan/T-8393-2017	Kaskel, Stefan/0000-0003-4572-0303; wang, jiacheng/0000-0003-4327-1508													0959-9428					DEC 7	2012	22	45					23710	23725		10.1039/c2jm34066f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2jm34066f													WOS:000311522500001

Shape effects of filaments versus spherical particles in flow and drug delivery	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Interaction of spherical particles with cells and within animals has been studied extensively, but the effects of shape have received little attention. Here we use highly stable, polymer micelle assemblies known as filomicelles to compare the transport and trafficking of flexible filaments with spheres of similar chemistry. In rodents, filomicelles persisted in the circulation up to one week after intravenous injection. This is about ten times longer than their spherical counterparts and is more persistent than any known synthetic nanoparticle. Under fluid flow conditions, spheres and short filomicelles are taken up by cells more readily than longer filaments because the latter are extended by the flow. Preliminary results further demonstrate that filomicelles can effectively deliver the anticancer drug paclitaxel and shrink human-derived tumours in mice.

This is likely to continue to rise, but in the development of these solar cells there are unusual characteristics that have arisen, specifically an anomalous hysteresis in the current voltage curves. We identify this phenomenon and show some examples of factors that make the hysteresis more or less extreme. We also demonstrate stabilized power output under working conditions and suggest that this is a useful parameter to present, alongside the current-voltage scan derived power conversion efficiency. We hypothesize three possible origins of the effect and discuss its implications on device efficiency and future research directions. Understanding and resolving the hysteresis is essential for further progress and is likely to lead to a further step improvement in performance.

Silicon anodes can be used both in traditional lithium-ion batteries and in more recent Li-O-2 and Li-S batteries as a replacement for the dendrite-forming lithium metal anodes. The main challenges associated with silicon anodes are structural degradation and instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase caused by the large volume change (similar to 300%) during cycling, the occurrence of side reactions with the electrolyte, and the low volumetric capacity when the material size is reduced to a nanometre scale(4-7). Here, we propose a hierarchical structured silicon anode that tackles all three of these problems. Our design is inspired by the structure of a pomegranate, where single silicon nanoparticles are encapsulated by a conductive carbon layer that leaves enough room for expansion and contraction following lithiation and delithiation. An ensemble of these hybrid nanoparticles is then encapsulated by a thicker carbon layer in micrometre-size pouches to act as an electrolyte barrier. As a result of this hierarchical arrangement, the solid-electrolyte interphase remains stable and spatially confined, resulting in superior cyclability (97% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles). In addition, the microstructures lower the electrode-electrolyte contact area, resulting in high Coulombic efficiency (99.87%) and volumetric capacity (1,270 mAh cm(-3)), and the cycling remains stable even when the areal capacity is increased to the level of commercial lithium-ion batteries (3.7 mAh cm(-2)).

Highly ordered nanotube arrays of 46-nm pore diameter, 17-nm wall thickness, and 360-nm length were grown perpendicular to a fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass substrate by anodic oxidation of a titanium thin film. After crystallization by an oxygen anneal, the nanotube arrays are treated with TiCl4 to enhance the photogenerated current and then integrated into the DSC structure using a commercially available ruthenium-based dye. Although the negative electrode is only 360-nm-thick, under AM 1.5 illumination the generated photocurrent is 7.87 mA/cm(2), with a photocurrent efficiency of 2.9%. Voltage-decay measurements indicate that the highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays, in comparison to nanoparticulate systems, have superior electron lifetimes and provide excellent pathways for electron percolation. Our results indicate that remarkable photoconversion efficiencies may be obtained, possibly to the ideal limit of similar to 31% for a single photosystem scheme, with an increase of the nanotube-array length to several micrometers.

Single and bilayer MoS2 is exfoliated from bulk and transferred to a substrate containing an array of microfabricated circular holes. The resulting suspended, free-standing membranes are deformed and eventually broken using an atomic force microscope. We find that the In-plane stiffness of monolayer MoS2 is 180 +/- 60 Nm(-1), corresponding to an effective Young's modulus of 270 +/- 100 GPa, which Is comparable to that of steel. Breaking occurs at an effective strain between 6 and 11% with the average breaking strength of 15 +/- 3 Nm(-1) (23 GPa). The strength of strongest monolayer membranes Is 11% of its Young's modulus, corresponding to the upper theoretical limit which indicates that the material can be highly crystalline and almost defect-free. Our results show that monolayer MoS2 could be suitable for a variety of applications such as reinforcing elements in composites and for fabrication of flexible electronic devices.

However, the usual synthesis needs high temperature, inert gas protection, and localized injection operation, which are severely against applications. Moreover, the so unexpectedly high QYs are very confusing. Here, for the first time, the IPQDs' room-temperature (RT) synthesis, superior PL, underlying origins and potentials in lighting and displays are reported. The synthesis is designed according to supersaturated recrystallization (SR), which is operated at RT, within few seconds, free from inert gas and injection operation. Although formed at RT, IPQDs' PLs have QYs of 80%, 95%, 70%, and FWHMs of 35, 20, and 18 nm for red, green, and blue emissions. As to the origins, the observed 40 meV exciton binding energy, halogen self-passivation effect, and CsPbX3@X quantum-well band alignment are proposed to guarantee the excitons generation and high-rate radiative recombination at RT. Moreover, such superior optical merits endow them with promising potentials in lighting and displays, which are primarily demonstrated by the white light-emitting diodes with tunable color temperature and wide color gamut.

This process is characterized by highly localized high heat inputs during very short interaction times and will therefore significantly affect the microstructure. In this research, the development of the microstructure of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy processed by SLM and the influence of the scanning parameters and scanning strategy on this microstructure are studied by light optical microscopy. The martensitic phase is present, and due to the occurrence of epitaxial growth, elongated grains emerge. The direction of these grains is directly related to the process parameters. At high heat inputs it was also found that the intermetallic phase Ti3Al is precipitated during the process. (C) 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, YC; Lv, JA; Zhu, L; Ma, YM				Wang, Yanchao; Lv, Jian; Zhu, Li; Ma, Yanming			Crystal structure prediction via particle-swarm optimization	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We have developed a method for crystal structure prediction from "scratch" through particle-swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm within the evolutionary scheme. PSO technique is different with the genetic algorithm and has apparently avoided the use of evolution operators (e.g., crossover and mutation). The approach is based on an efficient global minimization of free-energy surfaces merging total-energy calculations via PSO technique and requires only chemical compositions for a given compound to predict stable or metastable structures at given external conditions (e.g., pressure). A particularly devised geometrical structure parameter which allows the elimination of similar structures during structure evolution was implemented to enhance the structure search efficiency. The application of designed variable unit-cell size technique has greatly reduced the computational cost. Moreover, the symmetry constraint imposed in the structure generation enables the realization of diverse structures, leads to significantly reduced search space and optimization variables, and thus fastens the global structure convergence. The PSO algorithm has been successfully applied to the prediction of many known systems (e.g., elemental, binary, and ternary compounds) with various chemical-bonding environments (e.g., metallic, ionic, and covalent bonding). The high success rate demonstrates the reliability of this methodology and illustrates the promise of PSO as a major technique on crystal structure determination.

Beyond Intercalation-Based Li-Ion Batteries: The State of the Art and Challenges of Electrode Materials Reacting Through Conversion Reactions	ADVANCED MATERIALS												Despite the imminent commercial introduction of Li-ion batteries in electric drive vehicles and their proposed use as enablers of smart grids based on renewable energy technologies, an intensive quest for new electrode materials that bring about improvements in energy density, cycle life, cost, and safety is still underway. This Progress Report highlights the recent developments and the future prospects of the use of phases that react through conversion reactions as both positive and negative electrode materials in Li-ion batteries. By moving beyond classical intercalation reactions, a variety of low cost compounds with gravimetric specific capacities that are two-to-five times larger than those attained with currently used materials, such as graphite and LiCoO2, can be achieved. Nonetheless, several factors currently handicap the applicability of electrode materials entailing conversion reactions. These factors, together with the scientific breakthroughs that are necessary to fully assess the practicality of this concept, are reviewed in this report.					Cabana, Jordi/G-6548-2012; Palacin, M.

In this paper, a facile approach to the synthesis of high quality graphene nanosheets in large scale through electrochemical reduction of exfoliated graphite oxide precursor at cathodic potentials (completely reduced potential: -1.5 V) is reported. This method is green and fast, and will not result in contamination of the reduced material. The electrochemically reduced graphene nanosheets have been carefully characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques in comparison to the chemically reduced graphene-based product. Particularly, FTIR spectra indicate that a variety of the oxygen-containing functional groups have been thoroughly removed from the graphite oxide plane via electrochemical reduction. The chemically converted materials are not expected to exhibit graphene's electronic properties because of residual defects. Indeed, the high quality grapheme accelerates the electron transfer rate in dopamine electrochemistry (Delta E-p is as small as 44 mV which is much smaller than that on a glassy carbon electrode). This approach opens up the possibility for assembling graphene biocomposites for electrocatalysis and the construction of blosensors..					; , Hui-Lin/G-5096-2011	Xia, Xing-Hua/0000-0001-9831-4048; , Hui-Lin/0000-0003-1046-2033													1936-0851	1936-086X				SEP	2009	3	9					2653	2659		10.1021/nn900227d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn900227d								19691285					WOS:000269988600029

In this work, for the first time we study the in vivo behaviors of nanographene sheets (NGS) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating by a fluorescent labeling method. In vivo fluorescence imaging reveals surprisingly high tumor uptake of NGS in several xenograft tumor mouse models. Distinctive from PEGylated carbon nanotubes, PEGylated NGS shows several interesting in vivo behaviors including highly efficient tumor passive targeting and relatively low retention in reticuloendothelial systems. We then utilize the strong optical absorbance of NGS in the near-infrared (NIR) region for in vivo photothermal therapy, achieving ultraefficient tumor ablation after intravenous administration of NGS and low-power NIR laser irradiation on the tumor. Furthermore, no obvious side effect of PEGylated NGS is noted for the injected mice by histology, blood chemistry, and complete blood panel analysis in our pilot toxicity study. Although a lot more efforts are required to further understand the in vivo behaviors and the long-term toxicology of this new type of nanomaterials, our work is the first success of using carbon nanomaterials for efficient in vivo photothermal therapy by intravenous administration and suggests the great promise of graphene in biomedical applications, such as cancer treatment.

The focus of this article is on contacts. We demonstrate that through a proper understanding and design of source/drain contacts and the right choice of number of MoS2 layers the excellent intrinsic properties of this 2-D material can be harvested. Using scandium contacts on 10-nm-thick exfoliated MoS2 flakes that are covered by a 15 nm Al2O3 film, high effective mobilities of 700 cm(2)/(V s) room temperature. This breakthrough is largely attributed to the fact that we succeeded in eliminating contact resistance effects that limited the device performance in the past unrecognized.

JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY												There are an increasing number of studies regarding active electrode materials that undergo faradaic reactions but are used for electrochemical capacitor applications. Unfortunately, some of these materials are described as "pseudocapacitive" materials despite the fact that their electrochemical signature (e.g., cyclic voltarnmogram and charge/discharge curve) is analogous to that of a "battery" material, as commonly observed for Ni(OH)(2) and cobalt oxides in KOH electrolyte. Conversely, true pseudocapacitive electrode materials such as MnO2 display electrochemical behavior typical of that observed for a capacitive carbon electrode. The difference between these two classes of materials will be explained, and we demonstrate why it is inappropriate to describe nickel oxide or hydroxide and cobalt oxide/hydroxide as pseudocapacitive electrode materials.

J	Akhavan, O; Ghaderi, E				Akhavan, Omid; Ghaderi, Elham			Toxicity of Graphene and Graphene Oxide Nanowalls Against Bacteria	ACS NANO												Bacterial toxicity of graphene nanosheets in the form of graphene nanowalls deposited on stainless steel substrates was investigated for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative models of bacteria. The graphene oxide nanowalls were obtained by electrophoretic deposition of Mg2+-graphene oxide nanosheets synthesized by a chemical exfoliation method. On the basis of measuring the efflux of cytoplasmic materials of the bacteria, it was found that the cell membrane damage of the bacteria caused by direct contact of the bacteria with the extremely sharp edges of the nanowalls was the effective mechanism in the bacterial inactivation. In this regard, the Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria with an outer membrane were more resistant to the cell membrane damage caused by the nanowalls than the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus lacking the outer membrane. Moreover, the graphene oxide nanowalls reduced by hydrazine were more toxic to the bacteria than the unreduced graphene oxide nanowalls. The better antibacterial activity of the reduced nanowalls was assigned to the better charge transfer between the bacteria and the more sharpened edges of the reduced nanowalls, during the contact interaction.

Transmissive metasurfaces are especially important, as most optical systems used in practice operate in transmission. Several types of transmissive metasurface have been realized(3-6), but with either low transmission efficiencies or limited control over polarization and phase. Here, we show a metasurface platform based on high-contrast dielectric elliptical nanoposts that provides complete control of polarization and phase with subwavelength spatial resolution and an experimentally measured efficiency ranging from 72% to 97%, depending on the exact design. Such complete control enables the realization of most free-space transmissive optical elements such as lenses, phase plates, wave plates, polarizers, beamsplitters, as well as polarization-switchable phase holograms and arbitrary vector beam generators using the same metamaterial platform.

Perspectives on Titanium Science and Technology	ACTA MATERIALIA												The basic framework and - conceptual understanding of the metallurgy of Ti alloys is strong and this has enabled the use of titanium and its alloys in safety-critical structures such as those in aircraft and aircraft engines. Nevertheless, a focus on cost-effectiveness and the compression of product development time by effectively integrating design with manufacturing in these applications, as well as those emerging in bioengineering, has driven research in recent decades towards a greater predictive capability through the use of computational materials engineering tools. Therefore this paper focuses on the complexity and variety of fundamental phenomena in this material system with a focus on phase transformations and mechanical behaviour in order to delineate the challenges that lie ahead in achieving these goals.

A novel poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) structure with a unique architecture produced by an electrospinning process has been developed for tissue-engineering applications. Electrospinning is a process whereby ultra-fine fibers are formed in a high-voltage electrostatic field. The electrospun structure, composed of PLGA fibers ranging from 500 to 800 rim in diameter, features a morphologic similarity to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of natural tissue, which is characterized by a wide range of pore diameter distribution, high porosity, and effective mechanical properties. Such a structure meets the essential design criteria of an ideal engineered scaffold. The favorable cell-matrix interaction within the cellular construct supports the active biocompatibility of the structure. The electrospun nanofibrous structure is capable of supporting cell attachment and proliferation. Cells seeded on this structure tend to maintain phenotypic shape and guided growth according to nanofiber orientation. This novel biodegradable scaffold has potential applications for tissue engineering based upon its unique architecture, which acts to support and guide cell growth.

The aim of this study was to investigate the degradation mechanism at the bone-implant interface of different degrading magnesium alloys in bone and to determine their effect on the surrounding bone. Sample rods of four different magnesium alloys and a degradable polymer as a control were implanted intramedullary into the femora of guinea pigs. After 6 and 18 weeks, uncalcified sections were generated for histomorphologic analysis. The bone-implant interface was characterized in uncalcified sections by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), element mapping and X-ray diffraction. Results showed that metallic implants made of magnesium alloys degrade in vivo depending on the composition of the alloying elements. While the corrosion layer of all magnesium alloys accumulated with biological calcium phosphates, the corrosion layer was in direct contact with the surrounding bone. The results further showed high mineral apposition rates and an increased bone mass around the magnesium rods, while no bone was induced in the surrounding soft tissue. From the results of this study, there is a strong rationale that in this research model, high magnesium ion concentration could lead to bone cell activation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The composite film has a layered structure, and PANI-NFs are sandwiched between CCG layers. Furthermore, it is mechanically stable and has a high flexibility; thus, it can be bent into large angles or be shaped into various desired structures. The conductivity of the composite film containing 44% CCG (5.5 x 10(2) S m(-1)) is about 10 times that of a PANI-NF film. Supercapacitor devices based on this conductive flexible composite film showed large electrochemical capacitance (210 F g(-1)) at a discharge rate of 0.3 A g(-1). They also exhibited greatly improved electrochemical stability and rate performances.					liu, anran/HTQ-0424-2023; Xu, Yuxi/A-5182-2010; Wu, Qiong/F-1515-2015	Wu, Qiong/0000-0001-8768-7738													1936-0851	1936-086X				APR	2010	4	4					1963	1970		10.1021/nn1000035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn1000035								20355733					WOS:000276956800027

BIOMATERIALS												A comparative in vitro cytotoxicity study with different water-soluble, cationic macromolecules which have been described as gene delivery systems was performed. Cytotoxicity in L929 mouse fibroblasts was monitored using the MTT assay and the release of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Microscopic observations were carried out as indicators for cell viability. Furthermore, hemolysis of erythrocytes was quantified spectrophotometrically. To determine the nature of cell death induced by the polycations, the nuclear morphology after DAPI staining and the inhibition of the toxic effects by the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk were investigated. All assays yielded comparable results and allowed the following ranking of the polymers with regard to cytotoxicity: Poly(ethylenimine) = poly(L-lysine) > poly(diallyl-dimethyl-ammonium chloride) > diethylaminoethyl-dextran > poly (vinyl pyridinium bromide) > Starburst dendrimer > cationized albumin > native albumin. The magnitude of the cytotoxic effects of all polymers were found to be time- and concentration dependent. The molecular weight as well as the cationic charge density of the polycations were confirmed as key parameters for the interaction with the cell membranes and consequently, the cell damage. Evaluating the nature of cell death induced by poly(ethylenimine), we did not detect any indication for apoptosis suggesting that the polymer induced a necrotic cell reaction. Cell nuclei retained their size, chromatin was homogenously distributed and cell membranes lost their integrity very rapidly at an early stage. Furthermore, the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk did not inhibit poly(ethylenimine)-induced cell damage. Insights into the structure-toxicity relationship are necessary to optimize the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of non-viral gene delivery systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Substrate-induced bandgap opening in epitaxial graphene	NATURE MATERIALS												Graphene has shown great application potential as the host material for next-generation electronic devices. However, despite its intriguing properties, one of the biggest hurdles for graphene to be useful as an electronic material is the lack of an energy gap in its electronic spectra. This, for example, prevents the use of graphene in making transistors. Although several proposals have been made to open a gap in graphene's electronic spectra, they all require complex engineering of the graphene layer. Here, we show that when graphene is epitaxially grown on SiC substrate, a gap of approximate to 0.26 eV is produced. This gap decreases as the sample thickness increases and eventually approaches zero when the number of layers exceeds four. We propose that the origin of this gap is the breaking of sublattice symmetry owing to the graphene-substrate interaction. We believe that our results highlight a promising direction for bandgap engineering of graphene.

Graphene Quantum Dots Derived from Carbon Fibers	NANO LETTERS												Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which are edge-bound nanometer-size graphene pieces, have fascinating optical and electronic properties. These have been synthesized either by nanolithography or from starting materials such as graphene oxide (GO) by the chemical breakdown of their extended planar structure, both of which are multistep tedious processes. Here, we report that during the acid treatment and chemical exfoliation of traditional pitch-based carbon fibers, that are both cheap and commercially available, the stacked graphitic submicrometer domains of the fibers are easily broken down, leading to the creation of GQDs with different size distribution in scalable amounts. The as-produced GQDs, in the size range of 1-4 nm, show two-dimensional morphology, most of which present zigzag edge structure, and are 1-3 atomic layers thick. The photoluminescence of the GQDs can be tailored through varying the size of the GQDs by changing process parameters. Due to the luminescence stability, nanosecond lifetime, biocompatibility, low toxicity, and high water solubility, these GQDs are demonstrated to be excellent probes for high contrast bioimaging and biosensing applications.

Comparison of the Mechanism of Toxicity of Zinc Oxide and Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles Based on Dissolution and Oxidative Stress Properties	ACS NANO												Nanomaterials (NM) exhibit novel physicochemical properties that determine their interaction with biological substrates and processes. Three metal oxide nanoparticles that are currently being produced in high tonnage, TiO2 ZnO, and CeO2 were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis process and compared in a mechanistic study to elucidate the physicochemical characteristics that determine cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and toxic effects based on a test paradigm that was originally developed for oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 and BEAS-2B cell lines. ZnO induced toxicity in both cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidant injury, excitation of inflammation, and cell death. Using ICP-MS and fluorescent-labeled ZnO, it is found that ZnO dissolution could happen in culture medium and endosomes. Nondissolved ZnO nanoparticles enter caveolae in BEAS-2B but enter lysosomes in RAW 264.7 cells in which smaller particle remnants dissolve. In contrast, fluorescent-labeled CeO2 nanoparticles were taken up intact into caveolin-1 and LAMP-1 positive endosomal compartments, respectively, in BEAS-2B and RAW 264.7 cells, without inflammation or cytotoxicity. Instead, CeO2 suppressed ROS production and induced cellular resistance to an exogenous source of oxidative stress. Fluorescent-labeled TiO2 was processed by the same uptake pathways as CeO2 but did not elicit any adverse or protective effects. These results demonstrate that metal oxide nanoparticles induce a range of biological responses that vary from cytotoxic to cytoprotective and can only be properly understood by using a tiered test strategy such as we developed for oxidative stress and adapted to study other aspects of nanoparticle toxicity.

Unfortunately, planar structures typically show I-V hysteresis and lower stable device efficiency compared with mesoporous structures, especially for TiO2-based n-i-p devices. SnO2, which has a deeper conduction band and higher electron mobility compared with traditional TiO2, could enhance charge transfer from perovskite to electron transport layers, and reduce charge accumulation at the interface. Here we report low-temperature solution-processed SnO2 nanoparticles as an efficient electron transport layer for perovskite solar cells. Our SnO2-based devices are almost free of hysteresis, which we propose is due to the enhancement of electron extraction. By introducing a PbI2 passivation phase in the perovskite layer, we obtain a 19.9 +/- 0.6% certified efficiency. The devices can be easily processed under low temperature (150 degrees C), offering an efficient method for the large-scale production of perovskite solar cells.

Photocatalyts provide a potential strategy to solve these problems because these materials not only can directly convert solar energy into usable or storable energy resources but also can decompose organic pollutants under solar-light irradiation. However, the aforementioned applications require photocatalysts with a wide absorption range, long-term stability, high charge-separation efficiency and strong redox ability. Unfortunately, it is often difficult for a single-component photocatalyst to simultaneously fulfill all these requirements. The artificial heterogeneous Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, mimicking the natural photosynthesis process, overcome the drawbacks of single-component photocatalysts and satisfy those aforementioned requirements. Such multi-task systems have been extensively investigated in the past decade. Especially, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems without redox pair have been widely used in the water splitting, solar cells, degradation of pollutants and CO2 conversion, which have a huge potential to solve the current energy and environmental crises facing the modern industrial development. Thus, this review gives a concise overview of the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, including their composition, construction, optimization and applications.

High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.

These NPs owned well defined particle sizes (150-500 nm) and Zeta potentials (-40 mV - +35 mV). FITC labeled protamine sulfate (FITC-PS) loaded RhB-CMCNP and camptothecin (CPT) loaded RhB-CHNP with high encapsulation efficiency were prepared. The fluorescence stability in plasma and towards I was investigated, and the result indicated it was sufficient for qualitative and quantitative analysis. NPs with high surface charge and large particle size were phagocytized more efficiently by murine macrophage. Slight particle size and surface charge differences and different cell lines had significant implications in the cellular uptake of NPs, and various mechanisms were involved in the uptake process. In vivo biodistribution suggested that NPs with slight negative charges and particle size of 150 nm were tended to accumulate in tumor more efficiently. These results could serve as a guideline in the rational design of drug nanocarriers with maximized therapeutic efficacy and predictable in vivo properties, in which the control of particle size and surface charge was of significance.

Synthesis and exfoliation of isocyanate-treated graphene oxide nanoplatelets	CARBON												A number of functionalized graphite oxides were prepared by treatment of graphite oxide (GO) with organic isocyanates. These isocyanate-treated GOs (iGOs) can then be exfoliated into functionalized graphene oxide nanoplatelets that can form a stable dispersion in polar aprotic solvents. Characterization of iGOs by FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis suggested that the isocyanate treatment results in the functionalization of the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in GO via formation of amides and carbamate esters, respectively. The degree of GO functionalization can be controlled via either the reactivity of the isocyanate or the reaction time. When used with functionalized isocyanates, the described methodology allows for the elaboration of graphene oxide nanoplatelets with different surface functional groups. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells are amongst the most promising candidates in terms of energy densities and power densities. Nanostructured materials are currently of interest for such devices because of their high surface area, novel size effects, significantly enhanced kinetics, and so on. This Progress Report describes some recent developments in nanostructured anode and cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, addressing the benefits of nanometer-size effects, the disadvantages of 'nano', and strategies to solve these issues such as nano/micro hierarchical structures and surface coatings, as well as developments in the discovery of nanostructured Pt-based electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Approaches to lowering the cost of Pt catalysts include the use of i) novel nanostructures of Pt, ii) new cost-effective synthesis routes, iii) binary or multiple catalysts, and iv) new catalyst supports.

They often crystallize to form atomically smooth thin films, nanotubes, and platelet or fullerene-like nanoparticles due to the anisotropic bonding. Structures that predominately expose edges of the layers exhibit high surface energy and are often considered unstable. In this communication, we present a synthesis process to grow MoS2 and MoSe2 thin films with vertically aligned layers, thereby maximally exposing the edges on the film surface. Such edge-terminated films are metastable structures of MoS2 and MoSe2, which may find applications in diverse catalytic reactions. We have confirmed their catalytic activity in a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which the exchange current density correlates directly with the density of the exposed edge sites.

Activating the MoS2 basal plane could further enhance its HER activity but is not often a strategy for doing so. Herein, we report the first activation and optimization of the basal plane of monolayer 2H-MoS2 for HER by introducing sulphur (S) vacancies and strain. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the S-vacancies are new catalytic sites in the basal plane, where gap states around the Fermi level allow hydrogen to bind directly to exposed Mo atoms. The hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H)) can be further manipulated by straining the surface with S-vacancies, which fine-tunes the catalytic activity. Proper combinations of S-vacancy and strain yield the optimal Delta G(H) = 0 eV, which allows us to achieve the highest intrinsic HER activity among molybdenum-sulphide-based catalysts.

First, we employ Raman spectroscopy to observe phonon softening with increased strain, breaking the degeneracy in the E' Raman mode of MoS2, and extract a Gruneisen parameter of similar to 1.06. Second, using photoluminescence spectroscopy we measure a decrease in the optical band gap of MoS2 that is approximately linear with strain, similar to 45 meV/% strain for monolayer MoS2 and similar to 120 meV/% strain for bilayer MoS2. Third, we observe a pronounced strain-induced decrease in the photoluminescence intensity of monolayer MoS2 that is indicative of the direct-to-indirect transition of the character of the optical band gap of this material at applied strain of similar to 1%. These observations constitute a demonstration of strain engineering the band structure in the emergent class of two-dimensional crystals, transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Accumulation of sub-100 nm polymeric micelles in poorly permeable tumours depends on size	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												A major goal in cancer research is to develop carriers that can deliver drugs effectively and without side effects. Liposomal and particulate carriers with diameters of similar to 100 nm have been widely used to improve the distribution and tumour accumulation of cancer drugs, but so far they have only been effective for treating highly permeable tumours. Here, we compare the accumulation and effectiveness of different sizes of long-circulating, drug-loaded polymeric micelles ( with diameters of 30, 50, 70 and 100 nm) in both highly and poorly permeable tumours. All the polymer micelles penetrated highly permeable tumours in mice, but only the 30 nm micelles could penetrate poorly permeable pancreatic tumours to achieve an antitumour effect. We also showed that the penetration and efficacy of the larger micelles could be enhanced by using a transforming growth factor-beta inhibitor to increase the permeability of the tumours.

Zinc oxide has substantial advantages including large exciton binding energy, as demonstrated by efficient excitonic lasing on optical excitation(5,6). Several groups have postulated the use of p-type ZnO doped with nitrogen, arsenic or phosphorus(7-10), and even p-n junctions(11-13). However, the choice of dopant and growth technique remains controversial and the reliability of p-type ZnO is still under debate(14). If ZnO is ever to produce long-lasting and robust devices, the quality of epitaxial layers has to be improved as has been the protocol in other compound semiconductors(15). Here we report high-quality undoped films with electron mobility exceeding that in the bulk. We have used a new technique to fabricate p-type ZnO reproducibly.

Enhanced charge-collection efficiencies and light scattering in dye-sensitized solar cells using oriented TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes arrays	NANO LETTERS												We report on the microstructure and dynamics of electron transport and recombination in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) incorporating oriented TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays. The morphology of the NT arrays, which were prepared from electrochemically anodized Ti foils, were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The arrays were found to consist of closely packed NTs, several micrometers in length, with typical wall thicknesses and intertube spacings of 8-10 nm and pore diameters of about 30 nm. The calcined material was fully crystalline with individual NTs consisting of about 30 nm sized crystallites. The transport and recombination properties of the NT and nanoparticle (NP) films used in DSSCs were studied by frequency-resolved modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopies. While both morphologies display comparable transport times, recombination was much slower in the NT films, indicating that the NT-based DSSCs have significantly higher charge-collection efficiencies than their NP-based counterparts. Dye molecules were shown to cover both the interior and exterior walls of the NTs. Analysis of photocurrent measurements indicates that the light-harvesting efficiencies of NT-based DSSCs were higher than those found for DSSCs incorporating NPs owing to stronger internal light-scattering effects.

It is found that the sheet resistance of graphite oxide film reduced using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is much lower than that of films reduced using hydrazine (N2H4). This is attributed to the formation of C-N groups in the N2H4 case, which may act as donors compensating the hole carriers in reduced graphite oxide. In the case of NaBH4 reduction, the interlayer distance is first slightly expanded by the formation of intermediate boron oxide complexes and then contracted by the gradual removal of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups along with the boron oxide complexes. The fabricated conducting film comprising a NaBH4-reduced graphite oxide reveals a sheet resistance comparable to that of dispersed graphene.

Here we developed a ligand-assisted reprecipitation strategy to luminescent and color-tunable colloidal CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I, Cl) quantum dots with absolute quantum yield up to 70% at room temperature and low excitation fluencies. To illustrate the photoluminescence enhancements in these quantum dots, we conducted comprehensive composition and surface characterizations and determined the time- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra. Comparisons between small-sized CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots (average diameter 3.3 nm) and corresponding micrometer-sized bulk particles (2-8 mu m) suggest that the intense increased photoluminescence quantum yield originates from the increase of exciton binding energy due to size reduction as well as proper chemical passivations of the Br-rich surface. We further demonstrated wide-color gamut white-light-emitting diodes using green emissive CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots and red emissive K2SiF6:Mn4+ as color converters, providing enhanced color quality for display technology. Moreover, colloidal CH3NH3PbBX3 quantum dots are expected to exhibit interesting nanoscale excitonic properties and also have other potential applications in lasers, electroluminescence devices, and optical sensors.

Optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Fully nonlocal two-projector norm-conserving pseudopotentials are shown to be compatible with a systematic approach to the optimization of convergence with the size of the plane-wave basis. A reformulation of the optimization is developed, including the ability to apply it to positive-energy atomic scattering states and to enforce greater continuity in the pseudopotential. The generalization of norm conservation to multiple projectors is reviewed and recast for the present purposes. Comparisons among the results of all-electron and one- and two-projector norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations of lattice constants and bulk moduli are made for a group of solids chosen to represent a variety of types of bonding and a sampling of the periodic table.																			1098-0121	1550-235X				AUG 19	2013	88	8							085117	10.1103/PhysRevB.88.085117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.085117													WOS:000323329700006

The control of human mesenchymal cell differentiation using nanoscale symmetry and disorder	NATURE MATERIALS												A key tenet of bone tissue engineering is the development of scaffold materials that can stimulate stem cell differentiation in the absence of chemical treatment to become osteoblasts without compromising material properties. At present, conventional implant materials fail owing to encapsulation by soft tissue, rather than direct bone bonding. Here, we demonstrate the use of nanoscale disorder to stimulate human mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) to produce bone mineral in vitro, in the absence of osteogenic supplements. This approach has similar efficiency to that of cells cultured with osteogenic media. In addition, the current studies show that topographically treated MSCs have a distinct differentiation profile compared with those treated with osteogenic media, which has implications for cell therapies.

Biomaterials & scaffolds for tissue engineering	MATERIALS TODAY												Every day thousands of surgical procedures are performed to replace or repair tissue that has been damaged through disease or trauma. The developing field of tissue engineering (TE) aims to regenerate damaged tissues by combining cells from the body with highly porous scaffold biomaterials, which act as templates for tissue regeneration, to guide the growth of new tissue. This article describes the functional requirements, and types, of materials used in developing state of the art of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.

Epitaxial graphene on ruthenium	NATURE MATERIALS												Graphene has been used to explore the fascinating electronic properties of ideal two-dimensional carbon, and shows great promise for quantum device architectures. The primary method for isolating graphene, micromechanical cleavage of graphite, is difficult to scale up for applications. Epitaxial growth is an attractive alternative, but achieving large graphene domains with uniform thickness remains a challenge, and substrate bonding may strongly affect the electronic properties of epitaxial graphene layers. Here, we show that epitaxy on Ru(0001) produces arrays of macroscopic single-crystalline graphene domains in a controlled, layer-by-layer fashion. Whereas the first graphene layer indeed interacts strongly with the metal substrate, the second layer is almost completely detached, shows weak electronic coupling to the metal, and hence retains the inherent electronic structure of graphene. Our findings demonstrate a route towards rational graphene synthesis on transition-metal templates for applications in electronics, sensing or catalysis.

Since the discovery of this new family of nanoporous materials and the concept of so called 'reticular design', nowadays several hundred different types of MOF are known. The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centres, linked together with a variety of polyatomic organic bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mechanical stability. Describing examples of different zinc-containing structures, e.g. MOF-2, MOF-5 and IRMOF8 verified synthesis methods will be given, as well as a totally novel electrochemical approach for transition metal based MOFs will be presented for the first time. With sufficient amounts of sample now being available, the testing of metal-organic frameworks in fields of catalysis and gas processing is exemplified. Report is given on the catalytic activation of alkynes (formation of methoxypropene from propyne, vinylester synthesis from acetylene). Removal of impurities in natural gas (traces of tetrahydrothiophene in methane), pressure swing separation of rare gases (krypton and xenon) and storage of hydrogen (3.3 wt% at 2.0 MPa/77 K on Cu-BTC-MOF) will underline the prospective future industrial use of metal-organic frameworks in gas processing. Whenever possible, comparison is made to state-of-art applications in order to outline possibilities which might be superior by using MOFs.																			0959-9428	1364-5501				FEB 21	2006	16	7					626	636		10.1039/b511962f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b511962f													WOS:000235608200012

Fast Anion-Exchange in Highly Luminescent Nanocrystals of Cesium Lead Halide Perovskites (CsPbX<sub>3</sub>, X = Cl, Br, I)	NANO LETTERS												Postsynthetic chemical transformations of colloidal nanocrystals, such as ion-exchange reactions, provide an avenue to compositional fine-tuning or to otherwise inaccessible materials and morphologies. While cation-exchange is facile and commonplace, anion-exchange reactions have not received substantial deployment. Here we report fast, low-temperature, deliberately partial, or complete anionexchange in highly luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals of cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I). By adjusting the halide ratios in the colloidal nanocrystal solution, the bright photoluminescence can be tuned over the entire visible spectral region (410-700 nm) while maintaining high quantum yields of 20 80% and narrow emission line widths of 10-40 nm (from blue to red). Furthermore, fast internanocrystal anion-exchange is demonstrated, leading to uniform CsPb(Cl/Br)(3) or CsPb(Br/I)(3) compositions simply by mixing CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3, and CsPbI3 nano crystals in appropriate ratios.

Sorting carbon nanotubes by electronic structure using density differentiation	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												The heterogeneity of as-synthesized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) precludes their widespread application in electronics, optics and sensing. We report on the sorting of carbon nanotubes by diameter, bandgap and electronic type using structure-discriminating surfactants to engineer subtle differences in their buoyant densities. Using the scalable technique of density-gradient ultracentrifugation, we have isolated narrow distributions of SWNTs in which > 97% are within a 0.02-nm-diameter range. Furthermore, using competing mixtures of surfactants, we have produced bulk quantities of SWNTs of predominantly a single electronic type. These materials were used to fabricate thin-film electrical devices of networked SWNTs characterized by either metallic or semiconducting behaviour.

The obtained graphene oxide/PANI composites with different mass ratios were reduced to graphene using hydrazine followed by reoxidation and reprotonation of the reduced PANI to give the graphene/PANI nanocomposites. The morphology, composition, and electronic structure of the composites together with pure polyaniline fibers (PANI-F), graphene oxide (GO), and graphene (GR) were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid-state C-13 NMR, FT-IR, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the chemically modified graphene and the PANI nanofibers formed a uniform nanocomposite with the PANI Fibers absorbed on the graphene surface and/or Filled between the graphene sheets. Such uniform structure together with the observed high conductivities afforded high specific capacitance and good cycling stability during the charge-discharge process when used as supercapacitor electrodes. A specific capacitance of as high as 480 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g was achieved over a PANI-doped graphene composite. The research data revealed that high specific capacitance and good cycling stability can be achieved either by doping chemically modified graphenes with PANI or by doping the bulky PAN Is with graphene/graphene oxide.

Here we show that exposing the mesothelial lining of the body cavity of mice, as a surrogate for the mesothelial lining of the chest cavity, to long multiwalled carbon nanotubes results in asbestos-like, length-dependent, pathogenic behaviour. This includes inflammation and the formation of lesions known as granulomas. This is of considerable importance, because research and business communities continue to invest heavily in carbon nanotubes for a wide range of products(5) under the assumption that they are no more hazardous than graphite. Our results suggest the need for further research and great caution before introducing such products into the market if long-term harm is to be avoided.

The two limits are identified as the cases of infinitely small and infinitely large upconversion rates, respectively. In the latter case, the dependence of luminescence intensities from intermediate excited states on pump power changes with the underlying upconversion and decay mechanisms. In certain situations, energy-transfer upconversion and excited-state absorption can be distinguished by the measured slopes. The competition between linear decay and upconversion in the individual excitation steps of sequential upconversion can be analyzed. The influence of nonuniform distributions of absorbed pump power or of a subset of ions participating in energy-transfer upconversion is investigated. These results are of importance for the interpretation of excitation mechanisms of luminescent and laser materials. We verify our theoretical results by experimental examples of multiphoton-excited luminescence in Cs3Lu2Cl9:Er3+, Ba2YCl7:Er3+, LiYF4:Nd3+, and Cs2ZrCl6:Re4+.

These separated CDs emitted bright and stable luminescence in gradient colors from blue to red under a single-wavelength UV light. They exhibited high optical uniformity; that is, every sample showed only one peak in the PL excitation spectrum, only one peak in the excitation-independent PL emission spectrum, and similar monoexponential fluorescence lifetimes. Although these samples had similar distributions of particle size and graphite structure in their carbon cores, the surface state gradually varied among the samples, especially the degree of oxidation. Therefore, the observed red shift in their emission peaks from 440 to 625 nm was ascribed to a gradual reduction in their band gaps with the increasing incorporation of oxygen species into their surface structures. These energy bands were found to depend on the surface groups and structures but not on the particle size, not as in traditional semiconductor quantum dots. In addition, because of their excellent PL properties and low cytotoxicity, these CDs could be used to image cells in different colors under a single-wavelength light source, and the red-emitting CDs could be used to image live mice because of the strong penetration capability of their fluorescence.

The mechanical properties of the different, natural fibre composites were tested and compared. A further comparison was made with the corresponding properties of glass mat reinforced polypropylene composites from the open literature. Kenaf, hemp and sisal composites showed comparable tensile strength and modulus results but in impact properties hemp appears to out-perform kenaf. The tensile modulus, impact strength and the ultimate tensile stress of kenaf reinforced polypropylene composites were found to increase with increasing fibre weight fraction. Coir fibre composites displayed the lowest mechanical properties, but their impact strength was higher than that of jute and kenaf composites. In most cases the specific properties of the natural fibre composites were found to compare favourably with those of glass. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We report on new semiconducting liquid-crystalline thieno[3,2-b] thiophene polymers, the enhancement in charge-carrier mobility achieved through highly organized morphology from processing in the mesophase, and the effects of exposure to both ambient and low-humidity air on the performance of transistor devices. Relatively large crystalline domain sizes on the length scale of lithographically accessible channel lengths (similar to 200 nm) were exhibited in thin films, thus offering the potential for fabrication of single-crystal polymer transistors. Good transistor stability under static storage and operation in a low-humidity air environment was demonstrated, with charge-carrier field-effect mobilities of 0.2-0.6 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) achieved under nitrogen.

Hybrid graphene-quantum dot phototransistors with ultrahigh gain	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Graphene is an attractive material for optoelectronics(1) and photodetection applications(2-6) because it offers a broad spectral bandwidth and fast response times. However, weak light absorption and the absence of a gain mechanism that can generate multiple charge carriers from one incident photon have limited the responsivity of graphene-based photodetectors to similar to 10(-2) AW(-1). Here, we demonstrate a gain of similar to 10(8) electrons per photon and a responsivity of similar to 10(7) AW(-1) in a hybrid photodetector that consists of monolayer or bilayer graphene covered with a thin film of colloidal quantum dots. Strong and tunable light absorption in the quantum-dot layer creates electric charges that are transferred to the graphene, where they recirculate many times due to the high charge mobility of graphene and long trapped-charge lifetimes in the quantum-dot layer. The device, with a specific detectivity of 7x10(13) Jones, benefits from gate-tunable sensitivity and speed, spectral selectivity from the short-wavelength infrared to the visible, and compatibility with current circuit technologies.

To explore the potential limits of silicon nanowire transistors, we have examined the influence of source-drain contact thermal annealing and surface passivation on key transistor properties. Thermal annealing and passivation of oxide defects using chemical modification were found to increase the average transconductance from 45 to 800 nS and average mobility from 30 to 560 cm(2)/V(.)s with peak values of 2000 nS and 1350 cm(2)/V(.)s, respectively. The comparison of these results and other key parameters with state-of-the-art planar silicon devices shows substantial advantages for silicon nanowires.

Topological invariants of time-reversal-invariant band structures	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												The topological invariants of a time-reversal-invariant band structure in two dimensions are multiple copies of the Z(2) invariant found by Kane and Mele. Such invariants protect the "topological insulator" phase and give rise to a spin Hall effect carried by edge states. Each pair of bands related by time reversal is described by one Z(2) invariant, up to one less than half the dimension of the Bloch Hamiltonians. In three dimensions, there are four such invariants per band pair. The Z(2) invariants of a crystal determine the transitions between ordinary and topological insulators as its bands are occupied by electrons. We derive these invariants using maps from the Brillouin zone to the space of Bloch Hamiltonians and clarify the connections between Z(2) invariants, the integer invariants that underlie the integer quantum Hall effect, and previous invariants of T-invariant Fermi systems.

Band alignment of rutile and anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>	NATURE MATERIALS												The most widely used oxide for photocatalytic applications owing to its low cost and high activity is TiO2. The discovery of the photolysis of water on the surface of TiO2 in 1972(1) launched four decades of intensive research into the underlying chemical and physical processes involved(2-5). Despite much collected evidence, a thoroughly convincing explanation of why mixed-phase samples of anatase and rutile outperform the individual polymorphs has remained elusive(6). One long-standing controversy is the energetic alignment of the band edges of the rutile and anatase polymorphs of TiO2 (ref. 7). We demonstrate, through a combination of state-of-the-art materials simulation techniques and X-ray photoemission experiments, that a type-II, staggered, band alignment of similar to 0.4 eV exists between anatase and rutile with anatase possessing the higher electron affinity, or work function. Our results help to explain the robust separation of photoexcited charge carriers between the two phases and highlight a route to improved photocatalysts.

The formation mechanism of these intriguing nanocomposites investigated by transmission electron microscopy and Raman and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy is proposed as intercalation and adsorption of manganese ions onto the GO sheets, followed by the nucleation and growth of the crystal species in a double solvent system via dissolution-crystallization and oriented attachment mechanisms, which in turn results in the exfoliation of GO sheets. Interestingly, it was found that the electrochemical performance of as-prepared nanocomposites could be enhanced by the chemical interaction between GO and MnO2. This method provides a facile and straightforward approach to deposit MnO2 nanoparticles onto the graphene oxide sheets (single layer of graphite oxide) and may be readily extended to the preparation of other classes of hybrids based on GO sheets for technological applications.

After removing the excess of negative charges from the surface of the nanosheets, highly conducting IT phase MoS2 nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward the evolution of hydrogen with a notably low Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec. By partially oxidizing MoS2, we found that the activity of 2H MoS2 is significantly reduced after oxidation, consistent with edge oxidation. On the other hand, IT MoS2 remains unaffected after oxidation, suggesting that edges of the nanosheets are not the main active sites. The importance of electrical conductivity of the two phases on the hydrogen evolution reaction activity has been further confirmed by using carbon nanotubes to increase the conductivity of 2H MoS2.

J	Chen, XQ; Niu, HY; Li, DZ; Li, YY				Chen, Xing-Qiu; Niu, Haiyang; Li, Dianzhong; Li, Yiyi			Modeling hardness of polycrystalline materials and bulk metallic glasses	INTERMETALLICS												Though extensively studied, hardness, defined as the resistance of a material to deformation, still remains a challenging issue for a formal theoretical description due to its inherent mechanical complexity. The widely applied Teter's empirical correlation between hardness and shear modulus has been considered to be not always valid for a large variety of materials. The main reason is that shear modulus only responses to elastic deformation whereas the hardness links both elastic and permanent plastic properties. We found that the intrinsic correlation between hardness and elasticity of materials correctly predicts Vickers hardness for a wide variety of crystalline materials as well as bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Our results suggest that, if a material is intrinsically brittle (such as BMGs that fail in the elastic regime), its Vickers hardness linearly correlates with the shear modulus (H-v = 0.151G). This correlation also provides a robust theoretical evidence on the famous empirical correlation observed by Teter in 1998. On the other hand, our results demonstrate that the hardness of polycrystalline materials can be correlated with the product of the squared Pugh's modulus ratio and the shear modulus (H-v = 2(k(2)G)(0.585) - 3 where k =G/B is Pugh's modulus ratio). Our work combines those aspects that were previously argued strongly, and, most importantly, is capable to correctly predict the hardness of all hard compounds known included in several pervious models.

Our calculation indicates that the P2(1)/c phase with arsenopyrite-type structure is energetically more stable than the other phases. It is semiconducting (the remaining phases are metallic) and contains diatomic N-N with the bond distance of 1.414 A. These characters are consistent with the experimental facts that IrN2 is in lower symmetry and nonmetallic. Our conclusion is also in agreement with the recent theoretical studies that the most stable phase of IrN2 is monoclinic P2(1)/c. The calculated bulk modulus of 373 GPa is also the highest among the considered space groups. It matches the recent theoretical values of 357 GPa within 4.3% and of 402 GPa within 7.8%, but smaller than the experimental value of 428 GPa by 14.7%. Chemical bonding and potential displacive phase transitions are discussed for IrN2. For IrN3, cubic skutterudite structure (Im-3) was assumed. Our calculation indicated that it is also promising to be superhard due to the large bulk modulus of 358 GPa and shear modulus of 246 GPa. The diatomic N-N bond distance is even shorter (1.272 A).

Meanwhile, a possible schematic diagram has been proposed to detail the structure of N-doped graphene. By controlling the exposure time, the N percentage in host graphene can be regulated, ranging from 0.11 to 1.35%. Moreover, the as-prepared N-doped graphene has displayed high electrocatalytic activity for reduction of hydrogen peroxide and fast direct electron transfer kinetics for glucose oxidase.

Perovskite energy funnels for efficient light-emitting diodes	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Organometal halide perovskites exhibit large bulk crystal domain sizes, rare traps, excellent mobilities and carriers that are free at room temperature-properties that support their excellent performance in charge-separating devices. In devices that rely on the forward injection of electrons and holes, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), excellent mobilities contribute to the efficient capture of non-equilibrium charge carriers by rare non-radiative centres. Moreover, the lack of bound excitons weakens the competition of desired radiative (over undesired non-radiative) recombination. Here we report a perovskite mixed material comprising a series of differently quantum-size-tuned grains that funnels photoexcitations to the lowest-bandgap light-emitter in the mixture. The materials function as charge carrier concentrators, ensuring that radiative recombination successfully outcompetes trapping and hence non-radiative recombination.

In conventional p-n junctions, regions depleted of free charge carriers form on either side of the junction, generating built-in potentials associated with uncompensated dopant atoms. Carrier transport across the junction occurs by diffusion and drift processes influenced by the spatial extent of this depletion region. With the advent of atomically thin van der Waals materials and their heterostructures, it is now possible to realize a p-n junction at the ultimate thickness limit(3-10). Van der Waals junctions composed of p-and n-type semiconductors-each just one unit cell thick-are predicted to exhibit completely different charge transport characteristics than bulk heterojunctions(10-12). Here, we report the characterization of the electronic and optoelectronic properties of atomically thin p-n heterojunctions fabricated using van der Waals assembly of transition-metal dichalcogenides. We observe gate-tunable diode-like current rectification and a photovoltaic response across the p-n interface. We find that the tunnelling-assisted interlayer recombination of the majority carriers is responsible for the tunability of the electronic and optoelectronic processes. Sandwiching an atomic p-n junction between graphene layers enhances the collection of the photoexcited carriers. The atomically scaled van der Waals p-n heterostructures presented here constitute the ultimate functional unit for nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Vertical and in-plane heterostructures from WS<sub>2</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayers	NATURE MATERIALS												Layer-by-layer stacking or lateral interfacing of atomic monolayers has opened up unprecedented opportunities to engineer two-dimensional heteromaterials. Fabrication of such artificial heterostructures with atomically clean and sharp interfaces, however, is challenging. Here, we report a one-step growth strategy for the creation of high-quality vertically stacked as well as in-plane interconnected heterostructures ofWS(2)/MoS2 via control of the growth temperature. Vertically stacked bilayers with WS2 epitaxially grown on top of the MoS2 monolayer are formed with preferred stacking order at high temperature. A strong interlayer excitonic transition is observed due to the type II band alignment and to the clean interface of these bilayers. Vapour growth at low temperature, on the other hand, leads to lateral epitaxy of WS2 on MoS2 edges, creating seamless and atomically sharp in-plane heterostructures that generate strong localized photoluminescence enhancement and intrinsic p-n junctions. The fabrication of heterostructures from monolayers, using simple and scalable growth, paves the way for the creation of unprecedented two-dimensional materials with exciting properties.

Pseudocapacitive transition-metal oxides such as MnO2 could be used to make electrodes in such supercapacitors, because they are predicted to have a high capacitance for storing electrical charge while also being inexpensive and not harmful to the environment(9,10). However, the poor conductivity of MnO2 (10(-5)-10(-6) S cm(-1)) limits the charge/discharge rate for high-power applications(10,11). Here, we show that hybrid structures made of nanoporous gold and nanocrystalline MnO2 have enhanced conductivity, resulting in a specific capacitance of the constituent MnO2 (similar to 1,145 F g(-1)) that is close to the theoretical value(9). The nanoporous gold allows electron transport through the MnO2, and facilitates fast ion diffusion between the MnO2 and the electrolytes while also acting as a double-layer capacitor. The high specific capacitances and charge/discharge rates offered by such hybrid structures make them promising candidates as electrodes in supercapacitors, combining high-energy storage densities with high levels of power delivery.

Atomic layers of hybridized boron nitride and graphene domains	NATURE MATERIALS												Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and monolayer hexagonal BN (h-BN), are attractive for demonstrating fundamental physics in materials and potential applications in next-generation electronics. Atomic sheets containing hybridized bonds involving elements B, N and C over wide compositional ranges could result in new materials with properties complementary to those of graphene and h-BN, enabling a rich variety of electronic structures, properties and applications. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of large-area atomic layers of h-BNC material, consisting of hybridized, randomly distributed domains of h-BN and C phases with compositions ranging from pure BN to pure graphene. Our studies reveal that their structural features and bandgap are distinct from those of graphene, doped graphene and h-BN.

We have developed a postproduction treatment that improves the performance of solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) by means of a tempering cycle at elevated temperatures in which an external voltage is simultaneously applied, resulting in a significant increase of the short-circuit current. Using this postproduction treatment, an enhancement of the short-circuit cur rent density, I-sc, to 8.5 mA cm(-2) under illumination with white light at an illumination intensity of 800 W m(2) and an increase in external quantum efficiency (IPCE, incident photon to collected electron efficiency) to 70 % are demonstrated.

J	Garnett, E; Yang, PD				Garnett, Erik; Yang, Peidong			Light Trapping in Silicon Nanowire Solar Cells	NANO LETTERS												Thin-film structures can reduce the cost of solar power by using inexpensive substrates and a lower quantity and quality of semiconductor material. However, the resulting short optical path length and minority carrier diffusion length necessitates either a high absorption coefficient or excellent light trapping. Semiconducting nanowire arrays have already been shown to have low reflective losses compared to planar semiconductors, but their light-trapping properties have not been measured. Using optical transmission and photocurrent measurements on thin silicon films, we demonstrate that ordered arrays of silicon nanowires increase the path length of incident solar radiation by up to a Factor of 73. This extraordinary light-trapping path length enhancement factor is above the randomized scattering (Lambertian) limit (2n(2)similar to 25 without a back reflector) and is superior to other light-trapping methods. By changing the silicon film thickness and nanowire length, we show that there is a competition between improved absorption and increased surface recombination; for nanowire arrays fabricated from 8 mu m thick silicon films, the enhanced absorption can dominate over surface recombination, even without any surface passivation. These nanowire devices give efficiencies above 5%, with short-circuit photocurrents higher than planar control samples,					Yang, Peidong/E-4431-2011; Garnett, Erik/A-6847-2009	Garnett, Erik/0000-0002-9158-8326													1530-6984	1530-6992				MAR	2010	10	3					1082	1087		10.1021/nl100161z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl100161z								20108969					WOS:000275278200058

As the distance between junctions in modern devices drops below 10 nm, extraordinarily high doping concentration gradients become necessary. Because of the laws of diffusion and the statistical nature of the distribution of the doping atoms, such junctions represent an increasingly difficult fabrication challenge for the semiconductor industry. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new type of transistor in which there are no junctions and no doping concentration gradients.

The story of Bioglass®	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE					1985 ANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC	1985	LOS ANGELES, CA	AMER PSYCHOL ASSOC				Historically the function of biomaterials has been to replace diseased or damaged tissues. First generation biomaterials were selected to be as bio-inert as possible and thereby minimize formation of scar tissue at the interface with host tissues. Bioactive glasses were discovered in 1969 and provided for the first time an alternative; second generation, interfacial bonding of an implant with host tissues. Tissue regeneration and repair using the gene activation properties of Bioglass(R) provide a third generation of biomaterials. This article reviews the 40 year history of the development of bioactive glasses, with emphasis on the first composition, 45S5 Bioglass(R), that has been in clinical use since 1985. The steps of discovery, characterization, in vivo and in vitro evaluation, clinical studies and product development are summarized along with the technology transfer processes.																			0957-4530	1573-4838				NOV	2006	17	11					967	978		10.1007/s10856-006-0432-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10856-006-0432-z								17122907					WOS:000242295900003

Electric vehicles, which are not equipped with an internal combustion engine, have been launched in the market. Manganese-and iron-based positive-electrode materials(1,2), such as LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4, are used in large-scale batteries for electric vehicles. Manganese and iron are abundant elements in the Earth's crust, but lithium is not. In contrast to lithium, sodium is an attractive charge carrier on the basis of elemental abundance. Recently, some layered materials(3-6), where sodium can be electrochemically and reversibly extracted/inserted, have been reported. However, their reversible capacity is typically limited to 100 mAh g(-1). Herein, we report a new electrode material, P2-Na-2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O-2, that delivers 190 m Ah g(-1) of reversible capacity in the sodium cells with the electrochemically active Fe3+/Fe4+ redox.

J	Liu, XH; Zhong, L; Huang, S; Mao, SX; Zhu, T; Huang, JY				Liu, Xiao Hua; Zhong, Li; Huang, Shan; Mao, Scott X.; Zhu, Ting; Huang, Jian Yu			Size-Dependent Fracture of Silicon Nanoparticles During Lithiation	ACS NANO												Lithiation of individual silicon nanopartides was studied in real time with in situ transmission electron microscopy. A strong size dependence of fracture was discovered; that Is, there exists a critical particle diameter of similar to 150 nm, below which the particles neither cracked nor fractured upon first lithiation, and above which the particles initially formed surface cracks and then fractured due to lithiation-induced swelling. The unexpected surface cracking arose owing to the buildup of large tensile hoop stress, which reversed the initial compression, in the surface layer. The stress reversal was attributed to the unique mechanism of lithiation in crystalline Si, taking place by movement of a two-phase boundary between the inner core of pristine Si and the outer shell of amorphous Li-Si alloy. While the resulting hoop tension tended to initiate surface cracks, the small-sized nanoparticles nevertheless averted fracture. This is because the stored strain energy from electrochemical reactions was insufficient to drive crack propagation, as dictated by the interplay between the two length scales, that is, particle diameter and crack size, that control the fracture. These results are diametrically opposite to those obtained previously from single-phase modeling, which predicted only compressive hoop stress In the surface layer and thus crack initiation from the center in lithiated Si particles and wires.

Elucidating the mechanism of cellular uptake and removal of protein-coated gold nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes	NANO LETTERS												We investigated the mechanism by which transferrin-coated gold nanoparticles (Au NP) of different sizes and shapes entered mammalian cells. We determined that transferrin-coated Au NP entered the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. The NPs exocytosed out of the cells in a linear relationship to size. This was different than the relationship between uptake and size. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical equation to predict the relationship of size versus exocytosis for different cell lines. These studies will provide guidelines for developing NPs for imaging and drug delivery applications, which will require "controlling" NP accumulation rate. These studies will also have implications in determining nanotoxicity.

In order to achieve high energy and power densities, a high-voltage asymmetric supercapacitor is successfully fabricated using Ni(OH)2/graphene and porous graphene as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Because of their unique structure, both of these materials exhibit excellent electrochemical performances. The optimized asymmetric supercapacitor could be cycled reversibly in the high-voltage region of 01.6 V and displays intriguing performances with a maximum specific capacitance of 218.4 F g-1 and high energy density of 77.8 Wh kg-1. Furthermore, the Ni(OH)2/graphene//porous graphene supercapacitor device exhibits an excellent long cycle life along with 94.3% specific capacitance retained after 3000 cycles. These fascinating performances can be attributed to the high capacitance and the positive synergistic effects of the two electrodes.

However, the poor stability of both the perovskite material and the charge transport layers has so far prevented the fabrication of devices that can withstand sustained operation under normal conditions. Here, we report a solution-processed lead halide perovskite solar cell that has p-type NiOx and n-type ZnO nanoparticles as hole and electron transport layers, respectively, and shows improved stability against water and oxygen degradation when compared with devices with organic charge transport layers. Our cells have a p-i-n structure (glass/indium tin oxide/NiOx/perovskite/ZnO/Al), in which the ZnO layer isolates the perovskite and Al layers, thus preventing degradation. After 60 days storage in air at room temperature, our all-metal-oxide devices retain about 90% of their original efficiency, unlike control devices made with organic transport layers, which undergo a complete degradation after just 5 days. The initial power conversion efficiency of our devices is 14.6 +/- 1.5%, with an uncertified maximum value of 16.1%.

Grains and grain boundaries in highly crystalline monolayer molybdenum disulphide	NATURE MATERIALS												Recent progress in large-area synthesis of monolayer molybdenum disulphide, a new two-dimensional direct-bandgap semiconductor, is paving the way for applications in atomically thin electronics. Little is known, however, about the microstructure of this material. Here we have refined chemical vapour deposition synthesis to grow highly crystalline islands of monolayer molybdenum disulphide up to 120 mu m in size with optical and electrical properties comparable or superior to exfoliated samples. Using transmission electron microscopy, we correlate lattice orientation, edge morphology and crystallinity with island shape to demonstrate that triangular islands are single crystals. The crystals merge to form faceted tilt and mirror twin boundaries that are stitched together by lines of 8- and 4-membered rings. Density functional theory reveals localized mid-gap states arising from these 8- 4 defects. We find that mirror twin boundaries cause strong photoluminescence quenching whereas tilt boundaries cause strong enhancement. Meanwhile, mirror twin boundaries slightly increase the measured in-plane electrical conductivity, whereas tilt boundaries slightly decrease the conductivity.

Scalable production of large quantities of defect-free few-layer graphene by shear exfoliation in liquids	NATURE MATERIALS												To progress from the laboratory to commercial applications, it will be necessary to develop industrially scalable methods to produce large quantities of defect-free graphene. Here we show that high-shear mixing of graphite in suitable stabilizing liquids results in large-scale exfoliation to give dispersions of graphene nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy show the exfoliated flakes to be unoxidized and free of basal-plane defects. We have developed a simple model that shows exfoliation to occur once the local shear rate exceeds 10(4) s(-1). By fully characterizing the scaling behaviour of the graphene production rate, we show that exfoliation can be achieved in liquid volumes from hundreds of millilitres up to hundreds of litres and beyond. The graphene produced by this method performs well in applications from composites to conductive coatings. This method can be applied to exfoliate BN, MoS2 and a range of other layered crystals.

It is crucial to finely optimize the energy level matching between the perovskites and hole-transporting materials to achieve better performance. Here, we synthesize a fluorene-terminated hole-transporting material with a fine-tuned energy level and a high glass transition temperature to ensure highly efficient and thermally stable PSCs. We use this material to fabricate photovoltaic devices with 23.2% efficiency (under reverse scanning) with a steady-state efficiency of 22.85% for small-area (-0.094 cm(2)) cells and 21.7% efficiency (under reverse scanning) for large-area (-1 cm(2)) cells. We also achieve certified efficiencies of 22.6% (small-area cells, -0.094 cm(2)) and 20.9% (large-area, -1 cm(2)). The resultant device shows better thermal stability than the device with spiro-OMeTAD, maintaining almost 95% of its initial performance for more than 500 h after thermal annealing at 60 degrees C.

We utilized a synthesis specifically designed for long and thin wires for improved performance in terms of sheet resistance and optical transmittance. Twenty Omega/sq and similar to 80% specular transmittance, and 8 ohms/sq and 80% diffusive transmittance in the visible range are achieved, which fall in the same range as the best indium tin oxide (ITO) samples on plastic substrates for flexible electronics and solar cells. The Ag NW electrodes show optical transparencies superior to ITO for near-infrared wavelengths (2-fold higher transmission). Owing to light scattering effects, the Ag NW network has the largest difference between diffusive transmittance and specular transmittance when compared with ITO and carbon nanotube electrodes, a property which could greatly enhance solar cell performance. A mechanical study shows that Ag NW electrodes on flexible substrates show excellent robustness when subjected to bending. We also study the electrical conductance of Ag nanowires and their junctions and report a facile electrochemical method for a Au coating to reduce the wire-to-wire junction resistance for better overall film conductance. Simple mechanical pressing was also found to increase the NW film conductance due to the reduction of junction resistance. The overall properties of transparent Ag NW electrodes meet the requirements of transparent electrodes for many applications and could be an immediate ITO replacement for flexible electronics and solar cells.

High-entropy alloy: challenges and prospects	MATERIALS TODAY												High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are presently of great research interest in materials science and engineering. Unlike conventional alloys, which contain one and rarely two base elements, HEAs comprise multiple principal elements, with the possible number of HEA compositions extending considerably more than conventional alloys. With the advent of HEAs, fundamental issues that challenge the proposed theories, models, and methods for conventional alloys also emerge. Here, we provide a critical review of the recent studies aiming to address the fundamental issues related to phase formation in HEAs. In addition, novel properties of HEAs are also discussed, such as their excellent specific strength, superior mechanical performance at high temperatures, exceptional ductility and fracture toughness at cryogenic temperatures, superparamagnetism, and superconductivity. Due to their considerable structural and functional potential as well as richness of design, HEAs are promising candidates for new applications, which warrants further studies.					liu, chao/GQZ-6687-2022; Yang, Yong/G-9148-2011; LU, Jian/C-6044-2013; Ye, Yifan/C-3280-2013	Yang, Yong/0000-0002-0491-8295; LU, Jian/0000-0001-5362-0316; Ye, Yifan/0000-0002-9172-6514													1369-7021	1873-4103				JUL-AUG	2016	19	6					349	362		10.1016/j.mattod.2015.11.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mattod.2015.11.026													WOS:000380759200017

Because the capacitance and charge-discharge rates of EDLCs scale with surface area and electrical conductivity, respectively, porous carbons such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes and crosslinked or holey graphenes are used exclusively as the active electrode materials in EDLCs4-9. One class of materials whose surface area far exceeds that of activated carbons, potentially allowing them to challenge the dominance of carbon electrodes in EDLCs, is metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)(10). The high porosity of MOFs, however, is conventionally coupled to very poor electrical conductivity, which has thus far prevented the use of these materials as active electrodes in EDLCs. Here, we show that Ni-3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)(2) (Ni-3(HITP)(2)), a MOF with high electrical conductivity(11), can serve as the sole electrode material in an EDLC. This is the first example of a supercapacitor made entirely from neat MOFs as active materials, without conductive additives or other binders. The MOF-based device shows an areal capacitance that exceeds those of most carbon-based materials and capacity retention greater than 90% over 10,000 cycles, in line with commercial devices. Given the established structural and compositional tunability of MOFs, these results herald the advent of a new generation of supercapacitors whose active electrode materials can be tuned rationally, at the molecular level.

More importantly, it can be quickly charged and discharged in a very short time of 1 h to several tens of seconds together with high-rate capability and excellent long-term cyclability. For example, a very high capacity of similar to 199 and 235 mAh g(-1) was obtained for the N-doped graphene and B-doped graphene at 25 A g(-1) (about 30 s to full charge). We believe that the unique two-dimensional structure, disordered surface morphology, heteroatomic defects, better electrode/electrolyte wettability, increased intersheet distance, improved electrical conductivity, and thermal stability of the doped graphene are beneficial to rapid surface Li+ absorption and ultrafast Li+ diffusion and electron transport, and thus make the doped materials superior to those of pristine chemically derived graphene and other carbonaceous materials.

It has been argued that the current in the high-conductivity state of several technologically relevant oxide materials flows through localized filaments, but these filaments have been characterized only indirectly, limiting our understanding of the switching mechanism. Here, we use high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to probe directly the nanofilaments in a Pt/TiO2/Pt system during resistive switching. In situ current-voltage and low-temperature (similar to 130 K) conductivity measurements confirm that switching occurs by the formation and disruption of TinO2n-1 (or so-called Magneli phase) filaments. Knowledge of the composition, structure and dimensions of these filaments will provide a foundation for unravelling the full mechanism of resistance switching in oxide thin films, and help guide research into the stability and scalability of such films for applications.

High-throughput solution processing of large-scale graphene	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												The electronic properties of graphene, such as high charge carrier concentrations and mobilities, make it a promising candidate for next-generation nanoelectronic devices(1-3). In particular, electrons and holes can undergo ballistic transport on the sub-micrometre scale in graphene and do not suffer from the scale limitations of current MOSFET technologies(2,3). However, it is still difficult to produce single-layer samples of graphene(1,3) and bulk processing has not yet been achieved, despite strenuous efforts to develop a scalable production method(4,5). Here, we report a versatile solution-based process for the large-scale production of single-layer chemically converted graphene over the entire area of a silicon/SiO2 wafer. By dispersing graphite oxide paper in pure hydrazine we were able to remove oxygen functionalities and restore the planar geometry of the single sheets. The chemically converted graphene sheets that were produced have the largest area reported to date (up to 20 x 40 mu m), making them far easier to process. Field-effect devices have been fabricated by conventional photolithography, displaying currents that are three orders of magnitude higher than previously reported for chemically produced graphene(6). The size of these sheets enables a wide range of characterization techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, to be performed on the same specimen.

Laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing: Physics of complex melt flow and formation mechanisms of pores, spatter, and denudation zones	ACTA MATERIALIA												This study demonstrates the significant effect of the recoil pressure and Marangoni convection in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of 316L stainless steel. A three-dimensional high fidelity powder-scale model reveals how the strong dynamical melt flow generates pore defects, material spattering (sparking), and denudation zones. The melt track is divided into three sections: a topological depression, a transition and a tail region, each being the location of specific physical effects. The inclusion of laser ray-tracing energy deposition in the powder-scale model improves over traditional volumetric energy deposition. It enables partial particle melting, which impacts pore defects in the denudation zone. Different pore formation mechanisms are observed at the edge of a scan track, at the melt pool bottom (during collapse of the pool depression), and at the end of the melt track (during laser power ramp down). Remedies to these undesirable pores are discussed. The results are validated against the experiments and the sensitivity to laser absorptivity is discussed. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

MX2 heterostructures are particularly exciting for novel optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, because two-dimensional MX2 monolayers can have an optical bandgap in the near-infrared to visible spectral range and exhibit extremely strong light-matter interactions(2,3,11). Theory predicts that many stacked MX2 heterostructures form type II semiconductor heterojunctions that facilitate efficient electron-hole separation for light detection and harvesting(12-16). Here, we report the first experimental observation of ultrafast charge transfer in photoexcited MoS2/WS2 heterostructures using both photoluminescence mapping and femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. We show that hole transfer from the MoS2 layer to the WS2 layer takes place within 50 fs after optical excitation, a remarkable rate for van der Waals coupled two-dimensional layers. Such ultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures can enable novel two-dimensional devices for optoelectronics and light harvesting.

The characteristic properties of aluminium, high strength stiffness to weight ratio, good formability, good corrosion resistance, and recycling potential make it the ideal candidate to replace heavier materials (steel or copper) in the car to respond to the weight reduction demand within the automotive industry. This paper summarises the recent developments covering aluminium's use in castings, extrusions and sheet; two specific examples will be given. The first deals with hang-on parts manufactured by Hoogovens Rolled Products Duffel, for which the weight saving potential can be 50%. Currently, the highly formable 5000 alloys are used mostly for inner panel applications, whilst the heat-treatable 6000 alloys are preferred for outer panel applications. This presentation reviews recent developments in aluminium alloys to improve formability, surface quality in both 5000 and 6000 alloys, and the bake hardening response of 6000 alloys. It also indicates the trend to develop a unialloy system to improve the aluminium scrap recycling. The second area deals with brazing sheet. Over the last 10 years there has been an increasing trend to replace copper heat exchangers with ones manufactured from brazed aluminium. Hoogovens Aluminium Walzprodukte Koblenz is one of the world's leading supplier of aluminium brazing sheet and is in the forefront of developing alloys with the combination of strength, formability, brazing performance and long life required by its customers. Materials have been development for both vacuum and controlled atmosphere brazing. The current status and future trends in aluminium brazing sheet for automotive applications will be presented. Particular emphasis has been placed on the development of long life alloys with superior corrosion performance over the more conventional materials. Using these two examples the technical and commercial aspects of the manufacturing processes of aluminium automotive components and engineering design support of materials producers are illustrated. The essential feature is the close co-operation at all stages between the material's supplier and the automotive manufacture. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

J	Williams, JC; Starke, EA				Williams, JC; Starke, EA			Progress in structural materials for aerospace systems	ACTA MATERIALIA												This paper examines the progress in aircraft and aircraft engines from the standpoint of the role that better materials and processing has played. Such progress includes the relatively recent transformation of the aircraft industry from purely performance driven products to products that are driven by customer value. It is demonstrated that advances in materials and processing technology and understanding has enabled much of the progress that has been made since the inception of manned, heavier than air flight. The recent constraints of cost, as determined by customer value, have changed the way new materials are introduced and these trends appear to be the new paradigm for the aircraft and aircraft engine industry. While the focus of this paper is aircraft and aircraft engines, the broader focus is on the role of materials in creating lightweight structures. There are examples used in this paper that are relevant to automotive applications once they are adjusted for cost. This matter is briefly discussed at the end of the paper.

J	Jablan, M; Buljan, H; Soljacic, M				Jablan, Marinko; Buljan, Hrvoje; Soljacic, Marin			Plasmonics in graphene at infrared frequencies	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We point out that plasmons in doped graphene simultaneously enable low losses and significant wave localization for frequencies below that of the optical phonon branch h omega(Oph)approximate to 0.2 eV. Large plasmon losses occur in the interband regime (via excitation of electron-hole pairs), which can be pushed toward higher frequencies for higher-doping values. For sufficiently large dopings, there is a bandwidth of frequencies from omega(Oph) up to the interband threshold, where a plasmon decay channel via emission of an optical phonon together with an electron-hole pair is nonegligible. The calculation of losses is performed within the framework of a random-phase approximation and number conserving relaxation-time approximation. The measured DC relaxation-time serves as an input parameter characterizing collisions with impurities, whereas the contribution from optical phonons is estimated from the influence of the electron-phonon coupling on the optical conductivity. Optical properties of plasmons in graphene are in many relevant aspects similar to optical properties of surface plasmons propagating on dielectric-metal interface, which have been drawing a lot of interest lately because of their importance for nanophotonics. Therefore, the fact that plasmons in graphene could have low losses for certain frequencies makes them potentially interesting for nanophotonic applications.

The first samples of pristine graphene were obtained by 'peeling off'(2,6) and epitaxial growth(5,7). Recently, the chemical reduction of graphite oxide was used to produce covalently functionalized single-layer graphene oxide(8-15). However, chemical approaches for the large-scale production of highly conducting graphene sheets remain elusive. Here, we report that the exfoliation reintercalation- expansion of graphite can produce high-quality single-layer graphene sheets stably suspended in organic solvents. The graphene sheets exhibit high electrical conductance at room and cryogenic temperatures. Large amounts of graphene sheets in organic solvents are made into large transparent conducting films by Langmuir-Blodgett assembly in a layer-by-layer manner. The chemically derived, high-quality graphene sheets could lead to future scalable graphene devices.

We present a highly active photocathode for solar H-2 production, consisting of electrodeposited cuprous oxide, which was protected against photocathodic decomposition in water by nanolayers of Al-doped zinc oxide and titanium oxide and activated for hydrogen evolution with electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles. The roles of the different surface protection components were investigated, and in the best case electrodes showed photocurrents of up to -7.6 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 0V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at mild pH. The electrodes remained active after 1 h of testing, cuprous oxide was found to be stable during the water reduction reaction and the Faradaic efficiency was estimated to be close to 100%.

Oxide-based resistance memory and the related memristor have succeeded in surpassing the specifications for a number of device requirements. However, a material or device structure that satisfies high-density, switching-speed, endurance, retention and most importantly power-consumption criteria has yet to be announced. In this work we demonstrate a TaOx-based asymmetric passive switching device with which we were able to localize resistance switching and satisfy all aforementioned requirements. In particular, the reduction of switching current drastically reduces power consumption and results in extreme cycling endurances of over 10(12). Along with the 10 ns switching times, this allows for possible applications to the working-memory space as well. Furthermore, by combining two such devices each with an intrinsic Schottky barrier we eliminate any need for a discrete transistor or diode in solving issues of stray leakage current paths in high-density crossbar arrays.

An orthophosphate semiconductor with photooxidation properties under visible-light irradiation	NATURE MATERIALS												The search for active semiconductor photocatalysts that directly split water under visible-light irradiation remains one of the most challenging tasks for solar-energy utilization(1-6). Over the past 30 years, the search for such materials has focused mainly on metal-ion substitution as in In(1-x)Ni(x)TaO(4) and (V-; Fe- or Mn-) TiO(2) (refs 7,8), non-metal-ion substitution as in TiO(2-x)N(x) and Sm(2)Ti(2)O(5)S(2) (refs 9,10) or solid-solution fabrication as in (Ga(1-x)Zn(x))(N(1-x)O(x)) and ZnS-CuInS(2)-AgInS(2) (refs 11,12). Here we report a new use of Ag(3)PO(4) semiconductor, which can harness visible light to oxidize water as well as decompose organic contaminants in aqueous solution. This suggests its potential as a photofunctional material for both water splitting and waste-water cleaning. More generally, it suggests the incorporation of p block elements and alkali or alkaline earth ions into a simple oxide of narrow bandgap as a strategy to design new photoelectrodes or photocatalysts.					李, 朝升/J-4034-2016; KAKO, Tetsuya/H-2932-2011; Cao, JUnyu/AAL-8605-2021; Luo, Wenjun/F-2676-2013; Yi, Zhiguo/F-7718-2011; KIKUGAWA, Naoki/H-2806-2011; Withers, Ray/H-8309-2014; YE, Jinhua/H-2755-2011; Liu, Yun/O-6153-2015	Luo, Wenjun/0000-0001-6760-6929; KIKUGAWA, Naoki/0000-0003-3975-4478; Withers, Ray/0000-0001-9017-2233; YE, Jinhua/0000-0002-8105-8903; Liu, Yun/0000-0002-5404-3909													1476-1122					JUL	2010	9	7					559	564		10.1038/NMAT2780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT2780								20526323					WOS:000279014300017

J	Aurbach, D				Aurbach, D			Review of selected electrode-solution interactions which determine the performance of Li and Li ion batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES					Solid State Lithium Battery Workshop	JUL, 1999	TOWSON, MD					We report herein on several phenomenological electrode-solution interactions which determine the performance of lithium and lithium ion batteries. This review is based on extensive studies of the behavior of Li, lithiated carbons and lithiated transition metal oxide electrodes in a wide variety of non-aqueous electrolyte solutions. These studies included spectroscopic measurements (FTIR, XPS, EDAX), morphological and structural analysis (XRD, SEM, AFM) in conjunction with impedance spectroscopy, EQCM and standard electrochemical techniques. It appears that the performance of both Li, Li-C anodes and LixMOy cathodes depends on their surface chemistry in solutions. We address complicated surface film formation on these electrodes, which either contribute to electrode stabilization or to capacity fading due to an increase in the electrodes' impedance. Several common classical phenomena occurring in these systems are reviewed and discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

J	Zinkle, SJ; Was, GS				Zinkle, S. J.; Was, G. S.			Materials challenges in nuclear energy	ACTA MATERIALIA												Nuclear power currently provides about 13% of electrical power worldwide, and has emerged as a reliable baseload source of electricity. A number of materials challenges must be successfully resolved for nuclear energy to continue to make further improvements in reliability, safety and economics. The operating environment for materials in current and proposed future nuclear energy systems is summarized, along with a description of materials used for the main operating components. Materials challenges associated with power uprates and extensions of the operating lifetimes of reactors are described. The three major materials challenges for the current and next generation of water-cooled fission reactors are centered on two structural materials aging degradation issues (corrosion and stress corrosion cracking of structural materials and neutron-induced embrittlement of reactor pressure vessels), along with improved fuel system reliability and accident tolerance issues. The major corrosion and stress corrosion cracking degradation mechanisms for light-water reactors are reviewed. The materials degradation issues for the Zr alloy-clad UO2 fuel system currently utilized in the majority of commercial nuclear power plants are discussed for normal and off-normal operating conditions. Looking to proposed future (Generation IV) fission and fusion energy systems, there are five key bulk radiation degradation effects (low temperature radiation hardening and embrittlement; radiation-induced and -modified solute segregation and phase stability; irradiation creep; void swelling; and high-temperature helium embrittlement) and a multitude of corrosion and stress corrosion cracking effects (including irradiation-assisted phenomena) that can have a major impact on the performance of structural materials.

J	Minami, T				Minami, T			Transparent conducting oxide semiconductors for transparent electrodes	SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The present status and prospects for further development of polycrystalline or amorphous transparent conducting oxide (TCO) semiconductors used for practical thin-film transparent electrode applications are presented in this paper. The important TCO semiconductors are impurity-doped ZnO, In2O3 and SnO2 as well as multicomponent oxides consisting of combinations of ZnO, In2O3 and SnO2, including some ternary compounds existing in their systems. Development of these and other TCO semiconductors is important because the expanding need for transparent electrodes for optoelectronic device applications is jeopardizing the availability of indium-tin-oxide (ITO), whose main constituent, indium, is a very expensive and scarce material. Al- and Ga-doped ZnO (AZO and GZO) semiconductors are promising as alternatives to ITO for thin-film transparent electrode applications. In particular, AZO thin films, with a low resistivity of the order of 10(-5) Omega cm and source materials that are inexpensive and non-toxic, are the best candidates. However, further development of the deposition techniques, such as magnetron sputtering or vacuum arc plasma evaporation, as well as of the targets is required to enable the preparation of AZO and GZO films on large area substrates with a high deposition rate.																			0268-1242	1361-6641				APR	2005	20	4					S35	S44		10.1088/0268-1242/20/4/004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0268-1242/20/4/004													WOS:000228840900005

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope observations, Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller surface area measurements, particle-size distribution measurements, and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Ab initio calculation was used to confirm the experimental redox potentials and Mossbauer parameters. The choice of a moderate sintering temperature (500 degreesC < T < 600 degreesC) and a homogeneous precursor enabled nearly perfect utilization of >95% of the 170 mAh/g theoretical capacity at room temperature. There are two main obstacles to achieving optimum charge/discharge performance of LiFePO4: (i) undesirable particle growth at T > 600 degreesC and (ii) the presence of a noncrystalline residual Fe3+ phase at T < 500<degrees>C.

Long-term stability remains a major obstacle for application on an industrial scale. Here, it is demonstrated that significant decomposition effects already occur during annealing of a methylammonium lead triiode perovskite at 85 degrees C even in inert atmosphere thus violating international standards. The observed behavior supports the view of currently used perovskite materials as soft matter systems with low formation energies, thus representing a major bottleneck for their application, especially in countries with high average temperatures.

High-performance lithium-ion anodes using a hierarchical bottom-up approach	NATURE MATERIALS												Si-based Li-ion battery anodes have recently received great attention, as they offer specific capacity an order of magnitude beyond that of conventional graphite. The applications of this transformative technology require synthesis routes capable of producing safe and easy-to-handle anode particles with low volume changes and stable performance during battery operation. Herein, we report a large-scale hierarchical bottom-up assembly route for the formation of Si on the nanoscale-containing rigid and robust spheres with irregular channels for rapid access of Li ions into the particle bulk. Large Si volume changes on Li insertion and extraction are accommodated by the particle's internal porosity. Reversible capacities over five times higher than that of the state-of-the-art anodes (1,950 mAh g(-1)) and stable performance are attained. The synthesis process is simple, low-cost, safe and broadly applicable, providing new avenues for the rational engineering of electrode materials with enhanced conductivity and power.

Control of the microarchitecture in engineered tissues can be achieved through photopatterning of cell-laden hydrogels. However, despite high pattern fidelity of photopolymerizable hydrogels, many such materials are not cell-responsive and have limited biodegradability. Here, we demonstrate gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) as an inexpensive, cell-responsive hydrogel platform for creating cell-laden microtissues and microfluidic devices. Cells readily bound to, proliferated, elongated, and migrated both when seeded on micropatterned GelMA substrates as well as when encapsulated in microfabricated GelMA hydrogels. The hydration and mechanical properties of GelMA were demonstrated to be tunable for various applications through modification of the methacrylation degree and gel concentration. The pattern fidelity and resolution of GelMA were high and it could be patterned to create perfusable microfluidic channels. Furthermore, GelMA micropatterns could be used to create cellular micropatterns for in vitro cell studies or 3D microtissue fabrication. These data suggest that GelMA hydrogels could be useful for creating complex, cell-responsive microtissues, such as endothelialized microvasculature, or for other applications that require cell-responsive microengineered hydrogels.

J	Zhang, SB; Wei, SH; Zunger, A				Zhang, SB; Wei, SH; Zunger, A			Intrinsic <i>n</i>-type versus <i>p</i>-type doping asymmetry and the defect physics of ZnO -: art. no. 075205	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												ZnO typifies a class of materials that can be doped via native defects in only one way: either n type or p type. We explain this asymmetry in ZnO via a study of its intrinsic defect physics, including Zn-O, Zn-i, V-O, O-i, and V-Zn and n-type impurity dopants, Al and F. We find that ZnO is n type at Zn-rich conditions. This is because (i) the Zn interstitial, Zn-i, is a shallow, donor, supplying electrons; (ii) its formation enthalpy is low for both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, so this defect is abundant; and (iii) the native defects that could compensate the n-type doping effect of Zn-i (interstitial O, O-i, and Zn vacancy, V-Zn), have high formation enthalpies for Zn-rich conditions, so these "electron killers" are not abundant. We find that ZnO cannot be doped p type via native defects (O-i, V-Zn) despite the fact that they are shallow (i.e., supplying holes at room temperature). This is because at both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, the defects that could compensate p-type doping (V-O, Zn-i, Zn-O) have low formation enthalpies so these "hole killers" form readily. Furthermore, we identify electron-hole radiative recombination at the V-O center as the source of the green luminescence. In contrast, a large structural relaxation of the same center upon double hole capture leads to slow electron-hole recombination (either radiative or nonradiative) responsible for the slow decay of photoconductivity.

Here, we show that quaternary ammonium halides can effectively passivate ionic defects in several different types of hybrid perovskite with their negative-and positive-charged components. The efficient defect passivation reduces the charge trap density and elongates the carrier recombination lifetime, which is supported by density-function-theory calculation. The defect passivation reduces the open-circuit-voltage deficit of the p-i-n-structured device to 0.39V, and boosts the efficiency to a certified value of 20.59 +/- 0.45%. Moreover, the defect healing also significantly enhances the stability of films in ambient conditions.

A precipitation-hardened high-entropy alloy with outstanding tensile properties	ACTA MATERIALIA												Recent studies indicated that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) possess unusual structural and thermal features, which could greatly affect dislocation motion and contribute to the mechanical performance, however, a HEA matrix alone is insufficiently strong for engineering applications and other strengthening mechanisms are urgently needed to be incorporated. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility to precipitate nanosized coherent reinforcing phase, i.e., L1(2)-Ni-3(TLA1), in a fcc-FeCoNiCr HEA matrix using minor additions of Ti and Al. Through thermomechanical processing and microstructure controlling, extraordinary balanced tensile properties at room temperature were achieved, which is due to a well combination of various hardening mechanisms, particularly precipitation hardening. The applicability and validity of the conventional strengthening theories are also discussed. The current work is a successful demonstration of using integrated strengthening approaches to manipulate the properties of fcc-HEA systems, and the resulting findings are important not only for understanding the strengthening mechanisms of metallic materials in general, but also for the future development of high-performance HEAs for industrial applications.

The growth of ZnO nanowires was carried out in a simple chemical vapor transport and condensation (CVM system. Based on our fundamental understanding of the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) nanowire growth mechanism, different levels of growth controls (including positional, orientational, diameter, and density control) have been achieved. Power-dependent emission has been examined and lasing action was observed in these ZnO nanowires when the excitation intensity exceeds a threshold (similar to40 kW cm(-2)). These short-wavelength nanolasers operate at room temperature and the areal density of these nanolasers on substrate readily reaches 1 X 10(10) cm(-2). The observation of lasing, fabricated mirrors indicates these single-crystalline, well-facetted nanoaction in these nanowire arrays without any wires can function as self-contained optical resonance cavities. This argument is further supported by our recent near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) studies on single nanowires.

The traditionally assumed stoichiometric termination is only found to be favorable at low oxygen chemical potentials, i.e., low pressures and/or high temperatures. At a realistic O pressure, the surface is predicted to contain additional terminal O atoms. Although this O excess defines a so-called polar surface, we show that the prevalent ionic model, that dismisses such terminations on electrostatic grounds, is of little validity for RuO2(110). Together with analogous results obtained previously at the (0001) surface of corundum-structured oxides, these findings on (110) rutile indicate that the stability of nonstoichiometric terminations is a more general phenomenon of transition metal oxide surfaces.

The performance of these devices strongly depends on the quality and defect morphology of the MoS2 layers. Here we provide a systematic study of intrinsic structural defects in chemical vapor phase grown monolayer MoS2, including point defects, dislocations, grain boundaries, and edges, via direct atomic resolution imaging, and explore their energy landscape and electronic properties using first-principles calculations. A rich variety of point defects and dislocation cores, distinct from those present in graphene, were observed in MoS2 . We discover that one-dimensional metallic wires can be created via two different types of 60 degrees grain boundaries consisting of distinct 4-fold ring chains.

J	Williams, DF				Williams, David F.			On the mechanisms of biocompatibility	BIOMATERIALS					Ratner Symposium 2006	2006	Maui, HI					The manner in which a mutually acceptable co-existence of biomaterials and tissues is developed and sustained has been the focus of attention in biomaterials science for many years, and forms the foundation of the subject of biocompatibility. There are many ways in which materials and tissues can be brought into contact such that this co-existence may be compromised, and the search for biomaterials that are able to provide for the best performance in devices has been based upon the understanding of all the interactions within biocompatibility phenomena. Our understanding of the mechanisms of biocompatibility has been restricted whilst the focus of attention has been long-term implantable devices. In this paper, over 50 years of experience with such devices is analysed and it is shown that, in the vast majority of circumstances, the sole requirement for biocompatibility in a medical device intended for long-term contact with the tissues of the human body is that the material shall do no harm to those tissues, achieved through chemical and biological inertness. Rarely has an attempt to introduce biological activity into a biomaterial been clinically successful in these applications. This essay then turns its attention to the use of biomaterials in tissue engineering, sophisticated cell, drug and gene delivery systems and applications in biotechnology, and shows that here the need for specific and direct interactions between biomaterials and tissue components has become necessary, and with this a new paradigm for biocompatibility has emerged. It is believed that once the need for this change is recognised, so our understanding of the mechanisms of biocompatibility will markedly improve. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials.

Morphological Control for High Performance, Solution-Processed Planar Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												Organometal trihalide perovskite based solar cells have exhibited the highest efficiencies to-date when incorporated into mesostructured composites. However, thin solid films of a perovskite absorber should be capable of operating at the highest efficiency in a simple planar heterojunction configuration. Here, it is shown that film morphology is a critical issue in planar heterojunction CH3NH3PbI3-xClx solar cells. The morphology is carefully controlled by varying processing conditions, and it is demonstrated that the highest photocurrents are attainable only with the highest perovskite surface coverages. With optimized solution based film formation, power conversion efficiencies of up to 11.4% are achieved, the first report of efficiencies above 10% in fully thin-film solution processed perovskite solar cells with no mesoporous layer.

Monolayer honeycomb structures of group-IV elements and III-V binary compounds: First-principles calculations	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Using first-principles plane-wave calculations, we investigate two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb structure of group-IV elements and their binary compounds as well as the compounds of group III-V elements. Based on structure optimization and phonon-mode calculations, we determine that 22 different honeycomb materials are stable and correspond to local minima on the Born-Oppenheimer surface. We also find that all the binary compounds containing one of the first row elements, B, C, or N have planar stable structures. On the other hand, in the honeycomb structures of Si, Ge, and other binary compounds the alternating atoms of hexagons are buckled since the stability is maintained by puckering. For those honeycomb materials which were found stable, we calculated optimized structures, cohesive energies, phonon modes, electronic-band structures, effective cation and anion charges, and some elastic constants. The band gaps calculated within density functional theory using local density approximation are corrected by GW(0) method. Si and Ge in honeycomb structure are semimetal and have linear band crossing at the Fermi level which attributes massless Fermion character to charge carriers as in graphene. However, all binary compounds are found to be semiconductor with band gaps depending on the constituent atoms. We present a method to reveal elastic constants of 2D honeycomb structures from the strain energy and calculate the Poisson's ratio as well as in-plane stiffness values. Preliminary results show that the nearly lattice matched heterostructures of these compounds can offer alternatives for nanoscale electronic devices. Similar to those of the three-dimensional group-IV and group III-V compound semiconductors, one deduces interesting correlations among the calculated properties of present honeycomb structures.

Supplementary cementitious materials	CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH												The use of silica rich SCMs influences the amount and kind of hydrates formed and thus the volume, the porosity and finally the durability of these materials. At the levels of substitution normally used, major changes are the lower Ca/Si ratio in the C-S-H phase and consumption of portlandite. Alumina-rich SCMs increase the Al-uptake in C-S-H and the amounts of aluminate containing hydrates. In general the changes in phase assemblages are well captured by thermodynamic modelling, although better knowledge of the C-S-H is needed. At early ages, "filler" effects lead to an increased reaction of the clinker phases. Reaction of SCMs starts later and is enhanced with pH and temperature. Composition, fineness and the amount of glassy phase play also an important role. Due to the diverse range of SCM used, generic relations between composition, particle size, exposure conditions as temperature or relative humidity become increasingly crucial. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that many of these compounds show a half-metallic behavior; however, in contrast to the half-Heusler alloys the energy gap in the minority band is extremely small due to states localized only at the Co (Fe, Rh, or Ru) sites which are not present in the half-Heusler compounds. The full-Heusler alloys show a Slater-Pauling behavior and the total spin magnetic moment per unit cell (M-t) scales with the total number of valence electrons (Z(t)) following the rule M-t=Z(t)-24. We explain why the spin-down band contains exactly 12 electrons using arguments based on group theory and show that this rule holds also for compounds with less than 24 valence electrons. Finally we discuss the deviations from this rule and the differences compared to the half-Heusler alloys.

The electrochemical and thermal properties of Li[NixCoyMnz]O-2 are strongly dependent on its composition. An increase of the Ni content results in an increase of specific discharge capacity and total residual lithium content but the corresponding capacity retention and safety characteristics gradually decreased. The structural stability is related to the thermal and electrochemical stabilities, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. Developing an ideal cathode material with both high capacity and safety will be a challenging task that requires precise control of microstructure and physico-chemical properties of the electrode.

Today's state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employ various methods to enhance nucleation and improve the smoothness of the perovskite films formed via solution processing. However, the lack of precise control over the crystallization process creates a risk of forming unwanted defects, for example, pinholes and grain boundaries. Here, we introduce an approach to prepare perovskite films of high electronic quality by using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a template to control nucleation and crystal growth. We obtain shiny smooth perovskite films of excellent electronic quality, as manifested by a remarkably long photoluminescence lifetime. We realize stable PSCs with excellent reproducibility showing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 21.6% and a certified PCE of 21.02% under standard AM 1.5G reporting conditions.

Yet, few pseudocapacitive transition metal oxides can provide a high power capability due to their low intrinsic electronic and ionic conductivity. Here we demonstrate that two-dimensional transition metal carbides (MXenes) can operate at rates exceeding those of conventional EDLCs, but still provide higher volumetric and areal capacitance than carbon, electrically conducting polymers or transition metal oxides. We applied two distinct designs for MXene electrode architectures with improved ion accessibility to redox-active sites. A macroporous Ti(3)C(2)Tx MXene film delivered up to 210 F g(-1) at scan rates of 10Vs(-1), surpassing the best carbon supercapacitors known.

Lithium resources are confirmed to be unevenly distributed in South America, and the cost of the lithium raw materials has roughly doubled from the first practical application in 1991 to the present and is increasing due to global demand for lithium-ion accumulators. Since the electrochemical equivalent and standard potential of sodium are the most advantageous after lithium, sodium based energy storage is of great interest to realize lithium-free high energy and high voltage batteries. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no successful reports on electrochemical sodium insertion materials for battery applications; the major challenge is the negative electrode and its passivation. In this study, we achieve high capacity and excellent reversibility sodium-insertion performance of hard-carbon and layered NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 electrodes in propylene carbonate electrolyte solutions. The structural change and passivation for hard-carbon are investigated to study the reversible sodium insertion. The 3-volt secondary Na-ion battery possessing environmental and cost friendliness, Na+-shuttlecock hard-carbon/NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cell, demonstrates steady cycling performance as next generation secondary batteries and an alternative to Li-ion batteries.

These active optoelectronic materials produce and harvest light efficiently in the visible spectrum. The same functions are required in the infrared for telecommunications (1,300-1,600 nm), thermal imaging (1,500 nm and beyond), biological imaging (transparent tissue windows at 800 nm and 1,100 nm), thermal photovoltaics (>1,900 nm), and solar cells (800-2,000 nm). Photoconductive polymer devices have yet to demonstrate sensitivity beyond similar to800 nm (refs 2,3). Sensitizing conjugated polymers with infrared-active nanocrystal quantum dots provides a spectrally tunable means of accessing the infrared while maintaining the advantageous properties of polymers. Here we use such a nanocomposite approach in which PbS nanocrystals tuned by the quantum size effect sensitize the conjugated polymer poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy-p-phenylenevinylene)] (MEH-PPV) into the infrared. We achieve, in a solution-processed device and with sensitivity far beyond 800 nm, harvesting of infrared-photogenerated carriers and the demonstration of an infrared photovoltaic effect. We also make use of the wavelength tunability afforded by the nanocrystals to show photocurrent spectra tailored to three different regions of the infrared spectrum.

It is shown that these materials exhibit unique many-electron effects; the electronic structures are dispersive essentially along one dimension, leading to particularly enhanced self-energy corrections and excitonic effects. Additionally, within a wide energy range, including infrared light and part of visible light, few-layer black phosphorous absorbs light polarized along the structures' armchair direction and is transparent to light polarized along the zigzag direction, making them potentially viable linear polarizers for applications. Finally, the number of phosphorene layers included in the stack controls the material's band gap, optical absorption spectrum, and anisotropic polarization energy window across a wide range.

Recombination in polymer-fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells reduces the short circuit current (J(sc)) and the fill factor (FF). Identifying the mechanism of recombination is, therefore, fundamentally important for increasing the power conversion efficiency. Light intensity and temperature-dependent current-voltage measurements on polymer BHJ cells made from a variety of different semiconducting polymers and fullerenes show that the recombination kinetics are voltage dependent and evolve from first-order recombination at short circuit to bimolecular recombination at open circuit as a result of increasing the voltage-dependent charge carrier density in the cell. The "missing 0.3 V" inferred from comparison of the band gaps of the bulk heterojunction materials and the measured open-circuit voltage at room-temperature results from the temperature dependence of the quasi-Fermi levels in the polymer and fullerene domains-a conclusion based on the fundamental statistics of fermions.

Here, an artificial tree with a reverse-tree design is demonstrated as a cost-effective, scalable yet highly efficient steam-generation device. The reverse-tree design implies that the wood is placed on the water with the tree-growth direction parallel to the water surface; accordingly, water is transported in a direction perpendicular to what occurs in natural tree. The artificial tree is fabricated by cutting the natural tree along the longitudinal direction followed by surface carbonization (called as C-L-Wood). The nature-made 3D interconnected micro-/nanochannels enable efficient water transpiration, while the layered channels block the heat effectively. A much lower thermal conductivity (0.11 W m(-1) K-1) thus can be achieved, only 1/3 of that of the horizontally cut wood. Meanwhile, the carbonized surface can absorb almost all the incident light. The simultaneous optimizations of water transpiration, thermal management, and light absorption results in a high efficiency of 89% at 10 kW m(-2), among the highest values in literature. Such wood-based high-performance, cost-effective, scalable steam-generation device can provide an attractive solution to the pressing global clean water shortage problem.

Structurally ordered intermetallic platinum-cobalt core-shell nanoparticles with enhanced activity and stability as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts	NATURE MATERIALS												To enhance and optimize nanocatalyst performance and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel-cell applications, we look beyond Pt-metal disordered alloys and describe a new class of Pt-Co nanocatalysts composed of ordered Pt3Co intermetallic cores with a 2-3 atomic-layer-thick platinum shell. These nanocatalysts exhibited over 200% increase in mass activity and over 300% increase in specific activity when compared with the disordered Pt3Co alloy nanoparticles as well as Pt/C. So far, this mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction is the highest among the Pt-Co systems reported in the literature under similar testing conditions. Stability tests showed a minimal loss of activity after 5,000 potential cycles and the ordered core-shell structure was maintained virtually intact, as established by atomic-scale elemental mapping. The high activity and stability are attributed to the Pt-rich shell and the stable intermetallic Pt3Co core arrangement.

Advances in Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY												Rechargeable Li-S batteries have received ever-increasing attention recently due to their high theoretical specific energy density, which is 3 to 5 times higher than that of Li ion batteries based on intercalation reactions. Li-S batteries may represent a next-generation energy storage system, particularly for large scale applications. The obstacles to realize this high energy density mainly include high internal resistance, self-discharge and rapid capacity fading on cycling. These challenges can be met to a large degree by designing novel sulfur electrodes with "smart'' nanostructures. This highlight provides an overview of major developments of positive electrodes based on this concept.

In this process, polymer fibers with diameters down to the nanometer range, or nanofibers, are formed by subjecting a fluid jet to a high electric field. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of neonatal rats were cultured, expanded and seeded oil electrospun PCL scaffolds. The cell-polymer constructs were cultured with osteogenic supplements under dynamic culture conditions for up to 4 weeks. The cell-polymer constructs maintained the size and shape of the original scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), histological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed. Penetration of cells and abundant extracellular matrix were observed in the cell-polymer constructs after 1 week. SEM showed that the surfaces of the cell-polymer constructs were covered with cell multilayers at 4 weeks. In addition, mineralization and type I collagen were observed at 4 weeks. This suggests that electrospun PCL is a potential candidate scaffold for bone tissue engineering. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rapid formation of plasma protein corona critically affects nanoparticle pathophysiology	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												In biological fluids, proteins bind to the surface of nanoparticles to form a coating known as the protein corona, which can critically affect the interaction of the nanoparticles with living systems. As physiological systems are highly dynamic, it is important to obtain a time-resolved knowledge of protein-corona formation, development and biological relevancy. Here we show that label-free snapshot proteomics can be used to obtain quantitative time-resolved profiles of human plasma coronas formed on silica and polystyrene nanoparticles of various size and surface functionalization. Complex time- and nanoparticle-specific coronas, which comprise almost 300 different proteins, were found to form rapidly (<0.5 minutes) and, over time, to change significantly in terms of the amount of bound protein, but not in composition. Rapid corona formation is found to affect haemolysis, thrombocyte activation, nanoparticle uptake and endothelial cell death at an early exposure time.

Prospectively, employing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as versatile nanofillers would notably broaden the scope of functionalities. However, synthesizing MOFs in the form of freestanding nanosheets has proved challenging. We present a bottom-up synthesis strategy for dispersible copper 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate MOF lamellae of micrometre lateral dimensions and nanometre thickness. Incorporating MOF nanosheets into polymer matrices endows the resultant composites with outstanding CO2 separation performance from CO2/CH4 gas mixtures, together with an unusual and highly desired increase in the separation selectivity with pressure. As revealed by tomographic focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, the unique separation behaviour stems from a superior occupation of the membrane cross-section by the MOF nanosheets as compared with isotropic crystals, which improves the efficiency of molecular discrimination and eliminates unselective permeation pathways. This approach opens the door to ultrathin MOF-polymer composites for various applications.

Water-Dispersible Magnetite-Reduced Graphene Oxide Composites for Arsenic Removal	ACS NANO												Magnetite-graphene hybrids have been synthesized via a chemical reaction with a magnetite particle size of similar to 10 nm. The composites are superparamagnetic at room temperature and can be separated by an external magnetic field. As compared to bare magnetite particles, the hybrids show a high binding capacity for As(III) and As(V), whose presence in the drinking water in wide areas of South Asia has been a huge problem. Their high binding capacity is due to the increased adsorption sites in the M-RGO composite which occurs by reducing the aggregation of bare magnetite. Since the composites show near complete (over 99.9%) arsenic removal within 1 ppb, they are practically usable for arsenic separation from water.

Jeffrey			Copper ion liquid-like thermoelectrics	NATURE MATERIALS												Advanced thermoelectric technology offers a potential for converting waste industrial heat into useful electricity, and an emission-free method for solid state cooling(1,2). Worldwide efforts to find materials with thermoelectric figure of merit, zT values significantly above unity, are frequently focused on crystalline semiconductors with low thermal conductivity(2). Here we report on Cu2-xSe, which reaches a zT of 1.5 at 1,000 K, among the highest values for any bulk materials. Whereas the Se atoms in Cu2-xSe form a rigid face-centred cubic lattice, providing a crystalline pathway for semiconducting electrons (or more precisely holes), the copper ions are highly disordered around the Se sublattice and are superionic with liquid-like mobility. This extraordinary 'liquid-like' behaviour of copper ions around a crystalline sublattice of Se in Cu2-xSe results in an intrinsically very low lattice thermal conductivity which enables high zT in this otherwise simple semiconductor. This unusual combination of properties leads to an ideal thermoelectric material. The results indicate a new strategy and direction for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials by exploring systems where there exists a crystalline sublattice for electronic conduction surrounded by liquid-like ions.					xu, fang/B-4789-2012; Zhang, Wenqing/K-1236-2012; LI, Qiang/HLQ-6133-2023; shi, xun/B-4499-2009; Liu, Huili/F-5148-2017; Zhang, Linlin/HGE-7116-2022; Chen, Lidong/F-2705-2010; Snyder, Jeff/E-4453-2011; shi, xun/A-1764-2019; Liu, Huili/B-7230-2012	Snyder, Jeff/0000-0003-1414-8682; shi, xun/0000-0002-8086-6407; Liu, Huili/0000-0001-8959-0315; Chen, Lidong/0000-0002-9683-037X													1476-1122	1476-4660				MAY	2012	11	5					422	425		10.1038/NMAT3273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT3273								22406814					WOS:000303108500019

FactSage was introduced in 2001 and is the fusion of the FACT-Win/F*A*C*T and ChemSage/SOLGASMIX thermochemical packages that were founded over 25 years ago. The FactSage package runs on a PC operating under Microsoft Windows(R) and consists of a series of information, database, calculation and manipulation modules that enable one to access and manipulate pure substances and solution databases. With the various modules one can perform a wide variety of thermochemical calculations and generate tables, graphs and figures of interest to chemical and physical metallurgists, chemical engineers, corrosion engineers, inorganic chemists, geochemists, ceramists, electrochemists, environmentalists, etc. In this article emphasis is placed on the calculation and manipulation of phase diagrams. However the reputation of FactSage has been established mainly in the field of complex chemical equilibria and process simulation where the software has unique capabilities. Some of these capabilities are also shown in this paper.

However, the growth of dendrites greatly hinders the practical applications of LMBs in portable electronics and electric vehicles. Constructing stable and efficient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is among the most effective strategies to inhibit the dendrite growth and thus to achieve a superior cycling performance. In this review, the mechanisms of SEI formation and models of SEI structure are briefly summarized. The analysis methods to probe the surface chemistry, surface morphology, electrochemical property, dynamic characteristics of SEI layer are emphasized. The critical factors affecting the SEI formation, such as electrolyte component, temperature, current density, are comprehensively debated. The efficient methods to modify SEI layer with the introduction of new electrolyte system and additives, ex-situ-formed protective layer, as well as electrode design, are summarized. Although these works afford new insights into SEI research, robust and precise routes for SEI modification with well-designed structure, as well as understanding of the connection between structure and electrochemical performance, is still inadequate. A multidisciplinary approach is highly required to enable the formation of robust SEI for highly efficient energy storage systems.

However, the synthetic approach to obtain high-quality and large-area MoS2 atomic thin layers is still rare. Here we report that the high-temperature annealing of a thermally decomposed ammonium thiomolybdate layer in the presence of sulfur can produce large-area MoS2 thin layers with superior electrical performance on insulating substrates. Spectroscopic and microscopic results reveal that the synthesized MoS2 sheets are highly crystalline. The electron mobility of the bottom-gate transistor devices made of the synthesized MoS2 layer is comparable with those of the micromechanically exfoliated thin sheets from MoS2 crystals. This synthetic approach is simple, scalable, and applicable to other transition metal dichalcogenides. Meanwhile, the obtained MoS2 films are transferable to arbitrary substrates, providing great opportunities to make layered composites by stacking various atomically thin layers.

We report the first observations of ferromagnetism above room temperature for dilute (<4 at.%) Mn-doped ZnO. The Mn is found to carry an average magnetic moment of 0.16 μ(B) per ion. Our ab initio calculations find a valance state of Mn2+ and that the magnetic moments are ordered ferromagnetically, consistent with the experimental findings. We have obtained room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in bulk pellets, in transparent films 2-3 μm thick, and in the powder form of the same material. The unique feature of our sample preparation was the low-temperature processing. When standard high-temperature (T>700degreesC) methods were used, samples were found to exhibit clustering and were not ferromagnetic at room temperature. This capability to fabricate ferromagnetic Mn-doped ZnO semiconductors promises new spintronic devices as well as magneto-optic components.

Water Desalination across Nanoporous Graphene	NANO LETTERS												We show that nanometer-scale pores in single-layer freestanding graphene can effectively filter NaCl salt from water. Using classical molecular dynamics, we report the desalination performance of such membranes as a function of pore size, chemical functionalization, and applied pressure. Our results indicate that the membrane's ability to prevent the salt passage depends critically on pore diameter with adequately sized pores allowing for water flow while blocking ions. Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water flux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water flux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions. Overall, our results indicate that the water permeability of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reverse osmosis membranes, and that nanoporous graphene may have a valuable role to play for water purification.

These fullerene derivatives, methanofullerene [6,6]-plienyl C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a new azafulleroid, and a ketolactam quasifullerene, show a variation of almost 200 mV in their first reduction potential. The open circuit voltage of the corresponding devices was found to correlate directly with the acceptor strength of the fullerenes, whereas it was rather insensitive to variations of the work function of the negative electrode. These observations are discussed within the concept of Fermi level pinning between fullerenes and metals via surface charges.

The resulting, graphene/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible spectrophotometry, nitrogen adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The transient photocurrent response was measured for several on-off cycles of intermittent irradiation. The effect of graphene content on the rate of visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production was studied for a series of graphene-graphitic carbon nitride composite samples containing Pt as a cocatalyst in methanol aqueous solutions. This study shows that graphene sheets act as electronic conductive channels to efficiently separate the photogenerated charge carriers and, consequently, to enhance the visible-light photocatalytic H-2-production activity of g-C3N4. The optimal graphene content was determined to be similar to 1.0 wt %, and the corresponding H-2-production rate was 451 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which exceeded that of pure g-C3N4 by more than 3.07 times. The proposed mechanism for the enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 modified by a 5 mall amount of graphene was further confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy and transient photocurrent response. The metal-free graphene/g-C3N4 composites showed high visible-light photocatalytic activity, which makes them promising nanomaterials for further applications in water treatment and dye-sensitized solar cells.

However, the structure of their active sites has remained elusive, delaying further advance. Here, we synthesized Fe-N-C materials quasi-free of crystallographic iron structures after argon or ammonia pyrolysis. These materials exhibit nearly identical Mossbauer spectra and identical X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra, revealing the same Fe-centred moieties. However, the much higher activity and basicity of NH3-pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials demonstrates that the turnover frequency of Fe-centred moieties depends on the physico-chemical properties of the support. Following a thorough XANES analysis, the detailed structures of two FeN4 porphyrinic architectures with different O-2 adsorption modes were then identified. These porphyrinic moieties are not easily integrated in graphene sheets, in contrast with Fe-centred moieties assumed hitherto for pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials. These new insights open the path to bottom-up synthesis approaches and studies on site-support interactions.					jaouen, frederic/D-7912-2019; Mineva, Tzonka/AGR-9642-2022; Zitolo, Andrea/J-2190-2019; Fonda, Emiliano/D-9666-2011; Stievano, Lorenzo/B-7801-2010; Sougrati, Moulay Tahar/B-6283-2011	jaouen, frederic/0000-0001-9836-3261; Stievano, Lorenzo/0000-0001-8548-0231; Fonda, Emiliano/0000-0001-6584-4587; Mineva, Tzonka/0000-0002-9156-2396; Zitolo, Andrea/0000-0002-2187-6699; Sougrati, Moulay Tahar/0000-0003-3740-2807													1476-1122	1476-4660				SEP	2015	14	9					937	+		10.1038/NMAT4367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT4367								26259106					WOS:000360192000029

Our results indicate that tunneling is much more interesting and complicated than the simple barrier model used previously. We obtain the following general results: (1) Tunneling conductance depends strongly on the symmetry of the Bloch states in the electrodes and of the evanescent states in the barrier layer. (2) Bloch states of different symmetry decay at different rates within the barrier. The decay rate is determined by the complex energy bands of the same symmetry in the barrier. (3) There may be quantum interference between the decaying states in the barrier. This leads to an oscillatory dependence of the tunneling current on kll and a damped oscillatory dependence on barrier thickness. (4) Interfacial resonance states can allow particular Bloch states to tunnel efficiently through the barrier. For Fe(100)(MgO(100)\Fe(100) our calculations indicate that quite different tunneling mechanisms dominate the conductance in the two spin channels. In the majority channel the conductance is primarily via Bloch electrons with small transverse momentum. One particular state with Delta (1) symmetry is able to effectively couple from the Fe into the MgO. In the minority channel the conductance is primarily through interface resonance states especially for thinner layers. We predict a large magnetoresistance that increases with barrier thickness.																			2469-9950	2469-9969				FEB 1	2001	63	5							054416	10.1103/PhysRevB.63.054416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.63.054416													WOS:000166820600069

J	Salahuddin, S; Dattat, S				Salahuddin, Sayeef; Dattat, Supriyo			Use of negative capacitance to provide voltage amplification for low power nanoscale devices	NANO LETTERS												It is well-known that conventional field effect transistors (FETs) require a change in the channel potential of at least 60 mV at 300 K to effect a change in the current by a factor of 10, and this minimum subthreshold slope S puts a fundamental lower limit on the operating voltage and hence the power dissipation in standard FET-based switches. Here, we suggest that by replacing the standard insulator with a ferroelectric insulator of the right thickness it should be possible to implement a step-up voltage transformer that will amplify the gate voltage thus leading to values of S lower than 60 mV/decade and enabling low voltage/low power operation. The voltage transformer action can be understood intuitively as the result of an effective negative capacitance provided by the ferroelectric capacitor that arises from an internal positive feedback that in principle could be obtained from other microscopic mechanisms as well. Unlike other proposals to reduce S, this involves no change in the basic physics of the FET and thus does not affect its current drive or impose other restrictions.																			1530-6984	1530-6992				FEB	2008	8	2					405	410		10.1021/nl071804g	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl071804g								18052402					WOS:000253166200006

Joshua			Memristors with diffusive dynamics as synaptic emulators for neuromorphic computing	NATURE MATERIALS												The accumulation and extrusion of Ca2+ in the pre- and postsynaptic compartments play a critical role in initiating plastic changes in biological synapses. To emulate this fundamental process in electronic devices, we developed diffusive Ag-in-oxide memristors with a temporal response during and after stimulation similar to that of the synaptic Ca2+ dynamics. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle dynamics simulations both demonstrate that Ag atoms disperse under electrical bias and regroup spontaneously under zero bias because of interfacial energy minimization, closely resembling synaptic influx and extrusion of Ca2+, respectively. The diffusive memristor and its dynamics enable a direct emulation of both short- and long-term plasticity of biological synapses, representing an advance in hardware implementation of neuromorphic functionalities.

Negligible Particle-Specific Antibacterial Activity of Silver Nanoparticles	NANO LETTERS												For nearly a decade, researchers have debated the mechanisms by which AgNPs exert toxicity to bacteria and other organisms. The most elusive question has been whether the AgNPs exert direct "particle-specific" effects beyond the known antimicrobial activity of released silver ions (Ag+). Here, we infer that Ag+ is the definitive molecular toxicant. We rule out direct particle-specific biological effects by showing the lack of toxicity of AgNPs when synthesized and tested under strictly anaerobic conditions that preclude Ag(0) oxidation and Ag+ release. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the toxicity of various AgNPs (PEG- or PVP- coated, of three different sizes each) accurately follows the dose response pattern of E. coli exposed to Ag+ (added as AgNO3). Surprisingly, E. coli survival was stimulated by relatively low (sublethal) concentration of all tested AgNPs and AgNO3 (at 3-8 mu g/L Ag+, or 12-31% of the minimum lethal concentration (MLC)), suggesting a hormetic response that would be counterproductive to antimicrobial applications. Overall, this work suggests that AgNP morphological properties known to affect antimicrobial activity are indirect effectors that primarily influence Ag+ release. Accordingly, antibacterial activity could be controlled (and environmental impacts could be mitigated) by modulating Ag+ release, possibly through manipulation of oxygen availability, particle size, shape, and/or type of coating.

Crystalline silicon becomes amorphous during lithium insertion, confirming previous studies. Highly lithiated amorphous silicon suddenly crystallizes at 50 mV to form a new lithium-silicon phase, identified as Li15Si4. This phase is the fully lithiated phase for silicon at room temperature, not Li21Si5 as is widely believed. Delithiation of the Li15Si4 phase results in the formation of amorphous silicon. Cycling silicon anodes above 50 mV avoids the formation of crystallized phases completely and results in better cycling performance. (C) 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Kannan, N; Sundaram, MM				Kannan, N; Sundaram, MM			Kinetics and mechanism of removal of methylene blue by adsorption on various carbons - a comparative study	DYES AND PIGMENTS												The kinetics and mechanism of methylene blue adsorption on commercial activated carbon (CAC) and indigenously prepared activated carbons from bamboo dust, coconut shell, groundnut shell, rice husk, and straw, have been studied. The effects of various experimental parameters have been investigated using a batch adsorption technique to obtain information on treating effluents from the dye industry. The extent of dye removal increased with decrease in the initial concentration of the dye and particle size of the adsorbent and also increased with increase in contact time, amount of adsorbent used and the initial pH of the solution. Adsorption data were modeled using the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms and first order kinetic equations. The kinetics of adsorption were found to be first order with regard to intra-particle diffusion rate. The adsorption capacities of indigenous activated carbons have been compared with that of the commercial activated carbon. The results indicate that such carbons could be employed as low cost alternatives to commercial activated carbon in wastewater treatment for the removal of colour and dyes.

One limitation of electrochemical capacitors is their low energy density and for this reason, there is widespread interest in pseudocapacitive materials that use Faradaic reactions to store charge. One candidate pseudocapacitive material is orthorhombic MoO3 (alpha-MoO3), a layered compound with a high theoretical capacity for lithium (279 mA h g(-1) or 1,005 C g(-1)). Here, we report on the properties of reduced alpha-MoO3-x(R-MoO3-x) and compare it with fully oxidized alpha-MoO3 (F-MoO3). The introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a larger interlayer spacing that promotes faster charge storage kinetics and enables the alpha-MoO3 structure to be retained during the insertion and removal of Li ions. The higher specific capacity of the R-MoO3-x is attributed to the reversible formation of a significant amount of Mo4+ following lithiation. This study underscores the potential importance of incorporating oxygen vacancies into transition metal oxides as a strategy for increasing the charge storage kinetics of redox-active materials.

Due to electrostatically induced hydration, surfaces coated with zwitterionic groups are highly resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and biofilm formation. Among zwitterionic materials, pCB is unique due to its abundant functional groups for the convenient immobilization of biomolecules. pCB can also be prepared in a hydrolyzable form as cationic pCB esters, which can kill bacteria or condense DNA. The hydrolysis of cationic pCB esters into nonfouling zwitterionic groups will lead to the release of killed microbes or the irreversible unpackaging of DNA. Furthermore, mixed-charge materials have been shown to be equivalent to zwitterionic materials in resisting nonspecific protein adsorption when they are uniformly mixed at the molecular scale.

This splits the G peak into two bands, which we call G(+) and G(-), by analogy with the effect of curvature on the nanotube G peak. Both peaks redshift with increasing strain and their splitting increases, in excellent agreement with first-principles calculations. Their relative intensities are found to depend on light polarization, which provides a useful tool to probe the graphene crystallographic orientation with respect to the strain. The 2D and 2D(') bands also redshift but do not split for small strains. We study the Gruneisen parameters for the phonons responsible for the G, D, and D-' peaks. These can be used to measure the amount of uniaxial or biaxial strain, providing a fundamental tool for nanoelectronics, where strain monitoring is of paramount importance.

In this work, we report the antibacterial activity of two water-dispersible graphene derivatives, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets. Such graphene-based nanomaterials can effectively inhibit the growth of E. coli bacteria while showing minimal cytotoxicity. We have also demonstrated that macroscopic freestanding GO and rGO paper can be conveniently fabricated from their suspension via simple vacuum filtration. Given the superior antibacterial effect of GO and the fact that GO can be mass-produced and easily processed to make freestanding and flexible paper with low cost, we expect this new carbon nanomaterial may find important environmental and clinical applications.					zhang, jin/IXD-9872-2023; Luo, Weijie/AAG-8602-2020; Qing, Huang/B-8796-2014; Peng, Cheng/HPG-9590-2023; Li, Di/F-2468-2012; Fan, Chunhai/A-7569-2011	Li, Di/0000-0003-1674-0110; Fan, Chunhai/0000-0002-7171-7338; Li, Xiaoming/0000-0003-1795-0371													1936-0851	1936-086X				JUL	2010	4	7					4317	4323		10.1021/nn101097v	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn101097v								20593851					WOS:000280364800093

Extraordinary Sunlight Absorption and One Nanometer Thick Photovoltaics Using Two-Dimensional Monolayer Materials	NANO LETTERS												Graphene and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising materials for next-generation ultrathin optoelectronic devices. Although visually transparent, graphene is an excellent sunlight absorber, achieving 2.3% visible light absorbance in just 3.3 angstrom thickness. TMD monolayers also hold potential as sunlight absorbers, and may enable ultrathin photovoltaic (PV) devices due to their semi-conducting character. In this work, we show that the three TMD monolayers MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2 can absorb up to 5-10% incident sunlight in a thickness of less than 1 nm, thus achieving 1 order of magnitude higher sunlight absorption than GaAs and Si. We further study PV devices based on just two stacked monolayers: (1) a Schottky barrier solar cell between MoS2 and graphene and (2) an excitonic solar cell based on a MoS2/WS2 bilayer. We demonstrate that such 1 nm thick active layers can attain power conversion efficiencies of up to similar to 1%, corresponding to approximately 1-3 orders of magnitude higher power densities than the best existing ultrathin solar cells. Our work shows that two-dimensional monolayer materials hold yet untapped potential for solar energy absorption and conversion at the nanoscale.

Graphane: A two-dimensional hydrocarbon	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We predict the stability of an extended two-dimensional hydrocarbon on the basis of first-principles total-energy calculations. The compound that we call graphane is a fully saturated hydrocarbon derived from a single graphene sheet with formula CH. All of the carbon atoms are in sp(3) hybridization forming a hexagonal network and the hydrogen atoms are bonded to carbon on both sides of the plane in an alternating manner. Graphane is predicted to be stable with a binding energy comparable to other hydrocarbons such as benzene, cyclohexane, and polyethylene. We discuss possible routes for synthesizing graphane and potential applications as a hydrogen storage material and in two-dimensional electronics.

The GNS/Fe3O4 composite shows a reversible specific capacity approaching 1026 mA h(-1) g(-1) after 30 cycles at 35 mA g(-1) 580 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 700 mA g(-1) as well as improved cyclic stability and excellent rate capability. The multifunctional features of the GNS/Fe3O4 composite are considered as follows: (i) GNSs play a "flexible confinement" function to enwrap Fe3O4 particles, which can compensate for the volume change of Fe3O4 and prevent the detachment and agglomeration of pulverized Fe3O4, thus extending the cycling life of the electrode; (ii) GNSs provide a large contact surface for individual dispersion of well-adhered Fe3O4 particles and act as an excellent conductive agent to provide a highway for electron transport, improving the accessible capacity; (iii) Fe3O4 particles separate GNSs and prevent their restacking thus improving the adsorption and immersion of electrolyte on the surface of electroactive material; and (iv) the porosity formed by lateral GNSs and Fe3O4 particles facilitates ion transportation. As a result, this unique laterally confined GNS/Fe3O4 composite can dramatically improve the cycling stability and the rate capability of Fe3O4 as an anode material for lithium ion batteries.

Doped metal oxides are commonly used, but their optical transparency is limited for films with a low sheet resistance. Furthermore, they are prone to cracking when deposited on flexible substrates, are costly, and require a high-temperature step for the best performance. We demonstrate solution-processed transparent electrodes consisting of random meshes of metal nanowires that exhibit an optical transparency equivalent to or better than that of metal-oxide thin films for the same sheet resistance. Organic solar cells deposited on these electrodes show a performance equivalent to that of devices based on a conventional metal-oxide transparent electrode.

The composite was prepared by conventional ceramic processing. The real part of the permittivity increases with increasing temperature, which is attributed to the shortened relaxation time of electron polarization, and the imaginary part also increases which is ascribed to the increasing electrical conductivity of the carbon fibers. The effect of frequency is found in reflection coefficient and absorption coefficient, and the corresponding mechanisms for the effect are proposed. Results indicate that the composite has good electromagnetic interference shielding property. By calculating the microwave-absorption as a single-layer absorber, we find that the reflection loss varies with the changes of thickness and temperature, due to the deviation of impedance matching condition.

Using a simple and inexpensive technique, we recorded surface plasmon resonance (SPR) scattering images and SPR absorption spectra from both colloidal gold nanoparticles and from gold nanoparticles conjugated to monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies after incubation in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCaT) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). Colloidal gold nanoparticles are found in dispersed and aggregated forms within the cell cytoplasm and provide anatomic labeling information, but their uptake is nonspecific for malignant cells. The anti-EGFR antibody conjugated nanoparticles specifically and homogeneously bind to the surface of the cancer type cells with 600% greater affinity than to the noncancerous cells. This specific and homogeneous binding is found to give a relatively sharper SPR absorption band with a red shifted maximum compared to that observed when added to the noncancerous cells. These results suggest that SPR scattering imaging or SPR absorption spectroscopy generated from antibody conjugated gold nanoparticles can be useful in molecular biosensor techniques for the diagnosis and investigation of oral epithelial living cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.

The power generation of the pyramid-featured device far surpassed that exhibited by the unstructured films and gave an output voltage of up to 18 Vat a current density of similar to 0.13 mu A/cm(2). Furthermore, the as-prepared nanogenerator can be applied as a self-powered pressure sensor for sensing a water droplet (8 mg, similar to 3.6 Pa in contact pressure) and a falling feather (20 mg, Pa in contact pressure) with a low-end detection limit of similar to 13 mPa.

Despite extensive research efforts, there are still many fundamental challenges in using lithium metal in lithium-ion batteries. Most notably, critical information such as its nucleation and growth behaviour remains elusive. Here we explore the nucleation pattern of lithium on various metal substrates and unravel a substrate-dependent growth phenomenon that enables selective deposition of lithium metal. With the aid of binary phase diagrams, we find that no nucleation barriers are present for metals exhibiting a definite solubility in lithium, whereas appreciable nucleation barriers exist for metals with negligible solubility. We thereafter design a nanocapsule structure for lithium metal anodes consisting of hollow carbon spheres with nanoparticle seeds inside. During deposition, the lithium metal is found to predominantly grow inside the hollow carbon spheres. Such selective deposition and stable encapsulation of lithium metal eliminate dendrite formation and enable improved cycling, even in corrosive alkyl carbonate electrolytes, with 98% coulombic efficiency for more than 300 cycles.

Newly implemented fabrication technologies consist of pre-treatment of the working photoelectrode by TiCl4, variations in layer thickness of the transparent nanocrystalline-TiO2 and applying a topcoat light-scattering layer as well as the adhesion of an anti-reflecting film to the electrode's surface. TiCl4 treatments induce improvements in the adhesion and mechanical strength of the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer. Optimization of the thickness of the TiO2 layer, acting as the working electrode, affects both the photocurrent and the photovoltage of the devices. Covering of the TiO2 photoanode by an anti-reflecting film results in enhancement of the photocurrent.

A t value between 0.8 and 1.0 is favorable for cubic perovskite structure, and larger (>1) or smaller (<0.8) values of tolerance factor usually result in nonperovskite structures. CH(NH2)(2)PbI3 (FAPbI(3)) can exist in the perovskite a-phase (black phase) with good photovoltaic properties. However, it has a large tolerance factor and is more stable in the hexagonal delta(H)-phase (yellow phase), with delta(H)-to-alpha phase-transition temperature higher than room temperature. On the other hand, CsPbI3 is stabilized to an orthorhombic structure (delta(o)-phase) at room temperature due to its small tolerance factor. We find that, by alloying FAPbI(3) with CsPbI3, the effective tolerance factor can be tuned, and the stability of the photo active a-phase of the mixed solid-state perovskite alloys FA(1-x)C(sx)bI(3) is enhanced, which is in agreement with our first-principles calculations. Thin films of the FA(0.85)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) perovskite alloy demonstrate much improved stability in a high-humidity environment; this contrasts significantly with the pure FAPbI(3) film for which the alpha-to-delta(H) phase transition (associated with yellowing appearance) is accelerated by humidity environment. Due to phase stabilization, the FA(0.86)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) solid-state alloy showed better solar cell performance and device stability than its FAPbI(3) counterparts. Our studies suggest that tuning the tolerance factor through solidstate alloying can be a general strategy to stabilize the desired perovskite structure for solar cell applications.

Recent inventions of several tough hydrogels show their potential as structural biomaterials, such as cartilage. Any given application, however, requires a combination of mechanical properties including stiffness, strength, toughness, damping, fatigue resistance and self-healing, along with biocompatibility. This combination is rarely realized. Here, we report that polyampholytes, polymers bearing randomly dispersed cationic and anionic repeat groups, form tough and viscoelastic hydrogels with multiple mechanical properties. The randomness makes ionic bonds of a wide distribution of strength. The strong bonds serve as permanent crosslinks, imparting elasticity, whereas the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. These physical hydrogels of supramolecular structure can be tuned to change multiple mechanical properties over wide ranges by using diverse ionic combinations. This polyampholyte approach is synthetically simple and dramatically increases the choice of tough hydrogels for applications.

Native point defects in ZnO	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We have performed a comprehensive first-principles investigation of native point defects in ZnO based on density functional theory within the local density approximation (LDA) as well as the LDA+U approach for overcoming the band-gap problem. Oxygen deficiency, manifested in the form of oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials, has long been invoked as the source of the commonly observed unintentional n-type conductivity in ZnO. However, contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find that native point defects are very unlikely to be the cause of unintentional n-type conductivity. Oxygen vacancies, which have most often been cited as the cause of unintentional doping, are deep rather than shallow donors and have high formation energies in n-type ZnO (and are therefore unlikely to form). Zinc interstitials are shallow donors, but they also have high formation energies in n-type ZnO and are fast diffusers with migration barriers as low as 0.57 eV; they are therefore unlikely to be stable. Zinc antisites are also shallow donors but their high formation energies (even in Zn-rich conditions) render them unlikely to be stable under equilibrium conditions. We have, however, identified a different low-energy atomic configuration for zinc antisites that may play a role under nonequilibrium conditions such as irradiation. Zinc vacancies are deep acceptors and probably related to the frequently observed green luminescence; they act as compensating centers in n-type ZnO. Oxygen interstitials have high formation energies; they can occur as electrically neutral split interstitials in semi-insulating and p-type materials or as deep acceptors at octahedral interstitial sites in n-type ZnO. Oxygen antisites have very high formation energies and are unlikely to exist in measurable concentrations under equilibrium conditions. Based on our results for migration energy barriers, we calculate activation energies for self-diffusion and estimate defect-annealing temperatures. Our results provide a guide to more refined experimental studies of point defects in ZnO and their influence on the control of p-type doping.

It contains a number of modern quantum chemical methods for studies of the electronic structure in ground and excited electronic states. A macromolecular environment can be modeled by a combination of quantum chemistry and molecular mechanics. It is further possible to describe a crystalline material using model potentials. Solvent effects can be treated using continuum models or by combining quantum chemical calculations with molecular dynamics or Monte-Carlo simulations. MOLCAS is especially adapted to treat systems with a complex electronic structure, where the simplest quantum chemical models do not work. These features together with the inclusion of relativistic effects makes it possible to treat with good accuracy systems including atoms from the entire periodic system. MOLCAS has effective methods for geometry optimization of equilibria, transition states, conical intersections, etc. This facilitates studies of excited state energy surfaces, spectroscopy, and photochemical processes.

Recent studies have proven that the carbon materials doped with the elements, which have the larger (N) or smaller (P, B) electronegative atoms than carbon such as N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs), P-doped graphite layers and B-doped CNTs, have also shown pronounced catalytic activity. Herein, we find that the graphenes doped with the elements, which have the similar electronegativity with carbon such as sulfur and selenium, can also exhibit better catalytic activity than the commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, indicating that these doped graphenes hold great potential far a substitute for Pt-based catalysts in FCs. The experimental results are believed to be significant because they not only give further insight Into the ORR mechanism of these metal-free doped carbon materials, but also open a way to fabricate other new low-cost NPMCs with high electrocatalytic activity by a simple, economical, and scalable approach for real FC applications.					zhou, xuemei/AGF-4466-2022; chen, xi'an/N-8232-2018; Huang, Shaoming/AAY-2942-2021; Yang, Zhi/ABD-3925-2021	huang, shaoming/0000-0003-0242-1143													1936-0851	1936-086X				JAN	2012	6	1					205	211		10.1021/nn203393d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn203393d								22201338					WOS:000299368300026

Furthermore, computer graphics is also an indispensable tool in analysing computed data and facilitates interpretation of results. In this context XCrySDen (http://www.xcrysden.org/) is presented, a crystalline- and molecular-structure visualisation program, which aims at display of isosurfaces and contours, which can be superimposed on crystalline structures and interactively rotated and manipulated. Another aspect of computer utilisation in simulations that takes advantage of the computer's graphics capabilities, is that it provides intuitive graphical user interfaces for the simulation setup.

Hydrogels with tunable stress relaxation regulate stem cell fate and activity	NATURE MATERIALS												Natural extracellular matrices (ECMs) are viscoelastic and exhibit stress relaxation. However, hydrogels used as synthetic ECMs for three-dimensional (3D) culture are typically elastic. Here, we report a materials approach to tune the rate of stress relaxation of hydrogels for 3D culture, independently of the hydrogel's initial elastic modulus, degradation, and cell-adhesion-ligand density. We find that cell spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are all enhanced in cells cultured in gels with faster relaxation. Strikingly, MSCs form a mineralized, collagen-1-rich matrix similar to bone in rapidly relaxing hydrogels with an initial elastic modulus of 17 kPa. We also show that the effects of stress relaxation are mediated by adhesion-ligand binding, actomyosin contractility and mechanical clustering of adhesion ligands. Our findings highlight stress relaxation as a key characteristic of cell-ECM interactions and as an important design parameter of biomaterials for cell culture.

Although, for example, the control of freely propagating waves (PWs; refs 1-6) and surface waves (SWs; refs 7-10) has separately become possible using transformation optics and metamaterials, a bridge linking both propagation types has not yet been found. Such a device has particular relevance given the many schemes of controlling electromagnetic waves at surfaces and interfaces, leading to trapped rainbows(11,12), lensing(13-16), beam bending(17), deflection(18-20), and even anomalous reflection/refraction(21,22). Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that a specific gradient-index meta-surface can convert a PW to a SW with nearly 100% efficiency. Distinct from conventional devices such as prism(23) or grating(24-26) couplers, the momentum mismatch between PW and SW is compensated by the reflection-phase gradient of the meta-surface, and a nearly perfect PW-SW conversion can happen for any incidence angle larger than a critical value. Experiments in the microwave region, including both far-field and near-field characterizations, are in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Our findings may pave the way for many applications, including high-efficiency surface plasmon couplers, anti-reflection surfaces, light absorbers, and so on.

J	Shrout, TR; Zhang, SJ				Shrout, Thomas R.; Zhang, Shujun J.			Lead-free piezoelectric ceramics: Alternatives for PZT?	JOURNAL OF ELECTROCERAMICS												Investigations in the development of lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have recently claimed comparable properties to the lead-based ferroelectric perovskites, represented by Pb(Zr,Ti)O-3, or PZT. In this work, the scientific and technical impact of these materials is contrasted with the various families of "soft" and "hard" PZTs. On the scientific front, the intrinsic nature of the dielectric and piezoelectric properties are presented in relation to their respective Curie temperatures (T-C) and the existence of a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Analogous to PZT, enhanced properties are noted for MPB compositions in the (Na,Bi)TiO3-BaTiO3 and ternary system with (K,Bi)TiO3, but offer properties significantly lower. The consequences of a ferroelectric to antiferroelectric transition well below T (C) further limits their usefulness. Though comparable with respect to T (C), the high levels of piezoelectricity reported in the (K,Na)NbO3 family are the result of enhanced polarizability associated with the orthorhombic-tetragonal polymorphic phase transition being compositionally shifted downward. As expected, the properties are strongly temperature dependent, while degradation occurs through the thermal cycling between the two distinct ferroelectric domain states. Extrinsic contributions arising from domains and domain wall mobility were determined using high field strain and polarization measurements. The concept of "soft" and "hard" lead-free piezoelectrics were discussed in relation to donor and acceptor modified PZTs, respectively. Technologically, the lead-free materials are discussed in relation to general applications, including sensors, actuators and ultrasound transducers.

J	Öner, D; McCarthy, TJ				Öner, D; McCarthy, TJ			Ultrahydrophobic surfaces.: Effects of topography length scales on wettability	LANGMUIR												We discuss dynamic hydrophobicity from the perspective of the force required to move a water droplet on a surface and argue that the structure of the three-phase contact line is important. We studied the wettability of a series of silicon surfaces that were prepared by photolithography and hydrophobized using silanization reagents. Hydrocarbon, siloxane, and fluorocarbon surfaces were prepared. The surfaces contain posts of different sizes, shapes, and separations. Surfaces containing square posts with X-Y dimensions of 32 mu m and less exhibited ultrahydrophobic behavior with high advancing and receding water contact angles. Water droplets moved very easily on these surfaces and rolled off of slightly tilted surfaces. Contact angles were independent of the post height from 20 to 140 mu m and independent of surface chemistry. Water droplets were pinned on surfaces containing square posts with larger dimensions. Increasing the distance between posts and changing the shape of the posts from square to staggered rhombus, star, or indented square caused increases in receding contact angles. We ascribe these contact angle increases to decreases in the contact length and increases in tortuosity of the three-phase contact line. The maximum length scale of roughness that imparts ultrahydrophobicity is similar to 32 mu m.																			0743-7463					OCT 3	2000	16	20					7777	7782		10.1021/la000598o	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la000598o													WOS:000089728700037

These micro- and nanostructures provide a sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity and yet at the same time a high adhesive force with water. A water droplet on the surface of the petal appears spherical in shape, which cannot roll off even when the petal is turned upside down. We define this phenomenon as the "petal effect" as compared with the popular "lotus effect". Artificial fabrication of biomimic polymer films, with well-defined nanoembossed structures obtained by duplicating the petal's surface, indicates that the superhydrophobic surface and the adhesive petal are in Cassie impregnating wetting state.

The desired three-dimensional mesoporous architecture of RuO2 center dot xH(2)O nanotubular arrayed electrodes with annealing in air at 200 degrees C for 2 h simultaneously maintained the facility of electrolyte penetration, the ease of proton exchange/ diffusion, and the metallic conductivity of crystalline RuO2, exhibiting unexpectedly ultrahigh power characteristics with its frequency "knee" reaching ca. 4.0-7.8 kHz, 20-40 times better than that of RuO2 single crystalline, arrayed nanorods. The specific power and specific energy of annealed RuO2 center dot xH(2)O nanotubes measured at 0.8 V and 4 kHz is equal to 4320 kW kg(-1) and 7.5 W h kg(-1), respectively, demonstrating the characteristics of next generation supercapacitors.

However, the frequently discussed cost advantage of sodium-ion batteries has, so far, not been examined in detail. In this Perspective, we use the Battery Performance and Cost (BatPaC) model to undertake a cost analysis of the materials for sodium-ion and lithium-ion cells, as well as complete batteries, and determine the effect of exchanging lithium with sodium, as well as the effect of replacing the material used for the anode current collector foil, on the cost. Moreover, we compare the calculated production costs of exemplary sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries and highlight the most relevant parameters for optimization. Finally, the major raw materials for lithium-ion cathodes are examined in terms of potential supply risks because supply issues may lead to increased costs. Through the use of a scenario-based supply and demand analysis, the risks to the supply of lithium and cobalt are assessed, and implications for battery research are discussed. Overall, we provide a broad and interdisciplinary perspective on modern batteries and future directions for this field, with a focus on sodium-ion batteries.

Ruddlesden-Popper Hybrid Lead Iodide Perovskite 2D Homologous Semiconductors	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												The hybrid two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites have recently drawn significant interest because they can serve as excellent photoabsorbers in perovskite solar cells. Here we present the large scale synthesis, crystal structure, and optical characterization of the 2D (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NR3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, infinity) perovskites, a family of layered compounds with tunable semiconductor characteristics. These materials consist of well-defined inorganic perovskite layers intercalated with bulky butylammonium cations that act as spacers between these fragments, adopting the crystal structure of the Ruddlesden-Popper type. We find that the perovskite thickness (n) can be synthetically controlled by adjusting the ratio between the spacer cation and the small organic cation, thus allowing the isolation of compounds in pure form and large scale. The orthorhombic crystal structures of (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)-Pb2I7 (n = 2, Cc2m; a = 8.9470(4), b = 39.347(2) angstrom, c = 8.8589(6)), (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(2)Pb3I10 (n = 3, C2cb; a = 8.9275(6), b = 51.959(4) angstrom, c = 8.8777(6)), and (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(3)Pb4I13 (n = 4, Cc2m; a = 8.9274(4), b = 64.383(4) angstrom, c = 8.8816(4)) have been solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and are reported here for the first time. The compounds are noncentrosymmetric, as supported by measurements of the nonlinear optical properties of the compounds and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The band gaps of the series change progressively between 2.43 eV for the n = 1 member to 1.50 eV for the n = infinity adopting intermediate values of 2.17 eV (n = 2), 2.03 eV (n = 3), and 1.91 eV (n = 4) for those between the two compositional extrema. DFT calculations confirm this experimental trend and predict a direct band gap for all the members of the Ruddlesden Popper series. The estimated effective masses have values of m(h) = 0.14 m(0) and m(e) = 0.08 m(0) for holes and electrons, respectively, and are found to be nearly composition independent. The band gaps of higher n members indicate that these compounds can be used as efficient light absorbers in solar cells, which offer better solution processability and good environmental stability. The compounds exhibit intense room-temperature photoluminescence with emission wavelengths consistent with their energy gaps, 2.35 eV (n = 1), 2.12 eV (n = 2), 2.01 eV (n = 3), and 1.90 eV (n = 4) and point to their potential use in light-emitting diodes. In addition, owing to the low dimensionality and the difference in dielectric properties between the organic spacers and the inorganic perovskite layers, these compounds are naturally occurring multiple quantum well structures, which give rise to stable excitons at room temperature.					, Kanatzidis/ABH-7936-2022; Rondinelli, James/A-2071-2009; Hupp, Joseph/K-8844-2012; Young, Joshua/M-8282-2017; Stoumpos, Constantinos/P-6677-2016	Young, Joshua/0000-0001-8102-751X; Stoumpos, Constantinos/0000-0001-8396-9578													0897-4756	1520-5002				APR 26	2016	28	8					2852	2867		10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00847													WOS:000375244500043

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in such conversions, having applications in water splitting and metal-air batteries. Here, we report ultrathin metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as promising electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline conditions. Our as-prepared ultrathin NiCo bimetal-organic framework nanosheets on glassy-carbon electrodes require an overpotential of 250 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When the MOF nanosheets are loaded on copper foam, this decreases to 189 mV. We propose that the surface atoms in the ultrathin MOF sheets are coordinatively unsaturated-that is, they have open sites for adsorption-as evidenced by a suite of measurements, including X-ray spectroscopy and density-functional theory calculations. The findings suggest that the coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms are the dominating active centres and the coupling effect between Ni and Co metals is crucial for tuning the electrocatalytic activity.

Stratasys Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a typical RP process that can fabricate prototypes out of ABS plastic. To predict the mechanical behavior of FDM parts, it is critical to understand the material properties of the raw FDM process material, and the effect that FDM build parameters have on anisotropic material properties. This paper characterizes the properties of ABS parts fabricated by the FDM 1650. Using a Design of Experiment (DOE) approach, the process parameters of FDM, such as raster orientation, air gap, bead width, color, and model temperature were examined. Tensile strengths and compressive strengths of directionally fabricated specimens were measured and compared with injection molded FDM ABS P400 material, For the FDM parts made with a 0.003 inch overlap between roads, the typical tensile strength ranged between 65 and 72 percent of the strength of injection molded ABS P400. The compressive strength ranged from 80 to 90 percent of the injection molded FDM ABS. Several build rules for designing FDM parts were formulated based on experimental results.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) was recently found to exhibit indirect-to-direct gap transition when the thickness is reduced to a single monolayer. Emerging photoluminescence (PL) from monolayer MoS2 opens up opportunities for a range of novel optoelectronic applications of the material. Here we report differential reflectance and PL spectra of mono- to few-layer WS2 and WSe2 that indicate that the band structure of these materials undergoes similar indirect-to-direct gap transition when thinned to a single monolayer. The transition is evidenced by distinctly enhanced PL peak centered at 630 and 750 nm in monolayer WS2 and WSe2, respectively. Few-layer flakes are found to exhibit comparatively strong indirect gap emission along with direct gap hot electron emission, suggesting high quality of synthetic crystals prepared by a chemical vapor transport method. Fine absorption and emission features and their thickness dependence suggest a strong effect of Se p-orbitals on the d electron band structure as well as interlayer coupling in WSe2.

J	Kokubo, T; Kim, HM; Kawashita, M				Kokubo, T; Kim, HM; Kawashita, M			Novel bioactive materials with different mechanical properties	BIOMATERIALS												Some ceramics, such as Bioglass((R)), sintered hydroxyapatite, and glass-ceramic A-W, spontaneously bond to living bone. They are called bioactive materials and are already clinically used as important bone substitutes. However, compared with human cortical bone, they have lower fracture toughness and higher elastic moduli. Therefore, it is desirable to develop bioactive materials with improved mechanical properties. All the bioactive materials mentioned above form a bone-like apatite layer on their surfaces in the living body, and bond to bone through this apatite layer. The formation of bone-like apatite on artificial material is induced by functional groups, such as Si-OH, Ti-OH, Zr-OH, Nb-OH, Ta-OH, -COOH, and PO4H2. These groups have specific structures revealing negatively charge, and induce apatite formation via formations of an amorphous calcium compound, e.g., calcium silicate, calcium titanate, and amorphous calcium phosphate. These fundamental findings provide methods for preparing new bioactive materials with different mechanical properties. Tough bioactive materials can be prepared by the chemical treatment of metals and ceramics that have high fracture toughness, e.g., by the NaOH and heat treatments of titanium metal, titanium alloys, and tantalum metal, and by H3PO4 treatment of tetragonal zirconia. Soft bioactive materials can be synthesized by the sol-gel process, in which the bioactive silica or titania is polymerized with a flexible polymer, such as polydimethylsiloxane or polytetramethyloxide, at the molecular level to form an inorganic-organic nano-hybrid. The biomimetic process has been used to deposit nano-sized bone-like apatite on fine polymer fibers, which were textured into a three-dimensional knit framework. This strategy is expected to ultimately lead to bioactive composites that have a bone-like structure and, hence, bone-like mechanical properties. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A sharp resonance of nearly perfect transmission can arise within a broad absorption profile. These features show remarkable potential for slow light, novel sensors and low-loss metamaterials. In nanophotonics, plasmonic structures enable large field strengths within small mode volumes. Therefore, combining EIT with nanoplasmonics would pave the way towards ultracompact sensors with extremely high sensitivity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a nanoplasmonic analogue of EIT using a stacked optical metamaterial. A dipole antenna with a large radiatively broadened linewidth is coupled to an underlying quadrupole antenna, of which the narrow linewidth is solely limited by the fundamental non-radiative Drude damping. In accordance with EIT theory, we achieve a very narrow transparency window with high modulation depth owing to nearly complete suppression of radiative losses.

For example, experimental evidence for ZnO with an excess of Zn is inconclusive as to whether the dominant defects are metal interstitials or oxygen vacancies. This information is essential to understand the behavior of the material and to tailor its numerous technological applications. We use the first-principles pseudopotential method to determine the electronic structure, atomic geometry, and formation energy of native point defects in ZnO. Interstitials, vacancies, and antisites in their relevant charge states are considered and the effects of dopants are also discussed. The results show that both the Zn and O vacancies are the relevant defects in ZnO. We also propose a possible transition mechanism and defect center responsible for the experimentally observed green luminescence.

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to breaking the in-plane symmetry of graphene with electric fields on AB-stacked bilayers(1,2) or stacked van der Waals heterostructures(3,4). In contrast, transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers are semiconductors with intrinsic in-plane asymmetry, leading to direct electronic bandgaps, distinctive optical properties and great potential in optoelectronics(5,6). Apart from their in-plane inversion asymmetry, an additional degree of freedom allowing spin manipulation can be induced by breaking the out-of-plane mirror symmetry with external electric fields(7,8) or, as theoretically proposed, with an asymmetric out-of-plane structural configuration(9). Here, we report a synthetic strategy to grow Janus monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides breaking the out-of-plane structural symmetry. In particular, based on a MoS2 monolayer, we fully replace the top-layer S with Se atoms. We confirm the Janus structure of MoSSe directly by means of scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and prove the existence of vertical dipoles by second harmonic generation and piezoresponse force microscopy measurements.

Sluggish diffusion in Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni high-entropy alloys	ACTA MATERIALIA												Sluggish diffusion kinetics is an important contributor to the outstanding properties of high-entropy alloys. However, the diffusion kinetics in high-entropy alloys has never been probed directly. Here, the diffusion couple method was used to measure the diffusion parameters of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni in ideal-solution-like Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni alloys. These parameters were compared with those in various conventional face-centered cubic metals. The results show that the diffusion coefficients in the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni alloys are indeed lower than those in the reference metals. Correspondingly, the activation energies in the high-entropy alloys are higher than those in the reference metals. Moreover, the trend of the normalized activation energy is positively related to the number of composing elements in the matrix. A quasi-chemical model is proposed to analyze the fluctuation of lattice potential energy in different matrices and to explain the observed trend in activation energies. Greater fluctuation of lattice potential energy produces more significant atomic traps and blocks, leading to higher activation energies, and thus accounts for the sluggish diffusion in high-entropy alloys.

J	Miller, RE; Shenoy, VB				Miller, RE; Shenoy, VB			Size-dependent elastic properties of nanosized structural elements	NANOTECHNOLOGY												Effective stiffness properties (D) of nanosized structural elements such as plates and beams differ from those predicted by standard continuum mechanics (D-c). These differences (D - D-c)/D-c depend on the size of the structural element. A simple model is constructed to predict this size dependence of the effective properties. The important length scale in the problem is identified to be the ratio of the surface elastic modulus to the elastic modulus of the bulk. In general, the non-dimensional difference in the elastic properties from continuum predictions (D - D-c)/D-c is found to scale as alpha S/Eh, where alpha is a constant which depends on the geometry of the structural element considered, S is a surface elastic constant, E is a bulk elastic modulus and h a length defining the size of the structural element. Thus, the quantity S/E is identified as a material length scale for elasticity of nanosized structures. The model is compared with direct atomistic simulations of nanoscale structures using the embedded atom method for FCC A1 and the Stillinger-Weber model of Si. Excellent agreement between the simulations and the model is found.

For this reason surface roughness has been the subject of experimental and theoretical investigations for many decades. The real surface geometry is so complicated that a finite number of parameters cannot provide a full description. If the number of parameters used is increased, a more accurate description can be obtained. This is one of the reasons for introducing new parameters for surface evaluation. Surface roughness parameters are normally categorised into three groups according to its functionality. These groups are defined as amplitude parameters, spacing parameters, and hybrid parameters. This paper illustrates the definitions and the mathematical formulae for about 59 of the roughness parameters. This collection of surface roughness parameter was used in a new software computer vision package called Surf Vision developed by the authors. In the package, these definitions were extended to calculate the 3D surface topography of different specimens. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of mean pore size on cell attachment, proliferation and migration in collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffolds for bone tissue engineering	BIOMATERIALS												In the literature there are conflicting reports on the optimal scaffold mean pore size required for successful bone tissue engineering. This study set out to investigate the effect of mean pore size, in a series of collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffolds with mean pore sizes ranging from 85 mu m to 325 mu m, on osteoblast adhesion and early stage proliferation up to 7 days post-seeding. The results show that cell number was highest in scaffolds with the largest pore size of 325 mu m. However, an early additional peak in cell number was also seen in scaffolds with a mean pore size of 120 mu m at time points up to 48 h post-seeding. This is consistent with previous studies from our laboratory which suggest that scaffold specific surface area plays an important role on initial cell adhesion. This early peak disappears following cell proliferation indicating that while specific surface area may be important for initial cell adhesion, improved cell migration provided by scaffolds with pores above 300 mu m overcomes this effect. An added advantage of the larger pores is a reduction in cell aggregations that develop along the edges of the scaffolds. Ultimately scaffolds with a mean pore size of 325 mu m were deemed optimal for bone tissue engineering. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bartók, AP; Kondor, R; Csányi, G				Bartok, Albert P.; Kondor, Risi; Csanyi, Gabor			On representing chemical environments	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighborhood environments, and analyze their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.

Based on the relative dimensions of the shell thickness and core radius, nanoshells may be designed to scatter and/or absorb light over a broad spectral range including the near-infrared (NIR), a wavelength region that provides maximal penetration of light through tissue. The ability to control both wave length-dependent scattering and absorption of nanoshells offers the opportunity to design nanoshells which provide, in a single nanoparticle, both diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Here, we demonstrate a novel nanoshell-based all-optical platform technology for integrating cancer imaging and therapy applications. Immunotargeted nanoshells are engineered to both scatter light in the NIR enabling optical molecular cancer imaging and to absorb light, allowing selective destruction of targeted carcinoma cells through photothermal therapy.

However, the acoustic analogue to electromagnetic metamaterials has, so far, not been investigated. We report a new class of ultrasonic metamaterials consisting of an array of subwavelength Helmholtz resonators with designed acoustic inductance and capacitance. These materials have an effective dynamic modulus with negative values near the resonance frequency. As a result, these ultrasonic metamaterials can convey acoustic waves with a group velocity antiparallel to phase velocity, as observed experimentally. On the basis of homogenized-media theory, we calculated the dispersion and transmission, which agrees well with experiments near 30 kHz. As the negative dynamic modulus leads to a richness of surface states with very large wavevectors, this new class of acoustic metamaterials may offer interesting applications, such as acoustic negative refraction and superlensing below the diffraction limit.

For use in practical applications, a Si electrode must have high capacity, long cycle life, high efficiency, and the fabrication must be industrially scalable. Here, we design and fabricate a yolk-shell structure to meet all these needs. The fabrication is carried out without special equipment and mostly at room temperature. Commercially available Si nanoparticles are completely sealed inside conformal, thin, self-supporting carbon shells, with rationally designed void space in between the particles and the shell. The well-defined void space allows the Si particles to expand freely without breaking the outer carbon shell, therefore stabilizing the solid-electrolyte interphase on the shell surface. High capacity (similar to 2800 mAh/g at C/10), long cycle life (1000 cycles with 74% capacity retention), and high Coulombic efficiency (99.84%) have been realized in this yolk-shell structured Si electrode.

The HCNWs used as anode material for Na-ion batteries deliver a high reversible capacity of 251 mAh g(-1) and 82.2% capacity retention over 400 charge-discharge cycles between 1.2 and 0.01 V (vs Na'/Na) at a constant current of 50 mA g(-1) (0.2 C). Excellent cycling stability is also observed at an even higher charge-discharge rate. A high reversible capacity of 149 rnAh g(-1) also can be obtained at a current rate of 500 rnA g(-1) (2C). The good Na-ion insertion property is attributed to the short diffusion distance in the HCNWIs and the large interlayer distance (0.37 nm) between the graphitic sheets, which agrees with the interlayered distance predicted by theoretical calculations to enable Na-ion insertion in carbon materials.

COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING					Annual Meeting of the American-Institute-of-Chemical-Engineers	NOV 03-08, 2002	INDIANAPOLIS, IN	Amer Inst Chem Engn				Natural fibers are emerging as low cost, lightweight and apparently environmentally superior alternatives to glass fibers in composites. We review select comparative life cycle assessment studies of natural fiber and glass fiber composites, and identify key drivers of their relative environmental performance. Natural fiber composites are likely to be environmentally superior to glass fiber composites in most cases for the following reasons: (1) natural fiber production has lower environmental impacts compared to glass fiber production; (2) natural fiber composites have higher fiber content for equivalent performance, reducing more polluting base polymer content; (3) the light-weight natural fiber composites improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions in the use phase of the component, especially in auto applications; and (4) end of life incineration of natural fibers results in recovered energy and carbon credits.

J	Souza, I; Marzari, N; Vanderbilt, D				Souza, I; Marzari, N; Vanderbilt, D			Maximally localized Wannier functions for entangled energy bands	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We present a method for obtaining well-localized Wannier-like functions (WF's) for energy bands that are attached to or mixed with other bands. The present scheme removes the limitation of the usual maximally localized WF's method [N. Marzari and D. Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. B 56, 12 847 (1997)] that the bands of interest should form an isolated group, separated by gaps from higher and lower bands everywhere in the Brillouin zone. An energy window encompassing N bands of interest is specified by the user, and the algorithm then proceeds to disentangle these from the remaining bands inside the window by filtering out an optimally connected N-dimensional subspace. This is achieved by minimizing a functional that measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally localized WF's for the optimal subspace are then obtained via the algorithm of Marzari and Vanderbilt. The method, which functions as a postprocessing step using the output of conventional electronic-structure codes, is applied to the s and d bands of copper, and to the valence and low-lying conduction bands of silicon. For the low-lying nearly-free-electron bands of copper we find WF's which are centered at the tetrahedral-interstitial sites, suggesting an alternative tight-binding parametrization.

However, compared to the best-performing device, the average efficiency was as low as 12%, with a large standard deviation (s.d.). Here, we report perovskite solar cells with an average efficiency exceeding 16% and best efficiency of 17%. This was enabled by the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 cuboids with a controlled size via a two-step spin-coating procedure. Spin-coating of a solution of CH3NH3I with different concentrations follows the spin-coating of PbI2, and the cuboid size of CH3NH3PbI3 is found to strongly depend on the concentration of CH3NH3I. Light-harvesting efficiency and charge-carrier extraction are significantly affected by the cuboid size. Under simulated one-sun illumination, average efficiencies of 16.4% (s.d. +/- 0.35), 16.3% (s.d. +/- 0.44) and 13.5% (s.d. +/- 0.34) are obtained from solutions of CH3NH3I with concentrations of 0.038 M, 0.050 M and 0.063 M, respectively. By controlling the size of the cuboids of CH3NH3PbI3 during their growth, we achieved the best efficiency of 17.01% with a photocurrent density of 21.64 mA cm(-2), open-circuit photovoltage of 1.056 V and fill factor of 0.741.

Mixed SAMs presenting different functional groups were prepared for screening using a synthetic protocol based on the reaction of organic amines with a SAM terminated by interchain carboxylic anhydride groups. Surfaces that presented derivatives of oligo(sarcosine), N-acetylpiperazine, and permethylated sorbitol groups were particularly effective in resisting the adsorption of proteins. Incorporation of these groups into single-component SAMs resulted in surfaces that are comparable to (but slightly less good than) single-component SAMs that present oligo(ethylene glycol) in their ability to resist the adsorption of proteins. In the group of surfaces examined, those that resisted the adsorption of proteins had the following properties: they were hydrophilic; they contained groups that were hydrogen-bond acceptors but not hydrogen-bond donors; and they were overall electrically neutral.																			0743-7463					SEP 4	2001	17	18					5605	5620		10.1021/la010384m	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la010384m													WOS:000170746800029

However, to date, there has been little success in the development of high-performance solid-state batteries using these exceptional materials, the major challenge being the high solid-solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and electrode materials. In this work, we effectively address the large interfacial impedance between a lithium metal anode and the garnet electrolyte using ultrathin aluminium oxide (Al2O3) by atomic layer deposition. Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLCZN) is the garnet composition of choice in this work due to its reduced sintering temperature and increased lithium ion conductivity. A significant decrease of interfacial impedance, from 1,710 Omega cm(2) to 1 Omega cm(2), was observed at room temperature, effectively negating the lithium metal/garnet interfacial impedance. Experimental and computational results reveal that the oxide coating enables wetting of metallic lithium in contact with the garnet electrolyte surface and the lithiated-alumina interface allows effective lithium ion transport between the lithium metal anode and garnet electrolyte. We also demonstrate a working cell with a lithium metal anode, garnet electrolyte and a high-voltage cathode by applying the newly developed interface chemistry.

The synthesis involves the co-electrodeposition of a bimetallic (Ni, Co) hydroxide precursor on a Ni foam support and subsequent thermal transformation to spinel mesoporous NiCo2O4. The as-prepared ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets with the thickness of a few nanometers possess many interparticle mesopores with a size range from 2 to 5 nm. The nickel foam supported ultrathin mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets promise fast electron and ion transport, large electroactive surface area, and excellent structural stability. As a result, superior pseudocapacitive performance is achieved with an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1450 F g(-1), even at a very high current density of 20 A g(-1), and excellent cycling performance at high rates, suggesting its promising application as an efficient electrode for electrochemical capacitors.

The model exhibits a carbon network consisting of two kinds of regions (of trans linked cyclohexane chairs and ribbons of flat hexagons with C=C double bonds) and functional groups such as tertiary OH, 1,3-ether, ketone, quinone, and phenol (aromatic diol).

The replacement of phosphorescent metal complexes with inexpensive organic compounds in electroluminescent (EL) devices that demonstrate comparable performance metrics is paradigm shifting, as these new materials offer the possibility of developing low-cost lighting and displays. Here, a comprehensive review of TADF materials is presented, with a focus on linking their optoelectronic behavior with the performance of the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and related EL devices. TADF emitters are cross-compared within specific color ranges, with a focus on blue, green-yellow, orange-red, and white OLEDs. Organic small-molecule, dendrimer, polymer, and exciplex emitters are all discussed within this review, as is their use as host materials. Correlations are provided between the structure of the TADF materials and their optoelectronic properties. The success of TADF materials has ushered in the next generation of OLEDs.

Some ZnO nanoparticles exhibit very strong blue emissions, the intensity of which first increase and then decrease with annealing. These visible emissions exhibit strong and interesting excitation dependences: 1) the optimal excitation energy for blue emissions is near the bandgap energy, but the effective excitation can obviously be lower, even 420 nm (2.95 eV < E-g = 3.26 eV); in contrast, green emissions can be excited only by energies larger than the bandgap energy; and, 2) there are several fixed emitting wavelengths at 415, 440, 455 and 488 nm in the blue wave band, which exhibit considerable stability in different excitation and annealing conditions. Mechanisms for blue emissions from ZnO are proposed with interstitial-zinc-related defect levels as initial states. EPR spectra reveal the predominance of interstitial zinc in as-prepared samples, and the evolutions of coexisting interstitial zinc and oxygen vacancies with annealing. Furthermore, good controllability of visible emissions is achieved, including the co-emission of blue and green emissions and peak adjustment from blue to yellow.

Catalysts and Reaction Pathways for the Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS												The electrochemical reduction of CO2 has gained significant interest recently as it has the potential to trigger a sustainable solar-fuel-based economy. In this Perspective, we highlight several heterogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 and discuss the reaction pathways through which they form various products. Among those, copper is a unique catalyst as it yields hydrocarbon products, mostly methane, ethylene, and ethanol, with acceptable efficiencies. As a result, substantial effort has been invested to determine the special catalytic properties of copper and to elucidate the mechanism through which hydrocarbons are formed. These mechanistic insights, together with mechanistic insights of CO2 reduction on other metals and molecular complexes, can provide crucial guidelines for the design of future catalyst materials able to efficiently and selectively reduce CO2 to useful products.

Biodegradable luminescent porous silicon nanoparticles for <i>in vivo</i> applications	NATURE MATERIALS												Nanomaterials that can circulate in the body hold great potential to diagnose and treat disease(1-4). For such applications, it is important that the nanomaterials be harmlessly eliminated from the body in a reasonable period of time after they carry out their diagnostic or therapeutic function. Despite efforts to improve their targeting efficiency, significant quantities of systemically administered nanomaterials are cleared by the mononuclear phagocytic system before finding their targets, increasing the likelihood of unintended acute or chronic toxicity. However, there has been little effort to engineer the self-destruction of errant nanoparticles into non-toxic, systemically eliminated products. Here, we present luminescent porous silicon nanoparticles (LPSiNPs) that can carry a drug payload and of which the intrinsic near-infrared photoluminescence enables monitoring of both accumulation and degradation in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to most optically active nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles and quantum dots), LPSiNPs self-destruct in a mouse model into renally cleared components in a relatively short period of time with no evidence of toxicity. As a preliminary in vivo application, we demonstrate tumour imaging using dextran-coated LPSiNPs (D-LPSiNPs). These results demonstrate a new type of multifunctional nanostructure with a low-toxicity degradation pathway for in vivo applications.

J	Wang, XD; Summers, CJ; Wang, ZL				Wang, XD; Summers, CJ; Wang, ZL			Large-scale hexagonal-patterned growth of aligned ZnO nanorods for nano-optoelectronics and nanosensor arrays	NANO LETTERS												An effective approach is demonstrated for growing large-area, hexagonally patterned, aligned ZnO nanorods. The synthesis uses a catalyst template produced by a self-assembled monolayer of submicron spheres and guided vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth on a single crystal alumina substrate. The ZnO nanorods have uniform shape and length, align vertically on the substrate, and are distributed according to the pattern defined by the catalyst template. The nanorods grow along [0001] with side surfaces defined by {2110}. This approach opens the possibility of creating patterned one-dimensional nanostructures for applications as sensor arrays, piezoelectric antenna arrays, optoelectronic devices, and interconnects.

Here, we report the controlled vapour phase synthesis of molybdenum disulphide atomic layers and elucidate a fundamental mechanism for the nucleation, growth, and grain boundary formation in its crystalline monolayers. Furthermore, a nucleation-controlled strategy is established to systematically promote the formation of large-area, single-and few-layered films. Using high-resolution electron microscopy imaging, the atomic structure and morphology of the grains and their boundaries in the polycrystalline molybdenum disulphide atomic layers are examined, and the primary mechanisms for grain boundary formation are evaluated. Grain boundaries consisting of 5- and 7- member rings are directly observed with atomic resolution, and their energy landscape is investigated via first-principles calculations. The uniformity in thickness, large grain sizes, and excellent electrical performance signify the high quality and scalable synthesis of the molybdenum disulphide atomic layers.

The Chemical and structural analysis of graphene oxide with different degrees of oxidation	CARBON												Graphene oxide (GO) with various degrees of oxidation was synthesized using a modified Hummers method. The formation of different types of oxygen containing functional groups in GO, and their influences on its structure were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), zeta potential analysis and Raman spectroscopy. XRD studies showed a disruption of the graphitic AS stacking order during the increase in oxidation levels. XPS analysis revealed the formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at lower oxidation levels and epoxide groups at higher oxidation levels. The influence of the oxidation degree on the properties of GO was evaluated by zeta potential analysis, which showed a linear increase in the zeta potential with increasing oxidation levels. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed that increasing oxidation levels results in a transition from a crystalline to an amorphous structure. The electrochemical properties of GO is highly influenced by the variation in degree of oxidation. Our results suggest that the properties of GO can be tuned by varying the oxidation degree, which may pave the way to new developments in the GO-based applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Supercapacitive electrode materials, which are closely related to the high-efficiency storage of energy, have provoked more interest. Herein, we present a high-capacity supercapacitor material based on the nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers synthesized by carbonization of macroscopic-scale carbonaceous nanofibers (CNFs) coated with polypyrrole (CNFs@polypyrrole) at an appropriate temperature. The composite nanofibers exhibit a reversible specific capacitance of 202.0 F g(-1) at the current density of 1.0 A g(-1) in 6.0 mol L-1 aqueous KOH electrolyte, meanwhile maintaining a high-class capacitance retention capability and a maximum power density of 89.57 kW kg(-1). This kind of nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber represents an alternative promising candidate for an efficient electrode material for supercapacitors.

J	Calcagnotto, M; Ponge, D; Demir, E; Raabe, D				Calcagnotto, Marion; Ponge, Dirk; Demir, Eralp; Raabe, Dierk			Orientation gradients and geometrically necessary dislocations in ultrafine grained dual-phase steels studied by 2D and 3D EBSD	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING												We study orientation gradients and geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) in two ultrafine grained dual-phase steels with different martensite particle size and volume fraction (24 vol.% and 38 vol.%). The steel with higher martensite fraction has a lower elastic limit, a higher yield strength and a higher tensile strength. These effects are attributed to the higher second phase fraction and the inhomogeneous transformation strain accommodation in ferrite. The latter assumption is analyzed using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). We quantify orientation gradients, pattern quality and GND density variations at ferrite-ferrite and ferrite-martensite interfaces. Using 3D EBSD, additional information is obtained about the effect of grain volume and of martensite distribution on strain accommodation. Two methods are demonstrated to calculate the GND density from the EBSD data based on the kernel average misorientation measure and on the dislocation density tensor, respectively. The overall GND density is shown to increase with increasing total martensite fraction, decreasing grain volume, and increasing martensite fraction in the vicinity of ferrite. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These nanostructured TiO2-graphene hybrid materials were used for investigation of Li-ion insertion properties. The hybrid materials showed significantly enhanced Li-ion insertion/extraction in TiO2. The specific capacity was more than doubled at high charge rates, as compared with the pure TiO2 phase. The improved capacity at high charge-discharge rate may be attributed to increased electrode conductivity in the presence of a percolated graphene network embedded into the metal oxide electrodes.

In most cases, specialized applications require incorporation of functional chemical groups. This work is a systematic investigation of the effect that simple substituents attached to the aromatic linker have on the stability and property to the parent MOF. A family of isoreticular MOFs, based on the UiO-66 structure was obtained from the three different linker ligands H2N-H2BDC, O2N-H2BDC, and Br-H2BDC. The physicochemical and chemical investigation of these materials demonstrate that this class of MOFs retains high thermal and chemical stabilities, even with functional groups present at the linker units. The results demonstrate the possibility of incorporating active functional groups into the UiO-66 structure almost without losing its exceptionally high thermal and chemical stability. It has been established that the functional groups, at least in the amino functionalized UiO-66 sample, are chemically available as evidenced by the H/D exchange experiment, making the tagged UiO series MOFs very interesting for further studies within the field of catalysis.

It is a light-weight material, and has the highest theoretical capacity (3,860 mAh g(-1)) and the lowest electrochemical potential of all candidates. There are, however, at least three major hurdles before lithium metal anodes can become a viable technology: uneven and dendritic lithium deposition, unstable solid electrolyte interphase and almost infinite relative dimension change during cycling. Previous research has tackled the first two issues, but the last is still mostly unsolved. Here we report a composite lithium metal anode that exhibits low dimension variation (similar to 20%) during cycling and good mechanical flexibility. The anode is composed of 7 wt% 'lithiophilic' layered reduced graphene oxide with nanoscale gaps that can host metallic lithium. The anode retains up to similar to 3,390 mAh g(-1) of capacity, exhibits low overpotential (similar to 80 mV at 3 mA cm(-2)) and a flat voltage profile in a carbonate electrolyte. A full-cell battery with a LiCoO2 cathode shows good rate capability and flat voltage profiles.

As-prepared MoS2/G was then fabricated into layered MoS2/G composites after annealing in a H-2/N-2 atmosphere at 800 degrees C for 2 h. The samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical performances were evaluated In two-electrode cells versus metallic lithium. It Is demonstrated that the obtained MoS2/G composites show three-dimensional architecture and excellent electrochemical performances as anode materials for U-ion batteries. The MoS2/G composite with a Mo:C molar ratio of 1:2 exhibits the highest specific capacity of similar to 1100 mAh/g at a current of 100 mA/g, as well as excellent cycling stability and high-rate capability. The superior electrochemical performances of MoS2/G composites as U-Ion battery anodes are attributed to their robust composite structure and the synergistic effects between layered MoS2 and graphene.

Processing routes to macroporous ceramics: A review	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY					9th International Ceramic Processing Science Symposium	JAN 08-11, 2006	Coral Springs, FL					Macroporous ceramics with pore sizes from 400 nm to 4 mm and porosity within the range 20%-97% have been produced for a number of well-established and emerging applications, such as molten metal filtration, catalysis, refractory insulation, and hot gas filtration. These applications take advantage of the unique properties achieved through the incorporation of macropores into solid ceramics. In this article, we review the main processing routes that can be used for the fabrication of macroporous ceramics with tailored microstructure and chemical composition. Emphasis is given to versatile and simple approaches that allow one to control the microstructural features that ultimately determine the properties of the macroporous material. Replica, sacrificial template, and direct foaming techniques are described and compared in terms of microstructures and mechanical properties that can be achieved. Finally, directions to future investigations on the processing of macroporous ceramics are proposed.

J	Sevilla, M; Fuertes, AB				Sevilla, M.; Fuertes, A. B.			The production of carbon materials by hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose	CARBON												Highly functionalized carbonaceous materials were produced by means of the hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose at temperatures in the 220-250 degrees C range. The formation of this material follows essentially the path of a dehydration process, similar to that previously observed for the hydrothermal transformation of saccharides such as glucose, sucrose or starch. The materials so formed are composed of agglomerates of carbonaceous microspheres (size similar to 2-5 mu m), as evidenced by SEM. The combination of the results of the elemental analysis with that obtained by different spectroscopic techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and XPS) has allowed us to inferred that, from a chemical point of view, the solid product consists of small clusters of condensed benzene rings that form stable groups with oxygen in the core (i.e. ether, quinone, pyrone), whereas the shell possesses more reactive/hydrophilic oxygen functionalities (i.e. hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic, ester).

New metallurgical processing might offer the possibility of overcoming this. Here we report that austenitic 316L stainless steels additively manufactured via a laser powder-bed-fusion technique exhibit a combination of yield strength and tensile ductility that surpasses that of conventional 316L steels. High strength is attributed to solidification-enabled cellular structures, low-angle grain boundaries, and dislocations formed during manufacturing, while high uniform elongation correlates to a steady and progressive work-hardening mechanism regulated by a hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure, with length scales spanning nearly six orders of magnitude. In addition, solute segregation along cellular walls and low-angle grain boundaries can enhance dislocation pinning and promote twinning. This work demonstrates the potential of additive manufacturing to create alloys with unique microstructures and high performance for structural applications.

The sensor responses are linear for concentrations of sub ppm to hundreds of ppm with detection limits of 44 ppb for NO2 and 262 ppb for nitrotoluene. The time is on the order of seconds for the detection response and minutes for the recovery. The variation of the sensitivity is less than 6% for all of the tested devices, comparable with commercial metal oxide or polymer microfilm sensors while retaining the room-temperature high sensitivity of the SWNT transistor sensors and manufacturability of the commercial sensors. The extended detection capability from gas to organic vapors is attributed to direct charge transfer on individual semiconducting SWNT conductivity with additional electron hopping effects on intertube conductivity through physically adsorbed molecules between SWNTs.					, M.MUTHUKUMAR/KXR-7435-2024	, M.MUTHUKUMAR/0000-0002-5249-2970													1530-6984					JUL	2003	3	7					929	933		10.1021/nl034220x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl034220x													WOS:000184107300012

Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogels for Biomedical Applications	ADVANCED MATERIALS												Hyaluronic acid (HA), an immunoneutral polysaccharide that is ubiquitous in the human body, is crucial for many cellular and tissue functions and has been in clinical use for over thirty years. When chemically modified, HA can be transformed into many physical forms-viscoelastic solutions, soft or stiff hydrogels, electrospun fibers, non-woven meshes, macroporous and fibrillar sponges, flexible sheets, and nanoparticulate fluids-for use in a range of preclinical and clinical settings. Many of these forms are derived from the chemical crosslinking of pendant reactive groups by addition/condensation chemistry or by radical polymerization. Clinical products for cell therapy and regenerative medicine require crosslinking chemistry that is compatible with the encapsulation of cells and injection into tissues. Moreover, an injectable clinical biomaterial must meet marketing, regulatory, and financial constraints to provide affordable products that can be approved, deployed to the clinic, and used by physicians. Many HA-derived hydrogels meet these criteria, and can deliver cells and therapeutic agents for tissue repair and regeneration. This progress report covers both basic concepts and recent advances in the development of HA-based hydrogels for biomedical applications.

ACS NANO												The nanocomposites of TiO2-graphene (TiO2-GR) have been prepared via a facile hydrothermal reaction of graphene oxide and TiO2 in an ethanol-water solvent. We show that such a TiO2-GR nanocomposite exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity and stability than bare TiO2 toward the gas-phase degradation of benzene, a volatile aromatic pollutant in air. By investigating the effect of different addition ratios of graphene on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-GR systematically, we find that the higher weight ratio in TiO2-GR will decrease the photocatalytic activity. Analogous phenomenon is also observed for the liquid-phase degradation of dyes over TiO2-GR. In addition, the key features for TiO2-GR including enhancement of adsorptivity of pollutants, light absorption intensity, electron-hole pairs lifetime, and extended light absorption range have also been found in the composite of TiO2 and carbon nanotubes (TiO2-CNT). These strongly manifest that TiO2-GR is in essence the same as other TiO2-carbon (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and activated carbon) composite materials on enhancement of photocatalytic activity of TiO2, although graphene by itself has unique structural and electronic properties. Notably, this key fundamental question remains completely unaddressed in a recent report (ACS Nano 2010, 4, 380) regarding liquid-phase degradation of dyes over the TiO2-GR photocatalyst. Thus, we propose that TiO2-GR cannot provide truly new insights into the fabrication of TiO2-carbon composite as high-performance photocatalysts. It is hoped that our work could avert the misleading message to the readership, hence offering a valuable source of reference on fabricating TiO2-carbon composites for their application as a photocatalyst in the environment cleanup.

J	Colombo, P; Mera, G; Riedel, R; Sorarù, GD				Colombo, Paolo; Mera, Gabriela; Riedel, Ralf; Soraru, Gian Domenico			Polymer-Derived Ceramics: 40 Years of Research and Innovation in Advanced Ceramics	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY												Preceramic polymers were proposed over 30 years ago as precursors for the fabrication of mainly Si-based advanced ceramics, generally denoted as polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs). The polymer to ceramic transformation process enabled significant technological breakthroughs in ceramic science and technology, such as the development of ceramic fibers, coatings, or ceramics stable at ultrahigh temperatures (up to 2000 degrees C) with respect to decomposition, crystallization, phase separation, and creep. In recent years, several important advances have been achieved such as the discovery of a variety of functional properties associated with PDCs. Moreover, novel insights into their structure at the nanoscale level have contributed to the fundamental understanding of the various useful and unique features of PDCs related to their high chemical durability or high creep resistance or semiconducting behavior. From the processing point of view, preceramic polymers have been used as reactive binders to produce technical ceramics, they have been manipulated to allow for the formation of ordered pores in the meso-range, they have been tested for joining advanced ceramic components, and have been processed into bulk or macroporous components. Consequently, possible fields of applications of PDCs have been extended significantly by the recent research and development activities. Several key engineering fields suitable for application of PDCs include high-temperature-resistant materials (energy materials, automotive, aerospace, etc.), hard materials, chemical engineering (catalyst support, food- and biotechnology, etc.), or functional materials in electrical engineering as well as in micro/nanoelectronics. The science and technological development of PDCs are highly interdisciplinary, at the forefront of micro- and nanoscience and technology, with expertise provided by chemists, physicists, mineralogists, and materials scientists, and engineers. Moreover, several specialized industries have already commercialized components based on PDCs, and the production and availability of the precursors used has dramatically increased over the past few years. In this feature article, we highlight the following scientific issues related to advanced PDCs research: (1) General synthesis procedures to produce silicon-based preceramic polymers.(2) Special microstructural features of PDCs.(3) Unusual materials properties of PDCs, that are related to their unique nanosized microstructure that makes preceramic polymers of great and topical interest to researchers across a wide spectrum of disciplines.(4) Processing strategies to fabricate ceramic components from preceramic polymers.(5) Discussion and presentation of several examples of possible real-life applications that take advantage of the special characteristics of preceramic polymers. Note: In the past, a wide range of specialized international symposia have been devoted to PDCs, in particular organized by the American Ceramic Society, the European Materials Society, and the Materials Research Society. Most of the reviews available on PDCs are either not up to date or deal with only a subset of preceramic polymers and ceramics (e.g., silazanes to produce SiCN-based ceramics). Thus, this review is focused on a large number of novel data and developments, and contains materials from the literature but also from sources that are not widely available.

Hossein; Tse, Wang-Kong; Kargarian, Mehdi; MacDonald, Allan H.; Shvets, Gennady			Photonic topological insulators	NATURE MATERIALS												Recent progress in understanding the topological properties of condensed matter has led to the discovery of time-reversal-invariant topological insulators. A remarkable and useful property of these materials is that they support unidirectional spin-polarized propagation at their surfaces. Unfortunately topological insulators are rare among solid-state materials. Using suitably designed electromagnetic media (metamaterials) we theoretically demonstrate a photonic analogue of a topological insulator. We show that metacrystals-superlattices of metamaterials with judiciously designed properties-provide a platform for designing topologically non-trivial photonic states, similar to those that have been identified for condensed-matter topological insulators. The interfaces of the metacrystals support helical edge states that exhibit spin-polarized one-way propagation of photons, robust against disorder. Our results demonstrate the possibility of attaining one-way photon transport without application of external magnetic fields or breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Such spin-polarized one-way transport enables exotic spin-cloaked photon sources that do not obscure each other.

Photodegradation of Rhodamine B and Methyl Orange over Boron-Doped g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> under Visible Light Irradiation	LANGMUIR												Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and boron-doped g-C3N4 Were prepared by heating melamine and the mixture of melamine and boron oxide, respectively. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-vis spectra were used to describe the properties of as-prepared samples, The electron paramagnetic resonance was used to detect the active species for the photodegradation reaction over g-C3N4. The photodegradation mechanisms for two typical dyes, rhodamine B (Rh B) and methyl orange (MO), are proposed based on our comparison experiments. In the g-C3N4 photocatalysis system, the photodegradation of Rh B and MO is attributed to the direct hole oxidation and overall reaction, respectively; however, for the MO photodegradation the reduction process initiated by photogenerated electrons is a major photocatalytic process compared with the oxidation process induced by photogenerated holes. Boron doping for g-C3N4 can promote photodegradation of Rh B because the boron doping improves the dye adsorption and light absorption of catalyst.					李, 朝升/J-4034-2016; zhang, jingxing/KCY-4726-2024; Zou, Zhigang/AFG-8475-2022	Yan, Shicheng/0000-0002-3432-9117													0743-7463					MAR 16	2010	26	6					3894	3901		10.1021/la904023j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la904023j								20175583					WOS:000275226700024

Solar cells with a TiOx layer (deposited via a sol-gel process) between the active layer and the electron-collecting aluminum electrode exhibit approximately a 50 % enhancement in short-circuit current compared to similar devices without the optical spacer, as a result of modification of the spatial distribution of the light intensity inside the device.

Dielectric function, screening, and plasmons in two-dimensional graphene	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												The dynamical dielectric function of two-dimensional graphene at arbitrary wave vector q and frequency omega, epsilon(q,omega), is calculated in the self-consistent-field approximation. The results are used to find the dispersion of the plasmon mode and the electrostatic screening of the Coulomb interaction in two-dimensional (2D) graphene layer within the random-phase approximation. At long wavelengths (q -> 0), the plasmon dispersion shows the local classical behavior omega(cl)=omega(0)root q, but the density dependence of the plasma frequency (omega(0)proportional to n(1/4)) is different from the usual 2D electron system (omega(0)proportional to n(1/2)). The wave-vector-dependent plasmon dispersion and the static screening function show very different behavior than the usual 2D case. We show that the intrinsic interband contributions to static graphene screening can be effectively absorbed in a background dielectric constant.

According to the TEM analysis, the graphene nanosheets are homogeneously distributed between the loosely packed SnO2 nanoparticles in such a way that the nanoporous structure with a large amount of void spaces could be prepared. The obtained SnO/GNS exhibits a reversible capacity of 810 mAh/g; furthermore, its cycling performance is drastically enhanced in comparison with that of the bare SnO2 nanoparticle. After 30 cycles, the charge capacity of SnO2/GNS still remained 570 mAh/g, that is, about 70% retention of the reversible capacity, while the specific capacity of the bare SnO2 nanoparticle on the first charge was 550 mAh/g, dropping rapidly to 60 mAh/g only after 15 cycles. The dimensional confinement of tin oxide nanoparticles by the surrounding GNS limits the volume expansion upon lithium insertion, and the developed pores between SnO2 and GNS could be used as buffered spaces during charge/discharge, resulting in the superior cyclic performances.

Unlike for conventional devices, stretchable electronics can cover arbitrary surfaces and movable parts. However, a large hurdle is the manufacture of large-area highly stretchable electrical wirings with high conductivity. Here, we describe the manufacture of printable elastic conductors comprising single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) uniformly dispersed in a fluorinated rubber. Using an ionic liquid and jet-milling, we produce long and fine SWNT bundles that can form well-developed conducting networks in the rubber. Conductivity of more than 100 S cm(-1) and stretchability of more than 100% are obtained. Making full use of this extraordinary conductivity, we constructed a rubber-like stretchable active-matrix display comprising integrated printed elastic conductors, organic transistors and organic light-emitting diodes. The display could be stretched by 30-50% and spread over a hemisphere without any mechanical or electrical damage.

Peridynamic states and constitutive modeling	JOURNAL OF ELASTICITY												A generalization of the original peridynamic framework for solid mechanics is proposed. This generalization permits the response of a material at a point to depend collectively on the deformation of all bonds connected to the point. This extends the types of material response that can be reproduced by peridynamic theory to include an explicit dependence on such collectively determined quantities as volume change or shear angle. To accomplish this generalization, a mathematical object called a deformation state is defined, a function that maps any bond onto its image under the deformation. A similar object called a force state is defined, which contains the forces within bonds of all lengths and orientation. The relation between the deformation state and force state is the constitutive model for the material. In addition to providing a more general capability for reproducing material response, the new framework provides a means to incorporate a constitutive model from the conventional theory of solid mechanics directly into a peridynamic model. It also allows the condition of plastic incompressibility to be enforced in a peridynamic material model for permanent deformation analogous to conventional plasticity theory.																			0374-3535	1573-2681				AUG	2007	88	2					151	184		10.1007/s10659-007-9125-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10659-007-9125-1													WOS:000248806300004
J	Grässel, O; Krüger, L; Frommeyer, G; Meyer, LW				Grässel, O; Krüger, L; Frommeyer, G; Meyer, LW			High strength Fe-Mn-(Al, Si) TRIP/TWIP steels development -: properties -: application	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY												Deformation twinning, martensitic phase transformation and mechanical properties of austenitic Fe-(15-30) wt.%Mn steels with additions of aluminium and silicon have been investigated. It is known that additions of aluminium increase the stacking fault energy gamma(fcc) and therefore strongly suppress the gamma --> epsilon transformation while silicon decrease gamma(fcc) and sustains the gamma --> epsilon transformation. The gamma --> epsilon phase transformation takes place in steels with gamma(fcc) less than or equal to 20 mJ/m(2). For steels with higher stacking fault energy twinning is the main deformation mechanism. Tensile tests were carried out at different strain rates and temperatures. The formation of twins, alpha- and epsilon- martensite during plastic deformation was analysed by optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The developed light weight high manganese TRIP ("transformation induced plasticity") and TWIP ("twinning induced plasticity") steels exhibit high flow stress (600-1100 MPa) and extremely large elongation (60-95%) even at extremely high strain rates of about 10(3) s(-1). Recent trends in the automotive industry towards improved safely standards and a reduced weight as well as a more rational and cost effective manufacturing have led to great interest in these high strength and "super tough" steels.

The residual oxygen content and structure of GO are monitored and these chemical and structural characteristics are correlated to electronic properties of the thin films at various stages of reduction. It is found that the electrical characteristics of reduced GO do not approach those of intrinsic graphene obtained by mechanical cleaving because the material remains significantly oxidized. The residual oxygen forms sp(3) bonds with carbon atoms in the basal plane such that the carbon sp(2) bonding fraction in fully reduced GO is similar to 0.80. The minority sp(3) bonds disrupt the transport of carriers delocalized in the sp(2) network, limiting the mobility, and conductivity of reduced GO thin films. Extrapolation of electric conductivity data as a function of oxygen content reveals that complete removal of oxygen should lead to properties that are comparable to graphene.

Antibacterial anti-oxidant electroactive injectable hydrogel as self-healing wound dressing with hemostasis and adhesiveness for cutaneous wound healing	BIOMATERIALS												Injectable self-healing hydrogel dressing with multifunctional properties including anti-infection, anti oxidative and conductivity promoting wound healing process will be highly desired in wound healing application and its design is still a challenge. We developed a series of injectable conductive self-healed hydrogels based on quaternized chitosan-g-polyaniline (QCSP) and benzaldehyde group functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS-FA) as antibacterial, anti-oxidant and electroactive dressing for cutaneous wound healing. These hydrogels presented good self-healing, electroactivity, free radical scavenging capacity, antibacterial activity, adhesiveness, conductivity, swelling ratio, and biocompatibility. Interestingly, the hydrogel with an optimal crosslinker concentration of 1.5 wt% PEGS-FA showed excellent in vivo blood clotting capacity, and it significantly enhanced in vivo wound healing process in a full-thickness skin defect model than quaternized chitosan/PEGS-FA hydrogel and commercial dressing (Tegaderm (TM) film) by upregulating the gene expression of growth factors including VEGF, EGF and TGF-beta and then promoting granulation tissue thickness and collagen deposition. Taken together, the antibacterial electroactive injectable hydrogel dressing prolonged the lifespan of dressing relying on self-healing ability and significantly promoted the in vivo wound healing process attributed to its multifunctional properties, meaning that they are excellent candidates for full-thickness skin wound healing.

Here, we have investigated upconversion processes in a broad range of gadolinium-based nanoparticles of varying composition. We show that by rational design of a core-shell structure with a set of lanthanide ions incorporated into separated layers at precisely defined concentrations, efficient upconversion emission can be realized through gadolinium sublattice-mediated energy migration for a wide range of lanthanide activators without long-lived intermediary energy states. Furthermore, the use of the core-shell structure allows the elimination of deleterious cross-relaxation. This effect enables fine-tuning of upconversion emission through trapping of the migrating energy by the activators. Indeed, the findings described here suggest a general approach to constructing a new class of luminescent materials with tunable upconversion emissions by controlled manipulation of energy transfer within a nanoscopic region.

The semiconducting nature of MoS2 allows it to overcome the shortcomings of zero-bandgap graphene, while still sharing many of graphene's advantages for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Discrete electronic and optoelectronic components, such as field-effect transistors, sensors, and photodetectors made from few-layer MoS2 show promising performance as potential substitute of Si in conventional electronics and of organic and amorphous Si semiconductors in ubiquitous systems and display applications. An important next step is the fabrication of fully integrated multistage circuits and logic building blocks on MoS2 to demonstrate its capability for complex digital logic and high-frequency ac applications. This paper demonstrates an inverter, a NAND gate, a static random access memory, and a five-stage ring oscillator based on a direct-coupled transistor logic technology. The circuits comprise between 2 to 12 transistors seamlessly integrated side-by-side on a single sheet of bilayer MoS2. Both enhancement-mode and depletion-mode transistors were fabricated thanks to the use of gate metals with different work functions.

J	Peres, NMR; Guinea, F; Castro Neto, AH				Peres, NMR; Guinea, F; Castro Neto, AH			Electronic properties of disordered two-dimensional carbon	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Two-dimensional carbon, or graphene, is a semimetal that presents unusual low-energy electronic excitations described in terms of Dirac fermions. We analyze in a self-consistent way the effects of localized (impurities or vacancies) and extended (edges or grain boundaries) defects on the electronic and transport properties of graphene. On the one hand, point defects induce a finite elastic lifetime at low energies with the enhancement of the electronic density of states close to the Fermi level. Localized disorder leads to a universal, disorder independent, electrical conductivity at low temperatures, of the order of the quantum of conductance. The static conductivity increases with temperature and shows oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field. The graphene magnetic susceptibility is temperature dependent (unlike an ordinary metal) and also increases with the amount of defects. Optical transport properties are also calculated in detail. On the other hand, extended defects induce localized states near the Fermi level. In the absence of electron-hole symmetry, these states lead to a transfer of charge between the defects and the bulk, the phenomenon we call self-doping. The role of electron-electron interactions in controlling self-doping is also analyzed. We also discuss the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene, the role played by the edge states induced by a magnetic field, and their relation to the almost field independent surface states induced at boundaries. The possibility of magnetism in graphene, in the presence of short-range electron-electron interactions and disorder is also analyzed.

Perfectly aligned PLLA fibrous scaffolds were fabricated by an electrospinning technique under optimum condition and the diameter of the electrospun fibers can easily be tailored by adjusting the concentration of polymer solution. As the structure of PLLA scaffold was intended for neural tissue engineering, its suitability was evaluated in vitro using neural stem cells (NSCs) as a model cell line. Cell morphology, differentiation and neurite outgrowth were studied by various microscopic techniques. The results show that the direction of NSC elongation and its neurite outgrowth is parallel to the direction of PLLA fibers for aligned scaffolds. No significant changes were observed on the cell orientation with respect to the fiber diameters. However, the rate of NSC differentiation was higher for PLLA nanofibers than that of micro fibers and it was independent of the fiber alignment. Based on the experimental results, the aligned nanofibrous PLLA scaffold could be used as a potential cell carrier in neural tissue engineering. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent efforts in this direction have focused on high-capacity electrode materials such as lithium metal, silicon and tin as anodes, and sulphur and oxygen as cathodes. Lithium metal would be the optimal choice as an anode material, because it has the highest specific capacity (3,860 mAh g(-1)) and the lowest anode potential of all. However, the lithium anode forms dendritic and mossy metal deposits, leading to serious safety concerns and low Coulombic efficiency during charge/discharge cycles. Although advanced characterization techniques have helped shed light on the lithium growth process, effective strategies to improve lithium metal anode cycling remain elusive. Here, we show that coating the lithium metal anode with a monolayer of interconnected amorphous hollow carbon nanospheres helps isolate the lithium metal depositions and facilitates the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase. We show that lithium dendrites do not form up to a practical current density of 1 mA cm(-2). The Coulombic efficiency improvesto similar to 99% for more than 150 cycles. This is significantly better than the bare unmodified samples, which usually show rapid Coulombic efficiency decay in fewer than 100 cycles. Our results indicate that nanoscale interfacial engineering could be a promising strategy to tackle the intrinsic problems of lithium metal anodes.

Nanomechanical analysis of cells from cancer patients	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Change in cell stiffness is a new characteristic of cancer cells that affects the way they spread. Despite several studies on architectural changes in cultured cell lines, no ex vivo mechanical analyses of cancer cells obtained from patients have been reported. Using atomic force microscopy, we report the stiffness of live metastatic cancer cells taken from the body (pleural) fluids of patients with suspected lung, breast and pancreas cancer. Within the same sample, we find that the cell stiffness of metastatic cancer cells is more than 70% softer, with a standard deviation over five times narrower, than the benign cells that line the body cavity. Different cancer types were found to display a common stiffness. Our work shows that mechanical analysis can distinguish cancerous cells from normal ones even when they show similar shapes.

Comparison of the abilities of ambient and manufactured nanoparticles to induce cellular toxicity according to an oxidative stress paradigm	NANO LETTERS												Nanomaterial properties differ from those bulk materials of the same composition, allowing them to execute novel activities. A possible downside of these capabilities is harmful interactions with biological systems, with the potential to generate toxicity. An approach to assess the safety of nanomaterials is urgently required. We compared the cellular effects of ambient ultrafine particles with manufactured titanium dioxide (TiO2), carbon black, fullerol, and polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs). The study was conducted in a phagocytic cell line ( RAW 264.7) that is representative of a lung target for NPs. Physicochemical characterization of the NPs showed a dramatic change in their state of aggregation, dispersibility, and charge during transfer from a buffered aqueous solution to cell culture medium. Particles differed with respect to cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under biotic and abiotic conditions. Spontaneous ROS production was compared by using an ROS quencher (furfuryl alcohol) as well as an NADPH peroxidase bioelectrode platform. Among the particles tested, ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) and cationic PS nanospheres were capable of inducing cellular ROS production, GSH depletion, and toxic oxidative stress. This toxicity involves mitochondrial injury through increased calcium uptake and structural organellar damage. Although active under abiotic conditions, TiO2 and fullerol did not induce toxic oxidative stress. While increased TNF-alpha production could be seen to accompany UFP-induced oxidant injury, cationic PS nanospheres induced mitochondrial damage and cell death without inflammation. In summary, we demonstrate that ROS generation and oxidative stress are a valid test paradigm to compare NP toxicity. Although not all materials have electronic configurations or surface properties to allow spontaneous ROS generation, particle interactions with cellular components are capable of generating oxidative stress.

Based on their established use in the laboratory and the chemical stability of Au, gold nanoparticles were expected to be safe. The recent literature, however, contains conflicting data regarding the cytotoxicity of gold nanoparticles. Against this background a systematic study of watersoluble gold nanoparticles stabilized by triphenylphosphine derivatives ranging in size from 0.8 to 15 nm is made. The cytotoxicity of these particles in four cell lines representing major functional cell types with barrier and phagocyte function are tested. Connective tissue fibroblasts, epithelial cells, macrophages, and melanoma cells prove most sensitive to gold particles 1.4 nm in size, which results in IC50 values ranging from 30 to 56,cm depending on the particular 1.4-nm Au compound-cell line combination. In contrast, gold particles 15 nm in size and Tauredon (gold thiomalate) are nontoxic at up to 60-fold and 100-fold higher concentrations, respectively. The cellular response is size dependent, in that 1.4-nm particles cause predominantly rapid cell death by necrosis within 12 h while closely related particles 1.2 nm in diameter effect predominantly programmed cell death by apoptosis.

J	Radisavljevic, B; Kis, A				Radisavljevic, Branimir; Kis, Andras			Mobility engineering and a metal-insulator transition in monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>	NATURE MATERIALS												Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a new class of materials with interesting physical properties and applications ranging from nanoelectronics to sensing and photonics. In addition to graphene, the most studied 2D material, monolayers of other layered materials such as semiconducting dichalcogenides MoS2 or WSe2 are gaining in importance as promising channel materials for field-effect transistors (FETs). The presence of a direct bandgap in monolayer MoS2 due to quantum-mechanical confinement allows room-temperature FETs with an on/off ratio exceeding 10(8). The presence of high-kappa dielectrics in these devices enhanced their mobility, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report on electrical transport measurements on MoS2 FETs in different dielectric configurations. The dependence of mobility on temperature shows clear evidence of the strong suppression of charged-impurity scattering in dual-gate devices with a top-gate dielectric. At the same time, phonon scattering shows a weaker than expected temperature dependence. High levels of doping achieved in dual-gate devices also allow the observation of a metal-insulator transition in monolayer MoS2 due to strong electron-electron interactions. Our work opens up the way to further improvements in 2D semiconductor performance and introduces MoS2 as an interesting system for studying correlation effects in mesoscopic systems.

A review on the tensile properties of natural fiber reinforced polymer composites	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING												This paper is a review on the tensile properties of natural fiber reinforced polymer composites. Natural fibers have recently become attractive to researchers, engineers and scientists as an alternative reinforcement for fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Due to their low cost, fairly good mechanical properties, high specific strength, non-abrasive, eco-friendly and bio-degradability characteristics, they are exploited as a replacement for the conventional fiber, such as glass, aramid and carbon. The tensile properties of natural fiber reinforce polymers (both thermoplastics and thermosets) are mainly influenced by the interfacial adhesion between the matrix and the fibers. Several chemical modifications are employed to improve the interfacial matrix-fiber bonding resulting in the enhancement of tensile properties of the composites. In general, the tensile strengths of the natural fiber reinforced polymer composites increase with fiber content, up to a maximum or optimum value, the value will then drop. However, the Young's modulus of the natural fiber reinforced polymer composites increase with increasing fiber loading. Khoathane et al. [1] found that the tensile strength and Young's modulus of composites reinforced with bleached hemp fibers increased incredibly with increasing fiber loading. Mathematical modelling was also mentioned. It was discovered that the rule of mixture (ROM) predicted and experimental tensile strength of different natural fibers reinforced HDPE composites were very close to each other. Halpin-Tsai equation was found to be the most effective equation in predicting the Young's modulus of composites containing different types of natural fibers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rohlfing, M; Louie, SG				Rohlfing, M; Louie, SG			Electron-hole excitations and optical spectra from first principles	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We present a recently developed approach to calculate electron-hole excitations and the optical spectra of condensed matter from first principles. The key concept is to describe the excitations of the electronic system by the corresponding one- and two-particle Green's function. The method combines three computational techniques. First, the electronic ground state is treated within density-functional theory. Second, the single particle spectrum of the electrons and holes is obtained within the GW approximation to the electron self-energy operator. Finally, the electron-hole interaction is calculated and a Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved, yielding the coupled electron-hole excitations. The resulting solutions allow the calculation of the entire optical spectrum. This holds both for bound excitonic states below the band gap, as well as for the resonant spectrum above the band gap. We discuss a number of technical developments needed for the application of the method to real systems. To illustrate the approach, we discuss the excitations and optical spectra of spatially isolated systems (atoms, molecules, and semiconductor clusters) and of extended, periodic crystals (semiconductors and insulators).

For such materials, quantum effects define their physical behaviour and open completely new (quantum) perspectives for applications. Carbon-based materials are particularly good examples, highlighted by the fascinating quantum properties of, for example, nanotubes(1) or graphene(2). Here, we demonstrate the synthesis and application of ultrapure isotopically controlled single-crystal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond with a remarkably low concentration of paramagnetic impurities. The content of nuclear spins associated with the C-13 isotope was depleted to 0.3% and the concentration of other paramagnetic defects was measured to be <10(13) cm(-3). Being placed in such a spin-free lattice, single electron spins show the longest room-temperature spin dephasing times ever observed in solid-state systems (T-2 = 1.8 ms). This benchmark will potentially allow observation of coherent coupling between spins separated by a few tens of nanometres, making it a versatile material for room-temperature quantum information processing devices. We also show that single electron spins in the same isotopically engineered CVD diamond can be used to detect external magnetic fields with a sensitivity reaching 4 nT Hz(-1/2) and subnanometre spatial resolution.

We discuss the ground-state finite-size scaling properties of three different quantities-the Binder moment ratio, the spin stiffness, and the long-wavelength magnetic susceptibility-which we use to extract the critical value of the coupling ratio g=J(perpendicular to)/J. The individual estimates of g(c) are consistent provided that subleading finite-size corrections are properly taken into account. For both models, we find that the spin stiffness has the smallest subleading finite-size corrections; in the case of the incomplete bilayer we find that the first subleading correction vanishes or is extremely small. In agreement with predictions, we find that at the critical point the Binder ratio has a universal value and the product of the spin stiffness and the long-wavelength susceptibility scales as 1/L-2 with a universal prefactor. Our results for the critical coupling ratios are g(c)=2.5220(1) (full bilayer) and g(c)=1.3888(1) (incomplete bilayer), which represent improvements of more than an order of magnitude over the previous best estimates. For the correlation length exponent we obtain nu=0.7106(9), consistent with the expected three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class.

Paul			Localized surface plasmon resonances arising from free carriers in doped quantum dots	NATURE MATERIALS												Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) typically arise in nanostructures of noble metals(1,2) resulting in enhanced and geometrically tunable absorption and scattering resonances. LSPRs, however, are not limited to nanostructures of metals and can also be achieved in semiconductor nanocrystals with appreciable free carrier concentrations. Here, we describe well-defined LSPRs arising from p-type carriers in vacancy-doped semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Achievement of LSPRs by free carrier doping of a semiconductor nanocrystal would allow active on-chip control of LSPR responses. Plasmonic sensing and manipulation of solid-state processes in single nanocrystals constitutes another interesting possibility. We also demonstrate that doped semiconductor QDs allow realization of LSPRs and quantum-confined excitons within the same nanostructure, opening up the possibility of strong coupling of photonic and electronic modes, with implications for light harvesting, nonlinear optics, and quantum information processing.

The NGO is functionalized with sulfonic acid groups, which render it stable in physiological solution, followed by covalent binding of folic acid (FA) molecules to the NGO, thus allowing it to specifically target MCF-7 cells, human breast cancer cells with FA receptors. Furthermore, controlled loading of two anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CPT), onto the FA-conjugated NGO (FA-NGO) via pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions is investigated. It is demonstrated that FA-NGO loaded with the two anticancer drugs shows specific targeting to MCF-7 cells, and remarkably high cytotoxicity compared to NGO loaded with either DOX or CPT only. Considering that the combined use of two or more drugs, a widely adopted clinical practice, often displays much better therapeutic efficacy than that of a single drug, the controlled loading and targeted delivery of mixed anticancer drugs using these graphene-based nanocarriers may find widespread application in biomedicine.

Here, we present a general approach for the preparation of graphene-metal particle nanocomposites in a water-ethylene glycol system using graphene oxide as a precursor and metal nanoparticles (Au, Pt and Pd) as building blocks. These metal nanoparticles are adsorbed on graphene oxide sheets and play a pivotal role in catalytic reduction of graphene oxide with ethylene glycol, leading to the formation of graphene-metal particle nanocomposites.

J	Delley, B				Delley, B			Hardness conserving semilocal pseudopotentials	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												A new type of pseudopotentials for local orbital methods is presented. Hardness conserving semilocal pseudopotentials have been generated for all elements from H to Am. The construction is based on a minimization of errors with the norm conservation conditions for 2-3 relevant ionic configurations of the atom. Besides the transferability between atomic states, the portability among density functionals is also of interest. This paper explores if the norm-conservation errors can be kept reasonably small when minimized for two functionals, e.g., the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and local density approximation, simultaneously. It is found that the errors can be kept at roughly the same low level as for a single functional. Since these pseudopotentials are mainly designed for use with local orbital methods, semicore functions may be treated as valence functions, helping to increase the accuracy and portability. Therefore the name density functional semicore pseudopotential or DSPP is suggested. To further improve portability and, importantly, also aid numerical stability with GGA's, a core density (nonlinear core correction) is used. As with other pseudopotentials, scalar relativistic corrections to atomic scattering properties can easily be incorporated into this PP. Finally performance DSPP's versus all electron DSPP's with the same method, will be shown for an extensive set of test calculations. It is found that the DSPP is a very well behaved pseudo-potential.

Herein, using nitrogen-doped graphene produced by a simple plasma process, we developed ultracapacitors whose capacitances (similar to 280 F/g(electrode)) are about 4 times larger than those of pristine graphene based counterparts without sacrificing other essential and useful properties for ultracapacitor operations including excellent cycle life (>200000), high power capability, and compatibility with flexible substrates. While we were trying to understand the improved capacitance using scanning photoemission microscopy with a capability of probing local nitrogen-carbon bonding configurations within a single sheet of graphene, we observed interesting microscopic features of N-configurations: N-doped sites even at basal planes, distinctive distributions of N-configurations between edges and basal planes, and their distinctive evolutions with plasma duration. The local N-configuration mappings during plasma treatment, alongside binding energy calculated by density functional theory, revealed that the origin of the improved capacitance is a certain N-configuration at basal planes.

Sensors are fabricated from exfoliated graphene oxide platelets that are deposited to form an ultrathin continuous network. These graphene oxide networks are tunably reduced toward graphene by varying the exposure time to a hydrazine hydrate vapor. The conductance change of the networks upon exposure to trace levels of vapor is measured as a function of the chemical reduction.

Examples include hard, wear-resistant coatings, low friction coatings, corrosion resistant coatings, decorative coatings and coatings with specific optical, or electrical properties. Although the basic sputtering process has been known and used for many years, it is the development of the unbalanced magnetron and its incorporation into multi-source 'closed-field' systems that have been responsible for the rise in importance of this technique. Closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputtering (CFUBMS) is an exceptionally versatile technique for the deposition of high-quality, well-adhered films. The development, fundamental principles and applications of the CFUBMS process are, therefore, discussed in some detail in this review. Also discussed are other important recent developments in this area, including the pulsed magnetron sputtering process, variable field magnetrons, and the combining of sputtering techniques with other surface coating, or surface modification techniques in duplex production processes.

J.; Castellanos-Gomez, Andres			Fast and Broadband Photoresponse of Few-Layer Black Phosphorus Field-Effect Transistors	NANO LETTERS												Few-layer black phosphorus, a new elemental two-dimensional (2D) material recently isolated by mechanical exfoliation, is a high-mobility layered semiconductor with a direct bandgap that is predicted to strongly depend on the number of layers, from 0.35 eV (bulk) to 2.0 eV (single layer). Therefore, black phosphorus is an appealing candidate for tunable photodetection from the visible to the infrared part of the spectrum. We study the photoresponse of field-effect transistors (FETs) made of few-layer black phosphorus (3-8 nm thick), as a function of excitation wavelength, power, and frequency. In the dark state, the black phosphorus FETs can be tuned both in hole and electron doping regimes allowing for ambipolar operation. We measure mobilities in the order of 100 cm(2)/V s and a current ON/OFF ratio larger than 10(3). Upon illumination, the black phosphorus transistors show a response to excitation wavelengths from the visible region up to 940 nm and a rise time of about 1 ms, demonstrating broadband and fast detection. The responsivity reaches 4.8 mA/W, and it could be drastically enhanced by engineering a detector based on a PN junction. The ambipolar behavior coupled to the fast and broadband photodetection make few-layer black phosphorus a promising 2D material for photodetection across the visible and near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Rev. B 50, 17953 (1994)] for density functional theory (DFT) calculations is presented. The use of uniform three-dimensional (3D) real-space grids for representing wave functions, densities, and potentials allows for flexible boundary conditions, efficient multigrid algorithms for solving Poisson and Kohn-Sham equations, and efficient parallelization using simple real-space domain-decomposition. We use the PAW method to perform all-electron calculations in the frozen core approximation, with smooth valence wave functions that can be represented on relatively coarse grids. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by calculating the atomization energies of 20 small molecules, and the bulk modulus and lattice constants of bulk aluminum. We show that the approach in terms of computational efficiency is comparable to standard plane-wave methods, but the memory requirements are higher.

An important milestone was the creation of heterostructures based on graphene and other two-dimensional crystals, which can be assembled into three-dimensional stacks with atomic layer precision(5-7). Such layered structures have already demonstrated a range of fascinating physical phenomena(8-71), and have also been used in demonstrating a prototype field-effect tunnelling transistor(12), which is regarded to be a candidate for post-CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology. The range of possible materials that could be incorporated into such stacks is very large. Indeed, there are many other materials with layers linked by weak van der Waals forces that can be exfoliated(3,13) and combined together to create novel highly tailored heterostructures. Here, we describe a new generation of field-effect vertical tunnelling transistors where two-dimensional tungsten disulphide serves as an atomically thin barrier between two layers of either mechanically exfoliated or chemical vapour deposition-grown graphene. The combination of tunnelling (under the barrier) and thermionic (over the barrier) transport allows for unprecedented current modulation exceeding 1 x 10(6) at room temperature and very high ON current. These devices can also operate on transparent and flexible substrates.

We support this experimental observation by first-principle calculations and show that quantum confinement in layered d-electron dichalcogenides results in tuning the electronic structure.

J	Wang, ZL				Wang, Zhong Lin			On Maxwell's displacement current for energy and sensors: the origin of nanogenerators	MATERIALS TODAY												Self-powered system is a system that can sustainably operate without an external power supply for sensing, detection, data processing and data transmission. Nanogenerators were first developed for self-powered systems based on piezoelectric effect and triboelectrification effect for converting tiny mechanical energy into electricity, which have applications in internet of things, environmental/infrastructural monitoring, medical science and security. In this paper, we present the fundamental theory of the nanogenerators starting from the Maxwell equations. In the Maxwell's displacement current, the first term epsilon(0) partial derivative E/partial derivative t gives the birth of electromagnetic wave, which is the foundation of wireless communication, radar and later the information technology. Our study indicates that the second term partial derivative P/partial derivative t in the Maxwell's displacement current is directly related to the output electric current of the nanogenerator, meaning that our nanogenerators are the applications of Maxwell's displacement current in energy and sensors. By contrast, electromagnetic generators are built based on Lorentz force driven flow of free electrons in a conductor. This study presents the similarity and differences between pieozoelectric nanogenerator and triboelectric nanogenerator, as well as the classical electromagnetic generator, so that the impact and uniqueness of the nanogenerators can be clearly understood. We also present the three major applications of nanogenerators as micro/nano-power source, self-powered sensors and blue energy.

High Photoluminescence Efficiency and Optically Pumped Lasing in Solution-Processed Mixed Halide Perovskite Semiconductors	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS												The study of the photophysical properties of organic-metallic lead halide perovskites, which demonstrate excellent photovoltaic performance in devices with electron- and hole-accepting layers, helps to understand their charge photogeneration and recombination mechanism and unravels their potential for other optoelectronic applications. We report surprisingly high photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiencies, up to 70%, in these solution-processed crystalline films. We find that photoexcitation in the pristine CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite results in free charge carrier formation within 1 ps and that these free charge carriers undergo bimolecular recombination on time scales of 10s to 100s of ns. To exemplify the high luminescence yield of the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite, we construct and demonstrate the operation of an optically pumped vertical cavity laser comprising a layer of perovskite between a dielectric mirror and evaporated gold top mirrors. These long carrier lifetimes together with exceptionally high luminescence yield are unprecedented in such simply prepared inorganic semiconductors, and we note that these properties are ideally suited for photovoltaic diode operation.

Plasmonic nanorod metamaterials for biosensing	NATURE MATERIALS												Label-free plasmonic biosensors rely either on surface plasmon polaritons or on localized surface plasmons on continuous or nanostructured noble-metal surfaces to detect molecular-binding events(1-4). Despite undisputed advantages, including spectral tunability(3), strong enhancement of the local electric field(5,6) and much better adaptability to modern nanobiotechnology architectures(7), localized plasmons demonstrate orders of magnitude lower sensitivity compared with their guided counterparts(3). Here, we demonstrate an improvement in biosensing technology using a plasmonic metamaterial that is capable of supporting a guided mode in a porous nanorod layer. Benefiting from a substantial overlap between the probing field and the active biological substance incorporated between the nanorods and a strong plasmon-mediated energy confinement inside the layer, this metamaterial provides an enhanced sensitivity to refractive-index variations of the medium between the rods (more than 30,000nm per refractive-index unit). We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a standard streptavidin-biotin affinity model and record considerable improvement in the detection limit of small analytes compared with conventional label-free plasmonic devices.

Selective laser melting creates complex functional products by selectively melting powder particles of a powder bed layer after layer using a high-energy laser beam. The high-energy density applied to the material and the additive character of the process result in a unique material structure. To investigate this material structure, cube-shaped SLM parts were made using different scanning strategies and investigated by microscopy, X-ray diffraction and electron backscattered diffraction. The experimental results show that the high thermal gradients occurring during SLM lead to a very fine microstructure with submicron-sized cells. Consequently, the AlSi10Mg SLM products have a high hardness of 127 +/- 3 Hv0.5 even without the application of a precipitation hardening treatment. Furthermore, due to the unique solidification conditions and the additive character of the process, a morphological and crystallographic texture is present in the SLM parts. Thanks to the knowledge gathered in this paper on how this texture is formed and how it depends on the process parameters, this texture can be controlled. A strong fibrous < 1 0 0 > texture can be altered into a weak cube texture along the building and scanning directions when a rotation of 90 degrees of the scanning vectors within or between the layers is applied.

Electronic structure and stability of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons	NANO LETTERS												We present a systematic density functional theory study of the electronic properties, optical spectra, and relative thermodynamic stability of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons. We consider ribbons with different edge nature including bare and hydrogen-terminated ribbons, several crystallographic orientations, and widths up to 3 nm. Our results can be extrapolated to wider ribbons providing a qualitative way of determining the electronic properties of ribbons with widths of practical significance. We predict that in order to produce materials with band gaps similar to Ge or InN, the width of the ribbons must be between 2 and 3 nm. If larger bang gap ribbons are needed (like Si, InP, or GaAs), their width must be reduced to 1-2 nm. According to the extrapolated inverse power law obtained in this work, armchair carbon nanoribbons of widths larger than 8 nm will present a maximum band gap of 0.3 eV, while for ribbons with a width of 80 nm the maximum possible band gap is 0.05 eV. For chiral nanoribbons the band gap oscillations rapidly vanish as a function of the chiral angle indicating that a careful design of their crystallographic nature is an essential ingredient for controlling their electronic properties. Optical excitations show important differences between ribbons with and without hydrogen termination and are found to be sensitive to the carbon nanoribbon width.

After electrostatic assembly, rGO nanosheets are inserted in-between MXene layers. As a result, the self-restacking of MXene nanosheets is effectively prevented, leading to a considerably increased interlayer spacing. Accelerated diffusion of electrolyte ions enables more electroactive sites to become accessible. The freestanding MXene/rGO-5 wt% electrode displays a volumetric capacitance of 1040 F cm(-3) at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1), an impressive rate capability with 61% capacitance retention at 1 V s(-1) and long cycle life. Moreover, the fabricated binder-free symmetric supercapacitor shows an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 32.6 Wh L-1, which is among the highest values reported for carbon and MXene based materials in aqueous electrolytes. This work provides fundamental insight into the effect of interlayer spacing on the electrochemical performance of 2D hybrid materials and sheds light on the design of next-generation flexible, portable and highly integrated supercapacitors with high volumetric and rate performances.

Current-driven dynamics of chiral ferromagnetic domain walls	NATURE MATERIALS												In most ferromagnets the magnetization rotates from one domain to the next with no preferred handedness. However, broken inversion symmetry can lift the chiral degeneracy, leading to topologically rich spin textures such as spin spirals(1,2) and skyrmions(3-5) through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction(6) (DMI). Here we show that in ultrathin metallic ferromagnets sandwiched between a heavy metal and an oxide, the DMI stabilizes chiral domain walls(2,7) (DWs) whose spin texture enables extremely efficient current-driven motion(8-11). We show that spin torque from the spin Hall effect(12-15) drives DWs in opposite directions in Pt/CoFe/MgO and Ta/CoFe/MgO, which can be explained only if the DWs assume a Neel configuration(7,16) with left-handed chirality. We directly confirm the DW chirality and rigidity by examining current-driven DW dynamics with magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the spin spiral. This work resolves the origin of controversial experimental results(10,17,18) and highlights a new path towards interfacial design of spintronic devices.

Intrinsic ripples in graphene	NATURE MATERIALS												The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is the subject of a long-standing theoretical debate. According to the so-called Mermin-Wagner theorem(1), long-wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order of 2D crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be crumpled(2). These fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes meaning that a 2D membrane can exist but will exhibit strong height fluctuations(2-4). The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal(5,6), and the recent experimental observation of ripples in suspended graphene(7) make these issues especially important. Besides the academic interest, understanding the mechanisms of the stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic transport in this material that is attracting so much interest owing to its unusual Dirac spectrum and electronic properties(8-11). We address the nature of these height fluctuations by means of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for carbon(12). We find that ripples spontaneously appear owing to thermal fluctuations with a size distribution peaked around 80 A which is compatible with experimental findings(7) (50-100 angstrom ). This unexpected result might be due to the multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.

Inorganic caesium lead iodide perovskite solar cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A												The vast majority of perovskite solar cell research has focused on organic-inorganic lead trihalide perovskites. Herein, we present working inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells for the first time. CsPbI3 normally resides in a yellow non-perovskite phase at room temperature, but by careful processing control and development of a low-temperature phase transition route we have stabilised the material in the black perovskite phase at room temperature. As such, we have fabricated solar cell devices in a variety of architectures, with current-voltage curve measured efficiency up to 2.9% for a planar heterojunction architecture, and stabilised power conversion efficiency of 1.7%. The well-functioning planar junction devices demonstrate long-range electron and hole transport in this material. Importantly, this work identifies that the organic cation is not essential, but simply a convenience for forming lead triiodide perovskites with good photovoltaic properties. We additionally observe significant rate-dependent current-voltage hysteresis in CsPbI3 devices, despite the absence of the organic polar molecule previously thought to be a candidate for inducing hysteresis via ferroelectric polarisation. Due to its space group, CsPbI3 cannot be a ferroelectric material, and thus we can conclude that ferroelectricity is not required to explain current-voltage hysteresis in perovskite solar cells. Our report of working inorganic perovskite solar cells paves the way for further developments likely to lead to much more thermally stable perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

We employ transient absorption spectroscopy and present measurement data acquired for both intraband as well as interband probe energies. Quantum yields of 300% indicate the creation, on average, of three excitons per absorbed photon for PbSe QDs at photon energies that are four times the QD energy gap. Results indicate that the threshold photon energy for MEG in QDs is twice the lowest exciton absorption energy. We find that the biexciton effect, which shifts the transition energy for absorption of a second photon, influences the early time transient absorption data and may contribute to a modulation observed when probing near the lowest interband transition. We present experimental and theoretical values of the size-dependent interband transition energies for PbSe QDs.

The average sizes of the silver and copper nanoparticles were 3 nm and 9 nm, respectively, as determined through transmission electron microscopy. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectra of silver and copper nanoparticles revealed that while silver was in its pure form, an oxide layer existed on the copper nanoparticles. The bactericidal effect of silver and copper nanoparticles were compared based on diameter of inhibition zone in disk diffusion tests and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of nanoparticles dispersed in batch cultures. Bacterial sensitivity to nanoparticles was found to vary depending on the microbial species. Disk diffusion studies with E. coli and S. aureus revealed greater effectiveness of the silver nanoparticles compared to the copper nanoparticles. B. subtilis depicted the highest sensitivity to nanoparticles compared to the other strains and was more adversely affected by the copper nanoparticles. Good correlation was observed between MIC and MBC (r(2)=0.98) measured in liquid cultures. For copper nanoparticles a good negative correlation was observed between the inhibition zone observed in disk diffusion test and MIC/MBC determined based on liquid cultures with the various strains (r(2)=-0.75). Although strain-specific variation in MIC/MBC was negligible for S. aureus, some strain-specific variation was observed for E. coli. (c) 2007 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Above-bandgap voltages from ferroelectric photovoltaic devices	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												In conventional solid-state photovoltaics, electron-hole pairs are created by light absorption in a semiconductor and separated by the electric field spaning a micrometre-thick depletion region. The maximum voltage these devices can produce is equal to the semiconductor electronic bandgap. Here, we report the discovery of a fundamentally different mechanism for photovoltaic charge separation, which operates over a distance of 1-2 nm and produces voltages that are significantly higher than the bandgap. The separation happens at previously unobserved nanoscale steps of the electrostatic potential that naturally occur at ferroelectric domain walls in the complex oxide BiFeO3. Electric-field control over domain structure allows the photovoltaic effect to be reversed in polarity or turned off. This new degree of control, and the high voltages produced, may find application in optoelectronic devices.

Temperature dependence of the mechanical properties of equiatomic solid solution alloys with face-centered cubic crystal structures	ACTA MATERIALIA												Compared to decades-old theories of strengthening in dilute solid solutions, the mechanical behavior of concentrated solid solutions is relatively poorly understood. A special subset of these materials includes alloys in which the constituent elements are present in equal atomic proportions, including the high-entropy alloys of recent interest. A unique characteristic of equiatomic alloys is the absence of "solvent" and "solute" atoms, resulting in a breakdown of the textbook picture of dislocations moving through a solvent lattice and encountering discrete solute obstacles. To clarify the mechanical behavior of this interesting new class of materials, we investigate here a family of equiatomic binary, ternary and quaternary alloys based on the elements Fe, Ni, Co, Cr and Mn that were previously shown to be single-phase face-centered cubic (fcc) solid solutions. The alloys were arc-melted, drop-cast, homogenized, cold-rolled and recrystallized to produce equiaxed microstructures with comparable grain sizes. Tensile tests were performed at an engineering strain rate of 10(-3) s(-1) at temperatures in the range 77-673 K. Unalloyed fcc Ni was processed similarly and tested for comparison. The flow stresses depend to varying degrees on temperature, with some (e.g. NiCoCr, NiCoCrMn and FeNiCoCr) exhibiting yield and ultimate strengths that increase strongly with decreasing temperature, while others (e.g. NiCo and Ni) exhibit very weak temperature dependencies. To better understand this behavior, the temperature dependencies of the yield strength and strain hardening were analyzed separately. Lattice friction appears to be the predominant component of the temperature-dependent yield stress, possibly because the Peierls barrier height decreases with increasing temperature due to a thermally induced increase of dislocation width. In the early stages of plastic flow (5-13% strain, depending on material), the temperature dependence of strain hardening is due mainly to the temperature dependence of the shear modulus. In all the equiatomic alloys, ductility and strength increase with decreasing temperature down to 77 K. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transferrin-functionalized nanoparticles lose their targeting capabilities when a biomolecule corona adsorbs on the surface	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Nanoparticles have been proposed as carriers for drugs, genes and therapies to treat various diseases(1,2). Many strategies have been developed to target nanomaterials to specific or over-expressed receptors in diseased cells, and these typically involve functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with proteins, antibodies or other biomolecules. Here, we show that the targeting ability of such functionalized nanoparticles may disappear when they are placed in a biological environment. Using transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles, we found that proteins in the media can shield transferrin from binding to both its targeted receptors on cells and soluble transferrin receptors. Although nanoparticles continue to enter cells, the targeting specificity of transferrin is lost. Our results suggest that when nanoparticles are placed in a complex biological environment, interaction with other proteins in the medium and the formation of a protein corona(3,4) can 'screen' the targeting molecules on the surface of nanoparticles and cause loss of specificity in targeting.

We show that weak ferromagnetism of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type occurs in this material, and we analyze the coupling between the resulting magnetization and the structural distortions. We explore the possibility of electric-field-induced magnetization reversal and show that, although it is unlikely to be realized in BiFeO(3), it is not in general impossible. Finally, we outline the conditions that must be fulfilled to achieve switching of the magnetization using an electric field.

Nano Leff. 2002, 2,165. Sun, Y.; Xia, Y. Adv. Mater. 2002, 14,833. Sun, Y.; Yin, Y.; Mayers, B. T.; Herricks, T.; Xia, Y. Chem. Mater. 2002, 149 4736). Although the capability and feasibility of this method have been successfully illustrated with the production of silver nanowires 30-60 nm in diameter and 1-50 mum in length, the growth mechanism of this process is yet to be elucidated. Here we report some progress on this matter: First, electron microscopy studies on microtomed samples indicated that the cross sections of such silver nanowires had a pentagonal shape, together with a 5-fold twinned crystal structure. Second, the side surfaces (bounded by {100} facets) and the ends (bounded by {111} facets) of each nanowire were shown to have significant difference in reactivity toward dithoil molecules, with the side surfaces being completely passivated by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and the ends being partially passivated (or essentially uncovered) by PVP. This result implied that the PVP macromolecules interacted more strongly with the {100} planes than with the {111} planes of silver. On the basis of these new results, we proposed that each silver nanowire evolved from a multiply twinned nanoparticle (MTP) of silver with the assistance of PVP at the initial stage of the Ostwald ripening process. The anisotropic growth was maintained by selectively covering the {100} facets with PVP while leaving the {111} facets largely uncovered by PVP and thus highly reactive.

Carbon-supported materials containing metals such as iron or cobalt as well as nitrogen impurities have been proposed to increase scalability and reduce costs, but these alternatives usually suffer from low activity and/or gradual deactivation during use. Here, we show that few-walled carbon nanotubes, following outer wall exfoliation via oxidation and high-temperature reaction with ammonia, can act as an oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst in both acidic and alkaline solutions. Under a unique oxidation condition, the outer walls of the few-walled carbon nanotubes are partially unzipped, creating nanoscale sheets of graphene attached to the inner tubes. The graphene sheets contain extremely small amounts of irons originated from nanotube growth seeds, and nitrogen impurities, which facilitate the formation of catalytic sites and boost the activity of the catalyst, as revealed by atomic-scale microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Whereas the graphene sheets formed from the unzipped part of the outer wall of the nanotubes are responsible for the catalytic activity, the inner walls remain intact and retain their electrical conductivity, which facilitates charge transport during electrocatalysis.

Thermoelectric materials are being investigated for electricity production from waste heat (co-generation) and natural heat sources. For temperatures below 200 degrees C, the best commercially available inorganic semiconductors are bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3)-based alloys, which possess a figure of merit ZT close to one(1). Most of the recently discovered thermoelectric materials with ZT > 2 exhibit one common property, namely their low lattice thermal conductivities(2,3). Nevertheless, a high ZT value is not enough to create a viable technology platform for energy harvesting. To generate electricity from large volumes of warm fluids, heat exchangers must be functionalized with TEGs. This requires thermoelectric materials that are readily synthesized, air stable, environmentally friendly and solution processable to create patterns on large areas. Here we show that conducting polymers might be capable of meeting these demands. The accurate control of the oxidation level in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) combined with its low intrinsic thermal conductivity (lambda = D 0.37W m(-1) K-1) yields a ZT = 0.25 at room temperature that approaches the values required for efficient devices.

Combined Effect of Nitrogen- and Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups of Microporous Activated Carbon on its Electrochemical Performance in Supercapacitors	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												Microporous activated carbon originating from coconut shell, as received or oxidized with nitric acid, is treated with melamine and urea and heated to 950 degrees C in an inert atmosphere to modify the carbon surface with nitrogen- and oxygen-containing groups for a systematic investigation of their combined effect on electrochemical performance in 1 m H2SO4 supercapacitors. The chemistry of the samples is characterized using elemental analysis, Boehm titration, potentiometric titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Sorption of nitrogen and carbon dioxide is used to determine the textural properties. The results show that the surface chemistry is affected by the type of nitrogen precursor and the specific groups present on the surface before the treatment leading to the incorporation of nitrogen. Analysis of the electrochemical behavior of urea- and melamine-treated samples reveal pseudocapacitance from both the oxygen and the nitrogen containing functional groups located in the pores larger than 10 angstrom. On the other hand, pores between 5 angstrom and 6 angstrom are most effective in a double-layer formation, which correlates well with the size of hydrated ions. Although the quaternary and pyridinic-N-oxides nitrogen groups have enhancing effects on capacitance due to the positive charge, and thus an improved electron transfer at high current loads, the most important functional groups affecting energy storage performance are pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen along with quinone oxygen.

Two-dimensional buckled Si-based silicene has been recently realized by molecular beam epitaxy growth, whereas Ge-based germanene was obtained by molecular beam epitaxy and mechanical exfoliation. However, the synthesis of Sn-based stanene has proved challenging so far. Here, we report the successful fabrication of 2D stanene by molecular beam epitaxy, confirmed by atomic and electronic characterization using scanning tunnelling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, in combination with first-principles calculations. The synthesis of stanene and its derivatives will stimulate further experimental investigation of their theoretically predicted properties, such as a 2D topological insulating behaviour with a very large bandgap, and the capability to support enhanced thermoelectric performance, topological superconductivity and the near-room-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect.

Giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductor	NATURE MATERIALS												Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a new platform for exploring 2D semiconductor physics(1-9). Reduced screening in two dimensions results in markedly enhanced electron-electron interactions, which have been predicted to generate giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects(10-13). Here we present a rigorous experimental observation of extraordinarily large exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconducting TMD. We determine the single-particle electronic bandgap of single-layer MoSe2 by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), as well as the two-particle exciton transition energy using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 eV for monolayer MoSe2 on graphene-orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in conventional 3D semiconductors and significantly higher than what we see for MoSe2 monolayers in more highly screening environments. This finding is corroborated by our ab initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations(14,15) which include electron correlation effects. The renormalized bandgap and large exciton binding observed here will have a profound impact on electronic and optoelectronic device technologies based on single-layer semiconducting TMDs.					da Jornada, Felipe/AAF-5728-2020; Tongay, Seth Ariel/ACQ-5306-2022; Crommie, Michael/J-4824-2015; Hussain, Zahid/HGU-8912-2022; Ugeda, Miguel/ABG-8106-2020; Mo, Sung-Kwan/F-3489-2013; Wang, feng/I-5727-2015; Zhang, Yi/J-9025-2013	Mo, Sung-Kwan/0000-0003-0711-8514; shi, sufei/0000-0001-5158-805X; Moreno Ugeda, Miguel/0000-0001-7913-1617; Wang, feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Tongay, Seth Ariel/0000-0001-8294-984X; Zhang, Yi/0000-0003-1204-8717													1476-1122	1476-4660				DEC	2014	13	12					1091	1095		10.1038/NMAT4061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT4061								25173579					WOS:000345432200009

On the elastic-plastic decomposition of crystal deformation at the atomic scale	MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Given two snapshots of an atomistic system, taken at different stages of the deformation process, one can compute the incremental deformation gradient field, F, as defined by continuum mechanics theory, from the displacements of atoms. However, such a kinematic analysis of the total deformation does not reveal the respective contributions of elastic and plastic deformation. We develop a practical technique to perform the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation field, F = (FFp)-F-e, into elastic and plastic parts for the case of crystalline materials. The described computational analysis method can be used to quantify plastic deformation in a material due to crystal slip-based mechanisms in molecular dynamics and molecular statics simulations. The knowledge of the plastic deformation field, F-p, and its variation with time can provide insight into the number, motion and localization of relevant crystal defects such as dislocations. The computed elastic field, F-e, provides information about inhomogeneous lattice strains and lattice rotations induced by the presence of defects.

A particularly promising aspect seems to be the ability of perovskites to provide bistable switching of the conductance between non-metallic andmetallic behaviour by the application of an appropriate electric field. Here we demonstrate that the switching behaviour is an intrinsic feature of naturally occurring dislocations in single crystals of a prototypical ternary oxide, SrTiO3. The phenomenon is shown to originate from local modulations of the oxygen content and to be related to the self-doping capability of the early transition metal oxides. Our results show that extended defects, such as dislocations, can act as bistable nanowires and hold technological promise for terabit memory devices.

The thermal conductance is approximately 2.4 nW/K, and the thermal-conductivity is nearly 3500 Wm(-1)K(-1) at room temperature for a SWNT of length 2.6 mu m and diameter 1.7 nm. A subtle decrease in thermal conductivity steeper than 1/T is observed at the upper end of the temperature range, which is attributed to second-order three-phonon scattering between two acoustic modes and one optical mode.

J	Park, NG				Park, Nam-Gyu			Perovskite solar cells: an emerging photovoltaic technology	MATERIALS TODAY												Perovskite solar cells based on organometal halides represent an emerging photovoltaic technology. Perovskite solar cells stem from dye-sensitized solar cells. In a liquid-based dye-sensitized solar cell structure, the adsorption of methylammonium lead halide perovskite on a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface produces a photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 3-4%, as first discovered in 2009. The PCE was doubled after 2 years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However, the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and high efficiency (similar to 10%) perovskite solar cell was developed in 2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18% in just 2 years. Since PCE values over 20% are realistically anticipated with the use of cheap organometal halide perovskite materials, perovskite solar cells are a promising photovoltaic technology. In this review, the opto-electronic properties of perovskite materials and recent progresses in perovskite solar cells are described. In addition, comments on the issues to current and future challenges are mentioned.

However, metals deposited on the semiconducting 2H phase usually form high-resistance (0.7 k Omega mu m-10 k Omega mu m) contacts, leading to Schottky-limited transport. In this study, we demonstrate that the metallic 1T phase of MoS2 can be locally induced on semiconducting 2H phase nanosheets, thus decreasing contact resistances to 200-300 Omega mu m at zero gate bias. Field-effect transistors (FETs) with 1T phase electrodes fabricated and tested in air exhibit mobility values of similar to 50 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), subthreshold swing values below 100mV per decade, on/of ratios of >10(7), drive currents approaching similar to 100 mu A mu m(-1), and excellent current saturation. The deposition of different metals has limited influence on the FET performance, suggesting that the 1T/2H interface controls carrier injection into the channel. An increased reproducibility of the electrical characteristics is also obtained with our strategy based on phase engineering of MoS2.

The surfactants are compared with respect to their ability to suspend individual SWNTs and the quality of the absorption and fluorescence spectra. For the ionic surfactants, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) gives the most well resolved spectral features.

Enhanced Photoluminescence and Solar Cell Performance <i>via</i> Lewis Base Passivation of Organic Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskites	ACS NANO												Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a top contender to be used as an absorber material in highly efficient, low-cost photovoltaic devices. Solution-processed semiconductors tend to have a high density of defect states and exhibit a large degree of electronic disorder. Perovskites appear to go against this trend, and despite relatively little knowledge of the impact of electronic defects, certified solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.9% have been achieved. Here, through treatment of the crystal surfaces with the Lewis bases thiophene and pyridine, we demonstrate significantly reduced nonradiative electron-hole recombination within the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite, achieving photoluminescence lifetimes which are enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude, up to 2 mu s. We propose that this is due to the electronic passivation of under-coordinated Pb atoms within the crystal. Through this method of Lewis base passivation, we achieve power conversion efficiencies for solution-processed planar heterojunction solar cells enhanced from 13% for the untreated solar cells to 15.3% and 16.5% for the thiophene and pyridine-treated solar cells, respectively.

However, water evaporation suffers from either inefficient utilization of solar energy or relies on complex and expensive light-concentration accessories. Here, we demonstrate a hierarchically nanostructured gel (HNG) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polypyrrole (PPy) that serves as an independent solar vapour generator. The converted energy can be utilized in situ to power the vaporization of water contained in the molecular meshes of the PVA network, where water evaporation is facilitated by the skeleton of the hydrogel. A floating HNG sample evaporated water with a record high rate of 3.2 kg m(-2) h(-1) via 94% solar energy from 1 sun irradiation, and 18-23 litres of water per square metre of HNG was delivered daily when purifying brine water. These values were achievable due to the reduced latent heat of water evaporation in the molecular mesh under natural sunlight.

Several recent reports have demonstrated that the MSNs can be efficiently internalized by animal and plant cells. The functionalization of MSNs with organic moieties or other nanostructures brings controlled release and molecular recognition capabilities to these mesoporous materials for drug/gene delivery and sensing applications, respectively.

Magnetic effects at the interface between non-magnetic oxides	NATURE MATERIALS												The electronic reconstruction at the interface between two insulating oxides can give rise to a highly conductive interface. Here we show how, in analogy to this remarkable interface-induced conductivity, magnetism can be induced at the interface between the otherwise non-magnetic insulating perovskites SrTiO3 and LaAlO3. A large negative magnetoresistance of the interface is found, together with a logarithmic temperature dependence of the sheet resistance. At low temperatures, the sheet resistance reveals magnetic hysteresis. Magnetic ordering is a key issue in solid-state science and its underlying mechanisms are still the subject of intense research. In particular, the interplay between localized magnetic moments and the spin of itinerant conduction electrons in a solid gives rise to intriguing many-body effects such as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions, the Kondo effect and carrier-induced ferromagnetismin diluted magnetic semiconductors. The conducting oxide interface now provides a versatile system to induce and manipulate magnetic moments in otherwise non-magnetic materials.

Collodial nanocrystals (NCs) of cesium lead halides (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) exhibit bright photoluminescence, with emission tunable over the entire visible spectral region. However, previous studies on CsPbX3 NCs did not address key aspects of their chemistry and photophysics such as surface chemistry and quantitative light absorption. Here, we elaborate on the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs and their surface chemistry. In addition, the intrinsic absorption coefficient was determined experimentally by combining elemental analysis with accurate optical absorption measurements. H-1 solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterize sample purity, elucidate the surface chemistry, and evaluate the influence of purification methods on the surface composition. We find that ligand binding to the NC surface is highly dynamic, and therefore, ligands are easily lost during the isolation and purification procedures. However, when a small amount of both oleic acid and oleylamine is added, the NCs can be purified, maintaining optical, colloidal, and material integrity. In addition, we find that a high amine content in the ligand shell increases the quantum yield due to the improved binding of the carboxylic acid.

Efficient load transfer is found between the nanofiller graphene and matrix PVA and the mechanical properties of the graphene-based nanocomposite with molecule-level dispersion are significantly improved.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of select multi-layered transition metal carbides (MXenes)	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												In this work, a detailed high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is presented for select MXenes a recently discovered family of two-dimensional (2D) carbides and carbonitrides. Given their 2D nature, understanding their surface chemistry is paramount. Herein we identify and quantify the surface groups present before, and after, sputter-cleaning as well as freshly prepared vs. aged multi layered cold pressed discs. The nominal compositions of the MXenes studied here are Ti-3 C2Tx,Ti3CNTx, Nb2CTx and Nb4C3Tx where T represents surface groups that this work attempts to quantify. In all the cases, the presence of three surface terminations, O, OH and F, in addition to OH-terminations relatively strongly bonded to H2O molecules, was confirmed. From XPS peak fits, it was possible to establish the average sum of the negative charges of the terminations for the aforementioned MXenes. Based on this work, it is now possible to quantify the nature of the surface terminations. This information can, in turn, be used to better design and tailor these novel 2D materials for various applications. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Laboratory experiments with acid brown 14 as the model pollutant have been carried out to evaluate the performance of both ZnO and TiO2 catalysts. Solar light was used as the energy source for the photocatalytic experiments, These catalysts were examined for surface area, particle size and crystallinity. The effect of initial dye concentration, catalyst loading, irradiation time, pH, adsorption of acid brown 14 on ZnO and TiO2 intensity of light and comparison of photocatalytic activity with different commercial catalysts were Studied. The progress of photocatalytic degradation of the acid brown 14 has been observed by monitoring the change in substrate concentration of the model compound employing HPLC and measuring the absorbance in UV-Visible spectrophotometer for decolourisation. The photodegradation rate was determined for each experiment and the highest values were observed for ZnO suggesting that it absorbs large fraction of the solar spectrum and absorption of more light quanta than TiO2 The complete mineralisation was confirmed by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, COD measurement and estimation of the formation of inorganic ions such as NH4+, NO3, Cl- and SO42-.

One of the main factors that has hampered widespread practical use of DSC is the poor thermostability encountered so far with these devices. Here we show a DSC with unprecedented stable performance under both thermal stress and soaking with light, matching the durability criteria applied to silicon solar cells for outdoor applications. The cell uses the amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizer cis-RuLL'(SCN)(2) (L = 4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine, L' = 4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine) in conjunction with a quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte, reaching an efficiency of >6% in full sunlight (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm(-2)). A convenient and versatile new route is reported for the synthesis of the heteroleptic ruthenium complex, which plays a key role in achieving the high-temperature stability. Ultramicroelectrode voltammetric measurements show that the triiodide/iodide couple can perform charge transport freely in the polymer gel. The cell sustained heating for 1,000 h at 80 degreesC, maintaining 94% of its initial performance. The device also showed excellent stability under light soaking at 55 degreesC for 1,000 h in a solar simulator (100 mW cm(-2)) equipped with a ultraviolet filter. The present findings should foster widespread practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells.

Jeffrey			Characterization of Lorenz number with Seebeck coefficient measurement	APL MATERIALS												In analyzing zT improvements due to lattice thermal conductivity (kappa(L)) reduction, electrical conductivity (sigma) and total thermal conductivity (kappa(Total)) are often used to estimate the electronic component of the thermal conductivity (kappa(E)) and in turn kappa(L) from kappa(L) = similar to kappa(Total) - L sigma T. TheWiedemann-Franz law, kappa(E) = L sigma T, where L is Lorenz number, is widely used to estimate kappa(E) from sigma measurements. It is a common practice to treat L as a universal factor with 2.44 x 10(-8) W Omega K-2 (degenerate limit). However, significant deviations from the degenerate limit (approximately 40% or more for Kane bands) are known to occur for non-degenerate semiconductors where L converges to 1.5 x 10(-8) W Omega K-2 for acoustic phonon scattering. The decrease in L is correlated with an increase in thermopower (absolute value of Seebeck coefficient (S)). Thus, a first order correction to the degenerate limit of L can be based on the measured thermopower, vertical bar S vertical bar, independent of temperature or doping. We propose the equation: L = 1.5 + exp [ -vertical bar S vertical bar/116] (where L is in 10(-8) W Omega K-2 and S in mu V/K) as a satisfactory approximation for L. This equation is accurate within 5% for single parabolic band/acoustic phonon scattering assumption and within 20% for PbSe, PbS, PbTe, Si0.8Ge0.2 where more complexity is introduced, such as non-parabolic Kane bands, multiple bands, and/or alternate scattering mechanisms. The use of this equation for L rather than a constant value (when detailed band structure and scattering mechanism is not known) will significantly improve the estimation of lattice thermal conductivity.

Bacteriological test data, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, and electron microscopy (TEM) images are provided, which yield insight into the biocidal action of these nanoscale materials. The tests show that these materials are very effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as spores. zeta-Potential measurements show an attractive interaction between the MgO nanoparticles and bacteria and spore cells, which is confirmed by confocal microscopy images. The AFM studies illustrate considerable changes in the cell membranes upon treatment, resulting in the death of the cells. TEM micrographs confirm these results and supply additional information about the processes inside the cells. Overall, the results presented illustrate that dry powder nanoparticulate formulations as well as water slurries are effective. It is proposed that abrasiveness, basic character, electrostatic attraction, and oxidizing power (due to the presence of active halogen) combine to promote these biocidal properties.																			0743-7463					AUG 20	2002	18	17					6679	6686		10.1021/la0202374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la0202374													WOS:000177487600034

Considering the importance of protein interactions with injected colloidal dug carriers with regard to their in vivo fate, we analysed plasma protein adsorption onto biodegradable PEG-coated poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). A series of corona/core nanoparticles of sizes 160-270 nm were prepared from diblock PEG-PLA, PEG-PLGA and PEG-PCL and from PEG-PLA:PLA blends. The PEG Mw was varied from 2000-20 000 g/mole and the particles were prepared using different PEG contents. It was thus possible to study the influence of the PEG corona thickness and density, as well as the influence of the nature of the core (PLA, PLGA or PCL), on the competitive plasma protein adsorption, zeta potential and particle uptake by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. 2-D PAGE studies showed that plasma protein adsorption on PEG-coated PLA nanospheres strongly depends on the PEG molecular weight (Mw) (i.e. PEG chain length at the particle surface) as well as on the PEG content in the particles (i.e. PEG chain density at the surface of the particles). Whatever the thickness or the density of the corona, the qualitative composition of the plasma protein adsorption patterns was very similar, showing that adsorption was governed by interaction with a PLA surface protected more or less by PEG chains. The main spots on the gels were albumin, fibrinogen, IgG, Ig light chains, and the apolipoproteins apoA-I and apoE. For particles made of PEG-PLA45K with different PEG Mw, a maximal reduction in protein adsorption was found for a PEG Mw of 5000 g/mole. For nanospheres differing in their PEG content from 0.5 to 20 wt %, a PEG content between 2 and 5 wt % was determined as a threshold value for optimal protein resistance. When increasing the PEG content in the nanoparticles above 5 wt % no further reduction in protein adsorption was achieved. Phagocytosis by PMN studied using chemiluminescence and zeta potential data agreed well with these findings: the same PEG surface density threshold was found to ensure simultaneously efficient steric stabilization and to avoid the uptake by PMN cells. Supposing all the PEG chains migrate to the surface, this would correspond to a distance of about 1.5 nm between two terminally attached PEG chains in the covering 'brush'. Particles from PEG5K-PLA45K, PEG5K-PLGA45K; and PEG5K-PCL45K copolymers enabled to study the influence of the core on plasma protein adsorption, all other parameters (corona thickness and density) being kept constant. Adsorption patterns were in good qualitative agreement with each other. Only a few protein species were exclusively present just on one type of nanoparticle. However, the extent of proteins adsorbed differed in a large extent from one particle to another. In vivo studies could help elucidating the role of the type and amount of proteins adsorbed on the fate of the nanoparticles after intraveinous administration, as a function of the nature of their core. These results could be useful in the design of long circulating intravenously injectable biodegradable drug carriers endowed with protein resistant properties and low phagocytic uptake.

Rapid casting of patterned vascular networks for perfusable engineered three-dimensional tissues	NATURE MATERIALS												In the absence of perfusable vascular networks, three-dimensional (3D) engineered tissues densely populated with cells quickly develop a necrotic core(1). Yet the lack of a general approach to rapidly construct such networks remains a major challenge for 3D tissue culture(2-4). Here, we printed rigid 3D filament networks of carbohydrate glass, and used them as a cytocompatible sacrificial template in engineered tissues containing living cells to generate cylindrical networks that could be lined with endothelial cells and perfused with blood under high-pressure pulsatile flow. Because this simple vascular casting approach allows independent control of network geometry, endothelialization and extravascular tissue, it is compatible with a wide variety of cell types, synthetic and natural extracellular matrices, and crosslinking strategies. We also demonstrated that the perfused vascular channels sustained the metabolic function of primary rat hepatocytes in engineered tissue constructs that otherwise exhibited suppressed function in their core.					yu, xiang/B-1653-2010; Yang, Michael/LFS-4670-2024; Chen, Christopher/ABD-8499-2021; Miller, Jordan/P-8755-2014	Chaturvedi, Ritika/0000-0002-0416-6134; Baker, Brendon/0000-0002-2785-1070; Chen, Christopher/0000-0003-2445-8449; Miller, Jordan/0000-0002-7931-551X; Nguyen, Duc-Huy/0000-0003-0805-8103; Cohen, Daniel/0000-0002-7963-668X; Galie, Peter/0000-0001-5161-4924													1476-1122					SEP	2012	11	9					768	774		10.1038/NMAT3357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT3357								22751181					WOS:000308191700015

Silver Nanowire Networks as Flexible, Transparent, Conducting Films: Extremely High DC to Optical Conductivity Ratios	ACS NANO												We have used aqueous dispersions of silver nanowires to prepare thin, flexible, transparent, conducting films. The nanowires are of length and diameter close to 6.5 mu m and 85 nm, respectively. At low thickness, the films consist of networks but appear to become bulk-like for mean film thicknesses above similar to 160 nm. These films can be very transparent with optical transmittance reaching as high as 92% for low thickness. The transmittance (550 nm) decreases with increasing thickness, consistent with an optical conductivity of 6472 S/m. The films are also very uniform; the transmittance varies spatially by typically <2%. The sheet resistance decreases with increasing thickness, falling below 1 Omega/square for thicknesses above 300 nm. The DC conductivity increases from 2 x 101 S/m for very thin films before saturating at 5 X 106 S/m for thicker films. Similarly, the ratio of DC to optical conductivity increases with increasing thickness from 25 for the thinnest films, saturating at similar to 500 for thicknesses above similar to 160 nm. We believe this Is the highest conductivity ratio ever observed for nanostructured films and is matched only by doped metal oxide films. These nanowire films are electromechanically very robust, with all but the thinnest films showing no change in sheet resistance when flexed over >1000 cycles. Such results make these films ideal as replacements for indium tin oxide as transparent electrodes. We have prepared films with optical transmittance and sheet resistance of 85% and 13 Omega/square, respectively. This is very close to that displayed by commercially available indium tin oxide.

In neuromorphic engineering(5,6), emulation of known neural behaviour has proven to be difficult to implement in software because of the highly complex interconnected nature of thought processes. Here we report the discovery of a Ag2S inorganic synapse, which emulates the synaptic functions of both STP and LTP characteristics through the use of input pulse repetition time. The structure known as an atomic switch(7,8), operating at critical voltages, stores information as STP with a spontaneous decay of conductance level in response to intermittent input stimuli, whereas frequent stimulation results in a transition to LTP. The Ag2S inorganic synapse has interesting characteristics with analogies to an individual biological synapse, and achieves dynamic memorization in a single device without the need of external preprogramming. A psychological model related to the process of memorizing and forgetting is also demonstrated using the inorganic synapses.

The stability of the materials with respect to the most common solvents, acids, and bases is determined by combining XRPD and TGA/MS techniques. The structures of the two forms of UiO-66 are refined through an interactive XRPD/EXAFS approach and validated by ab initio calculations. Experimental and calculated IR spectra are reported and compared to enlighten the nature of vibrational modes upon dehydroxylation and to show the complete reversibility of the dehydration/hydration phenomenon. Experimental and calculated band gaps are also reported and compared. In this work, we show the necessity to combine, in a synergic way, different experimental techniques and periodic ab initio approaches to disclose and fully understand the nature of complex novel materials such as UiO-66 on structural, vibrational, and electronic grounds. The correct structure refinement could not be possible using one of these three approaches alone, in particular, XRPD data were unable to detect an important distortion of the Zr6O6 units of the dehydrated material that was, however, foreseen in the ab initio calculations and measured in the EXAFS spectra.

J	Naslain, R				Naslain, R			Design, preparation and properties of non-oxide CMCs for application in engines and nuclear reactors: an overview	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					Symposium on Multifucntional Materials and Structures	MAR 16-20, 2003	STUTTGART, GERMANY					SiC-based ceramic matrix composites, consisting of carbon or SiC fibers embedded in a SiC-matrix, are tough ceramics when the fiber/matrix bonding is properly optimized through the use of a thin interphase. They are fabricated according to different processing routes (chemical vapor infiltration, polymer impregnation/pyrolysis, liquid silicon infiltration or slurry impregnation/hot pressing) each of them displaying advantages and drawbacks which are briefly discussed. SiC-matrix composites are highly tailorable materials in terms of fiber-type (carbon fibers of SiC-based fibers such as Si-C-O, SiC + C or quasi-stoichiometric SiC reinforcements), interphase (pyrocarbon or hexagonal BN, as well as (PyC-SiC)(n) or (BN SiC)(n) multilayered interphases), matrix (simple SiC or matrices with improved oxidation resistance, such as self-healing matrices) and coatings (SiC or engineered multilayered coatings). The potential of SiC-matrix composites for application in advanced aerojet engines (after-burner hot section), gas turbine of electrical power/steam cogeneration (combustion chamber) and inner wall of the plasma chamber of nuclear fusion reaction, all of them corresponding to very severe conditions is discussed.

Here we report a low-temperature, environmentally benign, solution-based approach for the preparation of complex and oriented ZnO nanostructures, and the systematic modification of their crystal morphology. Using controlled seeded growth and citrate anions that selectively adsorb on ZnO basal planes as the structure-directing agent, we prepared large arrays of oriented ZnO nanorods with controlled aspect ratios, complex film morphologies made of oriented nanocolumns and nanoplates (remarkably similar to biomineral structures in red abalone shells) and complex bilayers showing in situ column-to-rod morphological transitions. The advantages of some of these ZnO structures for photocatalytic decompositions of volatile organic compounds were demonstrated. The novel ZnO nanostructures are expected to have great potential for sensing, catalysis, optical emission, piezoelectric transduction, and actuations.					Xu, HF/KOD-6035-2024; Tian, Z.

In general, such sensors contain a number of circuits or complex layered matrix arrays. Here, we present a simple architecture for a flexible and highly sensitive strain sensor that enables the detection of pressure, shear and torsion. The device is based on two interlocked arrays of high-aspect-ratio Pt-coated polymeric nanofibres that are supported on thin polydimethylsiloxane layers. When different sensing stimuli are applied, the degree of interconnection and the electrical resistance of the sensor changes in a reversible, directional manner with specific, discernible strain-gauge factors. The sensor response is highly repeatable and reproducible up to 10,000 cycles with excellent on/off switching behaviour. We show that the sensor can be used to monitor signals ranging from human heartbeats to the impact of a bouncing water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface.

Anomalous Zero-Bias Conductance Peak in a Nb-InSb Nanowire-Nb Hybrid Device	NANO LETTERS												Semiconductor InSb nanowires are expected to provide an excellent material platform for the study of Majorana fermions in solid state systems. Here, we report on the realization of a Nb-InSb nanowire-Nb hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap Delta(InSb) similar to 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value, at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is E-z similar to Delta(Insb), is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the InSb nanowire.

Further development of large, flexible displays requires a cost-effective manufacturing process for the active-matrix backplane, which contains one transistor per pixel. One way to further reduce costs is to integrate (part of) the display drive circuitry, such as row shift registers, directly on the display substrate. Here, we demonstrate flexible active-matrix monochrome electrophoretic displays based on solution-processed organic transistors on 25-mum-thick polyimide substrates. The displays can be bent to a radius of 1 cm without significant loss in performance. Using the same process flow we prepared row shift registers. With 1,888 transistors, these are the largest organic integrated circuits reported to date. More importantly, the operating frequency of 5 kHz is sufficiently high to allow integration with the display operating at video speed. This work therefore represents a major step towards 'system-on-plastic'.

Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>-e) emissions: A comparison between geopolymer and OPC cement concrete	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS												Concrete for construction has traditionally been based on an Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) binder. Geopolymers, an alternative binder based on fly ash (a fine waste collected from the emissions liberated by coal burning power stations) that is activated by an alkaline activator, have potential to lower the significant carbon footprint of OPC concrete. This paper presents the results of comprehensive carbon footprint estimates for both geopolymer and OPC concrete, including energy expending activities associated with mining and transport of raw materials, manufacturing and concrete construction.

These twelve models were selected from state-of-the-art lumped models reported in the literature. The test data used is obtained from a battery test system with a climate chamber. The test schedule is designed to measure key cell attributes under highly dynamical excitations. The datasets were collected from two types of Li-ion cells under three different temperatures. The multi-swarm particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to identify the optimal model parameters for the two types of Li-ion cells. The usefulness of these models is then studied through a comprehensive evaluation by examining model complexity, model accuracy, and robustness of the model by applying the model to datasets obtained from other cells of the same chemistry type.

J	Kempton, W; Tomic, J				Kempton, W; Tomic, J			Vehicle-to-grid power fundamentals: Calculating capacity and net revenue	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES												As the light vehicle fleet moves to electric drive (hybrid, battery, and fuel cell vehicles), an opportunity opens for "vehicle-to-grid" (V2G) power. This article defines the three vehicle types that can produce V2G power, and the power markets they can sell into. V2G only makes sense if the vehicle and power market are matched. For example, V2G appears to be unsuitable for baseload power-the constant round-the-clock electricity supply-because baseload power can be provided more cheaply by large generators, as it is today. Rather, V2G's greatest near-term promise is for quick-response, high-value electric services. These quick-response electric services are purchased to balance constant fluctuations in load and to adapt to unexpected equipment failures; they account for 5-10% of electric cost-$12 billion per year in the US. This article develops equations to calculate the capacity for grid power from three types of electric drive vehicles. These equations are applied to evaluate revenue and costs for these vehicles to supply electricity to three electric markets (peak power, spinning reserves, and regulation). The results suggest that the engineering rationale and economic motivation for V2G power are compelling. The societal advantages of developing V2G include an additional revenue stream for cleaner vehicles, increased stability and reliability of the electric grid, lower electric system costs, and eventually, inexpensive storage and backup for renewable electricity.

We report the design, formation and testing of QD-protein assemblies that function as chemical sensors. In these assemblies, multiple copies of Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) coordinate to each QD by a C-terminal oligohistidine segment and function as sugar receptors. Sensors are self-assembled in solution in a controllable manner. In one configuration, a beta-cyclodextrin-QSY9 dark quencher conjugate bound in the MBP saccharide binding site results in fluorescence resonance energy-transfer (FRET) quenching of QD photoluminescence. Added maltose displaces the beta-cyclodextrin-QSY9, and QD photoluminescence increases in a systematic manner. A second maltose sensor assembly consists of QDs coupled with Cy3-labelled MBP bound to beta-cyclodextrin-Cy3.5. In this case, the QD donor drives sensor function through a two-step FRET mechanism that overcomes inherent QD donor-acceptor distance limitations. Quantum dot-biomolecule assemblies constructed using these methods may facilitate development of new hybrid sensing materials.

Size-Dependent Bacterial Growth Inhibition and Mechanism of Antibacterial Activity of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles	LANGMUIR												The antibacterial properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles were investigated using both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. These studies demonstrate that ZnO nanoparticles have a wide range of antibacterial activities toward various microorganisms that are commonly found in environmental settings. The antibacterial activity of the ZnO nanoparticles was inversely proportional to the size of the nanoparticles in S. aureus. Surprisingly, the antibacterial activity did not require specific UV activation using artificial lamps, rather activation was achieved under ambient lighting conditions. Northern analyses of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) specific genes and confocal microscopy suggest that the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles might involve both the production of reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of nanoparticles in the cytoplasm or on the outer membranes. Overall, the experimental results suggest that ZnO nanoparticles could be developed as antibacterial agents against a wide range of microorganisms to control and prevent the spreading and persistence of bacterial infections.

However, the hydrophilicity of MXene films may affect their stability and reliability when applied in moist or wet environments. Herein, for the first time, an efficient and facile approach is reported to fabricate freestanding, flexible, and hydrophobic MXene foam with reasonable strength by assembling MXene sheets into films followed by a hydrazine-induced foaming process. In striking contrast to well-known hydrophilic MXene materials, the MXene foams surprisingly exhibit hydrophobic surfaces and outstanding water resistance and durability. More interestingly, a much enhanced EMI-shielding effectiveness of approximate to 70 dB is achieved for the lightweight MXene foam as compared to its unfoamed film counterpart (53 dB) due to the highly efficient wave attenuation in the favorable porous structure. Therefore, the hydrophobic, flexible, and lightweight MXene foam with an excellent EMI-shielding performance is highly promising for applications in aerospace and portable and wearable smart electronics.					zhang, hao-bin/Y-9093-2018; Liu, Ji/JOZ-2064-2023; Zhou, Aiguo/B-3560-2008; Yu, Zhong-Zhen/M-2252-2018	Zhou, Aiguo/0000-0002-0029-9060; Yu, Zhong-Zhen/0000-0001-8357-3362													0935-9648	1521-4095				OCT 11	2017	29	38							1702367	10.1002/adma.201702367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.201702367								28799671					WOS:000412452500011

J	Yeh, JW				Yeh, Jien-Wei			Recent progress in high-entropy alloys	ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX												The thirty or so presently used common alloy systems are typically based on one or, at most, two elements. It has been considered that alloys consisting of a greater number of principal elements will form complicated and brittle microstructures, and hence research regarding such multi-principal-element alloys has received very limited attention. It was suggested by Yeh in 1995, however, that alloy systems with five or more metallic elements will in fact possess higher mixing entropies, and therefore favour the formation of multielement solid-solution phases, as opposed to the inferred complex structures consisting of many intermetallic compounds. Indeed, work over the past decade into such multi-principal-element alloys, which have fittingly been coined as "high-entropy alloys" (HE alloys), has found them to form simple phases with nanocrystalline and even amorphous structures. In addition to the high-entropy effect, these structural characteristics are ascribed to the large lattice distortion and sluggish diffusion of such multielemental mixtures. Dependant upon the composition and/or processing route, HE alloys have been found to possess a wide spectrum of microstructures and properties. The superior properties exhibited by HE alloys over conventional alloys, along with the huge number of possible compositions that may give new phenomena and functional uses, makes these proposed HE alloys of great interest not only from a research perspective but also in numerous industrial applications. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress made on HE alloys, and possible future directions.																			0151-9107	1958-5934				NOV-DEC	2006	31	6					633	648		10.3166/acsm.31.633-648	http://dx.doi.org/10.3166/acsm.31.633-648													WOS:000242739500001
J	Roundy, S; Wright, PK				Roundy, S; Wright, PK			A piezoelectric vibration based generator for wireless electronics	SMART MATERIALS & STRUCTURES												Enabling technologies for wireless sensor networks have gained considerable attention in research communities over the past few years. It is highly desirable, even necessary in certain situations, for wireless sensor nodes to be self-powered. With this coal in mind, a vibration based piezoelectric generator has been developed as an enabling technology for wireless sensor networks. The focus of this paper is to discuss the modeling, design. and optimization of a piezoelectric generator based on a two-layer bending element. An analytical model of the generator has been developed and validated. In addition to providing intuitive design insight, the model has been used as the basis for design optimization. Designs of 1 cm(3) in size generated using the model have demonstrated a power output of 375 muW from a vibration source of 2.5 m s(-2) at 120 Hz. Furthermore, a 1 cm(3) generator has been used to power a custom designed 1.9 GHz radio transmitter from the same vibration source.

We investigate the coupling between pairs of elliptical metal particles by simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that the resonant wavelength peak of two interacting particles is red-shifted from that of a single particle because of near-field coupling. It is also found that the shift decays approximately exponentially with increasing particle spacing and become negligible when the gap between the two particles exceeds about 2.5 times the particle short-axis length.

We find that it is a symmetry-protected topological semimetal with a single pair of three-dimensional (3D) Dirac points in the bulk and nontrivial Fermi arcs on the surfaces. It can be driven into a topological insulator and a Weyl semimetal state by symmetry breaking, or into a quantum spin Hall insulator with a gap more than 100 meV by reducing dimensionality. We propose that the 3D Dirac cones in the bulk of Cd3As2 can support sizable linear quantum magnetoresistance even up to room temperature.

J	Girifalco, LA; Hodak, M; Lee, RS				Girifalco, LA; Hodak, M; Lee, RS			Carbon nanotubes, buckyballs, ropes, and a universal graphitic potential	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												The potential energies of interaction between two parallel, infinitely long carbon nanotubes of the same diameter, and between C-60 and a nanotube in various arrangements, were computed by assuming a continuous distribution of atoms on the tube and ball surfaces and using a Lennard-Jones (LJ) carbon-carbon potential. The constants in the LJ potential are different for graphene-graphene and C-60-C-60 interactions. From these, the constants for tube-C-60 interactions were estimated using averaging rules from the theory of dispersion forces. For tubes in ropes, the cohesive energy per unit length, the compressibility, and the equilibrium separation distance were computed as a function of tube radius. For a C-60 molecule interacting with tubes, the binding energy inside a tube was much higher than on a tube or at the tube mouth. Within a tube, the binding energy was highest at a spherically capped end. The potential energies for tubes of all radii, as well as for interactions between C-60 molecules, for a C-60 molecule outside of a nanotube, between a C-60 molecule and a graphene sheet, and between graphene sheets, all fell on the same curve when plotted in terms of certain reduced parameters. Because of this, all the potentials can be represented by a simple analytic form, thereby greatly simplifying all computations of van der Waals interactions in graphitic systems. Binding-energy results were all consistent with the recently proposed mechanism of peapod formation based on transmission electron microscopy experiments.

For all cases, quantitative values for the onset of cytotoxic effects in serum-free culture media are given. These values are correlated with microscope images in which the uptake of the particles by the cells has been investigated. Our data suggest that in addition to the release of toxic Cd2+ ions from the particles also their surface chemistry, in particular their stability toward aggregation, plays an important role for cytotoxic effects. Additional patch clamp experiments investigate effects of the particles on currents through ion channels.

However, the task of generating excited states with long lifetimes has been met with limited success, owing to the ultrafast deactivation of the highly active excited states(5). Here, we present a design rule that can be used to tune the emission lifetime of a wide range of luminescent organic molecules, based on effective stabilization of triplet excited states through strong coupling in H-aggregated molecules. Our experimental data revealed that luminescence lifetimes up to 1.35 s, which are several orders of magnitude longer than those of conventional organic fluorophores(6,7), can be realized under ambient conditions. These results outline a fundamental principle to design organic molecules with extended lifetimes of excited states, providing a major step forward in expanding the scope of organic phosphorescence applications.

Nucleation, stability and current-induced motion of isolated magnetic skyrmions in nanostructures	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable spin configurations, which usually originate from chiral interactions known as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Skyrmion lattices were initially observed in bulk non-centrosymmetric crystals, but have more recently been noted in ultrathin films, where their existence is explained by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced by the proximity to an adjacent layer with strong spin-orbit coupling. Skyrmions are promising candidates as information carriers for future information-processing devices due to their small size (down to a few nanometres) and to the very small current densities needed to displace skyrmion lattices. However, any practical application will probably require the creation, manipulation and detection of isolated skyrmions in magnetic thin-film nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate by numerical investigations that an isolated skyrmion can be a stable configuration in a nanostructure, can be locally nucleated by injection of spin-polarized current, and can be displaced by current-induced spin torques, even in the presence of large defects.

J	Sheng, WC; Gasteiger, HA; Shao-Horn, Y				Sheng, Wenchao; Gasteiger, Hubert A.; Shao-Horn, Yang			Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution Reaction Kinetics on Platinum: Acid vs Alkaline Electrolytes	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY												The kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on polycrystalline platinum [Pt(pc)] and high surface area carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt/C) were studied in 0.1 M KOH using rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements. After corrections of noncompensated solution resistance from ac impedance spectroscopy and of hydrogen mass transport in the HOR branch, the kinetic current densities were fitted to the Butler-Volmer equation using a transfer coefficient of alpha = 0.5, from which HOR/HER exchange current densities on Pt(pc) and Pt/C were obtained, and the HOR/HER mechanisms in alkaline solution were discussed. Unlike the HOR/HER rates on Pt electrodes in alkaline solution, the HOR/HER rates on a Pt electrode in 0.1 M HClO(4) were limited entirely by hydrogen diffusion, which renders the quantification of the HOR/HER kinetics impossible by conventional RDE measurements. The simulation of the hydrogen anode performance based on the specific exchange current densities of the HOR/HER at 80 degrees C illustrates that in addition to the oxygen reduction reaction cell voltage loss on the cathode, the slow HOR kinetics are projected to cause significant anode potential losses in alkaline fuel cells for low platinum loadings (> 130 mV at 0.05 mg(Pt)/cm(anode)(2) and 1.5 A/cm(anode)(2)), contrary to what is reported for proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

Solution-processed small-molecule solar cells with 6.7% efficiency	NATURE MATERIALS												Organic photovoltaic devices that can be fabricated by simple processing techniques are under intense investigation in academic and industrial laboratories because of their potential to enable mass production of flexible and coste-ffective devices(1,2). Most of the attention has been focused on solution-processed polymer bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells3-7. A combination of polymer design, morphology control, structural insight and device engineering has led to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching the 6-8% range for conjugated polymer/fullerene blends(8,9). Solution-processed small-molecule BHJ (SM BHJ) solar cells have received less attention, and their efficiencies have remained below those of their polymeric counterparts(10). Here, we report efficient solution-processed SM BHJ solar cells based on a new molecular donor, DTS(PTTh2)(2). A record PCE of 6.7% under AM 1.5G irradiation (100mWcm(-2)) is achieved for small-molecule BHJ devices from DTS(PTTh2)(2) V PC70BM (donor to acceptor ratio of 7: 3). This high efficiency was obtained by using remarkably small percentages of solvent additive (0.25% v/v of 1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) during the film-forming process, which leads to reduced domain sizes in the BHJ layer. These results provide important progress for solution-processed organic photovoltaics and demonstrate that solar cells fabricated from small donor molecules can compete with their polymeric counterparts.

Engineered doping of organic semiconductors for enhanced thermoelectric efficiency	NATURE MATERIALS												Significant improvements to the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT have emerged in recent years, primarily due to the engineering of material composition and nanostructure in inorganic semiconductors(1) (ISCs). However, many present high-ZT materials are based on low-abundance elements that pose challenges for scale-up, as they entail high material costs in addition to brittleness and difficulty in large-area deposition. Here we demonstrate a strategy to improve ZT in conductive polymers and other organic semiconductors (OSCs) for which the base elements are earth-abundant. By minimizing total dopant volume, we show that all three parameters constituting ZT vary in a manner so that ZT increases; this stands in sharp contrast to ISCs, for which these parameters have trade-offs. Reducing dopant volume is found to be as important as optimizing carrier concentration when maximizing ZT in OSCs. Implementing this strategy with the dopant poly(styrenesulphonate) in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), we achieve ZT = 0.42 at room temperature.

The first step of this procedure involved the formation of platinum nanoparticles by reducing PtCl2 With ethylene glycol heated to similar to160 degreesC. Due to their close match in crystal structure and lattice constants, these platinum nanoparticles could serve as seeds for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of silver that was produced in the solution via the reduction of AgNO3 with ethylene glycol. When surfactants such as poly(vinyl pyrrolldone) (PVP) were present in this solution, the silver could be directed to grow into uniform nanowires with aspect ratios as high as similar to1000. Measurements of transport property at room temperature indicated that these nanowires were electrically continuous with a conductivity of approximately 0.8 X 10(5) S/CM.

Monolayer transition-metal dichal-cogenides have recently emerged as interesting candidates for optoelectronic applications due to their unique optical properties(9-16). Electroluminescence has already been observed from monolayer MoS2 devices(17,18). However, the electroluminescence efficiency was low and the linewidth broad due both to the poor optical quality of the MoS2 and to ineffective contacts. Here, we report electroluminescence from lateral p-n junctions in monolayer WSe2 induced electrostatically using a thin boron nitride support as a dielectric layer with multiple metal gates beneath. This structure allows effective injection of electrons and holes, and, combined with the high optical quality of WSe2, yields bright electroluminescence with 1,000 times smaller injection current and 10 times smaller linewidth than in MoS2 (refs 17,18).

However, although the efficiency and durability of harvesting materials such as piezoelectric nanowires have steadily improved, the voltage and power produced by a single nanowire are insufficient for real devices. The integration of large numbers of nanowire energy harvesters into a single power source is therefore necessary, requiring alignment of the nanowires as well as synchronization of their charging and discharging processes. Here, we demonstrate the vertical and lateral integration of ZnO nanowires into arrays that are capable of producing sufficient power to operate real devices. A lateral integration of 700 rows of ZnO nanowires produces a peak voltage of 1.26 V at a low strain of 0.19%, which is potentially sufficient to recharge an AA battery. In a separate device, a vertical integration of three layers of ZnO nanowire arrays produces a peak power density of 2.7 mW cm(-3). We use the vertically integrated nanogenerator to power a nanowire pH sensor and a nanowire UV sensor, thus demonstrating a self-powered system composed entirely of nanowires.

The first step of this process involved the formation of Pt (or Ag) nanoparticles by reducing PtCl2 (or AgNO3) with ethylene glycol (EG) heated to similar to160 degreesC. These Pt (or Ag) nanoparticles could serve as seeds for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of silver (formed by reducing AgNO3 with EG) because of their close match in crystal structure and lattice constants. In the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), the growth of silver could be directed into a highly anisotropic mode to form uniform nanowires with aspect ratios as high as similar to1000. UV-visible spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, XRD, and electron diffraction were used to characterize these silver nanowires, indicating the formation of a highly pure phase, as well as a uniform diameter and bicrystalline structure. Both morphology and aspect ratios of these silver nanostructures could be varied from nanoparticles and nanorods to long nanowires by adjusting the reaction conditions, including the ratio of PVP to silver nitrate, reaction temperature, and seeding conditions. Measurements of the transport properties at room temperature indicated that these silver nanowires were electrically continuous with a conductivity (similar to0.8 x 10(5) S/cm) approaching that of bulk silver.

Metal films containing just a few layers of atoms can be fabricated on substrates using deposition techniques(7), but the production of freestanding ultrathin structures remains a significant challenge. Here we report the facile synthesis of freestanding hexagonal palladium nanosheets that are less than 10 atomic layers thick, using carbon monoxide as a surface confining agent. The as-prepared nanosheets are blue in colour and exhibit a well-defined but tunable surface plasmon resonance peak in the near-infrared region. The combination of photothermal stability and biocompatibility makes palladium nanosheets promising candidates for photothermal therapy.

Owing to the versatility of graphene properties and projected applications, several production techniques are summarized, ranging from the mechanical exfoliation of high-quality graphene to the direct growth on carbides or metal substrates and from the chemical routes using graphene oxide to the newly developed approach at the molecular level. The most promising and appealing properties of graphene are summarized from an exponentially growing literature, with a particular attention to matching production methods to characteristics and to applications. In particular, we report on the high carrier mobility value in suspended and annealed samples for electronic devices, on the thickness-dependent optical transparency and, in the mechanical section, on the high robustness and full integration of graphene in sensing device applications. Finally, we emphasize on the high potential of graphene not only as a post-silicon materials for CMOS device application but more ambitiously as a platform for post-CMOS molecular architecture in electronic information processing.

J	Plett, GL				Plett, GL			Extended Kalman filtering for battery management systems of LiPB-based HEV battery packs - Part 3. State and parameter estimation	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES												Battery management systems in hybrid-electric-vehicle battery packs must estimate values descriptive of the pack's present operating condition. These include: battery state-of-charge, power fade, capacity fade, and instantaneous available power. The estimation mechanism must adapt to changing cell characteristics as cells age and therefore provide accurate estimates over the lifetime of the pack. In a series of three papers, we propose methods, based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF), that are able to accomplish these goals for a lithium ion polymer battery pack. We expect that they will also work well on other battery chemistries. These papers cover the required mathematical background, cell modeling and system identification requirements, and the final solution, together with results. This third paper concludes the series by presenting five additional applications where either an EKF or results from EKF may be used in typical BMS algorithms: initializing state estimates after the vehicle has been idle for some time; estimating state-of-charge with dynamic error bounds on the estimate; estimating pack available dis/charge power; tracking changing pack parameters (including power fade and capacity fade) as the pack ages, and therefore providing a quantitative estimate of state-of-health; and determining which cells must be equalized. Results from pack tests are presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The inhibition of any secondary nucleation during homogeneous growth was controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions: temperature, gold precursor to seed particle concentration, and pH. This method presents improved results regarding the traditional Frens method in several aspects: (i) it produces particles of higher monodispersity; (ii) it allows better control of the gold nanoparticle size and size distribution; and (iii) it leads to higher concentrations. Gold nanoparticles synthesized following this method can be further functionalized with a wide variety of molecules, hence this method appears to be a promising candidate for application in the fields of biomedicine, photonics, and electronics, among others.

Much of the research conducted so far has focused on electron mobility, which is determined by scattering from charged impurities and other inhomogeneities(6,7). However, another important quantity, the quantum capacitance, has been largely overlooked. Here, we report a direct measurement of the quantum capacitance of graphene as a function of gate potential using a three-electrode electrochemical configuration. The quantum capacitance has a non-zero minimum at the Dirac point and a linear increase on both sides of the minimum with relatively small slopes. Our findings-which are not predicted by theory for ideal graphene-suggest that charged impurities also influences the quantum capacitance. We also measured the capacitance in aqueous solutions at different ionic concentrations, and our results strongly indicate that the long-standing puzzle about the interfacial capacitance in carbon-based electrodes has a quantum origin.

J	Meyers, MA; Vöhringer, O; Lubarda, VA				Meyers, MA; Vöhringer, O; Lubarda, VA			The onset of twinning in metals:: A constitutive description	ACTA MATERIALIA												A constitutive approach is developed that predicts the critical stress for twinning as a function of external (temperature, strain rate) and internal (grain size, stacking-fault energy) parameters. Plastic deformation by slip and twinning are considered as competitive mechanisms. The twinning stress is equated to the slip stress based on the plastic flow by thermally assisted movement of dislocations over obstacles, which leads to successful prediction of the slip-twinning transition. The model is applied to body centered cubic, face centered cubic, and hexagonal metals and alloys: Fe, Cu, brasses, and Ti, respectively. A constitutive expression for the twinning stress in BCC metals is developed using dislocation emission from a source and the formation of pile-ups, as rate-controlling mechanism. Employing an Eshelby-type analysis, the critical size of twin nucleus and twinning stress are correlated to the twin-boundary energy, which is directly related to the stacking-fault energy (SFE) for FCC metals. The effects of grain size and SFE are examined and the results indicate that the grain-scale pile-ups are not the source of the stress concentrations giving rise to twinning in FCC metals. The constitutive description of the slip-twinning transition are incorporated into the Weertman-Ashby deformation mechanism maps, thereby enabling the introduction of a twinning domain. This is illustrated for titanium with a grain size of 100 mum. (C) 2001 Acta Materialia Inc, Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This groundbreaking approach to temporary metallic implants is one of the latest developments in biomaterials science that is being rediscovered. It is a challenging topic, and several secrets still remain that might revolutionize various biomedical implants currently in clinical use. Magnesium alloys were investigated as implant materials long ago. A very early clinical report was given in 1878 by the physician Edward C. Huse. He used magnesium wires as ligature for bleeding vessels. Magnesium alloys for clinical use were explored during the last two centuries mainly by surgeons with various clinical backgrounds, such as cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and general surgery. Nearly all patients benefited from the treatment with magnesium implants. Although most patients experienced subcutaneous gas cavities caused by rapid implant corrosion, most patients had no pain and almost no infections were observed during the postoperative follow-up. This review critically summarizes the in vitro and in vivo knowledge and experience that has been reported on the use of magnesium and its alloys to advance the field of biodegradable metals.

J	Agnew, SR; Duygulu, Ö				Agnew, SR; Duygulu, Ö			Plastic anisotropy and the role of non-basal slip in magnesium alloy AZ31B	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY					International Symposium on Plasticity	JUL 07-10, 2003	Quebec City, CANADA					Mechanistic explanations for the plastic behavior of a wrought magnesium alloy are developed using a combination of experimental and simulation techniques. Parameters affecting the practical sheet formability, such as strain hardening rate, strain rate sensitivity, the degree of anisotropy, and the stresses and strains at fracture, are examined systematically by conducting tensile tests of variously oriented samples at a range of temperatures (room temperature to 250 degreesC and strain rates (10(-5)-0.1s(-1)). Polycrystal plasticity simulations are used to model the observed anisotropy and texture evolution. Strong in-plane anisotropy observed at low temperatures is attributed to the initial texture and the greater than anticipated non-basal cross-slip of dislocations with dropadrop type Burgers vectors. The agreement between the measured and simulated anisotropy and texture is further validated by direct observations of the dislocation microstructures using transmission electron microscopy. The increase in the ductility with temperature is accompanied by a decrease in the flow stress, an increase in the strain rate sensitivity, and a decrease in the normal anisotropy. Polycrystal simulations indicate that an increased activity of non-basal, dropc + adrop, dislocations provides a self-consistent explanation for the observed changes in the anisotropy with increasing temperature.

J	Gartner, E				Gartner, E			Industrially interesting approaches to "low-CO<sub>2</sub>" cements	CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH					Symposium on the Role of Cement Science in Sustainable Development	SEP 04, 2003	Dundee Univ, Dundee, SCOTLAND		Dundee Univ			This article discusses the practicality of replacing portland cements with alternative hydraulic cements that could result in lower total CO2 emissions per unit volume of concrete of equivalent performance. Currently, the cement industry is responding rapidly to the perceived societal need for reduced CO2 emissions by increasing the production of blended portland cements using supplementary cementitious materials that are principally derived from industrial by-products, such as blast-furnace slags and coal combustion fly ashes. However, the supplies of such by-products of suitable quality are limited. An alternative solution is to use natural pozzolans, although they must still be activated either by portland cement or lime or by alkali silicates or hydroxides, the production of all of which still involves significant CO2 emissions. Moreover, concretes based on activated pozzolans often require curing at elevated temperatures, which significantly limits their field of application. The most promising alternative cementing systems for general concrete applications at ambient temperatures currently appear to be those based at least in part on calcium sulfates, the availability of which is increasing due to the widespread implementation of sulfur dioxide emission controls. These include calcium sulfoaluminate-belite-ferrite cements of the type developed in China under the generic name "Third Cement Series" (TCS) and other similar systems that make good use of the potential synergies among calcium sulfate, calcium silicate and calcium aluminate hydrates. However, a great deal more research is required to solve significant unresolved processing and reactivity questions and to establish the durability of concretes made from such cements. If we are to use these potentially more CO2-efficient technologies on a large enough scale to have a significant global impact, we will also have to develop the performance data needed to justify changes to construction codes and standards.

The most stable configuration has one carbon atom on top of a boron atom, and the other centered above a BN ring.

In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096 eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082 eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of similar to 3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.

Gate-induced insulating state in bilayer graphene devices	NATURE MATERIALS												The potential of graphene-based materials consisting of one or a few layers of graphite for integrated electronics originates from the large room-temperature carrier mobility in these systems (similar to 10,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). However, the realization of electronic devices such as field-effect transistors will require controlling and even switching offthe electrical conductivity by means of gate electrodes, which is made difficult by the absence of a bandgap in the intrinsic material. Here, we demonstrate the controlled induction of an insulating state-with large suppression of the conductivity-in bilayer graphene, by using a double-gate device configuration that enables an electric field to be applied perpendicular to the plane. The dependence of the resistance on temperature and electric field, and the absence of any effect in a single-layer device, strongly suggest that the gate-induced insulating state originates from the recently predicted opening of a bandgap between valence and conduction bands.

It has long been known that liquid molecules close to a solid surface form layered solid-like structures, but little is known about the connection between this nanolayer and the thermal properties of the suspensions. Here, we have modified the Maxwell equation for the effective thermal conductivity of solid/liquid suspensions to include the effect of this ordered nanolayer. Because this ordered nanolayer has a major impact on nanofluid thermal conductivity when the particle diameter is less than 10 nm, a new direction is indicated for development of next-generation coolants.																			1388-0764	1572-896X				APR	2003	5	1-2					167	171		10.1023/A:1024438603801	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024438603801													WOS:000183704000020
J	Miracle, DB				Miracle, DB			Metal matrix composites - From science to technological significance	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Over the past two decades - a period coinciding with publication of Composites Science and Technology - metal matrix composites (MMCs) have been transformed from a topic of scientific and intellectual interest to a material of broad technological and commercial significance. The worldwide MMC markets in 1999 accounted for 2500 metric tons valued at over $100M. Important MMC applications in the ground transportation (auto and rail), thermal management, aerospace, industrial, recreational and infrastructure industries have been enabled by functional properties that include high structural efficiency, excellent wear resistance, and attractive thermal and electrical characteristics. A suite of challenging technical issues has been overcome, including affordable primary and secondary processing, material design and development methodologies, and characterization and control of interfacial properties. This article describes the technological features that characterize the MMC industry. Matrix/reinforcement systems and primary and secondary processes of commercial significance will be broadly described. Several metrics that underscore the growing maturity of the MMC industry will be discussed, including the emergence of a second tier support industry and the growth of standardized materials and methods. MMC applications in the major markets of ground transportation, thermal management, aerospace, industrial, recreational and infrastructure will be described. Successful commercialization strategies will be discussed and insights for achieving expanded MMC applications will be given. A forward look at candidate approaches for the next generation of MMCs will be provided, including projections of new MMC paradigms. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Tunable sieving of ions using graphene oxide membranes	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Graphene oxide membranes show exceptional molecular permeation properties, with promise for many applications(1-5). However, their use in ion sieving and desalination technologies is limited by a permeation cutoff of similar to 9 angstrom (ref. 4), which is larger than the diameters of hydrated ions of common salts(4,6). The cutoff is determined by the interlayer spacing (d) of similar to 13.5 angstrom, typical for graphene oxide laminates that swell in water(2,4). Achieving smaller d for the laminates immersed in water has proved to be a challenge. Here, we describe how to control d by physical confinement and achieve accurate and tunable ion sieving. Membranes with d from similar to 9.8 angstrom to 6.4 angstrom are demonstrated, providing a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions. In this regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with energy barriers of similar to 10-100 kJ mol(-1) depending on d. Importantly, permeation rates decrease exponentially with decreasing sieve size but water transport is weakly affected (by a factor of <2). The latter is attributed to a low barrier for the entry of water molecules and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries. Building on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable method to obtain graphene-based membranes with limited swelling, which exhibit 97% rejection for NaCl.

It forms many allotropes, some known from ancient times (diamond and graphite) and some discovered 10-20 years ago (fullerenes and nanotubes). Interestingly, the two-dimensional form (graphene) was only obtained very recently, immediately attracting a great deal of attention. Electrons in graphene, obeying a linear dispersion relation, behave like massless relativistic particles. This results in the observation of a number of very peculiar electronic properties - from an anomalous quantum Hall effect to the absence of localization - in this, the first two-dimensional material. It also provides a bridge between condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics, and opens new perspectives for carbon-based electronics.

Evolution of Graphene Growth on Ni and Cu by Carbon Isotope Labeling	NANO LETTERS												Large-area graphene growth is required for the development and production of electronic devices. Recently, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbons has shown some promise in growing large-area graphene or few-layer graphene films on metal substrates such as Ni and Cu. It has been proposed that CVD growth of graphene on Ni occurs by a C segregation or precipitation process whereas graphene on Cu grows by a surface adsorption process. Here we used carbon isotope labeling in conjunction with Raman spectroscopic mapping to track carbon during the growth process. The data clearly show that at high temperatures sequentially introduced isotopic carbon diffuses into the Ni first, mixes, and then segregates and precipitates at the surface of Ni forming graphene and/or graphite with a uniform mixture of C-12 and C-13 as determined by the peak position of the Raman G-band peak. On the other hand, graphene growth on Cu is clearly by surface adsorption where the spatial distribution of C-12 and C-13 follows the precursor time sequence and the linear growth rate ranges from about 1 to as high as 6 mu m/min depending upon Cu grain orientation. This data is critical in guiding the graphene growth process as we try to achieve the highest quality graphene for electronic devices.

Design/methodology/approach - First, the origin of residual stresses is explored and a simple theoretical model is developed to predict residual stress distributions. Next, experimental methods are used to measure the residual stress profiles in a set of test samples produced with different process parameters. Findings - Residual stresses are found to be very large in SLM parts. In general, the residual stress profile consists of two zones of large tensile stresses at the top and bottom of the part, and a large zone of intermediate compressive stress in between. The most important parameters determining the magnitude and shape of the residual stress profiles are the material properties, the sample and substrate height, the laser scanning strategy and the heating conditions. Research limitations/implications - All experiments were conducted on parts produced from stainless steel powder (316L) and quantitative results cannot be simply extrapolated to other materials. However, most qualitative results can still be generalized. Originality/value - This paper can serve as an aid in understanding the importance of residual stresses in SLS/SLM and other additive manufacturing processes involving a localized heat input. Some of the conclusions can be used to avoid problems associated with residual stresses.																			1355-2546	1758-7670					2006	12	5					254	265		10.1108/13552540610707013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13552540610707013													WOS:000242521000003

Giant spin-orbit-induced spin splitting in two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenide semiconductors	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Fully relativistic first-principles calculations based on density functional theory are performed to study the spin-orbit-induced spin splitting in monolayer systems of the transition-metal dichalcogenides MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2. All these systems are identified as direct-band-gap semiconductors. Giant spin splittings of 148-456 meV result from missing inversion symmetry. Full out-of-plane spin polarization is due to the two-dimensional nature of the electron motion and the potential gradient asymmetry. By suppression of the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation, spin lifetimes are expected to be very long. Because of the giant spin splittings, the studied materials have great potential in spintronics applications.

Two-Dimensional, Ordered, Double Transition Metals Carbides (MXenes)	ACS NANO												The higher the chemical diversity and structural complexity of two-dimensional (2D) materials, the higher the likelihood they possess unique and useful properties. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) is used to predict the existence of two new families of 2D ordered, carbides (MXenes), M'M-2 '' C-2 and M'M-2 '' C-2(3), where M' and M '' are two different early transition metals. In these solids, M' layers sandwich M" carbide layers. By synthesizing Mo2TiC2Tx, Mo2Ti2C3Tx, and Cr2TiC2Tx (where T is a surface termination), we validated the DFT predictions. Since the Mo and Cr atoms are on the outside, they control the 2D flakes' chemical and electrochemical properties. The latter was proven by showing quite different electrochemical behavior of Mo2TiC2Tx and Ti3C2Tx. This work further expands the family of 2D materials, offering additional choices of structures, chemistries, and ultimately useful properties.

In the case of bulk heterojunctions of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a soluble fullerene derivative ([6,6]-phenyl C-61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM), both blend morphology and photovoltaic device performance are influenced by various treatments, including choice of solvent, rate of drying, thermal annealing and vapour annealing. Although the protocols differ significantly, the maximum power conversion efficiency values reported for the various techniques are comparable (4-5%). In this paper, we demonstrate that these techniques all lead to a common arrangement of the components, which consists of a vertically and laterally phase-separated blend of crystalline P3HT and PCBM. We propose a morphology evolution that consists of an initial crystallization of P3HT chains, followed by diffusion of PCBM molecules to nucleation sites, at which aggregates of PCBM then grow.

We believe that Portland-based cement approaches will dominate in the near future due to economies of scale, levels of process optimisation, availability of raw materials and market confidence. Two product-based approaches can deliver substantial additional reductions in their global CO2 emissions, reducing the need for costly investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) over the next 20-30 years: 1. Increased use of low-CO2 supplements (SCMs) as partial replacements for Portland cement clinker. 2. More efficient use of Portland cement clinker in mortars and concretes.

The quantum spin Hall effect(3), chiral superconductivity(8), giant magnetoresistance(9) and various exotic field-dependent states7 have been predicted in monolayer silicene. Despite recent progress regarding the epitaxial synthesis of silicene(8-10) and investigation of its electronic properties(11,13-15), to date there has been no report of experimental silicene devices because of its air stability issue(16). Here, we report a silicene field-effect transistor, corroborating theoretical expectations regarding its ambipolar Dirac charge transport(17), with a measured roomtemperature mobility of similar to 100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) attributed to acoustic phonon-limited transport(18) and grain boundary scattering. These results are enabled by a growth-transfer-fabrication process that we have devised-silicene encapsulated delamination with native electrodes. This approach addresses a major challenge for material preservation of silicene during transfer and device fabrication and is applicable to other air-sensitive two-dimensional materials such as germanene(2-4) and phosphorene(19,20). Silicene's allotropic affinity with bulk silicon and its low-temperature synthesis compared with graphene or alternative two-dimensional semiconductors suggest a more direct integration with ubiquitous semiconductor technology.					akinwande, deji/JOZ-9014-2023; Cinquanta, Eugenio/J-1633-2019; Fanciulli, Marco/J-9940-2013; FANCIULLI, MARCO/AAE-5125-2022; Grazianetti, Carlo/Q-8760-2017; Cinquanta, Eugenio/J-7747-2016; Tao, Li/D-3622-2012; Molle, Alessandro/D-8952-2013	FANCIULLI, MARCO/0000-0003-2951-0859; Grazianetti, Carlo/0000-0003-0060-9804; Cinquanta, Eugenio/0000-0002-4721-5215; Tao, Li/0000-0001-6055-6068; Molle, Alessandro/0000-0002-3860-4120													1748-3387	1748-3395				MAR 15	2015	10	3					227	231		10.1038/NNANO.2014.325	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NNANO.2014.325								25643256					WOS:000350799700012

Current saturation in zero-bandgap, topgated graphene field-effect transistors	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												The novel electronic properties of graphene(1-4), including a linear energy dispersion relation and purely two-dimensional structure, have led to intense research into possible applications of this material in nanoscale devices. Here we report the first observation of saturating transistor characteristics in a graphene field-effect transistor. The saturation velocity depends on the charge-carrier concentration and we attribute this to scattering by interfacial phonons in the SiO2 layer supporting the graphene channels(5,6). Unusual features in the current-voltage characteristic are explained by a field-effect model and diffusive carrier transport in the presence of a singular point in the density of states. The electrostatic modulation of the channel through an efficiently coupled top gate yields transconductances as high as 150 mu S mu m(-1) despite low on-off current ratios. These results demonstrate the feasibility of two-dimensional graphene devices for analogue and radio-frequency circuit applications without the need for bandgap engineering.

In this study, we address the issue of cytotoxicity and immunogenic effects of gold nanoparticles on RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The cytotoxicity of gold nanoparticles has been correlated with a detailed study of their endocytotic uptake using various microscopy tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal-laser-scanning microscopy (CFLSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our findings suggest that Au(0) nanoparticles are not cytotoxic, reduce the production of reactive oxygen and nitrite species, and do not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL1-, making them suitable candidates for nanomedicine. AFM measurements suggest that gold nanoparticles are internalized inside the cell via a mechanism involving pinocytosis, while CFLSM and TEM studies indicate their internalization in lysosomal bodies arranged in perinuclear fashion. Our studies thus underline the noncytotoxic, nonimmunogenic, and biocompatible properties ofgold nanoparticles with the potential for application in nanoimmunology, nanomedicine, and nanobiotechnology.

The common solid electrolytes were found to have a limited electrochemical window. Our results suggest that the outstanding stability of the solid electrolyte materials is not thermodynamically intrinsic but is originated from kinetic stabilizations. The sluggish kinetics of the decomposition reactions cause a high overpotential leading to a nominally wide electrochemical window observed in many experiments. The decomposition products, similar to the solid-electrolyte-interphases, mitigate the extreme chemical potential from the electrodes and protect the solid electrolyte from further decompositions. With the aid of the first-principles calculations, we revealed the passivation mechanism of these decomposition interphases and quantified the extensions of the electrochemical window from the interphases. We also found that the artificial coating layers applied at the solid electrolyte and electrode interfaces have a similar effect of passivating the solid electrolyte. Our newly gained understanding provided general principles for developing solid electrolyte materials with enhanced stability and for engineering interfaces in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries.

Hydrazine-reduction of graphite- and graphene oxide	CARBON												We prepared hydrazine-reduced materials from both graphite oxide (GO) particles, which were not exfoliated, and completely exfoliated individual graphene oxide platelets, and then analyzed their chemical and structural properties by elemental analysis, XPS, TGA, XRD, and SEM. Both reduced materials showed distinctly different chemical and structural properties from one another. While hydrazine reduction of graphene oxide platelets produced agglomerates of exfoliated platelets, the reduction of GO particles produced particles that were not exfoliated. The degree of chemical reduction of reduced GO particles was lower than that of reduced graphene oxide and the BET surface area of reduced GO was much lower than that of reduced graphene oxide.

Moreover, they present a high power density (5000 W kg(-1) at 7.0 Wh kg(-1)) and acceptable cycling performance of similar to 79% retention after 1000 cycles.

As one of the most promising candidates among current thin film photovoltaic techniques, the organic/nature and exhibit compositional/structural dependence in inorganic hybrid perovskites generally inherit polycrystalline regard to their optoelectronic properties. Here, we demonstrate a controllable passivation technique for perovskite films, which enables their compositional change, and allows substantial enhancement in corresponding device performance. By releasing the organic species during annealing, PbI2 phase is presented in perovskite grain boundaries and at the relevant interfaces. The consequent passivation effects and underlying mechanisms are investigated with complementary characterizations, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), time-resolved photoluminescence decay (TRPL), scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM), and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS). This controllable self-induced passivation technique represents an important step to understand the polycrystalline nature of hybrid perovskite thin films and contributes to the development of perovskite solar cells judiciously.

Stable lithium electrodeposition in liquid and nanoporous solid electrolytes	NATURE MATERIALS												Rechargeable lithium, sodium and aluminium metal-based batteries are among the most versatile platforms for high-energy, cost-effective electrochemical energy storage. Non-uniform metal deposition and dendrite formation on the negative electrode during repeated cycles of charge and discharge are major hurdles to commercialization of energy-storage devices based on each of these chemistries. A long-held view is that unstable electrodeposition is a consequence of inherent characteristics of these metals and their inability to form uniform electrodeposits on surfaces with inevitable defects. We report on electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolytes. We find that simple liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends exhibit stable long-term cycling at room temperature, often with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge and thousands of operating hours. We rationalize these observations with the help of surface energy data for the electrolyte/lithium interface and impedance analysis of the interface during different stages of cell operation. Our findings provide support for an important recent theoretical prediction that the surface mobility of lithium is significantly enhanced in the presence of lithium halide salts. Our results also show that a high electrolyte modulus is unnecessary for stable electrodeposition of lithium.

Here, we designed a kind of self-healing injectable micelle/hydrogel composites with multi-functions as wound dressing for joint skin damage. By combining the dynamic Schiff base and copolymer micelle cross-linking in one system, a series of hydrogels were prepared by mixing quaternized chitosan (QCS) and benzaldehyde-terminated Pluronic (center dot)F127 (PF127-CHO) under physiological conditions. The inherent antibacterial property, pH-dependent biodegradation and release behavior were investigated to confirm multi-functions of wound dressing. The hydrogel dressings showed suitable stretchable and compressive property, comparable modulus with human skin, good adhesiveness and fast self-healing ability to bear deformation. The hydrogels exhibited efficient hemostatic performance and biocompatibility. Moreover, the curcumin loaded hydrogel showed good antioxidant ability and pH responsive release profiles. In vivo experiments indicated that curcumin loaded hydrogels significantly accelerated wound healing rate with higher granulation tissue thickness and collagen disposition and upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a full-thickness skin defect model. Taken together, the antibacterial adhesive hydrogels with self-healing and good mechanical property offer significant promise as dressing materials for joints skin wound healing.

Differences in E-g up to 0.5 eV for the same semiconductor depending on the transition chosen were observed.

On the universal scaling behavior of the distance decay of plasmon coupling in metal nanoparticle pairs: A plasmon ruler equation	NANO LETTERS												Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in lithographically fabricated gold (Au) nanodisc pairs are investigated using microabsorption spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting "universal" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a "plasmon ruler equation" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band. We find good agreement of the interparticle separations estimated using this equation with the experimental observations of Reinhard et al.

Biosynthesis of nanoparticles by plant extracts is currently under exploitation. Not only could silver nanoparticles ranging from 55 to 80 nm in size be fabricated, but also triangular or spherical shaped gold nanoparticles could be easily modulated by reacting the novel sundried biomass of Cinnamomum camphora leaf with aqueous silver or gold precursors at ambient temperature. The marked difference of shape control between gold and silver nanoparticles was attributed to the comparative advantage of protective biomolecules and reductive biomolecules. The polyol components and the water-soluble heterocyclic components were mainly responsible for the reduction of silver ions or chloroaurate ions and the stabilization of the nanoparticles, respectively. The sundried leaf in this work was very suitable for simple synthesis of nanoparticles.

Raman scattering from high-frequency phonons in supported <i>n</i>-graphene layer films	NANO LETTERS												Results of room-temperature Raman scattering studies of ultrathin graphitic films supported on Si(100)/SiO2 substrates are reported. The results are significantly different from those known for graphite. Spectra were collected using 514.5 nm radiation on films containing from n = 1 to 20 graphene layers, as determined by atomic force microscopy. Both the first- and second-order Raman spectra show unique signatures of the number of layers in the film. The nGL film analogue of the Raman G-band in graphite exhibits a Lorentzian line shape whose center frequency shifts linearly relative to graphite as similar to 1/n (for n = 1 omega(G) approximate to 1587 cm(-1)). Three weak bands, identified with disorder-induced first-order scattering, are observed at similar to 1350, 1450, and 1500 cm(-1). The similar to 1500 cm(-1) band is weak but relatively sharp and exhibits an interesting n-dependence. In general, the intensity of these D-bands decreases dramatically with increasing n. Three second-order bands are also observed (similar to 2450, similar to 2700, and 3248 cm(-1)). They are analogues to those observed in graphite. However, the similar to 2700 cm(-1) band exhibits an interesting and dramatic change of shape with n. Interestingly, for n < 5 this second-order band is more intense than the G-band.

A higher-order nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and its applications in wave propagation	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS												In recent years there have been many papers that considered the effects of material length scales in the study of mechanics of solids at micro- and/or nano-scales. There are a number of approaches and, among them, one set of papers deals with Eringen's differential nonlocal model and another deals with the strain gradient theories. The modified couple stress theory, which also accounts for a material length scale, is a form of a strain gradient theory. The large body of literature that has come into existence in the last several year has created significant confusion among researchers about the length scales that these various theories contain. The present paper has the objective of establishing the fact that the length scales present in nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory describe two entirely different physical characteristics of materials and structures at nanoscale. By using two principle kernel functions, the paper further presents a theory with application examples which relates the classical nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and it results in a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient theory. In this theory, a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient elasticity system which considers higher-order stress gradients and strain gradient nonlocality is proposed. It is based on the nonlocal effects of the strain field and first gradient strain field. This theory intends to generalize the classical nonlocal elasticity theory by introducing a higher-order strain tensor with nonlocality into the stored energy function. The theory is distinctive because the classical nonlocal stress theory does not include nonlocality of higher-order stresses while the common strain gradient theory only considers local higher-order strain gradients without nonlocal effects in a global sense. By establishing the constitutive relation within the thermodynamic framework, the governing equations of equilibrium and all boundary conditions are derived via the variational approach. Two additional kinds of parameters, the higher-order nonlocal parameters and the nonlocal gradient length coefficients are introduced to account for the size-dependent characteristics of nonlocal gradient materials at nanoscale. To illustrate its application values, the theory is applied for wave propagation in a nonlocal strain gradient system and the new dispersion relations derived are presented through examples for wave propagating in Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko nanobeams. The numerical results based on the new nonlocal strain gradient theory reveal some new findings with respect to lattice dynamics and wave propagation experiment that could not be matched by both the classical nonlocal stress model and the contemporary strain gradient theory. Thus, this higher-order nonlocal strain gradient model provides an explanation to some observations in the classical and nonlocal stress theories as well as the strain gradient theory in these aspects.

Light-emitting diodes by band-structure engineering in van der Waals heterostructures	NATURE MATERIALS												The advent of graphene and related 2D materials1,2 has recently led to a new technology: heterostructures based on these atomically thin crystals(3). The paradigm proved itself extremely versatile and led to rapid demonstration of tunnelling diodes with negative differential resistance(4), tunnelling transistors(5), photovoltaic devices(6,7) and so on. Here, we take the complexity and functionality of such van der Waals heterostructures to the next level by introducing quantum wells (QWs) engineered with one atomic plane precision. We describe light-emitting diodes (LEDs) made by stacking metallic graphene, insulating hexagonal boron nitride and various semiconducting monolayers into complex but carefully designed sequences. Our first devices already exhibit an extrinsic quantum efficiency of nearly 10% and the emission can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies by appropriately choosing and combining 2D semiconductors (monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides). By preparing the heterostructures on elastic and transparent substrates, we show that they can also provide the basis for flexible and semi-transparent electronics. The range of functionalities for the demonstrated heterostructures is expected to grow further on increasing the number of available 2D crystals and improving their electronic quality.

Here we describe the direct synthesis of WS2 monolayers with triangular morphologies and strong room-temperature photoluminescence (PL). The Raman response as well as the luminescence as a function of the number of S-W-S layers is also reported. The PL weakens with increasing number of layers due to a transition from direct band gap in a monolayer to indirect gap in multilayers. The edges of WS2 monolayers exhibit PL signals with extraordinary intensity, around 25 times stronger than that at the platelet's center. The structure and chemical composition of the platelet edges appear to be critical for PL enhancement.

The solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the most exciting of these energy technologies; it is an all-ceramic device that operates at temperatures in the range 500-1,000degreesC. The SOFC offers certain advantages over lower temperature fuel cells, notably its ability to use carbon monoxide as a fuel rather than being poisoned by it, and the availability of high-grade exhaust heat for combined heat and power, or combined cycle gas-turbine applications. Although cost is clearly the most important barrier to widespread SOFC implementation, perhaps the most important technical barriers currently being addressed relate to the electrodes, particularly the fuel electrode or anode. In terms of mitigating global warming, the ability of the SOFC to use commonly available fuels at high efficiency, promises an effective and early reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and hence is one of the lead new technologies for improving the environment. Here, we discuss recent developments of SOFC fuel electrodes that will enable the better use of readily available fuels.

However, the application of such techniques in the area of biomedical devices has been slow due to the stringent performance criteria and concerns related to reproducibility and part quality, when new technologies are in their infancy. However, the use of additive manufacturing technologies in bone tissue engineering has been growing in recent years. Among the different technology options, three dimensional printing (3DP) is becoming popular due to the ability to directly print porous scaffolds with designed shape, controlled chemistry and interconnected porosity. Some of these inorganic scaffolds are biodegradable and have proven ideal for bone tissue engineering, sometimes even with site specific growth factor/drug delivery abilities.

Design principles for electrolytes and interfaces for stable lithium-metal batteries	NATURE ENERGY												The future of electrochemical energy storage hinges on the advancement of science and technology that enables rechargeable batteries that utilize reactive metals as anodes. With specific capacity more than ten times that of the LiC6 anode used in present-day lithium-ion batteries, cells based on Li-metal anodes are of particular interest. Effective strategies for stabilizing the anode in such cells are now understood to be a requirement for progress on exceptional storage technologies, including Li-S and Li-O-2 batteries. Multiple challenges-parasitic reactions of Li-metal with liquid electrolytes, unstable and dendritic electrodeposition, and dendrite-induced short circuits-derailed early efforts to commercialize such lithium-metal batteries. Here we consider approaches for rationally designing electrolytes and Li-metal/electrolyte interfaces for stable, dendrite-free operation of lithium-metal batteries. On the basis of fundamental understanding of the failure modes of reactive metal anodes, we discuss the key variables that govern the stability of electrodeposition at the Li anode and propose a universal framework for designing stable electrolytes and interfaces for lithium-metal batteries.

The as-obtained HPNC-NS show favorable features for electrochemical energy storage such as high specific surface area (S-BET: 2494 m(2)/g), high volume of hierarchical pores (2.28 cm(3)/g), nanosheet structures, rich N-doping (4.7%), and defects. With respect to the multiple synergistic effects of these features, a lithium-ion battery anode and a two-electrode-based supercapacitor have been prepared. A reversible lithium storage capacity of 1865 mA h/g has been reported, which is the highest for N-doped carbon anode materials to the best of our knowledge. The HPNC-NS supercapacitor's electrode in ionic liquid,electrolytes exhibit a capacitane of 242 F/g and energy density of 102 W h/kg (48W h/L), with high cycling life stability (9% loss after 10 000 cycles). Thus, a high-performance Li-ion battery and supercapacitors were successfully assembled for the same electrode material, which was obtained through a one-step and facile large-scale synthesis route. It is promising for next-generation hybrid energy storage and renewable delivery devices.

Water desalination using nanoporous single-layer graphene	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												By creating nanoscale pores in a layer of graphene, it could be used as an effective separation membrane due to its chemical and mechanical stability, its flexibility and, most importantly, its one-atom thickness. Theoretical studies have indicated that the performance of such membranes should be superior to state-of-the-art polymer-based filtration membranes, and experimental studies have recently begun to explore their potential. Here, we show that single-layer porous graphene can be used as a desalination membrane. Nanometre-sized pores are created in a graphene monolayer using an oxygen plasma etching process, which allows the size of the pores to be tuned. The resulting membranes exhibit a salt rejection rate of nearly 100% and rapid water transport. In particular, water fluxes of up to 10(6) g m(-2) s(-1) at 40 degrees C were measured using pressure difference as a driving force, while water fluxes measured using osmotic pressure as a driving force did not exceed 70 g m(-2) s(-1) atm(-1).

J	Nakagawa, N; Hwang, HY; Muller, DA				Nakagawa, N; Hwang, HY; Muller, DA			Why some interfaces cannot be sharp	NATURE MATERIALS												A central goal of modern materials physics and nanoscience is the control of materials and their interfaces to atomic dimensions. For interfaces between polar and nonpolar layers, this goal is thwarted by a polar catastrophe that forces an interfacial reconstruction. In traditional semiconductors, this reconstruction is achieved by an atomic disordering and stoichiometry change at the interface, but a new option is available in multivalent oxides: if the electrons can move, the atoms do not have to. Using atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy, we have examined the microscopic distribution of charge and ions across the (001) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. We find that there is a fundamental asymmetry between the ionically compensated AlO2/SrO/TiO2 interface, and the electronically compensated AlO2/ LaO/TiO2 interface, both in interfacial sharpness and charge density. This suggests a general strategy to design sharp interfaces, remove interfacial screening charges, control the band offset and, hence, markedly improve the performance of oxide devices.

J	Nguyen, KT; West, JL				Nguyen, KT; West, JL			Photopolymerizable hydrogels for tissue engineering applications	BIOMATERIALS												Photopolymerized hydrogels are being investigated for a number of tissue engineering applications because of the ability to form these materials in situ in a minimally invasive manner such as by injection. In addition, hydrogels, three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers that are able to swell large amounts of water, can be made to resemble the physical characteristics of soft tissues. Hydrogel materials also generally exhibit high permeability and good biocompatibility making, these materials attractive for use in cell encapsulation and tissue engineering applications. A number of hydrogel materials can be formed via photopolymerization processes mild enough to be carried out in the presence of living cells. This allows one to homogeneously seed cells throughout the scaffold material and to form hydrogels in situ. This review presents advantages of photopolymerization of hydrogels and describes the photoinitiators and materials in current use. Applications of photopolymerized hydrogels in tissue engineering that have been investigated are summarized. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Dissolvable films of silk fibroin for ultrathin conformal bio-integrated electronics	NATURE MATERIALS												Electronics that are capable of intimate, non-invasive integration with the soft, curvilinear surfaces of biological tissues offer important opportunities for diagnosing and treating disease and for improving brain/machine interfaces. This article describes a material strategy for a type of bio-interfaced system that relies on ultrathin electronics supported by bioresorbable substrates of silk fibroin. Mounting such devices on tissue and then allowing the silk to dissolve and resorb initiates a spontaneous, conformal wrapping process driven by capillary forces at the biotic/abiotic interface. Specialized mesh designs and ultrathin forms for the electronics ensure minimal stresses on the tissue and highly conformal coverage, even for complex curvilinear surfaces, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical studies. In vivo, neural mapping experiments on feline animal models illustrate one mode of use for this class of technology. These concepts provide new capabilities for implantable and surgical devices.

The role of inorganic polymer technology in the development of 'green concrete'	CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH												The potential position of and drivers for inorganic polymers ("geopolymers") as an element of the push for a sustainable concrete industry are discussed. These materials are alkali-activated aluminosilicates, with a much smaller CO2 footprint than traditional Portland cements, and display very good strength and chemical resistance properties as well as a variety of other potentially valuable characteristics. It is widely known that the widespread uptake of geopolymer technology is hindered by a number of factors, in particular issues to do with a lack of long-term (20+ years) durability data in this relatively young research field. There are also difficulties in compliance with some regulatory standards in Europe and North America, specifically those defining minimum clinker content levels or chemical compositions in cements. Work on resolving these issues is ongoing, with accelerated durability testing showing highly promising results with regard to salt scaling and freeze-thaw cycling. Geopolymer concrete compliance with performance-based standards is comparable to that of most other high-strength concretes. Issues to do with the distinction between geopolymers synthesised for cement replacement applications and those tailored for niche ceramic applications are also discussed. Particular attention is paid to the role of free alkali and silicate in poorly-formulated systems and its deleterious effects on concrete performance, which necessitates a more complete understanding of the chemistry of geopolymerisation for the technology to be successfully applied. The relationship between CO, footprint and composition in comparison with Portland-based cements is quantified. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation	NATURE ENERGY												Accurately predicting the lifetime of complex, nonlinear systems such as lithium-ion batteries is critical for accelerating technology development. However, diverse aging mechanisms, significant device variability and dynamic operating conditions have remained major challenges. We generate a comprehensive dataset consisting of 124 commercial lithium iron phosphate/graphite cells cycled under fast-charging conditions, with widely varying cycle lives ranging from 150 to 2,300 cycles. Using discharge voltage curves from early cycles yet to exhibit capacity degradation, we apply machine-learning tools to both predict and classify cells by cycle life. Our best models achieve 9.1% test error for quantitatively predicting cycle life using the first 100 cycles (exhibiting a median increase of 0.2% from initial capacity) and 4.9% test error using the first 5 cycles for classifying cycle life into two groups. This work highlights the promise of combining deliberate data generation with data-driven modelling to predict the behaviour of complex dynamical systems.

Additive Enhanced Crystallization of Solution-Processed Perovskite for Highly Efficient Planar-Heterojunction Solar Cells	ADVANCED MATERIALS												An effective method to control the rate of perovskite crystallization by incorporating rationally chosen additives into the perovskite precursor solutions is demonstrated. The processing additives simultaneously facilitate nucleation and modulate the kinetics of crystal growth during crystallization, leading to much smoother perovskite morphology with improved coverage area and crystal uniformity. As a result, it enables very high PCE (similar to 12%) planar-heterojunction solar cells to be fabricated through the low-temperature solution processes (under 150 degrees C).

Colloidal-quantum-dot photovoltaics using atomic-ligand passivation	NATURE MATERIALS												Colloidal-quantum-dot (CQD) optoelectronics offer a compelling combination of solution processing and spectral tunability through quantum size effects. So far, CQD solar cells have relied on the use of organic ligands to passivate the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticles. Although inorganic metal chalcogenide ligands have led to record electronic transport parameters in CQD films, no photovoltaic device has been reported based on such compounds. Here we establish an atomic ligand strategy that makes use of monovalent halide anions to enhance electronic transport and successfully passivate surface defects in PbS CQD films. Both time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and transient device characterization indicate that the scheme leads to a shallower trap state distribution than the best organic ligands. Solar cells fabricated following this strategy show up to 6% solar AM1.5G power-conversion efficiency. The CQD films are deposited at room temperature and under ambient atmosphere, rendering the process amenable to low-cost, roll-by-roll fabrication.

Here we show that exosomes, endogenous nano-sized membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types, can deliver chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor tissue in BALB/c nude mice. To reduce immunogenicity and toxicity, mouse immature dendritic cells (imDCs) were used for exosome production. Tumor targeting was facilitated by engineering the imDCs to express a well-characterized exosomal membrane protein (Lamp2b) fused to alpha v integrin-specific iRGD peptide (CRGDKGPDC). Purified exosomes from imDCs were loaded with Dox via electroporation, with an encapsulation efficiency of up to 20%. iRGD exosomes showed highly efficient targeting and Dox delivery to am integrin-positive breast cancer cells in vitro as demonstrated by confocal imaging and flow cytometry. Intravenously injected targeted exosomes delivered Dox specifically to tumor tissues, leading to inhibition of tumor growth without overt toxicity. Our results suggest that exosomes modified by targeting ligands can be used therapeutically for the delivery of Dox to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical applications.

Integrated energy storage devices of this type are a key area that is still significantly underdeveloped, Here, we describe wearable power devices using everyday textiles as the platform. With an extremely simple "dipping and drying" process using single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) ink, we produced highly conductive textiles with conductivity of 125 S cm(-1) and sheet resistance less than 1 Omega/sq. Such conductive textiles show outstanding flexibility and stretchability and demonstrate strong adhesion between the SWNTs and the textiles of interest. Supercapacitors made from these conductive textiles show high areal capacitance, up to 0.48F/cm(2), and high specific energy. We demonstrate the loading of pseudocapacitor materials into these conductive textiles that leads to a 24-fold increase of the areal capacitance of the device. These highly conductive textiles can provide new design opportunities for wearable electronics and energy storage applications.

J	Khor, E; Lim, LY				Khor, E; Lim, LY			Implantable applications of chitin and chitosan	BIOMATERIALS												Chitin, extracted primarily from shellfish sources, is a unique biopolymer based on the N-acetyl-glucosamine monomer. More than 40 years have lapsed since this biopolymer had aroused the interest of the scientific community around the world for its potential biomedical applications. Chitin, together with its variants, especially its deacetylated counterpart chitosan, has been shown to be useful as a wound dressing material, drug delivery vehicle and increasingly a candidate for tissue engineering. The promise for this biomaterial is vast and will continue to increase as the chemistry to extend its capabilities and new biomedical applications are investigated. It is interesting to note that a majority of this work has come from Asia. Japan has been the undisputed leader, but other Asian nations, namely Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand have also. made notable contributions. More recently, China has joined the club to become an increasingly major research source for chitin and chitosan in Asia, This review surveys select works of key groups in Asia developing chitin and chitosan materials for implantable biomedical applications.

J	Blomgren, GE				Blomgren, George E.			The Development and Future of Lithium Ion Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY					International Meeting on Lithium Batteries (IMLB)	JUN, 2016	Chicago, IL					This year, the battery industry celebrates the 25th anniversary of the introduction of the lithium ion rechargeable battery by Sony Corporation. The discovery of the system dates back to earlier work by Asahi Kasei in Japan, which used a combination of lower temperature carbons for the negative electrode to prevent solvent degradation and lithium cobalt dioxide modified somewhat from Goodenough's earlier work. The development by Sony was carried out within a few years by bringing together technology in film coating from their magnetic tape division and electrochemical technology from their battery division. The past 25 years has shown rapid growth in the sales and in the benefits of lithium ion in comparison to all the earlier rechargeable battery systems. Recent work on new materials shows that there is a good likelihood that the lithium ion battery will continue to improve in cost, energy, safety and power capability and will be a formidable competitor for some years to come.

J	Mishin, Y; Mehl, MJ; Papaconstantopoulos, DA; Voter, AF; Kress, JD				Mishin, Y; Mehl, MJ; Papaconstantopoulos, DA; Voter, AF; Kress, JD			Structural stability and lattice defects in copper: <i>Ab initio</i>, tight-binding, and embedded-atom calculations - art. no. 224106	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We evaluate the ability of the embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials and the tight-binding (TB) method to predict reliably energies and stability of nonequilibrium structures by taking Cu as a model material. Two EAM potentials are used here. One is constructed in this work by using more fitting parameters than usual and including ab initio energies in the fitting database. The other potential was constructed previously using a traditional scheme. Excellent agreement is observed between ab initio, TB, and EAM results for the energies and stability of several nonequilibrium structures of Cu, as well as for energies along deformation paths between different structures. We conclude that not only TB calculations but also EAM potentials can be suitable for simulations in which correct energies and stability of different atomic configurations are essential, at least for Cu. The bcc, simple cubic, and diamond structures of Cu were identified as elastically unstable, while some other structures (e.g., hcp and 9R) are metastable. As an application of this analysis, nonequilibrium structures of epitaxial Cu films on (001)-oriented fcc or bcc substrates are evaluated using a simple model and atomistic simulations with an EAM potential. In agreement with experimental data, the structure of the film can be either deformed fee or deformed hcp. The bcc structure cannot be stabilized by epitaxial constraints.

Using Sillinger-Weber silicon as a model system, we address issues related to nonlinear response, thermal equilibration, and statistical averaging. In addition, we present an analysis of finite-size effects and demonstrate how reliable results can be obtained when using nonequilibrium methods by extrapolation to an infinite system size. For the equilibrium Green-Kubo method, we show that results for the thermal conductivity are insensitive to the choice of the definition of local energy from the many-body part of the potential. Finally, we show that the results obtained by the equilibrium and nonequilibrium methods are consistent with each other and for the case of Si are in reasonable agreement with experimental results.

Cl-based additives are among the most prevalent in literature, yet their exact role is still uncertain. In this work, we systematically study the function of methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI(3))-based perovskite. Using density functional theory, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the interaction of MACl with a perovskite. We show that MACl successfully induces an intermediate to the pure FAPbI(3) alpha-phase without annealing. The formation energy is related to the amount of incorporated MACl. By tuning the incorporation of MACl, the perovskite film quality can be significantly improved, exhibiting a 6 x increase in grain size, a 3 x increase in phase crystallinity, and a 4.3 x increase in photoluminescence lifetime. The optimized solar cells achieved a certified efficiency of 23.48%.

A bioresorbable polymer poly(epsilon -caprolactone) (PCL) was developed as a filament modeling material to produce porous scaffolds. made of layers of directionally aligned microfilaments, using this computer-controlled extrusion and deposition process. The PCL scaffolds were produced with a range of channel size 160-700 mum, filament diameter 260-370 mum and porosity 48-77%, and regular geometrical honeycomb pores, depending on the processing parameters. The scaffolds of different porosity also exhibited a pattern of compressive stress-strain behavior characteristic of porous solids under such loading. The compressive stiffness ranged from 4 to 77 MPa, yield strength from 0.4 to 3.6MPa and yield strain from 4% to 28%. Analysis of the measured data shows a high correlation between the scaffold porosity and the compressive properties based on a power-law relationship. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, Li dendrite growth during Li plating/stripping causes safety concern and poor lifespan of Li metal batteries (LMB). Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additives are used to form a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The FEC-induced SEI layer is compact and stable, and thus beneficial to obtain a uniform morphology of Li deposits. This uniform and dendrite-free morphology renders a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency of 98% within 100 cycles in a Li | Cu half-cell. When the FEC-protected Li metal anode matches a high-loading LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NMC) cathode (12 mg cm(-2)), a high initial capacity of 154 mAh g(-1) (1.9 mAh cm(-2)) at 180.0 mA g(-1) is obtained. This LMB with conversion-type Li metal anode and intercalation-type NMC cathode affords an emerging energy storage system to probe the energy chemistry of Li metal protection and demonstrates the material engineering of batteries with very high energy density.

Atomic structure of graphene on SiO<sub>2</sub>	NANO LETTERS												We employ scanning probe microscopy to reveal atomic structures and nanoscale morphology of graphene-based electronic devices (i.e., a graphene sheet supported by an insulating silicon dioxide substrate) for the first time. Atomic resolution scanning tunneling microscopy images reveal the presence of a strong spatially dependent perturbation, which breaks the hexagonal lattice symmetry of the graphitic lattice. Structural corrugations of the graphene sheet partially conform to the underlying silicon oxide substrate. These effects are obscured or modified on graphene devices processed with normal lithographic methods, as they are covered with a layer of photoresist residue.

J	Vrancken, B; Thijs, L; Kruth, JP; Van Humbeeck, J				Vrancken, Bey; Thijs, Lore; Kruth, Jean-Pierre; Van Humbeeck, Jan			Heat treatment of Ti6Al4V produced by Selective Laser Melting: Microstructure and mechanical properties	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS												The present work shows that optimization of mechanical properties via heat treatment of parts produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is profoundly different compared to conventionally processed Ti6Al4V. In order to obtain optimal mechanical properties, specific treatments are necessary due to the specific microstructure resulting from the SLM process. SLM is an additive manufacturing technique through which components are built by selectively melting powder layers with a focused laser beam. The process is characterized by short laser-powder interaction times and localized high heat input, which leads to steep thermal gradients, rapid solidification and fast cooling. In this research, the effect of several heat treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V processed by SLM is studied. A comparison is made with the effect of these treatments on hot forged and subsequently mill annealed Ti6Al4V with an original equiaxed microstructure. For SLM produced parts, the original martensite alpha' phase is converted to a lamellar mixture of alpha and beta for heat treating temperatures below the beta-transus (995 degrees C), but features of the original microstructure are maintained. Treated above the beta-transus, extensive grain growth occurs and large beta grains are formed which transform to lamellar alpha + beta upon cooling. Post treating at 850 degrees C for 2 h, followed by furnace cooling increased the ductility of SLM parts to 12.84 +/- 1.36%, compared to 7.36 +/- 1.32% for as-built parts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

J	Li, ZJ; Gu, XN; Lou, SQ; Zheng, YF				Li, Zijian; Gu, Xunan; Lou, Siquan; Zheng, Yufeng			The development of binary Mg-Ca alloys for use as biodegradable materials within bone	BIOMATERIALS												Binary Mg-Ca alloys with various Ca contents were fabricated under different working conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and optical microscopy observations showed that Mg-xCa (x = 1-3 wt%) alloys were composed of two phases, alpha(Mg) and Mg2Ca. The results of tensile tests and in vitro corrosion tests indicated that the mechanical properties could be adjusted by controlling the Ca content and processing treatment. The yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation decreased with increasing Ca content. The UTS and elongation of as-cast Mg-1Ca alloy (71.38 +/- 3.01 MPa and 1.87 +/- 0.14%) were largely improved after hot rolling (166.7 +/- 3.01 MPa and 3 +/- 0.78%) and hot extrusion (239.63 +/- 7.21 MPa and 10.63 +/- 0.64%). The in vitro corrosion test in simulated body fluid (SBF) indicated that the microstructure and working history of Mg-xCa alloys strongly affected their corrosion behaviors. An increasing content of Mg2Ca phase led to a higher corrosion rate whereas hot rolling and hot extrusion could reduce it. The cytotoxicity evaluation using L-929 cells revealed that Mg-1Ca alloy did not induce toxicity to cells, and the viability of cells for Mg-1Ca alloy extraction medium was better than that of control. Moreover, Mg-1Ca alloy pins, with commercial pure Ti pins as control, were implanted into the left and right rabbit femoral shafts, respectively, and observed for 1, 2 and 3 months. High activity of ostroblast and osteocytes were observed around the Mg-1Ca alloy pins as shown by hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections. Radiographic examination revealed that the Mg-1Ca alloy pins gradually degraded in vivo within 90 days and the newly formed bone was clearly seen at month 3. Both the in vitro and in vivo corrosion suggested that a mixture of Mg(OH)(2) and hydroxyapatite formed on the surface of Mg-1Ca alloy with the extension of immersion/implantation time. In addition, no significant difference (p > 0.05) of serum magnesium was detected at different degradation stages. All these results revealed that Mg-1Ca alloy had the acceptable biocompatibility as a new kind of biodegradable implant material. Based on the above results, a solid alloy/liquid solution interface model was also proposed to interpret the biocorrosion process and the associated hydroxyapatite mineralization.

J	Marschall, R				Marschall, Roland			Semiconductor Composites: Strategies for Enhancing Charge Carrier Separation to Improve Photocatalytic Activity	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												The formation of semiconductor composites comprising multicomponent or multiphase heterojunctions is a very effective strategy to design highly active photocatalyst systems. This review summarizes the recent strategies to develop such composites, and highlights the most recent developments in the field. After a general introduction into the different strategies to improve photocatalytic activity through formation of heterojunctions, the three different types of heterojunctions are introduced in detail, followed by a historical introduction to semiconductor heterojunction systems and a thorough literature overview. Special chapters describe the highly-investigated carbon nitride heterojunctions as well as very recent developments in terms of multiphase heterojunction formation, including the latest insights into the anatase-rutile system. When carefully designed, semiconductor composites comprising two or three different materials or phases very effectively facilitate charge separation and charge carrier transfer, substantially improving photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical efficiency.

J	Han, Y; Xu, Z; Gao, C				Han, Yi; Xu, Zhen; Gao, Chao			Ultrathin Graphene Nanofiltration Membrane for Water Purification	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												A method of fabricating ultrathin (approximate to 22-53 nm thick) graphene nanofiltration membranes (uGNMs) on microporous substrates is presented for efficient water purification using chemically converted graphene (CCG). The prepared uGNMs show well packed layer structure formed by CCG sheets, as characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The performance of the uGNMs for water treatment was evaluated on a dead end filtration device and the pure water flux of uGNMs was high (21.8 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)). The uGNMs show high retention (>99%) for organic dyes and moderate retention (approximate to 20-60%) for ion salts. The rejection mechanism of this kind of negatively charged membranes is intensively studied, and the results reveal that physical sieving and electrostatic interaction dominate the rejection process. Because of the ultrathin nature of uGNMs, 34 mg of CCG is sufficient for making a square meter of nanofiltration membrane, indicating that this new generation graphene-based nanofiltration technology would be resource saving and cost-effective. The integration of high performance, low cost, and simple solution-based fabrication process promises uGNMs great potential application in practical water purification.

In order to study the effects of the different alkali elements, we have produced a large number of CIGS solar cells with high efficiencies resulting in a good experimental resolution to detect even small differences in performance. We examine the electrical device parameters of these fully functional devices and observe a positive trend in the I-V parameters when moving from devices without PDT to KF-, RbF-, and eventually to CsF-PDT. A diode analysis reveals an improved diode quality for cells treated with heavier alkalis. Furthermore, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements reveal a competitive mechanism induced within the class of alkali elements in the CIGS absorber induced by the alkali post deposition treatment.

J	Jiang, JK; Oberdörster, G; Biswas, P				Jiang, Jingkun; Oberdorster, Gunter; Biswas, Pratim			Characterization of size, surface charge, and agglomeration state of nanoparticle dispersions for toxicological studies	JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH												Characterizing the state of nanoparticles (such as size, surface charge, and degree of agglomeration) in aqueous suspensions and understanding the parameters that affect this state are imperative for toxicity investigations. In this study, the role of important factors such as solution ionic strength, pH, and particle surface chemistry that control nanoparticle dispersion was examined. The size and zeta potential of four TiO2 and three quantum dot samples dispersed in different solutions (including one physiological medium) were characterized. For 15 nm TiO2 dispersions, the increase of ionic strength from 0.001 M to 0.1 M led to a 50-fold increase in the hydrodynamic diameter, and the variation of pH resulted in significant change of particle surface charge and the hydrodynamic size. It was shown that both adsorbing multiply charged ions (e.g., pyrophosphate ions) onto the TiO2 nanoparticle surface and coating quantum dot nanocrystals with polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol) suppressed agglomeration and stabilized the dispersions. DLVO theory was used to qualitatively understand nanoparticle dispersion stability. A methodology using different ultrasonication techniques (bath and probe) was developed to distinguish agglomerates from aggregates (strong bonds), and to estimate the extent of particle agglomeration. Probe ultrasonication performed better than bath ultrasonication in dispersing TiO2 agglomerates when the stabilizing agent sodium pyrophosphate was used. Commercially available Degussa P25 and in-house synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles were used to demonstrate identification of aggregated and agglomerated samples.

Here, we show that, in OTP-based photovoltaic devices with vertical and lateral cell configurations, the photocurrent direction can be switched repeatedly by applying a small electric field of < 1V mu m(-1). The switchable photocurrent, generally observed in devices based on ferroelectric materials, reached 20.1 mAcm(-2) under one sun illumination in OTP devices with a vertical architecture, which is four orders of magnitude larger than lthat measured in other ferroelectric photovoltaic devices(10,11). This field-switchable photovoltaic effect can be explained by the formation of reversible p-i-n structures induced by ion drift in the perovskite layer. The demonstration of switchable OTP photovoltaics and electric-field-manipulated doping paves the way for innovative solar cell designs and for the exploitation of OTP materials in electrically and optically readable memristors and circuits.

NANO LETTERS												Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), unlike its bulk form, is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1.8 eV. Recently, field-effect transistors have been demonstrated experimentally using a mechanically exfoliated MoS2 monolayer, showing promising potential for next generation electronics. Here we project the ultimate performance limit of MoS2 transistors by using nonequilibrium Green's function based quantum transport simulations. Our simulation results show that the strength of MoS2 transistors lies in large ON-OFF current ratio (>10(10)), immunity to short channel effects (drain-induced barrier lowering similar to 10 mV/V), and abrupt switching (subthreshold swing as low as 60 mV/decade). Our comparison of monolayer MoS2 transistors to the state-of-the-art III-V materials based transistors, reveals that while MoS2 transistors may not be ideal for high-performance applications due to heavier electron effective mass (m* = 0.45m(0)) and a lower mobility, they can be an attractive alternative for low power applications thanks to the large band gap and the excellent electrostatic integrity inherent in a two-dimensional system.

Plasticity in small-sized metallic systems: Intrinsic versus extrinsic size effect	PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE					139th TMS Annual Meeting and Exhibition on Pb-Free Solders and Emerging Interconnect and Packaging Technologies	FEB 14-18, 2010	Seattle, WA					A material strength depends on its microstructure, which in turn, is controlled by an engineering process. Strengthening mechanisms like work hardening, precipitate, and grain boundary strengthening can alter the strength of a material in a predictive, quantitative manner and are readily linked to the deformation mechanism. This quantification strongly depends on the characteristic length scale of a particular microstructure, thereby dictating bulk material's strength as a function of, for example, grain or precipitate size, twin boundary spacing, or dislocation density. This microstructural, or intrinsic, size governs the mechanical properties and post-elastic material deformation at all sample dimensions, as the classical definition of "ultimate tensile strength" deems it to be "an intensive property, therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen." Yet in the last 5 years, the vast majority of uniaxial deformation experiments and computations on small-scale metallic structures unambiguously demonstrated that at the micron and sub-micron scales, this definition no longer holds true. In fact, it has been shown that in single crystals the ultimate tensile strength and the yield strength scale with external sample size in a power law fashion, sometimes attaining a significant fraction of material's theoretical strength, and exhibiting the now-commonly-known phenomenon "smaller is stronger." Understanding of this "extrinsic size effect" at small scales is not yet mature and is currently a topic of rigorous investigations. As both the intrinsic (i.e. microstructural) and extrinsic (i.e. sample size) dimensions play a non-trivial role in the mechanical properties and material deformation mechanisms, it is critical to develop an understanding of their interplay and mutual effects on the mechanical properties and material deformation, especially in small-scale structures. This review focuses on providing an overview of metal-based material classes whose properties as a function of external size have been investigated and provides a critical discussion on the combined effects of intrinsic and extrinsic sizes on the material deformation behavior.

Localization of interacting fermions at high temperature	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We suggest that if a localized phase at nonzero temperature T > 0 exists for strongly disordered and weakly interacting electrons, as recently argued, it will also occur when both disorder and interactions are strong and T is very high. We show that in this high-T regime, the localization transition may be studied numerically through exact diagonalization of small systems. We obtain spectra for one-dimensional lattice models of interacting spinless fermions in a random potential. As expected, the spectral statistics of finite-size samples cross over from those of orthogonal random matrices in the diffusive regime at weak random potential to Poisson statistics in the localized regime at strong randomness. However, these data show deviations from simple one-parameter finite-size scaling: the apparent mobility edge '' drifts '' as the system's size is increased. Based on spectral statistics alone, we have thus been unable to make a strong numerical case for the presence of a many-body localized phase at nonzero T.

J	Assadi, H; Gärtner, F; Stoltenhoff, T; Kreye, H				Assadi, H; Gärtner, F; Stoltenhoff, T; Kreye, H			Bonding mechanism in cold gas spraying	ACTA MATERIALIA												Cold gas spraying is a relatively new coating process by which coatings can be produced without significant heating of the sprayed powder. In contrast to the well-known thermal spray processes such as flame, arc, and plasma spraying, in cold spraying there is no melting of particles prior to impact on the substrate. The adhesion of particles in this process is due solely to their kinetic energy upon impact. Experimental investigations show that successful bonding is achieved only above a critical particle velocity, whose value depends on the temperature and the thermomechanical properties of the sprayed material. This paper supplies a hypothesis for the bonding of particles in cold gas spraying, by making use of numerical modelling of the deformation during particle impact. The results of modelling are assessed with respect to the experimentally evaluated critical velocities, impact morphologies and strengths of coatings. The analysis demonstrates that bonding can be attributed to adiabatic shear instabilities which occur at the particle surface at or beyond the critical velocity. On the basis of this criterion, critical velocities can be predicted and used to optimise process parameters for various materials. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For this reason, those oxides, even though successfully introduced into microelectronics, were never considered to be more than simple dielectrics possessing limited functionality. Here we report the discovery of a field-driven ferroelectric phase transition in pure, sub 10 nm ZrO2 thin films and a composition- and temperature-dependent transition to a stable ferroelectric phase in the HfO2-ZrO2 mixed oxide. These unusual findings are attributed to a size-driven tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition that in thin films, similar to the anticipated tetragonal to monoclinic transition, is lowered to room temperature. A structural investigation revealed the orthorhombic phase to be of space group Pbc2(1), whose noncentrosymmetric nature is deemed responsible for the spontaneous polarization in this novel, nanoscale ferroelectrics.

FTIR spectroscopy characterization of poly (vinyl alcohol) hydrogel with different hydrolysis degree and chemically crosslinked with glutaraldehyde	MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-BIOMIMETIC AND SUPRAMOLECULAR SYSTEMS					Symposium on Nanostructured Biological Materials held at the 5th Meeting of the Brazilian-Materials-Research-Society	OCT, 2006	Florianopolis, BRAZIL	Brazilian Mat Res Soc				In this work, poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels with different degree of hydrolysis (DH) were prepared by chemical crosslinking with glutaraldehyde (GA). The nanostructure of the resulting hydrogels was investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering characterization (SAXS). In vitro tests were performed by swelling ratio assays in different pH solutions. The infrared spectra of the crosslinked PVA showed absorption bands of the acetal bridges resulted from the reaction of the GA with the OH groups from PVA. Also the FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine the crystallinity of the PVA film based on the relative intensity of the vibration band at 1141 cm(-1). The results have showed an increase of hydrogel crystallinity with higher DH of PVA. SAXS patterns have clearly indicated important modifications on the PVA semicrystalline structure when it was crosslinked by GA. The swelling ratio was significantly reduced by chemically crosslinking the PVA network. PVA-derived hydrogel with chemically modified network was found to be pH-sensitive, indicating a high potential to be used in drug delivery polymer system. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Hot Electrons Do the Impossible: Plasmon-Induced Dissociation of H<sub>2</sub> on Au	NANO LETTERS												Heterogeneous catalysis is of paramount importance in chemistry and energy applications. Catalysts that couple light energy into chemical reactions in a directed, orbital-specific manner would greatly reduce the energy input requirements of chemical transformations, revolutionizing catalysis-driven chemistry. Here we report the room temperature dissociation of H-2 on gold nanoparticles using visible light. Surface plasmons excited in the Au nanoparticle decay into hot electrons with energies between the vacuum level and the work function of the metal. In this transient state, hot electrons can transfer into a Feshbach resonance of an H-2 molecule adsorbed on the Au nanoparticle surface, triggering dissociation. We probe this process by detecting the formation of HD molecules from the dissociations of H-2 and D-2 and investigate the effect of Au nanoparticle size and wavelength of incident light on the rate of HD formation.

J	Burkov, AA; Hook, MD; Balents, L				Burkov, A. A.; Hook, M. D.; Balents, Leon			Topological nodal semimetals	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We present a study of "nodal-semimetal" phases in which nondegenerate conduction and valence bands touch at points (the "Weyl semimetal") or lines (the "line-node semimetal") in three-dimensional momentum space. We discuss a general approach to such states by perturbation of the critical point between a normal insulator (NI) and a topological insulator (TI), breaking either time-reversal (TR) or inversion symmetry. We give an explicit model realization of both types of states in a NI-TI superlattice structure with broken TR symmetry. Both the Weyl and the line-node semimetals are characterized by topologically protected surface states, although in the line-node case, some additional symmetries must be imposed to retain this topological protection. The edge states have the form of "Fermi arcs" in the case of the Weyl semimetal: these are chiral gapless edge states, which exist in a finite region in momentum space, determined by the momentum-space separation of the bulk Weyl nodes. The chiral character of the edge states leads to a finite Hall conductivity. In contrast, the edge states of the line-node semimetal are "flat bands": these states are approximately dispersionless in a subset of the two-dimensional edge Brillouin zone, given by the projection of the line node onto the plane of the edge. We discuss unusual transport properties of the nodal semimetals and, in particular, point out quantum critical-like scaling of the dc and optical conductivities of the Weyl semimetal and similarities to the conductivity of graphene in the line-node case.																			1098-0121					DEC 20	2011	84	23							235126	10.1103/PhysRevB.84.235126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.84.235126													WOS:000298557900002

Thermally stable Pt/mesoporous silica core-shell nanocatalysts for high-temperature reactions	NATURE MATERIALS												Recent advances in colloidal synthesis enabled the precise control of the size, shape and composition of catalytic metal nanoparticles, enabling their use as model catalysts for systematic investigations of the atomic-scale properties affecting catalytic activity and selectivity. The organic capping agents stabilizing colloidal nanoparticles, however, often limit their application in high-temperature catalytic reactions. Here, we report the design of a high-temperature-stable model catalytic system that consists of a Pt metal core coated with a mesoporous silica shell (Pt@mSiO(2)). Inorganic silica shells encaged the Pt cores up to 750 degrees C in air and the mesopores providing direct access to the Pt core made the Pt@mSiO(2) nanoparticles as catalytically active as bare Pt metal for ethylene hydrogenation and CO oxidation. The high thermal stability of Pt@mSiO(2) nanoparticles enabled high-temperature CO oxidation studies, including ignition behaviour, which was not possible for bare Pt nanoparticles because of their deformation or aggregation. The results suggest that the Pt@mSiO(2) nanoparticles are excellent nanocatalytic systems for high-temperature catalytic reactions or surface chemical processes, and the design concept used in the Pt@mSiO(2) core-shell catalyst can be extended to other metal/metal oxide compositions.

Using a solid-vapor phase thermal sublimation technique, nanocombs, nanorings, nanohelixes/nanosprings, nanobows, nanobelts, nanowires, and nanocages of ZnO have been synthesized under specific growth conditions.

Nanoparticle shape also contributes significantly to modulating their electronic properties. Several shapes ranging from rods to wires to plates to teardrop structures may be obtained by chemical methods; triangular nanoparticles have been synthesized by using a seeded growth process. Here, we report the discovery that the extract from the lemongrass plant, when reacted with aqueous chloroaurate ions, yields a high percentage of thin, flat, single-crystalline gold nanotriangles. The nanotriangles seem to grow by a process involving rapid reduction, assembly and room-temperature sintering of 'liquid-like' spherical gold nanoparticles. The anisotropy in nanoparticle shape results in large near-infrared absorption by the particles, and highly anisotropic electron transport in films of the nanotriangles.

Microscale heat transfer transduced by surface plasmon resonant gold nanoparticles	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C												Visible radiation at resonant frequencies is transduced to thermal energy by surface plasmons on gold nanoparticles. Temperature in <= 10-mu L aqueous suspensions of 20-nm gold particles irradiated by a continuous wave Ar+ ion laser at 514 nm increased to a maximum equilibrium value. This value increased in proportion to incident laser power and in proportion to nanoparticle content at low concentration. Heat input to the system by nanoparticle transduction of resonant irradiation equaled heat flux outward by conduction and radiation at thermal equilibrium. The efficiency of transducing incident resonant light to heat by microvolume suspensions of gold nanoparticles was determined by applying an energy balance to obtain a microscale heat-transfer time constant from the transient temperature profile. Measured values of transduction efficiency were increased from 3.4% to 9.9% by modulating the incident continuous wave irradiation.					; Ahn, Wonmi/B-7320-2014	Hoepfner, Michael/0000-0001-9648-6911; Ahn, Wonmi/0000-0002-2596-2295													1932-7447	1932-7455				MAR 8	2007	111	9					3636	3641		10.1021/jp064341w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp064341w								19011696					WOS:000245006000016

This layer-dependence permits the discovery of novel material properties in the monolayer regime. Ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional materials is a coveted property that would allow fundamental studies of spin behaviour in low dimensions and enable new spintronics applications(6-9). Recent studies have shown that for the bulk-ferromagnetic layered materials Crl(3), (ref. (9) ) and Cr2Ge2Te6 (ref. (10)), ferromagnetic order is maintained down to the ultrathin limit at low temperatures. Contrary to these observations, we report the emergence of strong ferromagnetic ordering for monolayer VSe2, a material that is paramagnetic in the bulk(11,12). Importantly, the ferromagnetic ordering with a large magnetic moment persists to above room temperature, making VSe2 an attractive material for van der Waals spintronics applications.

The key to the success of this method was the use of a collector consisting of two pieces of electrically conductive substrates separated by a gap whose width could be varied from hundreds of micrometers to several centimeters. As driven by electrostatic interactions, the charged nanofibers were stretched to span across the gap and thus to become uniaxially aligned arrays over large areas. Because the nanofibers were suspended over the gap, they could be conveniently transferred onto the surfaces of other substrates for subsequent treatments and various applications. Materials that have been successfully incorporated into this procedure include conventional organic polymers, graphite carbon, and metal oxides. By controlling the parameters for electrospinning, we have also fabricated a number of simple device structures, for example, an individual nanofiber spanning across two electrodes, 2D arrays of crossbar junctions, and optical polarizers.

Unfortunately, all current NIR-II fluorophores are excreted slowly and are largely retained within the reticuloendothelial system, making clinical translation nearly impossible. Here, we report a rapidly excreted NIR-II fluorophore (similar to 90% excreted through the kidneys within 24 h) based on a synthetic 970-Da organic molecule (CH1055). The fluorophore outperformed indocyanine green (ICG)-a clinically approved NIR-I dye-in resolving mouse lymphatic vasculature and sentinel lymphatic mapping near a tumour. High levels of uptake of PEGylated-CH1055 dye were observed in brain tumours in mice, suggesting that the dye was detected at a depth of similar to 4 mm. The CH1055 dye also allowed targeted molecular imaging of tumours in vivo when conjugated with anti-EGFR Affibody. Moreover, a superior tumour-to-background signal ratio allowed precise image-guided tumour-removal surgery.

Crystal Growth of the Perovskite Semiconductor CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>: A New Material for High-Energy Radiation Detection	CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN												The synthesis, crystal growth, and structural and optoelectronic characterization has been carried out for the perovsldte compound CsPbBr3. This compound is a direct band gap semiconductor which meets most of the requirements for successful detection of X- and gamma-ray radiation, such as high attenuation, high resistivity, and significant photoconductivity response, with detector resolution comparable to that of commercial, state-of-the-art materials. A structural phase transition which occurs during crystal growth at higher temperature does not seem to affect its crystal quality. Its mu tau product for both hole and electron carriers is approximately equal. The mu tau product for electrons is comparable to cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) and that for holes is 10 times higher than CZT.

Transient analysis of triplet-triplet annihilation	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												In the preceding paper, Paper I [Phys. Rev. B 62, 10 958 (2000)], we studied the formation and diffusion of excitons in several phosphorescent guest-host molecular organic systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that the observed decrease in electrophosphorescent intensity in organic light-emitting devices at high current densities [M. A. Baldo et al., Nature 395, 151 (1998)] is principally due to triplet-triplet annihilation. Using parameters extracted from transient phosphorescent decays, we model the quantum efficiency versus current characteristics of electrophosphorescent devices. It is found that the increase in luminance observed for phosphors with short excited-state lifetimes is due primarily to reduced triplet-triplet annihilation. We also derive an expression for a limiting current density (J(0)) above which triplet-triplet annihilation dominates. The expression for J(0) allows us to establish the criteria for identifying useful phosphors and to assist in the optimized design of electrophosphorescent molecules and device structures.

With these requirements, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries promise great potential to be the next-generation high-energy system. However, the practicality of Li-S technology is hindered by technical obstacles, such as short shelf and cycle life and low sulfur content/loading, arising from the shuttling of polysulfide intermediates between the cathode and anode and the poor electronic conductivity of S and the discharge product Li2S. Much progress has been made during the past five years to circumvent these problems by employing sulfur-carbon or sulfur-polymer composite cathodes, novel cell configurations, and lithium-metal anode stabilization. This Progress Report highlights recent developments with special attention toward innovation in sulfur-encapsulation techniques, development of novel materials, and cell-component design. The scientific understanding and engineering concerns are discussed at the end in every developmental stage.

One approach that shows immense potential is based on the biosynthesis of nanoparticles using biological micro-organisms such as bacteria. In this laboratory, we have concentrated on the use of fungi in the intracellular production of metal nanoparticles. As part of our investigation, we have observed that aqueous silver ions when exposed to the fungus Fusarium oxysporum are reduced in solution, thereby leading to the formation of an extremely stable silver hydrosol. The silver nanoparticles are in the range of 5-15 nm in dimensions and are stabilized in solution by proteins secreted by the fungus. It is believed that the reduction of the metal ions occurs by an enzymatic process, thus creating the possibility of developing a rational, fungal-based method for the synthesis of nanomaterials over a range of chemical compositions, which is currently not possible by other microbe-based methods.

An exonuclease enzyme might be used to cleave individual nucleotide molecules from the DNA, and when coupled to an appropriate detection system, these nucleotides could be identified in the correct order. Here, we show that a protein nanopore with a covalently attached adapter molecule can continuously identify unlabelled nucleoside W-monophosphate molecules with accuracies averaging 99.8%. Methylated cytosine can also be distinguished from the four standard DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine. The operating conditions are compatible with the exonuclease, and the kinetic data show that the nucleotides have a high probability of translocation through the nanopore and, therefore, of not being registered twice.

Information to the degree of functionalisation was ascertained by argon ion bombardment of the samples followed by XPS analysis to detect the functional groups, the percentage atomic concentration of various elements present and whether or not the detected functional groups imposed a chemical shift on the CNT atoms. The results show that true chemical functionalisation was achieved and by argon ion bombardment these functional groups can be altered relative to the C Is carbon atoms of the CNT. The choice of chemicals used for functionalisation, the techniques employed and the types of nanotubes treated are important factors in chemical characterisation. The carbon atom on the nanotube ring to which the functional group (atom) is bonded, the chirality of the CNT, the electronegativity of the functional group, the bond type and whether the CNT is single-wall or multi-wall, or cut (short) could play a role in determining the chemical shift on the CNTs atoms. These investigations are relevant to chemical functionalisation of carbon nanotubes for various applications for example DNA sensors and other biomedical sensors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, volume changes during cycling cause pulverization and capacity fade, and improving cycle life is a major research challenge. Here, we report a novel interconnected Si hollow nanosphere electrode that is capable of accommodating large volume changes without pulverization during cycling. We achieved the high initial discharge capacity of 2725 mAh g(-1) with less than 8% capacity degradation every hundred cycles for 700 total cycles. Si hollow sphere electrodes also show a Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% in later cycles. Superior rate capability is demonstrated and attributed to fast lithium diffusion in the interconnected Si hollow structure.

In addition, platinum surface area loss for a short-stack of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) operated at open-circuit voltage (similar to 0.95 V) was shown to be higher than another operated under load (similar to 0.75 V). Both findings suggest that the formation of soluble platinum species (such as Pt2+) plays an important role in platinum surface loss in PEMFC electrodes. As accelerated platinum surface area loss in the cathode (from 63 to 23 m(2)/g(Pt) in similar to 100 h) was observed upon potential cycling, a cycled membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cathode was examined in detail by incidence angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to reveal processes responsible for observed platinum loss. In this study, TEM data and analyses of Pt/C catalyst and cross-sectional MEA cathode samples unambiguously confirmed that coarsening of platinum particles occurred via two different processes: (i) Ostwald ripening on carbon at the nanometer scale, which is responsible for platinum particle coarsening from similar to 3 to similar to 6 nm on carbon, and (ii) migration of soluble platinum species in the ionomer phase at the micrometer scale, chemical reduction of these species by crossover H-2 molecules, and precipitation of platinum particles in the cathode ionomer phase, which reduces the weight of platinum on carbon. It was estimated that each process contributed to similar to 50% of the overall platinum area loss of the potential cycled electrode. (c) 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

However, their low thermal-abuse tolerance and poor cycle life, especially at elevated temperature, prohibit their use in practical batteries(4-6). Here, we report on a concentration-gradient cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries based on a layered lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide. In this material, each particle has a central bulk that is rich in Ni and a Mn-rich outer layer with decreasing Ni concentration and increasing Mn and Co concentrations as the surface is approached. The former provides high capacity, whereas the latter improves the thermal stability. A half cell using our concentration-gradient cathode material achieved a high capacity of 209m Ah g 1 and retained 96% of this capacity after 50 charge-discharge cycles under an aggressive test profile (55 degrees C between 3.0 and 4.4V). Our concentration-gradient material also showed superior performance in thermal-abuse tests compared with the bulk composition Li[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O-2 used as reference. These results suggest that our cathode material could enable production of batteries that meet the demanding performance and safety requirements of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

For an energy-efficient HER, a catalyst must be able to trigger proton reduction with minimal overpotential(4) and have fast kinetics(5-9). The most efficient catalysts in acidic media are platinum-based, as the strength of the Pt-H bond(10) is associated with the fastest reaction rate for the HER11,12. The use of platinum, however, raises issues linked to cost and stability in non-acidic media. Recently, non-precious-metal-based catalysts have been reported, but these are susceptible to acid corrosion and are typically much inferior to Pt-based catalysts, exhibiting higher overpotentials and lower stability(13-15). As a cheaper alternative to platinum, ruthenium possesses a similar bond strength with hydrogen (similar to 65 kcal mol(-1))(16), but has never been studied as a viable alternative for a HER catalyst. Here, we report a Ru-based catalyst for the HER that can operate both in acidic and alkaline media. Our catalyst is made of Ru nanoparticles dispersed within a nitrogenated holey two-dimensional carbon structure (Ru@C2N). The Ru@C2N electrocatalyst exhibits high turnover frequencies at 25 mV (0.67 H-2 s(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution; 0.75 H-2 s(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution) and small overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) (13.5 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution; 17.0 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution) as well as superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media. These performances are comparable to, or even better than, the Pt/C catalyst for the HER.

Nanotechnology in the real world: Redeveloping the nanomaterial consumer products inventory	BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY												To document the marketing and distribution of nano-enabled products into the commercial marketplace, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies created the Nanotechnology Consumer Products Inventory (CPI) in 2005. The objective of this present work is to redevelop the CPI by leading a research effort to increase the usefulness and reliability of this inventory. We created eight new descriptors for consumer products, including information pertaining to the nanomaterials contained in each product. The project was motivated by the recognition that a diverse group of stakeholders from academia, industry, and state/ federal government had become highly dependent on the inventory as an important resource and bellweather of the pervasiveness of nanotechnology in society. We interviewed 68 nanotechnology experts to assess key information needs. Their answers guided inventory modifications by providing a clear conceptual framework best suited for user expectations. The revised inventory was released in October 2013. It currently lists 1814 consumer products from 622 companies in 32 countries. The Health and Fitness category contains the most products (762, or 42% of the total). Silver is the most frequently used nanomaterial (435 products, or 24%); however, 49% of the products (889) included in the CPI do not provide the composition of the nanomaterial used in them. About 29% of the CPI (528 products) contain nanomaterials suspended in a variety of liquid media and dermal contact is the most likely exposure scenario from their use. The majority (1288 products, or 71%) of the products do not present enough supporting information to corroborate the claim that nanomaterials are used. The modified CPI has enabled crowdsourcing capabilities, which allow users to suggest edits to any entry and permits researchers to upload new findings ranging from human and environmental exposure data to complete life cycle assessments. There are inherent limitations to this type of database, but these modifications to the inventory addressed the majority of criticisms raised in published literature and in surveys of nanotechnology stakeholders and experts. The development of standardized methods and metrics for nanomaterial characterization and labelling in consumer products can lead to greater understanding between the key stakeholders in nanotechnology, especially consumers, researchers, regulators, and industry.

J	Bai, YL; Wierzbicki, T				Bai, Yuanli; Wierzbicki, Tomasz			A new model of metal plasticity and fracture with pressure and Lode dependence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY												Classical metal plasticity theory assumes that the hydrostatic pressure has no or negligible effect on the material strain hardening, and that the flow stress is independent of the third deviatoric stress invariant (or Lode angle parameter). However, recent experiments on metals have shown that both the pressure effect and the effect of the third deviatoric stress invariant should be included in the constitutive description of the material. A general form of asymmetric metal plasticity, considering both the pressure sensitivity and the Lode dependence, is postulated. The calibration method for the new metal plasticity is discussed. Experimental results on aluminum 2024-T351 are shown to validate the new material model. From the similarity between yielding surface and fracture locus, a new 3D asymmetric fracture locus, in the space of equivalent fracture strain, stress triaxiality and the Lode angle parameter, is postulated. Two methods of calibration of the fracture locus are discussed. One is based oil classical round specimens and flat specimens in uniaxial tests, and the other one uses the newly designed butterfly specimen under biaxial testing. Test results of Bao (2003) [Bao, Y., 2003. Prediction of ductile crack formation in uncracked bodies. PhD Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology] on aluminum 2024-T351, and test data points of A710 steel from butterfly specimens under biaxial testing validated the postulated asymmetric 3D fracture locus.

Observation of room-temperature magnetic skyrmions and their current-driven dynamics in ultrathin metallic ferromagnets	NATURE MATERIALS												Magnetic skyrmions(1,2) are topologically protected spin textures that exhibit fascinating physical behaviours(1-6) and large potential in highly energy-efficient spintronic device applications(7-13). The main obstacles so far are that skyrmions have been observed in only a few exotic materials and at low temperatures(1-4,6-8), and fast current-driven motion of individual skyrmions has not yet been achieved. Here, we report the observation of stable magnetic skyrmions at room temperature in ultrathin transition metal ferromagnets with magnetic transmission soft X-ray microscopy. We demonstrate the ability to generate stable skyrmion lattices and drive trains of individual skyrmions by short current pulses along a magnetic racetrack at speeds exceeding 100m s(-1) as required for applications. Our findings provide experimental evidence of recent predictions(10-13) and open the door to room-temperature skyrmion spintronics in robust thin-film heterostructures.

Effective Passivation of Exfoliated Black Phosphorus Transistors against Ambient Degradation	NANO LETTERS												Unencapsulated, exfoliated black phosphorus (BP) flakes are found to chemically degrade upon exposure to ambient conditions. Atomic force microscopy, electrostatic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to characterize the structure and chemistry of the degradation process, suggesting that O-2 saturated H2O irreversibly reacts with BP to form oxidized phosphorus species. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that BP degradation occurs more rapidly on hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayers and on H-Si(111) versus hydrophilic SiO2. For unencapsulated BP field-effect transistors, the ambient degradation causes large increases in threshold voltage after 6 h in ambient, followed by a similar to 10(3) decrease in FET current on/off ratio and mobility after 48 h. Atomic layer deposited AlOx overlayers effectively suppress ambient degradation, allowing encapsulated BP FETs to maintain high on/off ratios of similar to 103 and mobilities of similar to 100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for over 2 weeks in ambient conditions. This work shows that the ambient degradation of BP can be managed effectively when the flakes are sufficiently passivated. In turn, our strategy for enhancing BP environmental stability will accelerate efforts to implement BP in electronic and optoelectronic applications.

J	Kempton, W; Tomic, J				Kempton, W; Tomic, J			Vehicle-to-grid power implementation: From stabilizing the grid to supporting large-scale renewable energy	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES												Vehicle-to-grid power (V2G) uses electric-drive vehicles (battery, fuel cell, or hybrid) to provide power for specific electric markets. This article examines the systems and processes needed to tap energy in vehicles and implement V2G. It quantitatively compares today's light vehicle fleet with the electric power system. The vehicle fleet has 20 times the power capacity, less than one-tenth the utilization, and one-tenth the capital cost per prime mover M Conversely, utility generators have 10-50 times longer operating life and lower operating costs per kWh. To tap V2G is to synergistically use these complementary strengths and to reconcile the complementary needs of the driver and grid manager. This article suggests strategies and, business models for doing so, and the steps necessary for the implementation of V2G. After the initial high-value, V2G markets saturate and production costs drop, V2G can provide storage for renewable energy generation. Our calculations suggest that V2G could stabilize large-scale (one-half of US electricity) wind power with 3% of the fleet dedicated to regulation for wind, plus 8-38% of the fleet providing operating reserves or storage for wind. Jurisdictions more likely to take the lead in adopting V2G are identified. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The charge carriers in graphene behave like massless Dirac fermions, and graphene shows ballistic charge transport, turning it into an ideal material for circuit fabrication(2,3). However, graphene lacks a bandgap around the Fermi level, which is the defining concept for semiconductor materials and essential for controlling the conductivity by electronic means. Theory predicts that a tunable bandgap may be engineered by periodic modulations of the graphene lattice(4-6), but experimental evidence for this is so far lacking. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a bandgap opening in graphene, induced by the patterned adsorption of atomic hydrogen onto the Moire superlattice positions of graphene grown on an Ir(111) substrate.

With ZnO2 as precursors, we introduce a high concentration of oxygen vacancies into ZnO successfully. The obtained ZnO exhibits a yellow color, and the absorption edge shifts to longer wavelength. Raman and XPS spectra reveal that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO decreased when the samples are annealed at higher temperature in air. It is consistent with the theory calculation. The increasing of oxygen vacancies results in a narrowing bandgap and increases the visible light absorption of the ZnO. The narrowing bandgap can be confirmed by the enhancement of the photocurrent response when the ZnO was irradiated with visible light. The ZnO with oxygen vacancies are found to be efficient for photodecomposition of 2,4-dichlorophenol under visible light irradiation.

We show that a combination of high-resolution in situ X-ray photoemission and X-ray absorption spectroscopies offer a powerful approach to monitor the deoxygenation process and comprehensively evaluate the electronic structure of graphene oxide thin films at different stages of the thermal reduction process. It is established that the edge plane carboxyl groups are highly unstable, whereas carbonyl groups are more difficult to remove. The results consistently support the formation of phenol groups through reaction of basal plane epoxide groups with adjacent hydroxyl groups at moderate degrees of thermal activation (similar to 400 degrees C). The phenol groups are predominant over carbonyl groups and survive even at a temperature of 1000 degrees C. For the first time, a drastic increase in the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level at 600 degrees C is observed, suggesting a progressive restoration of aromatic structure in the thermally reduced graphene oxide.

J	Liu, F; Ming, PM; Li, J				Liu, Fang; Ming, Pingbing; Li, Ju			Ab initio calculation of ideal strength and phonon instability of graphene under tension	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Graphene-based sp(2)-carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and nanofibers can fail near their ideal strengths due to their exceedingly small dimensions. We have calculated the phonon spectra of graphene as a function of uniaxial tension by density functional perturbation theory to assess the first occurrence of phonon instability on the strain path, which controls the strength of a defect-free crystal at 0 K. Uniaxial tensile strain is applied in the x (nearest-neighbor) and y (second nearest-neighbor) directions, related to tensile deformation of zigzag and armchair nanotubes, respectively. The Young's modulus E=1050 GPa and Poisson's ratio nu=0.186 from our small-strain results are in good agreement with previous calculations. We find that in both x and y uniaxial tensions, phonon instabilities occur near the center of the Brillouin zone, at (epsilon(xx)=0.194, sigma(xx)=110 GPa, epsilon(yy)=-0.016) and (epsilon(yy)=0.266, sigma(yy)=121 GPa, epsilon(xx)=-0.027), respectively. Both soft phonons are longitudinal elastic waves in the pulling direction, suggesting that brittle cleavage fracture may be an inherent behavior of graphene and carbon nanotubes at low temperatures. We also predict that a phonon band gap will appear in highly stretched graphene, which could be a useful spectroscopic signature for highly stressed carbon nanotubes.

Activity Descriptors for CO<sub>2</sub> Electroreduction to Methane on Transition-Metal Catalysts	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS												The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbons and alcohols would allow renewable energy sources to be converted into fuels and chemicals. However, no electrode catalysts have been developed that can perform this transformation with a low overpotential at reasonable current densities. In this work, we compare trends in binding energies for the intermediates in CO2 electrochemical reduction and present an activity "volcano" based on this analysis. This analysis describes the experimentally observed variations in transition-metal catalysts, including why copper is the best-known metal electrocatalyst. The protonation of adsorbed CO is singled out as the most important step dictating the overpotential. New strategies are presented for the discovery of catalysts that can operate with a reduced overpotential.

The properties of aluminum and tungsten films on the following substrates have been studied: aluminum, glass, silicon and sapphire. By studying both soft films on hard substrates and hard films on soft substrates we are able to assess the effects of elastic and plastic inhomogeneity, as well as material pile-up, on the nanoindentation response. The data set includes Al/glass and W/sapphire, with the film and substrate having nearly the same elastic properties. These systems permit the true contact area and true hardness of the film to be determined from the measured contact stiffness, irrespective of the effects of pile-up or sink-in. Knowledge of the true hardness of the film permits a study of the effects of the elastic modulus mismatch on the nanoindentation properties. using the measured contact stiffness as a function of depth of indentation.

Control and characterization of individual grains and grain boundaries in graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition	NATURE MATERIALS												The strong interest in graphene has motivated the scalable production of high-quality graphene and graphene devices. As the large-scale graphene films synthesized so far are typically polycrystalline, it is important to characterize and control grain boundaries, generally believed to degrade graphene quality. Here we study single-crystal graphene grains synthesized by ambient chemical vapour deposition on polycrystalline Cu, and show how individual boundaries between coalescing grains affect graphene's electronic properties. The graphene grains show no definite epitaxial relationship with the Cu substrate, and can cross Cu grain boundaries. The edges of these grains are found to be predominantly parallel to zigzag directions. We show that grain boundaries give a significant Raman 'D' peak, impede electrical transport, and induce prominent weak localization indicative of intervalley scattering in graphene. Finally, we demonstrate an approach using pre-patterned growth seeds to control graphene nucleation, opening a route towards scalable fabrication of single-crystal graphene devices without grain boundaries.

First-principles study of metal adatom adsorption on graphene	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												The adsorption of 12 different metal adatoms on graphene is studied using first-principles density-functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation. The adsorption energy, geometry, density of states (DOS), dipole moment, and work function of each adatom-graphene system are calculated. For the adatoms studied from groups I-III of the Periodic Table, the results are consistent with ionic bonding, and the adsorption is characterized by minimal change in the graphene electronic states and large charge transfer. For transition, noble, and group IV metals, the calculations are consistent with covalent bonding, and the adsorption is characterized by strong hybridization between adatom and graphene electronic states. For ionically bonded adatoms, the charge transfer is calculated quantitatively using two methods, one based on the DOS and the other based on the real-space-charge density. A variation in dipole moments and work-function shifts across the different adatoms is observed. In particular, the work-function shift shows a general correlation with the induced interfacial dipole of the adatom-graphene system and the ionization potential of the isolated atom.

In situ deposition of Pd in the same reaction chamber in which the sensing measurements were carried out ensured that the observed modification in behavior was due to the Pd functionalization rather than the variation in properties from one nanowire to another. Changes in the conductance in the early stages of metal deposition (i.e., before metal percolation) indicated that the Pd nanoparticles on the nanowire surface created Schottky barrier-type junctions resulting in the formation of electron depletion regions within the nanowire, constricting the effective conduction channel and reducing the conductance. Pd-functionalized nanostructures exhibited a dramatic improvement in sensitivity toward oxygen and hydrogen due to the enhanced catalytic dissociation of the molecular adsorbate on the Pd nanoparticle surfaces and the subsequent diffusion of the resultant atomic species to the oxide surface.

J	Li, XD; Bhushan, B				Li, XD; Bhushan, B			A review of nanoindentation continuous stiffness measurement technique and its applications	MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION												Nanoindentation is now commonly used for the study of mechanical properties of materials on the nanoscale. One of the significant improvements in nanoindentation testing is the continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) technique. It offers a direct measure of dynamic contact stiffness during the loading portion of an indentation test and, being somewhat insensitive to thermal drift, allows an accurate observation of small volume deformation. Nanoscale damage caused by fatigue is of critical importance to the reliability of ultrathin protective overcoats and micro/nanostructures. The cyclic loading used in the CSM makes the technique useful for the evaluation of nanofatigue. Methodologies of the CSM technique used for the characterization of layered materials and nonhomogeneous composites are reviewed and discussed. Applications of the CSM technique to the measurement of contact stiffness, elastic modulus, hardness, creep resistance, and fatigue properties of the materials used in magnetic storage devices are presented. The nanoindentation CSM technique, in conjunction with nanoscratch and friction and wear tests, can be satisfactorily used for the materials characterization of magnetic storage and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and should find more application.

This work reports a carefully designed aqueous droplet light heating system along with a thorough mathematical procedure, which combined leads to a precise determination of internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency of a variety of nanomaterials. The internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency of MXene, more specifically Ti3C2, was measured to be 100%, indicating a perfect energy conversion. Furthermore, a self-floating MXene thin membrane was prepared by simple vacuum filtration and the membrane, in the presence of a rationally chosen heat barrier, produced a light-to-water evaporation efficiency of 84% under one sun irradiation, which is among the state of art energy efficiency for similar photothermal evaporation system. The outstanding internal light-to-heat conversion efficiency and great light-to-water evaporation efficiency reported in this work suggest that MXene is a very promising light-to-heat conversion material and thus deserves more research attention toward practical applications.

In particular, the underlying weak interaction of organic cations with surrounding iodides due to eight equivalent orientations of the organic cation along the body diagonals in unit cell and chemically non-inertness of organic cation result in photo- and moisture instability of organometal halide perovskite. Here, a perovskite light absorber incorporating organic-inorganic hybrid cation in the A-site of 3D APbI(3) structure with enhanced photo- and moisture stability is reported. A partial substitution of Cs+ for HC(NH2)(2)(+) in HC(NH2)(2)PbI3 perovskite is found to substantially improve photo- and moisture stability along with photovoltaic performance. When 10% of HC(NH2)(2)(+) is replaced by Cs+, photo- and moisture stability of perovskite film are significantly improved, which is attributed to the enhanced interaction between HC(NH2)(2)(+) and iodide due to contraction of cubo-octahedral volume. Moreover, trap density is reduced by one order of magnitude upon incorporation of Cs+, which is responsible for the increased open-circuit voltage and fill factor, eventually leading to enhancement of average PCE from 14.9% to 16.5%.

X-ray diffraction patterns of graphite and turbostratic carbon	CARBON												To identify the influence of microstructural variation on the X-ray diffraction intensities, X-ray diffraction patterns of hexagonal graphite (h-graphite) and turbostratic carbon (t-carbon) were simulated by using the general Debye equation. The numeric density of interatomic distance (NDID) is sensitive to the size and microstructure of a crystallite, so that it is used to characterize the structures of h-graphite and t-carbon. The dependence of the diffraction angles and full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of diffraction lines on the crystallite size and distortion factors is examined by computer simulation. The distortion factors for t-carbon, including rotation, translation, curvature, local positive fluctuation of interlayer spacing of graphene layers and fluctuation of atomic positions, have different influence on the NDIDs, hence on the X-ray diffraction patterns. The simulation results indicate that the diffraction angles and FWHMs of diffraction lines cannot be simply used to characterize the lattice parameters and crystallite sizes of t-carbon.

For the largest cooling effects of most potential refrigerants we need to fully exploit the different degrees of freedom such as magnetism and crystal structure. We report now for Heusler-type Ni-Mn-In-(Co) magnetic shape-memory alloys, the adiabatic temperature change Delta T-ad = 3.6 to -6.2 K under a moderate field of 2 T. Here it is the structural transition that plays the dominant role towards the net cooling effect. A phenomenological model is established that reveals the parameters essential for such a large Delta T-ad. We also demonstrate that obstacles to the application of Heusler alloys, namely the usually large hysteresis and limited operating temperature window, can be overcome by using the multi-response to different external stimuli and/or fine-tuning the lattice parameters, and by stacking a series of alloys with tailored magnetostructural transitions.

Direct laser writing of micro-supercapacitors on hydrated graphite oxide films	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY												Microscale supercapacitors provide an important complement to batteries in a variety of applications, including portable electronics. Although they can be manufactured using a number of printing and lithography techniques(1-3), continued improvements in cost, scalability and form factor are required to realize their full potential. Here, we demonstrate the scalable fabrication of a new type of all-carbon, monolithic supercapacitor by laser reduction and patterning of graphite oxide films. We pattern both in-plane and conventional electrodes consisting of reduced graphite oxide with micrometre resolution, between which graphite oxide serves as a solid electrolyte(4-9). The substantial amounts of trapped water in the graphite oxide makes it simultaneously a good ionic conductor and an electrical insulator, allowing it to serve as both an electrolyte and an electrode separator with ion transport characteristics similar to that observed for Nafion membranes(10,11). The resulting micro-supercapacitor devices show good cyclic stability, and energy storage capacities comparable to existing thin-film supercapacitors(1).

Originated from the slow redox kinetics of polysulfide intermediates, the flood of polysulfides in the batteries during cycling induced low sulfur utilization, severe polarization, low energy efficiency, deteriorated polysulfide shuttle, and short cycling life. Herein, sulfiphilic cobalt disulfide (CoS2) was incorporated into carbon/sulfur cathodes, introducing strong interaction between lithium polysulfides and CoS2 under working conditions. The interfaces between CoS2 and electrolyte served as strong adsorption and activation sites for polar polysulfides and therefore accelerated redox reactions of polysulfides. The high polysulfide reactivity not only guaranteed effective polarization mitigation and promoted energy efficiency by 10% but also promised high discharge capacity and stable cycling performance during 2000 cycles. A slow capacity decay rate of 0.034%/cycle at 2.0 C and a high initial capacity of 1368 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C were achieved. Since the propelling redox reaction is not limited to Li-S system, we foresee the reported strategy herein can be applied in other high-power devices through the systems with controllable redox reactions.

Thermal properties of graphene: Fundamentals and applications	MRS BULLETIN												Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) material with over 100-fold anisotropy of heat flow between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. High in-plane thermal conductivity is due to covalent sp(2) bonding between carbon atoms, whereas out-of-plane heat flow is limited by weak van der Waals coupling. Herein, we review the thermal properties of graphene, including its specific heat and thermal conductivity (from diffusive to ballistic limits) and the influence of substrates, defects, and other atomic modifications. We also highlight practical applications in which the thermal properties of graphene play a role. For instance, graphene transistors and interconnects benefit from the high in-plane thermal conductivity, up to a certain channel length. However, weak thermal coupling with substrates implies that interfaces and contacts remain significant dissipation bottlenecks. Heat flow in graphene or graphene composites could also be tunable through a variety of means, including phonon scattering by substrates, edges, or interfaces. Ultimately, the unusual thermal properties of graphene stem from its 2D nature, forming a rich playground for new discoveries of heat-flow physics and potentially leading to novel thermal management applications.

These nanorods were characterized by dark-field microscopy, UV-visible spectrophotometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Temporal evolution of rod shape had also been followed by UV-visible spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy and indicates that the nanorods briefly increase in length, then increase slightly in width, as they grow. The effect of the synthetic parameters on the rod dimension and yield was explored to find out suitable conditions to produce short nanorods; short nanorods have both plasmon bands in the visible region of the spectrum, which is a valuable property for sensor applications.

The obtained GM is characterized with atomic force microscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and so on. The merit of this method is that both the reducing agents themselves and the oxidized Products are environmentally friendly. It should be noted that, besides the mild reduction capability to GO, the oxidized products of reducing sugars could also play an important role as a capping reagent in stabilizing as-prepared GNS simultaneously, which exhibited good stability in water. This approach can open up the new possibility for preparing GNS in large-scale production alternatively. Moreover, it is found that GNS-based materials could be of great value for applications in various fields, such as good electrocatalytic activity toward catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine).					fang, youxing/K-1972-2016; , 董绍俊/P-5166-2019; Guo, Shaojun/A-8449-2011; Zhu, Chengzhou/M-3566-2014	Guo, Shaojun/0000-0002-5941-414X; Zhu, Chengzhou/0000-0003-0679-7965													1936-0851	1936-086X				APR	2010	4	4					2429	2437		10.1021/nn1002387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn1002387								20359169					WOS:000276956800079

Graphene-based flexible supercapacitors are one of the most promising candidates because of their intriguing features. In this report, we describe the use of freestanding, lightweight (0.75 mg/cm(2)), ultrathin (<200 mu m), highly conductive (55 S/cm), and flexible three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks, loaded with MnO2 by electrodeposition, as the electrodes of a flexible supercapacitor. It was found that the 3D graphene networks showed an ideal supporter for active materials and permitted a large MnO2 mass loading of 9.8 mg/cm(2) (similar to 92.9% of the mass of the entire electrode), leading to a high area capacitance of 1.42 F/cm(2) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. With a view to practical applications, we have further optimized the MnO2 content with respect to the entire electrode and achieved a maximum specific capacitance of 130 F/g. In addition, we have also explored the excellent electrochemical performance of a symmetrical supercapacitor (of weight less than 10 mg and thickness similar to 0.8 mm) consisting of a sandwich structure of two pieces of 3D graphene/MnO2 composite network separated by a membrane and encapsulated in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes. This research might provide a method for flexible, lightweight, high-performance, low-cost, and environmentally friendly materials used in energy conversion and storage systems for the effective use of renewable energy.

J	Monroe, C; Newman, J				Monroe, C; Newman, J			The impact of elastic deformation on deposition kinetics at lithium/polymer interfaces	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY												Past theories of electrode stability assume that the surface tension resists the amplification of surface roughness at cathodes and show that instability at lithium/liquid interfaces cannot be Prevented by surface forces alone [Electrochim. Acta, 40, 599 (1995)]. This work treats interfacial stability in lithium/polymer systems where the electrolyte is solid. Linear elasticity theory is employed to compute the additional effect of bulk mechanical forces on electrode stability. The lithium and polymer are treated as Hookean elastic materials, characterized by their shear moduli and Poisson's ratios. Two-dimensional displacement distributions that satisfy force balances across a periodically deforming interface are derived; these allow computation of the stress and surface-tension forces. The incorporation of elastic effects into a kinetic model demonstrates regimes of electrolyte mechanical properties where amplification of surface roughness can be inhibited. For a polymer material with Poisson's ratio similar to poly(ethylene oxide), interfacial roughening is mechanically suppressed when the separator shear modulus is about twice that of lithium.

J	Kruk, M; Jaroniec, M; Ko, CH; Ryoo, R				Kruk, M; Jaroniec, M; Ko, CH; Ryoo, R			Characterization of the porous structure of SBA-15	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												SBA-15 ordered mesoporous silicas were synthesized using the method reported by Zhao et al, The structures of these materials were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and nitrogen adsorption. The samples were found to exhibit structural properties similar to those reported earlier. Our study confirmed that the size of primary mesopores of SBA-15 can be tailored by the choice of synthesis temperature and that SBA-15 exhibits a significant amount of disordered micropores and small mesopores, The volume and size of these complementary pores were found to be dependent to some extent on the synthesis/aging temperature. It was shown that the washing of as-synthesized SBA-15 in water or ethanol was accompanied by an appreciable structural shrinkage and led to the removal of a significant part of the polymeric template. Therefore, washing needs to be avoided if one wants to isolate SBA-15 without appreciable loss of the template. It was confirmed that water-washed SBA-15 samples have fully accessible primary mesopores. Ethanol-washed samples also were found to exhibit accessible porosity. Despite an appreciable content of the template in the water- and ethanol-washed samples, their pore sizes were usually larger than those of the calcined materials. The observed structural properties of SBA-15 and their dependence on the synthesis temperature and washing were attributed to the changes in the degree of penetration of the poly(ethylene oxide) chains of the triblock copolymer template within the siliceous walls of SBA-15.

Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor, with the Ni-Co LDH hybrid film as the positive electrode material and porous freeze-dried reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as the negative electrode material, exhibits an ultrahigh energy density (188 Wh kg(-1)) at an average power density of 1499 W kg(-1) based on the mass of active material, which greatly exceeds the energy densities of most previously reported nickel or cobalt oxide/hydroxide-based asymmetric supercapacitors.					hu, linfeng/C-6491-2014; liu, junyan/HGV-1505-2022; Chen, Hao/P-1633-2016	Chen, Hao/0000-0002-6147-3173													1616-301X	1616-3028				FEB	2014	24	7					934	942		10.1002/adfm.201301747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201301747													WOS:000331962000006

Temperature dependence of raman scattering in ZnO	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We present a Raman scattering study of wurtzite ZnO over a temperature range from 80 to 750 K. Second-order Raman features are interpreted in the light of recent ab initio phonon density of states calculations. The temperature dependence of the Raman intensities allows the assignment of difference modes to be made unambiguously. Some weak, sharp Raman peaks are detected whose temperature dependence suggests they may be due to impurity modes. High-resolution spectra of the E-2(high), A(1)(LO), and E-1(LO) modes were recorded, and an analysis of the anharmonicity and lifetimes of these phonons is carried out. The E-2(high) mode displays a visibly asymmetric line shape. This can be attributed to anharmonic interaction with transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonon combinations in the vicinity of the K point, where the two-phonon density of states displays a sharp edge around the E-2(high) frequency. The temperature dependence of the linewidth and frequency of the E-2(high) mode is well described by a perturbation-theory renormalization of the harmonic E-2(high) frequency resulting from the interaction with the acoustic two-phonon density of states. In contrast, the A(1)(LO) and E-1(LO) frequencies lie in a region of nearly flat two-phonon density of states, and they exhibit a nearly symmetric Lorentzian line shape with a temperature dependence that is well accounted for by a dominating asymmetric decay channel.

Ferromagnetism as a universal feature of nanoparticles of the otherwise nonmagnetic oxides	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Room-temperature ferromagnetism has been observed in nanoparticles (7-30 nm diam) of nonmagnetic oxides such as CeO2, Al2O3, ZnO, In2O3, and SnO2. The saturated magnetic moments in CeO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles are comparable to those observed in transition-metal-doped wideband semiconducting oxides. The other oxide nanoparticles show somewhat lower values of magnetization but with a clear hysteretic behavior. Conversely, the bulk samples obtained by sintering the nanoparticles at high temperatures in air or oxygen became diamagnetic. As there were no magnetic impurities present, we assume that the origin of ferromagnetism may be the exchange interactions between localized electron spin moments resulting from oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of nanoparticles. We suggest that ferromagnetism may be a universal characteristic of nanoparticles of metal oxides.

J	Li, Y; Zhang, W; Niu, JF; Chen, YS				Li, Yang; Zhang, Wen; Niu, Junfeng; Chen, Yongsheng			Mechanism of Photogenerated Reactive Oxygen Species and Correlation with the Antibacterial Properties of Engineered Metal-Oxide Nanoparticles	ACS NANO												Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the most important antibacterial mechanisms of engineered nanoparticles (NPs). To elucidate the ROS generation mechanisms, we investigated the ROS production kinetics of seven selected metal-oxide NPs and their bulk counterparts under UV irradiation (365 nm). The results show that different metal oxides had distinct photogenerated ROS kinetics. Particularly, TiO2 nanoparticles and ZnO nanoparticles generated three types of ROS (superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical, and singlet oxygen), whereas other metal oxides generated only one or two types or did not generate any type of ROS. Moreover, NPs yielded more ROS than their bulk counterparts likely due to larger surface areas of NPs providing more absorption sites for UV irradiation. The ROS generation mechanism was elucidated by comparing the electronic structures (i.e., band edge energy levels) of the metal oxides with the redox potentials of various ROS generation, which correctly interpreted the ROS generation of most metal oxides. To develop a quantitative relationship between oxidative stress and antibacterial activity of NPs, we examined the viability of E. coli cells in aqueous suspensions of NPs under UV irradiation, and a linear correlation was found between the average concentration of total ROS and the bacterial survival rates (R-2 = 0.84). Although some NPs (i.e., ZnO and CuO nanoparticles) released toxic ions that partially contributed to their antibacterial activity, this correlation quantitatively linked ROS production capability of NPs to their antibacterial activity as well as shed light on the applications of metal-oxide NPs as potential antibacterial agents.					li, yang/AAQ-4597-2021; Chen, Yongsheng/B-1541-2010; Niu, Junfeng/A-5489-2012	Niu, Junfeng/0000-0003-2592-3103													1936-0851	1936-086X				JUN	2012	6	6					5164	5173		10.1021/nn300934k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn300934k								22587225					WOS:000305661300067

Here a graphene oxide (GO)-based multicolor fluorescent DNA nanoprobe that allows rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of DNA targets in homogeneous solution by exploiting interactions between GO and DNA molecules is reported. Because of the extraordinarily high quenching efficiency of GO, the fluorescent ssDNA probe exhibits minimal background fluorescence, while strong emission is observed when it forms a double helix with the specific targets, leading to a high signal-to-background ratio. Importantly, the large planar surface of GO allows simultaneous quenching of multiple DNA probes labeled with different dyes, leading to a multicolor sensor for the detection of multiple DNA targets in the same solution. It is also demonstrated that this GO-based sensing platform is suitable for the detection of a range of analytes when complemented with the use of functional DNA structures.

Water droplets rolled off easily from those silicon samples which had a microstructure consisting of rather slender spikes with narrow pitches. Such samples could be cleaned almost completely from artificial particulate contaminations by a fog consisting of water droplets (diameter range, 8-20 mum). Some metal foils and some replicates had two levels of roughening. Because of this, a complete removal of all particles was not possible using artificial fog. However, water drops with some amount of kinetic impact energy were able to clean these surfaces perfectly. A substrate where pronounced structures in the range below 5 mum were lacking could not be cleaned by means of fog because this treatment resulted in a continuous water film on the samples.

By its user friendliness the technique is closely related to the classical approach where the modal parameters are estimated by simple peak picking. However, by introducing a decomposition of the spectral density function matrix, the response spectra can be separated into a set of single degree of freedom systems, each corresponding to an individual mode. By using this decomposition technique close modes can be identified with high accuracy even in the case of strong noise contamination of the signals. Also, the technique clearly indicates harmonic components in the response signals.																			0964-1726					JUN	2001	10	3					441	445		10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/303													WOS:000169906900004

The devices are typically fabricated using condensed or mesoporous TiO2 as the electron transport layer and 2,2'7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)9,9'-spirobifluorene as the hole transport layer. However, the high-temperature processing (450 degrees C) requirement of the TiO2 layer could hinder the widespread adoption of the technology. In this report, we adopted a low-temperature processing technique to attain high-efficiency devices in both rigid and flexible substrates, using device structure substrate/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3-x)Cl(x)/PCBM/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and PCBM are used as hole and electron transport layers, respectively. Mixed halide perovskite, CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3-x)Cl(x) was used due to its long carrier lifetime and good electrical properties. All of these layers are solution-processed under 120 degrees C. Based on the proposed device structure, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.5% is obtained in rigid substrates (glass/ITO), and a 9.2% PCE is achieved for a polyethylene terephthalate/ITO flexible substrate.

In addition, several remaining controversies or gaps in understanding are identified, such as the nature and influence on kinetics of an early surface hydrate, the mechanistic origin of the beginning of the acceleration period, the manner in which microscopic growth processes lead to the characteristic morphologies of hydration products at larger length scales, and the role played by diffusion in the deceleration period.

Their main limitation, however, is the low volumetric energy density when compared with batteries. Here, we describe a hierarchically structured carbon microfibre made of an interconnected network of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes with interposed nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets. The nanomaterials form mesoporous structures of large specific surface area (396 m(2) g(-1)) and high electrical conductivity (102 S cm(-1)). We develop a scalable method to continuously produce the fibres using a silica capillary column functioning as a hydrothermal microreactor. The resultant fibres show a specific volumetric capacity as high as 305 F cm(-3) in sulphuric acid (measured at 73.5 mA cm(-3) in a three-electrode cell) or 300 F cm(-3) in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/H3PO4 electrolyte (measured at 26.7 mA cm(-3) in a two-electrode cell). A full micro-supercapacitor with PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte, free from binder, current collector and separator, has a volumetric energy density of similar to 6.3 mWh cm(-3) (a value comparable to that of 4 V-500 mu Ah thin-film lithium batteries) while maintaining a power density more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of batteries, as well as a long cycle life. To demonstrate that our fibre-based, all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors can be easily integrated into miniaturized flexible devices, we use them to power an ultraviolet photodetector and a light-emitting diode.

The model assumes a stationary alpha/gamma interface, and requires a uniform chemical potential for carbon, but not iron, in the two phases, leading to a metastable equilibrium condition identified here as "constrained paraequilibrium" or CPE. The model is explained with example calculations showing the characteristics of the constrained paraequilibrium condition, and applications are discussed with respect to new microstructures and processes, including a new "quenching and partitioning," or Q&P process, to create mixtures of carbon-depleted martensite, and carbon-enriched retained austenite.

Such a crystal behaves as a material having an effective refractive index controllable by the band structure. This situation is analogous to the effective-mass approximation id electron-band theory. By utilizing this phenomenon, negatively refractive material can be realized, which has interesting optical properties such as mirror-image refraction.																			2469-9950	2469-9969				OCT 15	2000	62	16					10696	10705		10.1103/PhysRevB.62.10696	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.62.10696													WOS:000165058600023

Alec; Salleo, Alberto			A non-volatile organic electrochemical device as a low-voltage artificial synapse for neuromorphic computing	NATURE MATERIALS												The brain is capable of massively parallel information processing while consuming only similar to 1-100 fJ per synaptic event(1,2). Inspired by the efficiency of the brain, CMOS-based neural architectures(3) and memristors(4,5) are being developed for pattern recognition and machine learning. However, the volatility, design complexity and high supply voltages for CMOS architectures, and the stochastic and energy-costly switching of memristors complicate the path to achieve the interconnectivity, information density, and energy efficiency of the brain using either approach. Here we describe an electrochemical neuromorphic organic device (ENODe) operating with a fundamentally different mechanism from existing memristors. ENODe switches at low voltage and energy (<10 pJ for 10(3) mu m(2) devices), displays >500 distinct, non-volatile conductance states within a similar to 1V range, and achieves high classification accuracy when implemented in neural network simulations. Plastic ENODes are also fabricated on flexible substrates enabling the integration of neuromorphic functionality in stretchable electronic systems(6,7). Mechanical flexibility makes ENODes compatible with three-dimensional architectures, opening a path towards extreme interconnectivity comparable to the human brain.

Herein, the direct growth of 1D NiCo2S4 nanowire (NW) arrays on a 3D Ni foam (NF) is described. This NiCo2S4 NW/NF array functions as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with excellent activity and stability. The 3D-Ni foam facilitates the directional growth, exposing more active sites of the catalyst for electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The binder-free, self-made NiCo2S4 NW/NF electrode delivers a hydrogen production current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 260 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and at 210 mV (versus a reversible hydrogen electrode) for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH. This highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst enables the preparation of an alkaline water electrolyzer that could deliver 10 mA cm(-2) under a cell voltage of 1.63 V. Because the nonprecious-metal NiCo2S4 NW/NF foam-based electrodes afford the vigorous and continuous evolution of both H-2 and O-2 at 1.68 V, generated using a solar panel, they appear to be promising water splitting devices for large-scale solar-to-hydrogen generation.

J	Nie, JF				Nie, Jian-Feng			Precipitation and Hardening in Magnesium Alloys	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE												Magnesium alloys have received an increasing interest in the past 12 years for potential applications in the automotive, aircraft, aerospace, and electronic industries. Many of these alloys are strong because of solid-state precipitates that are produced by an age-hardening process. Although some strength improvements of existing magnesium alloys have been made and some novel alloys with improved strength have been developed, the strength level that has been achieved so far is still substantially lower than that obtained in counterpart aluminum alloys. Further improvements in the alloy strength require a better understanding of the structure, morphology, orientation of precipitates, effects of precipitate morphology, and orientation on the strengthening and microstructural factors that are important in controlling the nucleation and growth of these precipitates. In this review, precipitation in most precipitation-hardenable magnesium alloys is reviewed, and its relationship with strengthening is examined. It is demonstrated that the precipitation phenomena in these alloys, especially in the very early stage of the precipitation process, are still far from being well understood, and many fundamental issues remain unsolved even after some extensive and concerted efforts made in the past 12 years. The challenges associated with precipitation hardening and age hardening are identified and discussed, and guidelines are outlined for the rational design and development of higher strength, and ultimately ultrahigh strength, magnesium alloys via precipitation hardening.

The anisotropy of the function was introduced in the formulation using two linear transformations on the Cauchy stress tensor. It was shown that the accuracy of this new function was similar to that of other recently proposed non-quadratic yield functions. Moreover, it was proved that the function is convex in stress space. A new experiment was proposed to obtain one of the anisotropy coefficients. This new formulation is expected to be particularly suitable for finite element (FE) modeling simulations of sheet forming processes for aluminum alloy sheets. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The PPs are tested on the lattice constants of the fcc and bcc structures of the 63 elements of the GBRV library. The same parameters are used to generate fully relativistic PPs that are compared with the scalar relativistic PPs. The PPs of lanthanides and actinides are tested on all-electron data available in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ramasubramaniam, A				Ramasubramaniam, Ashwin			Large excitonic effects in monolayers of molybdenum and tungsten dichalcogenides	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												Quasiparticle band structures and optical properties of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, and WSe2 monolayers are studied using the GW approximation in conjunction with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The inclusion of two-particle excitations in the BSE approach reveals the presence of two strongly bound excitons (A and B) below the quasiparticle absorption onset arising from vertical transitions between a spin-orbit-split valence band and the conduction band at the K point of the Brillouin zone. The transition energies for monolayer MoS2, in particular, are shown to be in excellent agreement with available absorption and photoluminescence measurements. Excitation energies for the remaining monolayers are predicted to lie in the range of 1-2 eV. Systematic trends are identified for quasiparticle band gaps, transition energies, and exciton binding energies within as well as across the Mo and W families of dichalcogenides. Overall, the results suggest that quantum confinement of carriers within monolayers can be exploited in conjunction with chemical composition to tune the optoelectronic properties of layered transition-metal dichalcogenides at the nanoscale.

J	Dickey, MD				Dickey, Michael D.			Stretchable and Soft Electronics using Liquid Metals	ADVANCED MATERIALS												The use of liquid metals based on gallium for soft and stretchable electronics is discussed. This emerging class of electronics is motivated, in part, by the new opportunities that arise from devices that have mechanical properties similar to those encountered in the human experience, such as skin, tissue, textiles, and clothing. These types of electronics (e.g., wearable or implantable electronics, sensors for soft robotics, e-skin) must operate during deformation. Liquid metals are compelling materials for these applications because, in principle, they are infinitely deformable while retaining metallic conductivity. Liquid metals have been used for stretchable wires and interconnects, reconfigurable antennas, soft sensors, self-healing circuits, and conformal electrodes. In contrast to Hg, liquid metals based on gallium have low toxicity and essentially no vapor pressure and are therefore considered safe to handle. Whereas most liquids bead up to minimize surface energy, the presence of a surface oxide on these metals makes it possible to pattern them into useful shapes using a variety of techniques, including fluidic injection and 3D printing. In addition to forming excellent conductors, these metals can be used actively to form memory devices, sensors, and diodes that are completely built from soft materials. The properties of these materials, their applications within soft and stretchable electronics, and future opportunities and challenges are considered.

J	Padmavathy, N; Vijayaraghavan, R				Padmavathy, Nagarajan; Vijayaraghavan, Rajagopalan			Enhanced bioactivity of ZnO nanoparticles-an antimicrobial study	SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS												In this study, we investigate the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles with various particle sizes. ZnO was prepared by the base hydrolysis of zinc acetate in a 2-propanol medium and also by a precipitation method using Zn(NO3)(2) and NaOH. The products were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Bacteriological tests such as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk diffusion were performed in Luria-Bertani and nutrient agar media on solid agar plates and in liquid broth systems using different concentrations of ZnO by a standard microbial method for the first time. Our bacteriological study showed the enhanced biocidal activity of ZnO nanoparticles compared with bulk ZnO in repeated experiments. This demonstrated that the bactericidal efficacy of ZnO nanoparticles increases with decreasing particle size. It is proposed that both the abrasiveness and the surface oxygen species of ZnO nanoparticles promote the biocidal properties of ZnO nanoparticles.

Such miniaturization is expected to lead to compact, nanoscale optical devices with applications in cameras, lighting, displays and wearable optics. However, retaining functionality while reducing device size has proven particularly challenging. For example, so far there has been no demonstration of broadband achromatic metalenses covering the entire visible spectrum. Here, we show that by judicious design of nanofins on a surface, it is possible to simultaneously control the phase, group delay and group delay dispersion of light, thereby achieving a transmissive achromatic metalens with large bandwidth. We demonstrate diffraction-limited achromatic focusing and achromatic imaging from 470 to 670 nm. Our metalens comprises only a single layer of nanostructures whose thickness is on the order of the wavelength, and does not involve spatial multiplexing or cascading. While this initial design (numerical aperture of 0.2) has an efficiency of about 20% at 500 nm, we discuss ways in which our approach may be further optimized to meet the demand of future applications.					sanjeev, vyshakh/HHS-0944-2022; shi, zhujun/IUO-5412-2023; capasso, federico/ACW-7492-2022; Zhu, Alexander/Q-2473-2016; Chen, Wei Ting/J-7691-2012	sanjeev, vyshakh/0000-0003-3141-4209; Chen, Wei Ting/0000-0001-8665-9241													1748-3387	1748-3395				MAR	2018	13	3					220	+		10.1038/s41565-017-0034-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41565-017-0034-6								29292382					WOS:000427009000015

Temperature Sensing Using Fluorescent Nanothermometers	ACS NANO												Acquiring the temperature of a single living cell is not a trivial task. In this paper, we devise a novel nanothermometer, capable of accurately determining the temperature of solutions as well as biological systems such as HeLa cancer cells. The nanothermometer is based on the temperature-sensitive fluorescence of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles, where the intensity ratio of the green fluorescence bands of the Er3+ dopant ions (H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) and S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2)) changes with temperature. The nanothermometers were first used to obtain thermal profiles created when heating a colloidal solution of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles in water using a pump-probe experiment. Following incubation of the nanoparticles with HeLa cervical cancer cells and their subsequent uptake, the fluorescent nanothermometers measured the internal temperature of the living cell from 25 degrees C to its thermally induced death at 45 degrees C.

In view of increasingly serious energy and environmental problems, semiconductor-based artificial photosynthetic systems consisting of isolated photochemical system 1 (PS1), PS2 and the electron-transfer system have recently been developed(2,3). However, the direct coupling of the components is crucial for retarding back reactions to increase the reaction efficiency. Here, we report a simple technique for forming an anisotropic CdS-Au-TiO2 nanojunction, in which PS1(CdS), PS2(TiO2) and the electron-transfer system (Au) are spatially fixed.

For the experimental analysis, EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of MWCNT/polypropylene (PP) composite plates made in three different thicknesses and at four different concentrations were studied. A model based on the shielding of electromagnetic plane wave was used to theoretically study the EMI shielding mechanisms.

Mechanical behavior and strengthening mechanisms in ultrafine grain precipitation-strengthened aluminum alloy	ACTA MATERIALIA												To provide insight into the relationships between precipitation phenomena, grain size and mechanical behavior in a complex precipitation-strengthened alloy system, Al 7075 alloy, a commonly used aluminum alloy, was selected as a model system in the present study. Ultrafine-grained (UFG) bulk materials were fabricated through cryomilling, degassing, hot isostatic pressing and extrusion, followed by a subsequent heat treatment. The mechanical behavior and microstructure of the materials were analyzed and compared directly to the coarse-grained (CG) counterpart. Three-dimensional atom-probe tomography was utilized to investigate the intermetallic precipitates and oxide dispersoids formed in the as-extruded UFG material. UFG 7075 exhibits higher strength than the CG 7075 alloy for each equivalent condition. After a T6 temper, the yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of UFG 7075 achieved 734 and 774 MPa, respectively, which are similar to 120 MPa higher than those of the CG equivalent. The strength of as-extruded UFG 7075 (YS: 583 MPa, UTS: 631 MPa) is even higher than that of commercial 7075-T6. More importantly, the strengthening mechanisms in each material were established quantitatively for the first time for this complex precipitation-strengthened system, accounting for grain-boundary, dislocation, solid-solution, precipitation and oxide dispersoid strengthening contributions. Grain-boundary strengthening was the predominant mechanism in as-extruded UFG 7075, contributing a strength increment estimated to be 242 MPa, whereas Orowan precipitation strengthening was predominant in the as-extruded CG 7075 (similar to 102 MPa) and in the T6-tempered materials, and was estimated to contribute 472 and 414 MPa for CG-T6 and UFG-T6, respectively.

A stable three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetal Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>	NATURE MATERIALS												Three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals (TDSs) are a recently proposed state of quantum matter(1-6) that have attracted increasing attention in physics and materials science. A 3D TDS is not only a bulk analogue of graphene; it also exhibits non-trivial topology in its electronic structure that shares similarities with topological insulators. Moreover, a TDS can potentially be driven into other exotic phases (such as Weyl semimetals(1,7), axion insulators(1,4) and topological superconductors(8,9)), making it a unique parent compound for the study of these states and the phase transitions between them. Here, by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe a pair of 3D Dirac fermions in Cd3As2, proving that it is a model 3D TDS. Compared with other 3D TDSs, for example, beta-cristobalite BiO2 (ref. 3) and Na3Bi (refs 4,5), Cd3As2 is stable and has much higher Fermi velocities. Furthermore, by in situ doping we have been able to tune its Fermi energy, making it a flexible platform for exploring exotic physical phenomena.

The treated PEDOT: PSS films show enhanced conductivities up to 1418 S cm(-1), accompanied by structural and chemical changes. The effect of the solvent treatment on PEDOT: PSS has been investigated in detail and is shown to cause a reduction of insulating PSS in the conductive polymer layer. Using these optimized electrodes, ITO-free, small molecule organic solar cells with a zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc): fullerene C-60 bulk heterojunction have been produced on glass and PET substrates. The system was further improved by pre-heating the PEDOT: PSS electrodes, which enhanced the power conversion efficiency to the values obtained for solar cells on ITO electrodes. The results show that optimized PEDOT: PSS with solvent and thermal post-treatment can be a very promising electrode material for highly efficient flexible ITO-free organic solar cells.

In these long transistors, carrier transport is diffusive and the channel resistance dominates the transport. Transport characteristics are used to extract the field-effect mobility (79 000 cm(2)/Vs) and estimate the intrinsic mobility (>100 000 cm(2)/Vs) at room temperature. These values exceed those for all known semiconductors, which bodes well for application of nanotubes in high-speed transistors, single- and few-electron memories, and chemical/biochemical sensors.

The Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) drastically simplifies this procedure by implementing decision rules based on formal statistical analysis that frees the researchers from a constant monitoring during the calculation process and automatically "glues" together the input and the output of various codes, in order to provide a. high-level interface to the calculation of alloy thermodynamic properties from first-principles. ATAT implements the Structure Inversion Method (SIM), also known as the Connolly-Williams method, in combination with semi-grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations. In order to make this powerful toolkit available to the wide community of researchers who could benefit from,it, this article present-a concise user guide outlining the steps required to obtain thermodynamic information from ab initio calculations.

The PL intensity of 1L-MoS2 was drastically enhanced by the adsorption of p-type dopants with high electron affinity but reduced by the adsorption of n-type dopants. This PL modulation results from switching between exciton PL and trion PL depending on carrier density in 1L-MoS2.

Advances in alternative cementitious binders	CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH												There is a burgeoning interest in the development, characterization, and implementation of alternatives to Portland cement as a binder in concrete. The construction materials industry is under increasing pressure to reduce the energy used in production of Portland cement clinker and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Further, Portland cement is not the ideal binder for all construction applications, as it suffers from durability problems in particularly aggressive environments. Several alternative binders have been available for almost as long as Portland cement, yet have not been extensively used, and new ones are being developed. In this paper, four promising binders available as alternatives to Portland cement are discussed, namely calcium aluminate cement, calcium sulfoaluminate cement, alkali-activated binders, and supersulfated cements. The history of the binders, their compositions and reaction mechanisms, benefits and drawbacks, unanswered questions, and primary challenges are described. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Particle size-dependent organ distribution of gold nanoparticles after intravenous administration	BIOMATERIALS												A kinetic study was performed to determine the influence of particle size on the in vivo tissue distribution of spherical-shaped gold nanoparticles in the rat. Gold nanoparticles were chosen as model substances as they are used in several medical applications. In addition, the detection of the presence of gold is feasible with no background levels in the body in the normal situation. Rats were intravenously injected in the tail vein with gold nanoparticles with a diameter of 10, 50, 100 and 250 nm, respectively. After 24 h, the rats were sacrificed and blood and various organs were collected for gold determination. The presence of gold was measured quantitatively with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For all gold nanoparticle sizes the majority of the gold was demonstrated to be present in liver and spleen. A clear difference was observed between the distribution of the 10 rum particles and the larger particles. The 10 rum particles were present in various organ systems including blood, liver, spleen, kidney, testis, thymus, heart, lung and brain, whereas the larger particles were only detected in blood, liver and spleen. The results demonstrate that tissue distribution of gold nartoparticles is size-dependent with the smallest 10 run nanoparticles showing the most widespread organ distribution. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The ordered brick-and-mortar arrangement of organic and inorganic layers is believed to be the most essential strength- and toughness-determining structural feature of nacre. It has also been found that the ionic crosslinking of tightly folded macromolecules is equally important. Here, we demonstrate that both structural features can be reproduced by sequential deposition of polyelectrolytes and clays. This simple process results in a nanoscale version of nacre with alternating organic and inorganic layers. The macromolecular folding effect reveals itself in the unique saw-tooth pattern of differential stretching curves attributed to the gradual breakage of ionic crosslinks in polyelectrolyte chains. The tensile strength of the prepared multilayers approached that of nacre, whereas their ultimate Young modulus was similar to that of lamellar bones. Structural and functional resemblance makes clay polyelectrolyte multilayers a close replica of natural biocomposites. Their nanoscale nature enables elucidation of molecular processes occurring under stress.

PANI nanowire arrays are aligned vertically on GO substrate. The morphologies of PANI nanowires can be controlled by adjusting the ratios of aniline to GO, which are attributed to different nucleation processes. The hierarchical nanocomposite structures of PANI GO were further proved by UV-vis, FTIR, and XRD measurements. The hierarchical nanocomposite possessed higher electrochemical capacitance and better stability than each individual component as supercapacitor electrode materials, showing a synergistic effect of PANI and GO.

Although recent reports on cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries have demonstrated performances comparable to their lithium-ion counterparts, the major scientific challenge for a competitive sodium-ion battery technology is to develop viable anode materials. Here we show that a hybrid material made out of a few phosphorene layers sandwiched between graphene layers shows a specific capacity of 2,440 mA h g(-1) (calculated using the mass of phosphorus only) at a current density of 0.05 A g(-1) and an 83% capacity retention after 100 cycles while operating between 0 and 1.5 V. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy and ex situ X-ray diffraction techniques, we explain the large capacity of our anode through a dual mechanism of intercalation of sodium ions along the x axis of the phosphorene layers followed by the formation of a Na3P alloy. The presence of graphene layers in the hybrid material works as a mechanical backbone and an electrical highway, ensuring that a suitable elastic buffer space accommodates the anisotropic expansion of phosphorene layers along the y and z axial directions for stable cycling operation.					zheng, guangyuan/K-6931-2014; Cui, Yi/L-5804-2013; Sun, Jie/I-3664-2016; Sun, Yongming/ABH-1286-2021; Li, Yuzhang/ABE-6314-2020; Yuan, Hongtao/C-9807-2012; Lee, Hyun-Wook/Q-9222-2016; Pasta, Mauro/B-8164-2012	Lee, Hyun-Wook/0000-0001-9074-1619; Pasta, Mauro/0000-0002-2613-4555													1748-3387	1748-3395				NOV	2015	10	11					980	U184		10.1038/NNANO.2015.194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NNANO.2015.194								26344183					WOS:000364528300016

Transfer of CVD-Grown Monolayer Graphene onto Arbitrary Substrates	ACS NANO												Reproducible dry and wet transfer techniques were developed to improve the transfer of large-area monolayer graphene grown on copper foils by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The techniques reported here allow transfer onto three different classes of substrates: substrates covered with shallow depressions, perforated substrates, and flat substrates. A novel dry, transfer technique was used to make graphene-sealed microchambers without trapping-liquid inside. The dry transfer technique utilizes a polydimethylsiloxane frame that attaches to the poly(methyl methacrylate) spun over the graphene film, and the monolayer graphene was transferred onto shallow depressions with 300 nm depth. The improved wet transfer onto perforated substrates with 2.7 mu m diameter holes yields 98% coverage of holes covered with continuous films, allowing the ready use of Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to study the intrinsic properties of CVD-grown monolayer graphene. Additionally, monolayer graphene transferred onto flat substrates has fewer cracks and tears, as well as lower sheet resistance than previous transfer techniques. Monolayer graphene films transferred onto glass had a sheet resistance of similar to 980 Omega/sq and a transmittance of 97.6%.

There are only subtle differences in the compression textures of magnesium and its solid solution alloys containing lithium or yttrium. However, the plane strain compression textures of the alloys showed an increasing tendency for the basal poles to rotate away from the "normal direction" towards the "rolling direction". Texture simulations enabled these distinctions to be attributed to the increased activity of the non-basal (c + a) slip mode. The alloys had improved compressive ductilities compared to pure magnesium, and the increased c + a slip mode activity provides a satisfying explanation for this improvement, since it can accommodate c-axis compression within individual grains. Accounting for individual deformation mode hardening enabled the flow curves to be simulated and the anisotropic plastic response of textured wrought alloys to be mechanistically understood and predicted.

J	Arima, Y; Iwata, H				Arima, Yusuke; Iwata, Hiroo			Effect of wettability and surface functional groups on protein adsorption and cell adhesion using well-defined mixed self-assembled monolayers	BIOMATERIALS												Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols, which can provide flat and chemically well-defined surfaces, were employed as model surfaces to understand cellular interaction with artificial materials. SAMs presenting a wide range of wettabilities were prepared by mixing two kinds of alkanethiols carrying terminal methyl (CH3) hydroxyl (OH), carboxylic acid (COOH), or amino (NH2) groups. Adhesion behavior of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HeLa cells on these mixed SAMs were examined. The number of adhered HUVECs reached a maximum on CH3/OH mixed SAMs with a water contact angle of 40 degrees, while cell adhesion increased with decreasing water contact angle up to 60-70 degrees and then leveled off on CH3/COOH and CH3/NH2 mixed SAMs. Numbers of adhered HeLa cells showed a maximum on CH3/OH and CH3/COOH mixed SAMs with a water contact angle of 50 degrees. These facts suggest that cell adhesion is mainly determined by surface wettability, but is also affected by the surface functional group, its surface density, and the kinds of cells. The effect of exchange of adsorbed proteins on cell adhesion was also examined. HUVECs were cultured on the mixed SAMs preadsorbed with albumin. Cell adhesion was effectively prohibited on hydrophobic SAMs pretreated with albumin. Albumin strongly adsorbed and resisted replacement by cell adhesive proteins on hydrophobic SAMs. On the other hand, cells adhered to albumin-adsorbed hydrophilic SAW Displacement of preadsorbed albumin with cell adhesive proteins effectively occurs on these hydrophilic SAMs. This effect contributes to induce SAMs with moderate wettability to give suitable surfaces for cell adhesion.

Z-scheme systems based on two-step photoexcitation of a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP) and an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP) are suited to harvesting of sunlight because semiconductors with either water reduction or oxidation activity can be applied to the water splitting reaction(4,5). However, it is challenging to achieve efficient transfer of electrons between HEP and OEP particles(6,7). Here, we present photocatalyst sheets based on La-and Rh-codoped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3:La, Rh; ref. 8) and Mo-doped BiVO4 (BiVO4:Mo) powders embedded into a gold (Au) layer. Enhancement of the electron relay by annealing and suppression of undesirable reactions through surface modification allow pure water (pH 6.8) splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 1.1% and an apparent quantum yield of over 30% at 419 nm. The photocatalyst sheet design enables efficient and scalable water splitting using particulate semiconductors.

J	Lam, L; Teng, JG				Lam, L; Teng, JG			Design-oriented stress-strain model for FRP-confined concrete	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS												External confinement by the wrapping of FRP sheets (or FRP jacketing) provides a very effective method for the retrofit of reinforced concrete (RC) columns subject to either static or seismic loads. For the reliable and cost-effective design of FRP jackets, an accurate stress-strain model is required for FRP-confined concrete. In this paper, a new design-oriented stress-strain model is proposed for concrete confined by FRP wraps with fibres only or predominantly in the hoop direction based on a careful interpretation of existing test data and observations. This model is simple, so it is suitable for direct use in design, but in the meantime, it captures all the main characteristics of the stress-strain behavior of concrete confined by different types of FRP. In addition, for unconfined concrete, this model reduces directly to idealized stress-strain curves in existing design codes. In the development of this model, a number of important issues including the actual hoop strains in FRP jackets at rupture, the sufficiency of FRP confinement for a significant strength enhancement, and the effect of jacket stiffness on the ultimate axial strain, were all carefully examined and appropriately resolved. The predictions of the model are shown to agree well with test data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Organometallic or organic materials were mostly used as sensitizers for solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells at early stages. Inorganic nanocrystals have lately received attention as light harvesters due to their high light-absorbing properties. Metal chalcogenides have been investigated with solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells; however, the best power conversion efficiency was reported to be around 6%. CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) perovskite sensitizer made a breakthrough in solid-state mescoscopic solar cells, where the first record efficiency of around 10% was reported in 2012 using submicrometer-thick TiO2 film sensitized with CH3NH3PbI3. A rapid increase in efficiency approaching 14% followed shortly. In this Perspective, recent progress in perovskite-sensitized solid-state mesoscopic solar cells is reviewed. On the basis of the recent achievements, a power conversion efficiency as high as 20% is expected based on optimized perovskite-based solid-state solar cells.

Copper Selenide Nanocrystals for Photothermal Therapy	NANO LETTERS												Ligand-stabilized copper selenide (Cu(2-x)Se) nanocrystals, approximately 16 nm in diameter, were synthesized by a colloidal hot injection method and coated with amphiphilic polymer. The nanocrystals readily disperse in water and exhibit strong near-infrared (NIR) optical absorption with a high molar extinction coefficient of 7.7 x 10(7) cm(-1) M(-1) at 980 nm. When excited with 800 nm light, the Cu(2-x)Se nanocrystals produce significant photothermal heating with a photothermal transduction efficiency of 22%, comparable to nanorods and nanoshells of gold (Au). In vitro photothermal heating of Cu(2-x)Se nanocrystals in the presence of human colorectal cancer cell (HCT-116) led to cell destruction after 5 mm of laser irradiation at 33 W/cm(2), demonstrating the viabilitiy of Cu(2-x)Se nanocrystals for photothermal therapy applications.

We rind that the anti-icing capability of these composites depends not only on their superhydrophobicity but also on the size of the particles exposed on the surface. The critical particle sizes that determine the superhydrophobicity and the anti-icing property are in two different length scales, The effect of particle size on ice formation is explained by using a classical heterogeneous nucleation theory. This result implies that the anti-icing property of a surface is not directly correlated with the superhydrophobicity, and thus, it is uncertain whether a superhydrophobic surface is anti-icing without detailed knowledge of the surface morphology, The result also opens up possibilities for rational design of anti-icing superhydrophobic surfaces by tuning surface textures in multiple length scales.

The intervention of elastic buckling of the struts is also analysed in an approximate manner. Good agreement is found between the predictions of the strength and experimental observations from tests on the octet-truss material made from a casting aluminium alloy. Moreover, the strength and stiffness of the octet-truss material are stretching-dominated and compare favourably with the corresponding properties of metallic foams.

For two types of defects considered in our study, the hydrogen chemisorption defect and the vacancy defect, the itinerant magnetism due to the defect-induced extended states has been observed. Calculated magnetic moments are equal to 1 mu(B) per hydrogen chemisorption defect and 1.12-1.53 mu(B) per vacancy defect depending on the defect concentration. The coupling between the magnetic moments is either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic, depending on whether the defects correspond to the same or to different hexagonal sublattices of the graphene lattice, respectively.

Harnessing traction-mediated manipulation of the cell/matrix interface to control stem-cell fate	NATURE MATERIALS												Stem cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix. However, both the extent to which extracellular-matrix mechanics affect stem-cell fate in three-dimensional microenvironments and the underlying biophysical mechanisms are unclear. We demonstrate that the commitment of mesenchymal stem-cell populations changes in response to the rigidity of three-dimensional microenvironments, with osteogenesis occurring predominantly at 11-30 kPa. In contrast to previous two-dimensional work, however, cell fate was not correlated with morphology. Instead, matrix stiffness regulated integrin binding as well as reorganization of adhesion ligands on the nanoscale, both of which were traction dependent and correlated with osteogenic commitment of mesenchymal stem-cell populations. These findings suggest that cells interpret changes in the physical properties of adhesion substrates as changes in adhesion-ligand presentation, and that cells themselves can be harnessed as tools to mechanically process materials into structures that feed back to manipulate their fate.

Processing graphene sheets into nano-ribbons with widths of less than 10 nm can open up a bandgap that is large enough for room-temperature transistor operation(8-19), but nanoribbon devices often have low driving currents or transconductances(18,19). Moreover, practical devices and circuits will require the production of dense arrays of ordered nanoribbons, which remains a significant challenge(20,21). Here, we report the production of a new graphene nanostructure-which we call a graphene nanomesh-that can open up a bandgap in a large sheet of graphene to create a semiconducting thin film. The nanomeshes are prepared using block copolymer lithography and can have variable periodicities and neck widths as low as 5 nm. Graphene nanomesh field-effect transistors can support currents nearly 100 times greater than individual graphene nanoribbon devices, and the on-off ratio, which is comparable with the values achieved in individual nanoribbon devices, can be tuned by varying the neck width. The block copolymer lithography approach used to make the nanomesh devices is intrinsically scalable and could allow for the rational design and fabrication of graphene-based devices and circuits with standard semiconductor processing.

Although our calculations do not reproduce the relative ordering of the two phases that is observed experimentally, the calculated bulk structural and elastic properties of both polymorphs are in excellent agreement with the experiment, suggesting that surface relaxations are correctly described as well. As expected, the surface energies of anatase appear to be related to the presence of undercoordinated Ti atoms: the surfaces with fourfold-coordinated Ti atoms have a larger energy than those with fivefold-coordinated Ti.

The caging effect is typically removed by photolysis with ultraviolet light to liberate the bioactive species. Although this technique has been successfully applied to many biological problems, it suffers from a number of intrinsic drawbacks. For example, it requires dedicated efforts to design and synthesize a precursor compound for each effector. The ultraviolet light may cause damage to biological samples and is suitable only for in vitro studies because of its quick attenuation in tissue(4). Here we address these issues by developing a platform based on the photothermal effect of gold nanocages. Gold nanocages represent a class of nanostructures with hollow interiors and porous walls(5). They can have strong absorption (for the photothermal effect) in the near-infrared while maintaining a compact size. When the surface of a gold nanocage is covered with a smart polymer, the pre-loaded effector can be released in a controllable fashion using a near-infrared laser. This system works well with various effectors without involving sophisticated syntheses, and is well suited for in vivo studies owing to the high transparency of soft tissue in the near-infrared region(6).

J	Hoppe, H; Sariciftci, NS				Hoppe, H; Sariciftci, NS			Morphology of polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY												Within the different organic photovoltaic devices the conjugated polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction approach is one of the foci of today's research interest. These devices are highly dependent on the solid state nanoscale morphology of the two components (donor/acceptor) in the photoactive layer. The need for finely phase separated polymer - fullerene blends is expressed by the limited exciton diffusion length present in organic semiconductors. Typical distances that these photo-excitations can travel within a pristine material are around 10 - 20 nm. In an efficient bulk heterojunction the scale of phase separation is therefore closely related to the respective exciton diffusion lengths of the two materials involved. Once the excitons reach the donor/ acceptor interface, the photoinduced charge transfer results in the charge separation. After the charges have been separated they require percolated pathways to the respective charge extracting electrodes in order to supply an external direct current. Thus also an effective charge transport relies on the development of a suitable nanomorphology i.e. bicontinuous interpenetrating phase structures within these blend films. The present feature article combines and summarizes the experimental findings on this nanomorphology - efficiency relationship.

The element is used at the interface between solid finite elements to model the initiation and non-self-similar growth of delaminations in composite materials. A single relative displacement-based damage parameter is applied in a softening law to track the damage state of the interface and to prevent the restoration of the cohesive state during unloading. The softening law is applied in the three-parameter Benzeggagh-Kenane mode interaction criterion to predict mixed-mode delamination propagation. To demonstrate the accuracy of the predictions, steady-state delamination growth is simulated for quasi-static loading of various single mode and mixed-mode delamination test specimens and the results are compared with experimental data.

These nanostructured graphene-MnO2 hybrid materials are used for investigation of electrochemical behaviors. Graphene-MnO2 composite (78 wt.% MnO2) displays the specific capacitance as high as 310 F g(-1) at 2 mV s(-1) (even 228 F g(-1) at 500 mV s(-1)), which is almost three times higher than that of pure graphene (104 F g(-1)) and birnessite-type MnO2 (103 F g(-1)). Interestingly, the capacitance retention ratio is highly kept over a wide range of scan rates (88% at 100 mV s(-1) and 74% at 500 mV s(-1)). The improved high-rate electrochemical performance may be attributed to the increased electrode conductivity in the presence of graphene network, the increased effective interfacial area between MnO2 and the electrolyte, as well as the contact area between MnO2 and graphene.

J	Win, KY; Feng, SS				Win, KY; Feng, SS			Effects of particle size and surface coating on cellular uptake of polymeric nanoparticles for oral delivery of anticancer drugs	BIOMATERIALS												This study evaluated cellular uptake of polymeric nanoparticles by using Caco-2 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, as an in vitro model with the aim to apply nanoparticles of biodegradable polymers for oral chemotherapy. The feasibility was demonstrated by showing the localization and quantification of the cell uptake of fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles of standard size and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or vitamin E TPGS. Coumarin-6 loaded PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by a modified solvent extraction/evaporation method and characterized by laser light scattering for size and size distribution, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for surface morphology, zeta-potential for surface charge, and spectrofluorometry for fluorescent molecule release from the nanoparticles. The effects of particle size and particle surface coating on the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles were quantified by spectrofluorometric measurement. Cellular uptake of vitamin E TPGS-coated PLGA nanoparticles showed 1.4 folds higher than that of PVA-coated PLGA nanoparticles and 4-6 folds higher than that of nude polystyrene nanoparticles. Images of confocal laser scanning microscopy, cryo-SEM and transmission electron microscopy clearly evidenced the internalization of nanoparticles by the Caco-2 cells, showing that surface modification of PLGA nanoparticles with vitamin E TPGS notably improved the cellular uptake. It is highly feasible for nanoparticles of biodegradable polymers to be applied to promote oral chemotherapy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, 2D ultrathin Ti3C2 nanosheets, a kind of MXenes, are prepared by etching Ti3AlC2 with subsequent ultrasonic exfoliation. A novel 2D/2D heterojunction of ultrathin Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 nanosheets is then successfully prepared by in situ growth of Bi2WO6 ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of these Ti3C2 ultrathin nanosheets. The resultant Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 hybrids exhibit a short charge transport distance and a large interface contact area, assuring excellent bulk-to-surface and interfacial charge transfer abilities. Meanwhile, the improved specific surface area and pore structure endow Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 hybrids with an enhanced CO2 adsorption capability. As a result, the 2D/2D heterojunction of ultrathin Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 nanosheets shows significant improvement on the performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction under simulated solar irradiation. The total yield of CH4 and CH3OH obtained on the optimized Ti3C2/Bi2WO6 hybrid is 4.6 times that obtained on pristine Bi2WO6 ultrathin nanosheets. This work provides a new protocol for constructing 2D/2D photocatalytic systems and demonstrates Ti3C2 as a promising and cheap cocatalyst.

However, electronic properties of individual MXene flakes, which are important for understanding the potential of these materials, remain largely unexplored. Herein, a modified synthetic method is reported for producing high-quality monolayer Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes. Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on monolayer Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes are fabricated and their electronic properties are measured. Individual Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes exhibit a high conductivity of 4600 +/- 1100 S cm(-1) and field-effect electron mobility of 2.6 +/- 0.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The resistivity of multilayer Ti(3)C(2)Tx films is only one order of magnitude higher than the resistivity of individual flakes, which indicates a surprisingly good electron transport through the surface terminations of different flakes, unlike in many other 2D materials. Finally, the fabricated FETs are used to investigate the environmental stability and kinetics of oxidation of Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes in humid air. The high-quality Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes are reasonably stable and remain highly conductive even after their exposure to air for more than 24 h. It is demonstrated that after the initial exponential decay the conductivity of Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes linearly decreases with time, which is consistent with their edge oxidation.

Various flat optical components, such as polarizers, optical imaging encoders, tunable phase modulators and a retroreflector, have been demonstrated using a metalens design. An open issue, especially problematic for colour imaging and display applications, is the correction of chromatic aberration, an intrinsic effect originating from the specific resonance and limited working bandwidth of each nanoantenna. As a result, no metalens has demonstrated full-colour imaging in the visible wavelength. Here, we show a design and fabrication that consists of GaN-based integrated-resonant unit elements to achieve an achromatic metalens operating in the entire visible region in transmission mode. The focal length of our metalenses remains unchanged as the incident wavelength is varied from 400 to 660 nm, demonstrating complete elimination of chromatic aberration at about 49% bandwidth of the central working wavelength. The average efficiency of a metalens with a numerical aperture of 0.106 is about 40% over the whole visible spectrum. We also show some examples of full-colour imaging based on this design.

Extracellular-matrix tethering regulates stem-cell fate	NATURE MATERIALS												To investigate how substrate properties influence stem-cell fate, we cultured single human epidermal stem cells on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel surfaces, 0.1 kPa-2.3 MPa in stiffness, with a covalently attached collagen coating. Cell spreading and differentiation were unaffected by polydimethylsiloxane stiffness. However, cells on polyacrylamide of low elastic modulus (0.5 kPa) could not form stable focal adhesions and differentiated as a result of decreased activation of the extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway. The differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells was also unaffected by PDMS stiffness but regulated by the elastic modulus of PAAm. Dextran penetration measurements indicated that polyacrylamide substrates of low elastic modulus were more porous than stiff substrates, suggesting that the collagen anchoring points would be further apart. We then changed collagen crosslink concentration and used hydrogel-nanoparticle substrates to vary anchoring distance at constant substrate stiffness.

J	Bachmann, V; Ronda, C; Meijerink, A				Bachmann, Volker; Ronda, Cees; Meijerink, Andries			Temperature Quenching of Yellow Ce<SUP>3+</SUP> Luminescence in YAG:Ce	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												Yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) doped with Ce3+ is the phosphor of choice for the conversion of blue to yellow light in the rapidly expanding market of white light LEDs, but it is generally thought to suffer from a low luminescence quenching temperature. The luminescence quenching temperature is an important parameter, especially in high-power LEDs, but surprisingly no systematic research has been done to measure and understand the temperature quenching of the yellow Ce luminescence in YAG:Ce. Here we report on the luminescence temperature quenching in YAG:Ce. For a wide range of Ce concentrations (between 0.033% and 3.3%) the temperature dependence of the emission intensity and the luminescence lifetimes are reported. The intrinsic quenching temperature of the Ce luminescence is shown to be very high (>700 K). The lower quenching temperatures reported in the literature are explained by thermally activated concentration quenching (for highly doped systems) and the temperature dependence of the oscillator strength (for low doping concentrations). In addition, high-resolution spectra are reported, which provide insight into the position of the zero-phonon transition (20450 cm(-1)), the Stokes shift (2400 cm(-1)), the energy of the dominant phonon mode (200 cm(-1)), and the Huang-Rhys parameter (S = 6). These parameters are compared with ab initio calculations on the position of and relaxation in the excited 5d state of Ce3+ in YAG, which can aid in providing a better theoretical understanding of the temperature quenching.

The conversion of waste heat into electrical energy may play an important role in our current challenge to develop alternative energy technologies to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An overview of various TE phenomena and materials is provided in this issue of MRS Bulletin. Several of the current applications and key parameters are defined and discussed. Novel applications of TE materials include biothermal batteries to power heart pacemakers, enhanced performance of optoelectronics coupled with solid-state TE cooling, and power generation for deep-space probes via radioisotope TE generators. A number of different systems of potential TE materials are currently under investigation by various research groups around the world, and many of these materials are reviewed in the articles in this issue. These range from thin-film superlattice materials to large single-crystal or polycrystalline bulk materials, and from semiconductors and semimetals to ceramic oxides. The phonon-glass/electron-crystal approach to new TE materials is presented, along with the role of solid-state crystal chemistry. Research criteria for developing new materials are highlighted.

Electronic logic and memory devices have already been constructed from graphene-MoS2 hybrids(7,8), but they do not make use of the photosensitivity of MoS2, which arises from its optical-range bandgap(9). Here, we demonstrate that graphene-on-MoS2 binary heterostructures display remarkable dual optoelectronic functionality, including highly sensitive photodetection and gate-tunable persistent photoconductivity. The responsivity of the hybrids was found to be nearly 1 x 10(10) A W-1 at 130 K and 5 x 10(8) A W-1 at room temperature, making them the most sensitive graphene-based photodetectors. When subjected to time-dependent photoillumination, the hybrids could also function as a rewritable optoelectronic switch or memory, where the persistent state shows almost no relaxation or decay within experimental timescales, indicating near-perfect charge retention. These effects can be quantitatively explained by gate-tunable charge exchange between the graphene and MoS2 layers, and may lead to new graphene-based optoelectronic devices that are naturally scalable for large-area applications at room temperature.

Phonons in single-layer and few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We report ab initio calculations of the phonon dispersion relations of the single-layer and bulk dichalcogenides MoS2 and WS2. We explore in detail the behavior of the Raman-active modes A(1g) and E-2g(1) as a function of the number of layers. In agreement with recent Raman spectroscopy measurements [C. Lee et al., ACS Nano 4, 2695 (2010)], we find that the A(1g) mode increases in frequency with an increasing number of layers while the E-2g(1) mode decreases. We explain this decrease by an enhancement of the dielectric screening of the long-range Coulomb interaction between the effective charges with a growing number of layers. This decrease in the long-range part overcompensates for the increase of the short-range interaction due to the weak interlayer interaction.

Here we introduce an approach for heterogeneous integration based on kinetically controlled switching between adhesion and release of solid objects to and from an elastomeric stamp. We describe the physics of soft adhesion that govern this process and demonstrate the method by printing objects with a wide range of sizes and shapes, made of single-crystal silicon and GaN, mica, highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, silica and pollen, onto a variety of substrates without specially designed surface chemistries or separate adhesive layers. Printed p-n junctions and photodiodes fixed directly on highly curved surfaces illustrate some unique device-level capabilities of this approach.

Tensile tests were performed at room temperature at a strain rate of 1x10(-3) s(-1). The alloys exhibited an apparent steady-state deformation region and a large tensile elongation of 47%. The deformed microstructure at an elongation of 2% indicated substantial cross-slip to non-basal planes induced by plastic compatibility stress associated with grain boundaries. The non-basal segment of dislocations was found to consist of 40% of the total dislocation density at a yield anisotropy factor of only 1.1 instead of an expected value of 100 obtained from single-crystal experiments. The deformed microstructure at an elongation of 16% indicated recovered regions within twins as well as untwinned matrices. These results indicate that dynamic recovery can occur in Mg alloys at room temperature. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The hydrogenated TiO2 (denoted as H-TiO2) were obtained by calcination of anodized TiO2 NTAs in hydrogen atmosphere in a range of temperatures between 300 to 600 degrees C. The H TiO2 NTAs prepared at 400 degrees C yields the largest specific capacitance of 3.24 mF cm(-2) at a scan rate of 100 mV s(-1), which is 40 times higher than thecapacitance obtained from air-annealed TiO2 NTAs at the same conditions. Importantly, H-TiO2 NTAs also show remarkable rate capability with 68% areal capacitance retained when the scan rate increase from 10 to 1000 mV s(-1), as well as outstanding long-term cycling stability with only 3.1% reduction of initial specific capacitance after 10 000 cycles. The prominent electrochemical capacitive properties of H-TiO2 are attributed to the enhanced carrier density and increased density of hydroxyl group on TiO2 surface, as a result of hydrogenation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that H-TiO2 NTAs is a good scaffold to support MnO2 nanoparticles. The capacitor electrodes made by electrochemical deposition of MnO2 nanoparticles on H-TiO2 NTAs achieve a remarkable specific capacitance of 912 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1) (based on the mass of MnO2). The ability to improve the capacitive properties of TiO2 electrode materials should open up new opportunities for high-performance supercapacitors.

A flexible and electrically conducting material that can sense mechanical forces and yet be able to self-heal repeatably can be of use in emerging fields such as soft robotics and biomimetic prostheses, but combining all these properties together remains a challenging task. Here, we describe a composite material composed of a supramolecular organic polymer with embedded nickel nanostructured microparticles, which shows mechanical and electrical self-healing properties at ambient conditions. We also show that our material is pressure-and flexion-sensitive, and therefore suitable for electronic skin applications. The electrical conductivity can be tuned by varying the amount of nickel particles and can reach values as high as 40 S cm(-1). On rupture, the initial conductivity is repeatably restored with similar to 90% efficiency after 15 s healing time, and the mechanical properties are completely restored after similar to 10 min. The composite resistance varies inversely with applied flexion and tactile forces. These results demonstrate that natural skin's repeatable self-healing capability can be mimicked in conductive and piezoresistive materials, thus potentially expanding the scope of applications of current electronic skin systems.

J	Devaraj, S; Munichandraiah, N				Devaraj, S.; Munichandraiah, N.			Effect of crystallographic structure of MnO<sub>2</sub> on its electrochemical capacitance properties	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C												MnO2 is currently under extensive investigations for its capacitance properties. MnO2 crystallizes into several crystallographic structures, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and lambda structures. Because these structures differ in the way MnO6 octahedra are interlinked, they possess tunnels or interlayers with gaps of different magnitudes. Because capacitance properties are due to intercalation/deintercalation of protons or cations in MnO2, only some crystallographic structures, which possess sufficient gaps to accommodate these ions, are expected to be useful for capacitance studies. In order to examine the dependence of capacitance on crystal structure, the present study involves preparation of these various crystal phases of MnO2 in nanodimensions and to evaluate their capacitance properties. Results of alpha-MnO2 prepared by a microemulsion route (alpha-MnO2(m)) are also used for comparison. Spherical particles of about 50 nm, nanorods of 30-50 nm in diameter, or interlocked fibers of 10-20 nm in diameters are formed, which depend on the crystal structure and the method of preparation. The specific capacitance (SC) measured for MnO2 is found to depend strongly on the crystallographic structure, and it decreases in the following order: alpha(m) > alpha congruent to 6 > gamma > lambda > beta. A SC value of 297 F g(-1) is obtained for alpha-MnO2(m), whereas it is 9 F g(-1) for beta-MnO2. A wide (-similar to 4.6 angstrom) tunnel size and large surface area of alpha-MnO2(m) are ascribed as favorable factors for its high SC. A large interlayer separation (similar to 7 angstrom) also facilitates insertion of cations in delta-MnO2 resulting in a SC close to 236 F g(-1). A narrow tunnel size (1.89 A) does not allow intercalation of cations into beta-MnO2. As a result, it provides a very small SC.

The antibacterial effect of silver nanoparticles used in this study was found to be far more potent than that described in the earlier reports. This effect was dose dependent and was more pronounced against gram-negative bacteria than gram-positive organisms. Although bacterial cell lysis could be one of the reasons for the observed antibacterial property, nanoparticles also modulated the phosphotyrosine profile of putative bacterial peptides, which could thus affect bacterial signal transduction and inhibit the growth of the organisms.

Identifying suitable materials for a given application can, in principle, be done by screening material databases. Such a screening requires automated high-throughput analysis tools that calculate structural properties for all materials contained in a database so they can be compared with search queries, grouped or classified. One important aspect of the structural analysis of materials such as zeolites and metal organic frameworks is the investigation of the geometrical parameters describing pores. Here, we present algorithms and tools to efficiently calculate some of these important parameters. Our tools are based on the Voronoi decomposition, which for a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph representation of the void space. The resulting Voronoi network is analyzed to obtain the diameter of the largest included sphere and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters that are frequently used to describe pore geometry. Accessibility of nodes in the network is also determined for a given guest molecule and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible surfaces and volumes. The presented algorithms are implemented in a software tool, Zeo++, which includes a modified version of the Voro++ library. We present example applications of our algorithms and tools using zeolite frameworks currently listed in the Atlas of Zeolite Frameworks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Marmur, A				Marmur, A			Wetting on hydrophobic rough surfaces: To be heterogeneous or not to be?	LANGMUIR												Equilibrium wetting on rough surfaces is discussed in terms of the "competition" between complete liquid penetration into the roughness grooves and entrapment of air bubbles inside the grooves underneath the liquid. The former is the homogeneous wetting regime, usually described by the Wenzel equation. The latter is the heterogeneous wetting regime that is described by the Cassie-Baxter equation. Understanding this "competition" is essential for the design of ultrahydrophobic surfaces. The present discussion puts the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter equations into proper mathematical-thermodynamic perspective and defines the conditions for determining the transition between the homogeneous and heterogeneous wetting regimes. In particular, a new condition that is necessary for the existence of the heterogeneous wetting regime is added. It is demonstrated that when this condition is violated, the homogeneous wetting regime is in effect, even though the Cassie-Baxter equation may be satisfied.

In this regard, the hardly explored compound class of nitridoaluminates affords a new material with superior luminescence properties. Doped with Eu2+, Sr[LiAl3N4] emerged as a new high-performance narrow-band red-emitting phosphor material, which can efficiently be excited by GaN-based blue LEDs. Owing to the highly efficient red emission at lambda(max) similar to 650 nm with a full-width at half-maximum of similar to 1,180 cm(-1) (similar to 50 nm) that shows only very low thermal quenching (>95% relative to the quantum efficiency at 200 degrees C), a prototype phosphor-converted LED (pc-LED), employing Sr[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+ as the red-emitting component, already shows an increase of 14% in luminous efficacy compared with a commercially available high colour rendering index (CRI) LED, together with an excellent colour rendition (R(a)8 = 91, R9 = 57). Therefore, we predict great potential for industrial applications in high-power white pc-LEDs.					; Schnick, Wolfgang/D-3064-2013	Kugler, Ann-Kathrin/0000-0001-7468-9654; Schnick, Wolfgang/0000-0003-4571-8035													1476-1122	1476-4660				SEP	2014	13	9					891	896		10.1038/NMAT4012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT4012								24952748					WOS:000341343500021

So far these self-organized pore structures could only be prepared within narrow processing conditions. Here we report a new oxalic-acid-based anodization process for long-range ordered alumina membranes. This process is a new generation of the so-called 'hard anodization' approach that has been widely used in industry for high-speed fabrication of mechanically robust, very thick (> 100 mu m) and low-porosity alumina films since the 1960s. This hard anodization approach establishes a new self-ordering regime with interpore distances, (D-int) = 200-300 nm, which have not been achieved by mild anodization processes so far. It offers substantial advantages over conventional anodization processes in terms of processing time, allowing 2,500-3,500% faster oxide growth with improved ordering of the nanopores. Perfectly ordered alumina membranes with high aspect ratios (> 1,000) of uniform nanopores with periodically modulated diameters have been realized.

Previously, perovskite/silicon tandems were limited by significant parasitic absorption and poor environmental stability. Here, we improve the efficiency of monolithic, two-terminal, 1-cm(2) perovskite/silicon tandems to 23.6% by combining an infrared-tuned silicon heterojunction bottom cell with the recently developed caesium formamidinium lead halide perovskite. This more-stable perovskite tolerates deposition of a tin oxide buffer layer via atomic layer deposition that prevents shunts, has negligible parasitic absorption, and allows for the sputter deposition of a transparent top electrode. Furthermore, the window layer doubles as a diffusion barrier, increasing the thermal and environmental stability to enable perovskite devices that withstand a 1,000-hour damp heat test at 85 degrees C and 85% relative humidity.

To improve the accessibility of H-2 production, it is necessary to develop an efficient OER catalyst with large surface area, abundant active sites, and good stability, through a low-cost fabrication route. Herein, a facile solution reduction method using NaBH4 as a reductant is developed to prepare iron-cobalt oxide nanosheets (FexCoy-ONSs) with a large specific surface area (up to 261.1 m(2) g(-1)), ultrathin thickness (1.2 nm), and, importantly, abundant oxygen vacancies. The mass activity of Fe1Co1-ONS measured at an overpotential of 350 mV reaches up to 54.9 A g(-1), while its Tafel slope is 36.8 mV dec(-1); both of which are superior to those of commercial RuO2, crystalline Fe1Co1-ONP, and most reported OER catalysts. The excellent OER catalytic activity of Fe1Co1-ONS can be attributed to its specific structure, e.g., ultrathin nanosheets that could facilitate mass diffusion/transport of OH-ions and provide more active sites for OER catalysis, and oxygen vacancies that could improve electronic conductivity and facilitate adsorption of H2O onto nearby Co3+ sites.

The crystal structure is computed to be rhombohedral with space group R3c, and the electronic structure is found to be insulating and antiferromagnetic, both in excellent agreement with available experiments. A large ferroelectric polarization of 90-100 muC/cm(2) is predicted, consistent with the large atomic displacements in the ferroelectric phase and with recent experimental reports, but differing by an order of magnitude from early experiments. One possible explanation is that the latter may have suffered from large leakage currents. However, both past and contemporary measurements are shown to be consistent with the modern theory of polarization, suggesting that the range of reported polarizations may instead correspond to distinct switching paths in structural space. Modern measurements on well-characterized bulk samples are required to confirm this interpretation.

Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene as a High Capacity Electrode Material for Metal (Li, Na, K, Ca) Ion Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES												Two-dimensional (2-D) materials are capable of handling high rates of charge in batteries since metal ions do not need to diffuse in a 3-D lattice structure. However, graphene, which is the most well-studied 2-D material, is known to have no Li capacity. Here, adsorption of Li, as well as Na, K, and Ca, on Ti3C2, one representative MXene, is predicted by first-principles density functional calculations. In our study, we observed that these alkali atoms exhibit different adsorption energies depending on the coverage. The adsorption energies of Na, K, and Ca decrease as coverage increases, while Li shows little sensitivity to variance in coverage. This observed relationship between adsorption energies and coverage of alkali ions on Ti3C2 can be explained by their effective ionic radii. A larger effective ionic radius increases interaction between alkali atoms, thus lower coverage is obtained. Our calculated capacities for Li, Na, K, and Ca on Ti3C2 are 447.8, 351.8, 191.8, and 319.8 mAh/g respectively. Compared to materials currently used in high-rate Li and Na ion battery anodes, MXene shows promise in increasing overall battery performance.

Near room-temperature formation of a skyrmion crystal in thin-films of the helimagnet FeGe	NATURE MATERIALS												The skyrmion(1-4), a vortex-like spin-swirling object, is anticipated to play a vital role in quantum magneto-transport processes such as the quantum Hall and topological Hall effects(3,5,6). The existence of the magnetic skyrmion crystal (SkX) state was recently verified experimentally for MnSi and Fe0.5Co0.5Si by means of small-angle neutron scattering(7,8) and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy(9). However, to enable the application of such a SkX for spintronic function, materials problems such as a low crystallization temperature and low stability of SkX have to be overcome. Here we report the formation of SkX close to room temperature in thin-films of the helimagnet FeGe. In addition to the magnetic twin structure, we found a magnetic chirality inversion of the SkX across lattice twin boundaries. Furthermore, for thin crystal plates with thicknesses much smaller than the SkX lattice constant (a(s)) the two-dimensional SkX is quite stable over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields, whereas for quasi-three-dimensional films with thicknesses over a(s) the SkX is relatively unstable and observed only around the helical transition temperature. The room-temperature stable SkX state as promised by this study will pave a new path to designing quantum-effect devices based on the controllable skyrmion dynamics.

The electrocatalytical mechanism of nitrogen doped graphene in acidic environment was studied by using density functional theory (DFT). The simulations demonstrate that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on N-doped graphene is a direct four-electron pathway, which is consistent with the experimental observations. The energy calculated for each ORR step shows that the ORR can spontaneously occur on the N-graphene. The active catalytical sites on single nitrogen doped graphene are identified, which have either high positive spin density or high positive atomic charge density. The nitrogen doping introduces asymmetry spin density and atomic charge density, making it possible for N-graphene to show high electroncatalytic activities for the ORR.

The electrode architecture takes advantage of the high electrochemical activity from both the CoO and PPy, the high electronic conductivity of PPy, and the short ion diffusion pathway in ordered mesoporous nanowires. These merits together with the elegant synergy between CoO and PPy lead to a high specific capacitance of 2223 F g(-1) approaching the theoretical value, good rate capability, and cycling stability (99.8% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles). An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor device with a maximum voltage of 1.8 V fabricated by using our hybrid array as the positive electrode and activated carbon film as the negative electrode has demonstrated high energy density (,similar to 43.5 Wh kg(-1)), high power density (similar to 5500 W kg(-1) at 11.8 Wh kg(-1)) and outstanding cycleability (similar to 20 000 times). After charging for only similar to 40 s, two such 4 cm(2) asymmetric supercapacitors connected in series can efficiently power 5 mm diameter red, yellow, and green round LED indicators (lasting for 1 h for red LED) and drive a mini 130 rotation-motor robustly.

Enhanced absorption and carrier collection in Si wire arrays for photovoltaic applications	NATURE MATERIALS												Si wire arrays are a promising architecture for solar-energy-harvesting applications, and may offer a mechanically flexible alternative to Si wafers for photovoltaics(1-17). To achieve competitive conversion efficiencies, the wires must absorb sunlight over a broad range of wavelengths and incidence angles, despite occupying only a modest fraction of the array's volume. Here, we show that arrays having less than 5% areal fraction of wires can achieve up to 96% peak absorption, and that they can absorb up to 85% of day-integrated, above-bandgap direct sunlight. In fact, these arrays show enhanced near-infrared absorption, which allows their overall sunlight absorption to exceed the ray-optics light-trapping absorption limit(18) for an equivalent volume of randomly textured planar Si, over a broad range of incidence angles. We furthermore demonstrate that the light absorbed by Si wire arrays can be collected with a peak external quantum efficiency of 0.89, and that they show broadband, near-unity internal quantum efficiency for carrier collection through a radial semiconductor/liquid junction at the surface of each wire. The observed absorption enhancement and collection efficiency enable a cell geometry that not only uses 1/100th the material of traditional wafer-based devices, but also may offer increased photovoltaic efficiency owing to an effective optical concentration of up to 20 times.

Ultrahigh mobility and giant magnetoresistance in the Dirac semimetal Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>	NATURE MATERIALS												Dirac and Weyl semimetals are 3D analogues of graphene in which crystalline symmetry protects the nodes against gap formation(1-3). Na3Bi and Cd3As2 were predicted to be Dirac semimetals(4,5), and recently confirmed to be so by photoemission experiments(6-8). Several novel transport properties in a magnetic field have been proposed for Dirac semimetals(2,9-11). Here, we report a property of Cd3As2 that was unpredicted, namely a remarkable protection mechanism that strongly suppresses backscattering in zero magnetic field. In single crystals, the protection results in ultrahigh mobility, 9 x 10(6) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 5 K. Suppression of backscattering results in a transport lifetime 10(4) times longer than the quantum lifetime. The lifting of this protection by the applied magnetic field leads to a very large magnetoresistance. We discuss how this may relate to changes to the Fermi surface induced by the applied magnetic field.

Reversible anionic redox chemistry in high-capacity layered-oxide electrodes	NATURE MATERIALS												Li-ion batteries have contributed to the commercial success of portable electronics and may soon dominate the electric transportation market provided that major scientific advances including new materials and concepts are developed. Classical positive electrodes for Li-ion technology operate mainly through an insertion-deinsertion redox process involving cationic species. However, this mechanism is insufficient to account for the high capacities exhibited by the new generation of Li-rich (Li1-xNiyCozMn(1-x- y- z)O2) layered oxides that present unusual Li reactivity. In an attempt to overcome both the inherent composition and the structural complexity of this class of oxides, we have designed structurally related Li2Ru1-ySnyO3 materials that have a single redox cation and exhibit sustainable reversible capacities as high as 230 mA h g(-1). Moreover, they present good cycling behaviour with no signs of voltage decay and a small irreversible capacity. We also unambiguously show, on the basis of an arsenal of characterization techniques, that the reactivity of these high-capacity materials towards Li entails cumulative cationic (Mn+ -> M(n+1)+) and anionic (O2- -> O-2(2-)) reversible redox processes, owing to the d-sp hybridization associated with a reductive coupling mechanism. Because Li2MO3 is a large family of compounds, this study opens the door to the exploration of a vast number of high-capacity materials.

Nowadays, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) from water splitting are considered as two of the most efficient methods to convert sustainable energy to the clean energy carrier, H-2. Catalysts based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are recognized as greatly promising substitutes for noble-metal-based catalysts for HER. The photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities of TMD nanosheets for the HER can be further improved after hybridization with many kinds of nanomaterials, such as metals, oxides, sulfides, and carbon materials, through different methods including the in situ reduction method, the hot-injection method, the heating-up method, the hydro(solvo) thermal method, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and thermal annealing. Here, recent progress in photocatalytic and electrocatalytic HERs using 2D TMD-based composites as catalysts is discussed.

High-resolution electrohydrodynamic jet printing	NATURE MATERIALS												Efforts to adapt and extend graphic arts printing techniques for demanding device applications in electronics, biotechnology and microelectromechanical systems have grown rapidly in recent years. Here, we describe the use of electrohydrodynamically induced fluid flows through fine microcapillary nozzles for jet printing of patterns and functional devices with submicrometre resolution. Key aspects of the physics of this approach, which has some features in common with related but comparatively low-resolution techniques for graphic arts, are revealed through direct high-speed imaging of the droplet formation processes. Printing of complex patterns of inks, ranging from insulating and conducting polymers, to solution suspensions of silicon nanoparticles and rods, to single-walled carbon nanotubes, using integrated computer-controlled printer systems illustrates some of the capabilities. High-resolution printed metal interconnects, electrodes and probing pads for representative circuit patterns and functional transistors with critical dimensions as small as 1 mu m demonstrate potential applications in printed electronics.

Graphene-Multilayer Graphene Nanocomposites as Highly Efficient Thermal Interface Materials	NANO LETTERS												We found that the optimized mixture of graphene and multilayer graphene, produced by the high-yield inexpensive liquid-phase-exfoliation technique, can lead to an extremely strong enhancement of the cross-plane thermal conductivity K of the composite. The "laser flash" measurements revealed a record-high enhancement of K by 2300% in the graphene-based polymer at the filler loading fraction f = 10 vol %. It was determined that the relatively high concentration of the single-layer and bilayer graphene flakes (similar to 10-15%) present simultaneously with the thicker multilayers of large lateral size (similar to 1 mu m) were essential for the observed unusual K enhancement. The thermal conductivity of the commercial thermal grease was increased from an initial value of similar to 5.8 W/mK to K = 14 W/mK at the small loading f = 2%, which preserved all mechanical properties of the hybrid. Our modeling results suggest that graphene-multilayer graphene nanocomposite used as the thermal interface material outperforms those with carbon nanotubes or metal nanoparticles owing to graphene's aspect ratio and lower Kapitza resistance at the graphene-matrix interface.

Vitamin C Is an Ideal Substitute for Hydrazine in the Reduction of Graphene Oxide Suspensions	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C												The preparation of solution-processable graphene from graphite oxide typically involves a hydrazine reduction step, but the use of such a reagent in the large-scale implementation of this approach is not desirable due to its high toxicity Here, we compare the deoxygenation efficiency of graphene oxide suspensions by different reductants (sodium borohydride, pyrogallol, and vitamin C. in addition to hydrazine). as well as by heating the suspensions under alkaline conditions. In almost all cases, the degree of reduction attainable and the subsequent restoration of relevant properties (e e electrical conductivity) lag significantly behind those achieved with hydrazine Only vitamin C is found to yield highly reduced suspensions in a way comparable to those provided by hydrazine Stable suspensions of vitamin C-reduced graphene oxide can be prepared not only in water but also in common organic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). These results open the perspective of replacing hydrazine in the reduction of graphene oxide suspensions by an innocuous and safe reductant of similar efficacy, thus facilitating the use of graphene-based materials for large-scale applications.

Direct ink writing of 3D functional materials	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												The ability to pattern materials in three dimensions is critical for several technological applications, including composites, microfluidics, photonics, and tissue engineering.

An important question is whether coherent manipulation can be performed on such valley pseudospins, analogous to that implemented using true spin, in the quest for quantum technologies(7,8). Here, we show that valley coherence can be generated and detected. Because excitons in a single valley emit circularly polarized photons, linear polarization can only be generated through recombination of an exciton in a coherent superposition of the two valley states. Using monolayer semiconductor WSe2 devices, we first establish the circularly polarized optical selection rules for addressing individual valley excitons and trions. We then demonstrate coherence between valley excitons through the observation of linearly polarized luminescence, whose orientation coincides with that of the linearly polarized excitation, for any given polarization angle. In contrast, the corresponding photoluminescence from trions is not observed to be linearly polarized, consistent with the expectation that the emitted photon polarization is entangled with valley pseudospin. The ability to address coherence(9,10), in addition to valley polarization(11-15), is a step forward towards achieving quantum manipulation of the valley index necessary for coherent valleytronics.

Self-healing materials with microvascular networks	NATURE MATERIALS												Self-healing polymers composed of microencapsulated healing agents exhibit remarkable mechanical performance and regenerative ability(1-3), but are limited to autonomic repair of a single damage event in a given location. Self-healing is triggered by crack-induced rupture of the embedded capsules; thus, once a localized region is depleted of healing agent, further repair is precluded. Re-mendable polymers(4,5) can achieve multiple healing cycles, but require external intervention in the form of heat treatment and applied pressure. Here, we report a self-healing system capable of autonomously repairing repeated damage events. Our bio-inspired coating-substrate design delivers healing agent to cracks in a polymer coating via a three-dimensional microvascular network(6) embedded in the substrate. Crack damage in the epoxy coating is healed repeatedly. This approach opens new avenues for continuous delivery of healing agents for self-repair as well as other active species for additional functionality.

The finite width of these systems breaks the spectrum into an infinite set of bands, which we demonstrate can be quantitatively understood using the Dirac equation with appropriate boundary conditions. For the zigzag nanoribbon we demonstrate that the boundary condition allows a particlelike and a holelike band with evanescent wave functions confined to the surfaces, which continuously turn into the well-known zero energy surface states as the width gets large. For armchair edges, we show that the boundary condition leads to admixing of valley states, and the band structure is metallic when the width of the sample in lattice constant units has the form 3M+1, with M an integer, and insulating otherwise. A comparison of the wave functions and energies from tight-binding calculations and solutions of the Dirac equations yields quantitative agreement for all but the narrowest ribbons.

However, lithium has been plagued by the issues of dendrite formation, high chemical reactivity with electrolyte, and infinite relative volume expansion during plating and stripping, which present safety hazards and low cycling efficiency in batteries with lithium metal electrodes. There have been a lot of recent studies on Li metal although little work has focused on the initial nucleation and growth behavior of Li metal, neglecting a critical fundamental scientific foundation of Li plating. Here, we study experimentally the morphology of lithium in the early stages of nucleation and growth on planar copper electrodes in liquid organic electrolyte. We elucidate the dependence of lithium nuclei size, shape, and areal density on current rate, consistent with classical nucleation and growth theory. We found that the nuclei size is proportional to the inverse of overpotential and the number density of nuclei is proportional to the cubic power of overpotential. Based on this understanding, we propose a strategy to increase the uniformity of electrodeposited lithium on the electrode surface.

Stable, Single-Layer MX<sub>2</sub> Transition-Metal Oxides and Dichalcogenides in a Honeycomb-Like Structure	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C												Recent studies have revealed that single-layer transition-metal oxides and dichalcogenides (MX2) might offer properties superior to those of graphene. So far, only very few MX2 compounds have been synthesized as suspended single layers, and some of them have been exfoliated as thin sheets. Using first-principles structure optimization and phonon calculations based on density functional theory, we predict that, out of 88 different combinations of MX2 compounds, several of them can be stable in free-standing, single-layer honeycomb-like structures. These materials have two-dimensional hexagonal lattices and have top-view appearances as if they consisted of either honeycombs or centered honeycombs. However, their bonding is different from that of graphene; they can be viewed as a positively charged plane of transition-metal atoms sandwiched between two planes of negatively charged oxygen or chalcogen atoms. Electron correlation in transition-metal oxides was treated by including Coulomb repulsion through LDA + U calculations. Our analysis of stability was extended to include in-plane stiffness, as well as ab initio, finite-temperature molecular dynamics calculations. Some of these single-layer structures are direct- or indirect-band-gap semiconductors, only one compound is half-metal, and the rest are either ferromagnetic or nonmagnetic metals. Because of their surface polarity, band gap, high in-plane stiffness, and suitability for functionalization by adatoms or vacancies, these single-layer structures can be utilized in a wide range of technological applications, especially as nanoscale coatings for surfaces contributing crucial functionalities. In particular, the manifold WX2 heralds exceptional properties promising future nanoscale applications.

Recent research has shown that the electrochemical reduction of CO2 can produce a variety of organic compounds such as formic acid, carbon monoxide, methane, and ethylene with high current efficiency. These products can be used as feedstocks for chemical synthesis or converted into hydrocarbon fuels. This process is of interest (i) for the recycling of CO2 as an energy carrier, thereby reducing its accumulation in the atmosphere, (ii) for the production of renewable hydrocarbon fuels from CO2, water, and renewable electricity for use as transportation fuels, and (iii) as a convenient means of storing electrical energy in chemical form to level the electrical output from intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Low-temperature Al2O3 ALD films have the potential to coat thermally fragile substrates such as organic, polymeric, or biological materials. The properties of low-temperature Al2O3 ALD films were investigated versus growth temperature by depositing films on Si(100) substrates and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors. Al2O3 film thicknesses, growth rates, densities, and optical properties were determined using surface profilometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), QCM, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Al2O3 film densities were lower at lower deposition temperatures. Al2O3 ALD film densities were 3.0 g/cm(3) at 177 degreesC and 2.5 g/cm(3) at 33 degreesC. AFM images showed that Al2O3 ALD films grown at low temperatures were very smooth with a root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness of only 4 +/- 1 A. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements showed good electrical properties of the low-temperature Al2O3 ALD films. Elemental analysis of the films using forward recoil spectrometry revealed hydrogen concentrations that increased with decreasing growth temperature. No other elements were observed by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry except the parent aluminum and oxygen concentrations.

Here, we show an intrinsic therapeutic effect of ferumoxytol on the growth of early mammary cancers, and lung cancer metastases in liver and lungs. In vitro, adenocarcinoma cells co-incubated with ferumoxytol and macrophages showed increased caspase-3 activity. Macrophages exposed to ferumoxytol displayed increased mRNA associated with pro-inflammatory Th1-type responses. In vivo, ferumoxytol significantly inhibited growth of subcutaneous adenocarcinomas in mice. In addition, intravenous ferumoxytol treatment before intravenous tumour cell challenge prevented development of liver metastasis. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and histopathology studies showed that the observed tumour growth inhibition was accompanied by increased presence of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in the tumour tissues. Our results suggest that ferumoxytol could be applied 'off label' to protect the liver from metastatic seeds and potentiate macrophage-modulating cancer immunotherapies.

Lately, black phosphorus has emerged as a promising new two-dimensional material due to its widely tunable and direct bandgap, high carrier mobility and remarkable in-plane anisotropic electrical, optical and phonon properties(3-9). However, current progress is primarily limited to its thin-film form. Here, we reveal highly anisotropic and strongly bound excitons in monolayer black phosphorus using polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements at room temperature. We show that, regardless of the excitation laser polarization, the emitted light from the monolayer is linearly polarized along the light effective mass direction and centres around 1.3 eV, a clear signature of emission from highly anisotropic bright excitons. Moreover, photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy suggests a quasiparticle bandgap of 2.2 eV, from which we estimate an exciton binding energy of similar to 0.9 eV, consistent with theoretical results based on first principles. The experimental observation of highly anisotropic, bright excitons with large binding energy not only opens avenues for the future explorations of many-electron physics in this unusual two-dimensional material, but also suggests its promising future in optoelectronic devices.

In particular, detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at the parts per billion (ppb) level is critical for the early diagnosis of diseases. To obtain high sensitivity, two requirements need to be simultaneously satisfied: (i) low electrical noise and (ii) strong signal, which existing sensor materials cannot meet. Here, we demonstrate that 2D metal carbide MXenes, which possess high metallic conductivity for low noise and a fully functionalized surface for a strong signal, greatly outperform the sensitivity of conventional semiconductor channel materials. Ti3C2Tx MXene gas sensors exhibited a very low limit of detection of 50-100 ppb for VOC gases at room temperature. Also, the extremely low noise led to a signal-to-noise ratio 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of other 2D materials, surpassing the best sensors known. Our results provide insight in utilizing highly functionalized metallic sensing channels for developing highly sensitive sensors.

Such a crossover can be achieved by peeling off a multilayer sample to a single layer. For exploration of physical behavior and device applications, it is much desired to reversibly modulate such crossover in a multilayer sample. Here we demonstrate that, in a few-layer sample where the indirect bandgap and direct bandgap are nearly degenerate, the temperature rise can effectively drive the system toward the 2D limit by thermally decoupling neighboring layers via interlayer thermal expansion. Such a situation is realized in few-layer MoSe2, which shows stark contrast from the well-explored MoS2 where the indirect and direct bandgaps are far from degenerate. Photoluminescence of few-layer MoSe2 is much enhanced with the temperature rise, much like the way that the photoluminescence is enhanced due to the bandgap crossover going from the bulk to the quantum limit, offering potential applications involving external modulation of optical properties in 2D semiconductors. The direct bandgap of MoSe2, identified at 1.55 eV, may also promise applications in energy conversion involving solar spectrum, as it is close to the optimal bandgap value of single-junction solar cells and photoelechemical devices.

Our devices with triple MoS2 layers exhibited excellent photodetection capabilities for red light, while those with single- and double-layers turned out to be quite useful for green light detection. The varied functionalities are attributed to energy gap modulation by the number of MoS2 layers.

Nanostructured Reduced Graphene Oxide/Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Composite As a High-Performance Anode Material for Lithium Ion Batteries	ACS NANO												Reduced graphene oxide/Fe2O3 composite was prepared using a facile two-step synthesis by homogeneous coprecipitation and subsequent reduction of the G-O with hydrazine under microwave irradiation to yield reduced graphene oxide (RG-O) platelets decorated with Fe2O3 nanoparticles. As an anode material for Li-ion batteries, the RG-O/Fe2O3 composite exhibited discharge and charge capacities of 1693 and 1227 mAh/g, respectively, normalized to the mass of Fe2O3 In the composite (and 1355 and 982 mAh/g, respectively, based on the total mass of the composite), with good cycling performance and rate capability. Characterization shows that the Fe2O3 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of the RG-O platelet in the composite. The total specific capacity of RG-O/Fe2O3 is higher than the sum of pure RG-O and nanoparticle Fe2O3, indicating a positive synergistic effect of RG-O and Fe2O3 on the improvement of electrochemical performance. The synthesis approach presents a promising route for a large-scale production of RG-O platelet/metal oxide nanoparticle composites as electrode materials for Li-ion batteries.

With respect to the charge transport, it is demonstrated that the electron mobility dominates the transport of the cell, varying from 10(-8) m(2) V-1 S-1 in as-cast devices to approximate to 3 x 10(-7) m(2) V-1 s(-1) after thermal annealing. The hole mobility in the P3HT phase of the blend is dramatically affected by thermal annealing. It increases by more than three orders of magnitude, to reach a value of up to approximate to 2 x 10(4) m(2) V-1 s(-1) after the annealing process, as a result of an improved crystallinity of the film. Moreover, upon annealing the absorption spectrum of P3HT:PCBM blends undergo a strong red-shift, improving the spectral overlap with solar emission, which results in an increase of more than 60% in the rate of charge-carrier generation. Subsequently, the experimental electron and hole mobilities are used to study the photocurrent generation in P3HT:PCBM devices as a function of annealing temperature. The results indicate that the most important factor leading to a strong enhancement of the efficiency, compared with non-annealed devices, is the increase of the hole mobility in the P3HT phase of the blend. Furthermore, numerical simulations indicate that under short-circuit conditions the dissociation efficiency of bound electron-hole pairs at the donor/acceptor interface is close to 90%, which explains the large quantum efficiencies measured in P3HT:PCBM blends.

Improved performance and stability in quantum dot solar cells through band alignment engineering	NATURE MATERIALS												Solution processing is a promising route for the realization of low-cost, large-area, flexible and lightweight photovoltaic devices with short energy payback time and high specific power. However, solar cells based on solution-processed organic, inorganic and hybrid materials reported thus far generally suffer from poor air stability, require an inert-atmosphere processing environment or necessitate high-temperature processing(1), all of which increase manufacturing complexities and costs. Simultaneously fulfilling the goals of high efficiency, low-temperature fabrication conditions and good atmospheric stability remains a major technical challenge, which may be addressed, as we demonstrate here, with the development of room-temperature solution-processed ZnO/PbS quantum dot solar cells. By engineering the band alignment of the quantum dot layers through the use of different ligand treatments, a certified efficiency of 8.55% has been reached. Furthermore, the performance of unencapsulated devices remains unchanged for over 150 days of storage in air. This material system introduces a new approach towards the goal of high-performance air-stable solar cells compatible with simple solution processes and deposition on flexible substrates.

This would particularly be true if magnesium alloys with controlled in vivo corrosion rates could be developed. Since the magnesium corrosion process depends on its corrosive environment, the corrosion rates of magnesium alloys under standard in vitro environmental conditions were compared to corrosion rates in an in vivo animal model. Two gravity-cast magnesium alloys (AZ91D, LAE442) were used in these investigations. Standardized immersion and electrochemical tests according to ASTM norms were performed. The in vivo corrosion tests were carried out by intramedullar implantation of sample rods of the magnesium alloys in guinea pig femura. The reduction in implant volume was determined by synchrotron-radiation-based microtomography. We found that in vivo corrosion was about four orders of magnitude lower than in vitro corrosion of the tested alloys. Furthermore, the tendency of the corrosion rates obtained from in vitro corrosion tests were in the opposite direction as those obtained from the in vivo study. The results of this study suggest, that the conclusions drawn from current ASTM standard in vitro corrosion tests cannot be used to predict in vivo corrosion rates of magnesium alloys.

Transparent Conductive Two-Dimensional Titanium Carbide Epitaxial Thin Films	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												Since the discovery of graphene, the quest for two-dimensional (2D) materials has intensified greatly. Recently, a new family of 2D transition metal carbides and carbonitrides (MXenes) was discovered that is both conducting and hydrophilic, an uncommon combination. To date MXenes have been produced as powders, flakes, and colloidal solutions. Herein, we report on the fabrication of similar to 1 x 1 cm(2) Ti3C2 films by selective etching of Al, from sputter-deposited epitaxial Ti3AlC2 films, in aqueous HF or NH4HF2. Films that were about 19 nm thick, etched with NH4HF2, transmit similar to 90% of the light in the visible-to-infrared range and exhibit metallic conductivity down to similar to 100 K. Below 100 K, the films' resistivity increases with decreasing temperature and they exhibit negative magnetoresistance-both observations consistent with a weak localization phenomenon characteristic of many 2D defective solids. This advance opens the door for the use of MXenes in electronic, photonic, and sensing applications.

Development of fire-retarded materials - Interpretation of cone calorimeter data	FIRE AND MATERIALS												There is little consensus within the fire science community on interpretation of cone calorimeter data, but there is a significant need to screen new flammability modified materials using the cone calorimeter. This article is the result of several discussions aiming to provide guidance in the use and interpretation of cone calorimetry for those directly involved with such measurements. This guidance is essentially empirical, and is not intended to replace the comprehensive scientific studies that already exist. The guidance discusses the fire scenario with respect to applied heat flux, length scale, temperature, ventilation, anaerobic pyrolysis and set-up represented by the cone calorimeter. The fire properties measured in the cone calorimeter are discussed, including heat release rate and its peak, the mass loss and char yield, effective heat of combustion and combustion efficiency, time to ignition and CO and smoke production together with deduced quantities such as FIGRA and MARHE. Special comments are made on the use of the cone calorimeter relating to sample thickness, textiles, foams and intumescent materials, and the distance of the cone heater from the sample surface. Finally, the relationship between cone calorimetry data and other tests is discussed. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

During the process the powder particles are completely molten by the laser beam. The resulting high density allows avoiding lengthy post-processing as required with selective laser sintering (SLS) of metal powders. Unlike SLS, SLM is more difficult to control. Because of the large energy input of the laser beam and the complete melting of particles problems like balling, residual stresses and deformation occur. This paper will describe SLM applied to a mixture of different types of particles (Fe, Ni, Cu and Fe3P) specially developed for SLM. The different appearing phenomenons are discussed and the process optimization is described. The latter includes an appropriate process parameter adjustment and the application of special scanning strategies. Resulting parts are characterized by their microstructure, density and mechanical properties. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, technical challenges, such as the fabrication of high-performance, energy-efficient sensors and memory modules that are in intimate mechanical contact with soft tissues, in conjunction with controlled delivery of therapeutic agents, limit the wide-scale adoption of such systems. Here, we describe materials, mechanics and designs for multifunctional, wearable-on-the-skin systems that address these challenges via monolithic integration of nanomembranes fabricated with a top-down approach, nanoparticles assembled by bottom-up methods, and stretchable electronics on a tissue-like polymeric substrate. Representative examples of such systems include physiological sensors, non-volatile memory and drug-release actuators. Quantitative analyses of the electronics, mechanics, heat-transfer and drug-diffusion characteristics validate the operation of individual components, thereby enabling system-level multifunctionalities.

The imperfection of the current techniques has encouraged the use of a rapid prototyping technology known as fused deposition modeling (FDM). Our results show that FDM allows the design and fabrication of highly reproducible bioresorbable 3D scaffolds with a fully interconnected pore network. The mechanical properties and in vitro biocompatibility of polycaprolactone scaffolds with a porosity of 61 +/- 1% and two matrix architectures were studied. The honeycomblike pores had a size falling within the range of 360 x 430 x 620 mum. The scaffolds with a 0/60/120 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in air of 41.9 +/- 3.5 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degreesC) of 29.4 +/- 4.0 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. In comparison, the scaffolds with a 0/72/144/36/108 degrees lay-down pattern had a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in air of 20.2 +/- 1.7 and 2.4 +/- 0.1 MPa, respectively, and a compressive stiffness and a 1% offset yield strength in simulated physiological conditions (a saline solution at 37 degreesC) of 21.5 +/- 2.9 and 2.0 +/- 0.2 MPa, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed that the five-angle scaffolds had significantly lower stiffness and 1% offset yield strengths under compression loading than those with a three-angle pattern under both testing conditions (p less than or equal to 0.05). The obtained stress-strain curves for both scaffold architectures demonstrate the typical behavior of a honeycomb structure undergoing deformation. In vitro studies were conducted with primary human fibroblasts and periosteal cells. Light, environmental scanning electron, and confocal laser microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry showed cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production on the polycaprolactone surface in the Ist culturing week. Over a period of 3-4 weeks in a culture, the fully interconnected scaffold architecture was completely 3D-filled by cellular tissue. Our cell culture study shows that fibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells can proliferate, differentiate, and produce a cellular tissue in an entirely interconnected 3D polycaprolactone matrix.

J	Withers, PJ; Bhadeshia, HKDH				Withers, PJ; Bhadeshia, HKDH			<i>Overview</i> -: Residual stress part 1 -: Measurement techniques	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Residual stress is that which remains in a body that is stationary and at equilibrium with its surroundings. It can be very detrimental to the performance of a material or the life of a component. Alternatively, beneficial residual stresses can be introduced deliberately, Residual stresses are more difficult to predict than the in-service stresses on which they superimpose, For this reason, it is important to have reliable methods for the measurement of these stresses and to understand the level of information they can provide. In this paper, which is the first part of a two part overview, the effect of residual stresses on fatigue lifetimes and structural integrity are first summarised, followed by the definition and measurement of residual stresses. Different types of stress are characterised according to the characteristic length scale over which they self-equilibrate. By comparing this length to the gauge volume of each technique, the capability of a range of techniques is assessed. In the second part of the overview, the different nature and origins of residual stress for various classes of material are examined.

In this work, porous PCL scaffolds were computationally designed and then fabricated via selective laser sintering (SLS), a rapid prototyping technique. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated scaffolds were assessed and compared to the designed porous architectures and computationally predicted properties. Scaffolds were then seeded with bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) transduced fibroblasts and implanted subcutaneously to evaluate biological properties and to demonstrate tissue in-growth. The work done illustrates the ability to design and fabricate PCL scaffolds with porous architecture that have sufficient mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering applications using SLS. Compressive modulus and yield strength values ranged from 52 to 67 MPa and 2.0 to 3.2 Mpa, respectively, lying within the lower range of properties reported for human trabecular bone. Finite element analysis (FEA) results showed that mechanical properties of scaffold designs and of fabricated scaffolds can be computationally predicted. Histological evaluation and micro-computed tomography (mu CT) analysis of implanted scaffolds showed that bone can be generated in vivo. Finally, to demonstrate the clinical application of this technology, we designed and fabricated a prototype mandibular condyle scaffold based on an actual pig condyle. The integration of scaffold computational design and free-form fabrication techniques presented here could prove highly useful for the construction of scaffolds that have anatomy specific exterior architecture derived from patient CT or MRI data and an interior porous architecture derived from computational design optimization.

The miniaturization of electronic circuits is expected to reach fundamental limits in the near future. Two-dimensional materials such as single-layer MoS2 represent the ultimate limit of miniaturization in the vertical dimension, are Interesting as building blocks of low-power nanoelectronic devices, and are suitable for integration due to their planar geometry. Because they are less than 1 nm thin, 2D materials in transistors could also lead to reduced short channel effects and result in fabrication of smaller and more power-efficient transistors. Here, we report on the first integrated circuit based on a two-dimensional semiconductor MoS2. Our Integrated circuits are capable of operating as Inverters, converting logical "1" into logical "0", with room-temperature voltage gain higher than 1, making them suitable for incorporation into digital circuits. We also show that electrical circuits composed of single-layer MoS2 transistors are capable of performing the NOR logic operation, the basis from which all logical operations and full digital functionality can be deduced.

Here we report a hollow carbon nanofiber-encapsulated sulfur cathode for effective trapping of polysulfides and demonstrate experimentally high specific capacity and excellent electrochemical cycling of the cells. The hollow carbon nanofiber arrays were fabricated using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates, through thermal carbonization of polystyrene. The AAO template also facilitates sulfur infusion into the hollow fibers and prevents sulfur from coating onto the exterior carbon wall. The high aspect ratio of the carbon nanofibers provides an ideal structure for trapping polysulfides, and the thin carbon wall allows rapid transport of lithium ions. The small dimension of these nanofibers provides a large surface area per unit mass for Li2S deposition during cycling and reduces pulverization of electrode materials due to volumetric expansion. A high specific capacity of about 730 mAh/g was observed at C/5 rate after 150 cycles of charge/discharge. The introduction of LiNO3 additive to the electrolyte was shown to improve the Coulombic efficiency to over 99% at C/5. The results show that the hollow carbon nanofiber-encapsulated sulfur structure could be a promising cathode design for rechargeable Li/S batteries with high specific energy.

All these characteristics are illustrated through selective examples. A simple step-by-step procedure is presented to design the cantilever beam based energy harvester by incorporating piezoelectric material at maximum stress points in first and second resonance modes. Suitable piezoelectric material for vibration energy harvesting is characterized by the large magnitude of product of the piezoelectric voltage constant (g) and the piezoelectric strain constant (d) given as (d . g). The condition for obtaining large magnitude of d.g has been shown to be as vertical bar d vertical bar = epsilon(n), where E is the permittivity of the material and n is a material parameter having, lower limit of 0.5. The material can be in the form of polycrystalline ceramics, textured ceramics, thin films, and polymers. A brief coverage of various material systems is provided in all these categories. Using these materials different transducer structures can be fabricated depending upon the desired frequency and vibration amplitude such as multilayer, MFC, bimorph, amplified piezoelectric actuator, QuickPack, rainbow, cymbal, and moonie. The concept of multi modal energy harvesting is introduced at the end of the chapter. This concept provides the opportunity for further enhancement of power density by combining two different energy-harvesting schemes in one system such that one assists the other.

Using a recently introduced algorithm, we have quantitatively simulated previously published small-angle scattering data of hydrated Nafion. The characteristic 'ionomer peak' arises from long parallel but otherwise randomly packed water channels surrounded by partially hydrophilic side branches, forming inverted-micelle cylinders. At 20 vol% water, the water channels have diameters of between 1.8 and 3.5 nm, with an average of 2.4 nm. Nafion crystallites (similar to 10 vol%), which form physical crosslinks that are crucial for the mechanical properties of Nafion films, are elongated and parallel to the water channels, with cross-sections of similar to(5nm)(2). Simulations for various other models of Nafion, including Gierke's cluster and the polymer-bundle model, do not match the scattering data. The new model can explain important features of Nafion, including fast diffusion of water and protons through Nafion and its persistence at low temperatures.					chen, qiang/GWZ-7308-2022														1476-1122	1476-4660				JAN	2008	7	1					75	83		10.1038/nmat2074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2074								18066069					WOS:000252117700024

When an ethanol solution containing both poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, M-w approximate to 1300 000) and titanium tetraisopropoxide was injected through a needle under a strong electrical field, composite nanofibers made of PVP and amorphous TiO2 were formed (with lengths up to several centimeters) as a result of electrostatic jetting. These nanofibers could be subsequently converted into anatase without changing their morphology via calcination in air at 500 degreesC. The average diameter of these ceramic nanofibers could be controlled in the range from 20 to 200 nm by varying a number of parameters such as the ratio between PVP and titanium tetraisopropoxide, their concentrations in the alcohol solution, the strength of the electric field, and the feeding rate of the precursor solution.

J	Lu, ZP; Liu, CT				Lu, ZP; Liu, CT			A new glass-forming ability criterion for bulk metallic glasses	ACTA MATERIALIA												A new indicator of glass-forming ability (GFA) for bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) is proposed based on crystallization processes during cooling and reheating of the supercooled liquid. The interrelationship between this new parameter and the critical cooling rate or critical section thickness is elaborated and discussed in comparison with two other representatives, i.e. reduced glass transition temperature T-rg (= T-g/T-l, where T-g and T-l are the glass transition temperature and liquidus temperature, respectively) and supercooled liquid range DeltaT(xg) (= T-x-T-g, where T-x is the onset crystallization temperature and T-g the glass transition temperature). Our results have shown that DeltaT(xg) alone cannot infer relative GFA for BMGs while the new parameter gamma, defined as T-x/(T-g + T-l), has a much better interrelationship with GFA than T-rg. An approximation of the critical cooling rate and critical section thickness for glass formation in bulk metallic glasses is also formulated and evaluated.

Influence of amount of recycled coarse aggregates and production process on properties of recycled aggregate concrete	CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH												in this study recycled coarse aggregates obtained by crushed concrete were used for concrete production. Four different recycled aggregate concretes were produced; made with 0%, 25%, 50% and 100% of recycled coarse aggregates, respectively. The mix proportions of the four concretes were designed in order to achieve the same compressive strengths. Recycled aggregates were used in wet condition, but not saturated, to control their fresh concrete properties, effective w/c ratio and lower strength variability. The necessity to produce recycled aggregate concrete with low-medium compressive strength was verified due to the requirement of the volume of cement. The influence of the order of materials used in concrete production (made with recycled aggregates) with respect to improving its splitting tensile strength was analysed.

Here we review recent results on the Raman spectroscopy and imaging of graphene. We show that Raman spectroscopy and imaging can be used as a quick and unambiguous method to determine the number of graphene layers. The strong Raman signal of single layer graphene compared to graphite is explained by an interference enhancement model. We have also studied the effect of substrates, the top layer deposition, the annealing process, as well as folding (stacking order) on the physical and electronic properties of graphene. Finally, Raman spectroscopy of epitaxial graphene grown on a SiC substrate is presented and strong compressive strain on epitaxial graphene is observed. The results presented here are highly relevant to the application of graphene in nano-electronic devices and help in developing a better understanding of the physical and electronic properties of graphene.

It is found that both N and S-doping can occur at annealing temperatures from 500 to 1000 degrees C to form the different binding configurations at the edges or on the planes of the graphene, such as pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N for N-doped graphene, thiophene-like S, and oxidized S for S-doped graphene. Moreover, the resulting N and S-doped graphene sheets exhibit good electrocatalytic activity, long durability, and high selectivity when they are employed as metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions. This approach may provide an efficient platform for the synthesis of a series of heteroatom-doped graphenes for different applications.

However, the most effective approach to achieving invisibility in various military applications is to absorb the electromagnetic waves emitted from radar to minimize the corresponding reflection and scattering, such that no signal gets bounced back. Here, we show the experimental realization of chip-scale unidirectional reflectionless optical metamaterials near the spontaneous parity-time symmetry phase transition point where reflection from one side is significantly suppressed. This is enabled by engineering the corresponding optical properties of the designed parity-time metamaterial in the complex dielectric permittivity plane. Numerical simulations and experimental verification consistently exhibit asymmetric reflection with high contrast ratios around a wavelength of of 1,550 nm. The demonstrated unidirectional phenomenon at the corresponding parity-time exceptional point on-a-chip confirms the feasibility of creating complicated on-chip parity-time metamaterials and optical devices based on their properties.

K.; Ferrari, Andrea C.; Mauri, Francesco			Breakdown of the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation in graphene	NATURE MATERIALS												The adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation (ABO) has been the standard ansatz to describe the interaction between electrons and nuclei since the early days of quantum mechanics(1,2). ABO assumes that the lighter electrons adjust adiabatically to the motion of the heavier nuclei, remaining at any time in their instantaneous ground state. ABO is well justified when the energy gap between ground and excited electronic states is larger than the energy scale of the nuclear motion. In metals, the gap is zero and phenomena beyond ABO (such as phonon-mediated superconductivity or phonon-induced renormalization of the electronic properties) occur(3). The use of ABO to describe lattice motion in metals is, therefore, questionable(4,5). In spite of this, ABO has proved effective for the accurate determination of chemical reactions(6), molecular dynamics(7,8) and phonon frequencies(9-11) in a wide range of metallic systems. Here, we show that ABO fails in graphene. Graphene, recently discovered in the free state(12,13), is a zero-bandgap semiconductor(14) that becomes a metal if the Fermi energy is tuned applying a gate voltage(13,15), V-g. This induces a stiffening of the Raman G peak that cannot be described within ABO.

However, recent reports demonstrate that the Li dendrite formation in Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and Li2S-P2S5 is actually much easier than that in liquid electrolytes of lithium batteries, by mechanisms that remain elusive. Here we illustrate the origin of the dendrite formation by monitoring the dynamic evolution of Li concentration profiles in three popular but representative SEs (LiPON, LLZO and amorphous Li3PS4) during lithium plating using time-resolved operando neutron depth profiling. Although no apparent changes in the lithium concentration in LiPON can be observed, we visualize the direct deposition of Li inside the bulk LLZO and Li3PS4. Our findings suggest the high electronic conductivity of LLZO and Li3PS4 is mostly responsible for dendrite formation in these SEs. Lowering the electronic conductivity, rather than further increasing the ionic conductivity of SEs, is therefore critical for the success of all-solid-state Li batteries.

Interfacial resistance is now the limiting factor in many systems, but the exact mechanisms of this resistance have not been fully explained in part because experimental evaluation of the interface can be very difficult. In this work, we develop a computational methodology to examine the thermodynamics of formation of resistive interfacial phases. The predicted interfacial phase formation is well correlated with experimental interfacial observations and battery performance. We calculate that thiophosphate electrolytes have especially high reactivity with high voltage cathodes and a narrow electrochemical stability window. We also find that a number of known electrolytes are not inherently stable but react in situ with the electrode to form passivating but ionically conducting barrier layers. As a reference for experimentalists, we tabulate the stability and expected decomposition products for a wide range of electrolyte, coating, and electrode materials including a number of high-performing combinations that have not yet been attempted experimentally.

Oxidation Resistance of Graphene-Coated Cu and Cu/Ni Alloy	ACS NANO												The ability to protect refined metals from reactive environments is vital to many industrial and academic applications. Current solutions, however, typically introduce several negative effects, including increased thickness and changes in the metal physical properties. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time the ability of graphene films grown by chemical vapor deposition to protect the surface of the metallic growth substrates of Cu and Cu/Ni alloy from air oxidation. In particular, graphene prevents the formation of any oxide on the protected metal surfaces, thus allowing pure metal surfaces only one atom away from reactive environments. SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS studies show that the metal surface is well protected from oxidation even after heating at 200 degrees C in air for up to 4 h. Our work further shows that graphene provides effective resistance against hydrogen peroxide. This protection method offers significant advantages and can be used on any metal that catalyzes graphene growth.

Many-body localization phase transition	PHYSICAL REVIEW B												We use exact diagonalization to explore the many-body localization transition in a random-field spin-1/2 chain. We examine the correlations within each many-body eigenstate, looking at all high-energy states and thus effectively working at infinite temperature. For weak random field the eigenstates are thermal, as expected in this nonlocalized, "ergodic" phase. For strong random field the eigenstates are localized with only short-range entanglement. We roughly locate the localization transition and examine some of its finite-size scaling, finding that this quantum phase transition at nonzero temperature might be showing infinite-randomness scaling with a dynamic critical exponent z ->infinity.

Water-soluble SWNTs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) functionalization via these routes allow for surprisingly high degrees of pi-stacking of aromatic molecules, including a cancer drug (doxorubicin) with ultrahigh loading capacity, a widely used fluorescence molecule (fluorescein), and combinations of molecules. Binding of molecules to nanotubes and their release can be controlled by varying the pH. The strength of pi-stacking of aromatic molecules is dependent on nanotube diameter, leading to a method for controlling the release rate of molecules from SWNTs by using nanotube materials with suitable diameter. This work introduces the concept of "functionalization partitioning" of SWNTs, i.e., imparting multiple chemical species, such as PEG, drugs, and fluorescent tags, with different functionalities onto the surface of the same nanotube. Such chemical partitioning should open up new opportunities in chemical, biological, and medical applications of novel nanomaterials.

The dopants being considered are group-I elements Li, Na, and K and group-V elements N, P, and As. We find that substitutional group-I elements are shallow acceptors, while substitutional group-V elements such as P and As are deep acceptors. The AX centers that convert acceptors into deep donors are found to be unstable except for P and As. Without compensation by intrinsic defects, the most likely cause for doping difficulty is the formation of interstitials for group-I elements and antisites for group-V elements.

J	Binks, BP; Lumsdon, SO				Binks, BP; Lumsdon, SO			Influence of particle wettability on the type and stability of surfactant-free emulsions	LANGMUIR												A systematic investigation into the influence of the wettability of spherical, nanometer-sized silica particles on the type and stability of water-toluene emulsions is described. The particles range from hydrophilic to hydrophobic depending on the extent of chemisorbed silane on their surfaces. We show that predictions based on considerations of the energy of attachment of a single particle to the oil-water interface relate directly to the stability of emulsions. A combination of powder immersion, shelf stability, light diffraction, and microscopy measurements is used to characterize the systems. Emulsions stabilized by either very hydrophilic or very hydrophobic particles are large (>100 mum) and unstable to coalescence. Those with particles of intermediate hydrophobicity are submicrometer and stable to coalescence indefinitely For these, catastrophic inversion of emulsions occurs upon increasing the volume fraction of water, phi (w), and their stability to sedimentation or creaming increases approaching inversion. The stability of emulsions to gravity-induced separation passes through a sharp maximum upon increasing the particle hydrophobicity, alongside a minimum in the average drop diameter. This is universal and independent of phi (w) and the type of emulsion formed. In one system, an otherwise very stable water-in-oil emulsion is destabilized in an ultracentrifugal field leading to enhanced sedimentation and eventual coalescence.

From these calculations, a key observation emerges involving the presence of two temporal pathways for transmission and reflection processes. Using this insight, we introduce a general physical model that explains the essential features of complex spectral properties.

Herein, the critical role of structural H2O on Zn2+ intercalation into bilayer V(2)O(5<bold>)nH(</bold>2)O is demonstrated. The results suggest that the H2O-solvated Zn2+ possesses largely reduced effective charge and thus reduced electrostatic interactions with the V2O5 framework, effectively promoting its diffusion. Benefited from the "lubricating" effect, the aqueous Zn battery shows a specific energy of approximate to 144 Wh kg(-1) at 0.3 A g(-1). Meanwhile, it can maintain an energy density of 90 Wh kg(-1) at a high power density of 6.4 kW kg(-1) (based on the cathode and 200% Zn anode), making it a promising candidate for high-performance, low-cost, safe, and environment-friendly energy-storage devices.

The adhesive wear behavior and mechanism were also studied and compared with the conventional wear-resistant steels SUJ2 and SKH51. The amounts of Al and Ti strongly affect the phase and microstructure, particularly the amount and morphology of the hard eta-(Ni, Co)(3)Ti phase. It was found that the wear resistance of the Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti and Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti alloys is at least two times better than that of conventional wear-resistant steels with similar hardness. The excellent anti-oxidation property and resistance to thermal softening in these high-entropy alloys are proposed to be the main reasons for the outstanding wear resistance.

M.; Koumoulos, Elias P.; Bandyopadhyay, Amit; Bose, Susmita; O'Donoghue, Lisa; Charitidis, Costas			Additive manufacturing: scientific and technological challenges, market uptake and opportunities	MATERIALS TODAY												Additive manufacturing (AM) is fundamentally different from traditional formative or subtractive manufacturing in that it is the closest to the 'bottom up' manufacturing where a structure can be built into its designed shape using a 'layer-by-layer' approach rather than casting or forming by technologies such as forging or machining. AM is versatile, flexible, highly customizable and, as such, can suite most sectors of industrial production. Materials to make these parts/objects can be of a widely varying type. These include metallic, ceramic and polymeric materials along with combinations in the form of composites, hybrid, or functionally graded materials (FGMs). The challenge remains, however, to transfer this 'making' shapes and structures into obtaining objects that are functional. A great deal of work is needed in AM in addressing the challenges related to its two key enabling technologies namely 'materials' and 'metrology' to achieve this functionality in a predictive and reproductive ways. The good news is that there is a significant interest in industry for taking up AM as one of the main production engineering route. Additive Manufacturing, in our opinion, is definitely at the cross-road from where this new, much-hyped but somewhat unproven manufacturing process must move towards a technology that can demonstrate the ability to produce real, innovative, complex and robust products.

These materials have the potential to be produced at low cost and in large areas, while maintaining high material quality. These properties, as well as their flexibility, make two-dimensional atomic crystals attractive for applications such as solar cells or display panels. The basic building blocks of optoelectronic devices are p-n junction diodes, but they have not yet been demonstrated in a two-dimensional material. Here, we report a p-n junction diode based on an electrostatically doped5 tungsten diselenide (WSe 2) monolayer. We present applications as a photovoltaic solar cell, a photodiode and a light-emitting diode, and obtain light-power conversion and electro-luminescence efficiencies of similar to 0.5% and similar to 0.1%, respectively. Given recent advances in the large-scale production of two-dimensional crystals(6,7), we expect them to profoundly impact future developments in solar, lighting and display technologies.

The materials have been flax fibres and polylactic acid (PLA). PLA is a thermoplastic polymer made from lactic acid and has mainly been used for biodegradable products, such as plastic bags and planting cups, but in principle PLA can also be used as a matrix material in composites. Because of the brittle nature of PLA triacetin was tested as plasticizer for PLA and PLA/flax composites in order to improve the impact properties. The studied composite materials were manufactured with a twin-screw extruder having a flax fibre content of 30 and 40 wt.%. The extruded compound was compression moulded to test samples. The processing and material properties have been studied and compared to the more commonly used polypropylene flax fibre composites (PP/flax). Preliminary results show that the mechanical properties of PLA and flax fibre composites are promising. The composite strength is about 50% better compared to similar PP/flax fibre composites, which are used today in many automotive panels. The addition of plasticizer does not show any positive effect on the impact strength of the composites. The study of interfacial adhesion shows that adhesion needs to be improved to optimise the mechanical properties of the PLA/flax composites. The PLA/flax composites did not show any difficulties in the extrusion and compression moulding processes and they can be processed in a similar way as PP based composites.

The as-prepared BiOX powders were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy' transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and nitrogen sorption. The resulting BiOX samples were phase-pure and of hierarchical microspheres consisting of nanoplates. The band gaps of the as-prepared powders were estimated to about 3.22, 2.64, and 1.77 eV for BiOCl, BiOBr, and BiOI, respectively. On the basis of characterization results, we proposed a possible process for the growth of hierarchical BiOX nanoplate microspheres. Moreover, we evaluated their photocatalytic activities on the degradation of methyl orange and compared them with TiO2 (Degussa, P25) under UV-vis light irradiation and C-doped TiO2 under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation, respectively. It was found that all the BiOX samples were photocatalytically active and BiOI exhibited excellent activity under both UV-vis and visible light irradiation. The resulting hierarchical BiOX nanoplate microspheres are very promising photocatalysts for degrading organic pollutants and other applications.					zhang, rui/HZI-0079-2023; Jia, Falong/J-9787-2013; Zhang, Lizhi/JPA-1569-2023														1932-7447					JAN 24	2008	112	3					747	753		10.1021/jp077471t	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp077471t													WOS:000252484000016

Samples with grain sizes varying between 3 and 23 mum were prepared by altering the extrusion conditions. Compression testing of the extruded bar was carried out at temperatures between ambient and 200 degreesC. Twinning dominated the deformation at lower temperatures but this gave way to slip dominated flow when the temperature was raised. For tests carried out at intermediate temperatures, a similar transition was observed when the grain size was reduced. The transition was accompanied by a change in flow curve shape and Hall-Petch slope. The peak stresses achieved when twinning dominated the deformation were up to 100 MPa greater than those seen when slip dominated the flow. Critical grain sizes marking the twinning-slip transition were identified and these are described in terms of the deformation conditions. (C) 2004 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Coli has been investigated. ZnO nanoparticles from two sources are used to formulate nanofluids. The effects of particle size, concentration and the use of dispersants on the antibacterial behaviour are examined. The results show that the ZnO nanofluids have bacteriostatic activity against E. coli. The antibacterial activity increases with increasing nanoparticle concentration and increases with decreasing particle size. Particle concentration is observed to be more important than particle size under the conditions of this work. The results also show that the use of two types of dispersants (Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and Polyvinylpyrolidone (PVP)) does not affect much the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanofluids but enhances the stability of the suspensions. SEM analyses of the bacteria before and after treatment with ZnO nanofluids show that the presence of ZnO nanoparticles damages the membrane wall of the bacteria. Electrochemical measurements using a model DOPC monolayer suggest some direct interaction between ZnO nanoparticles and the bacteria membrane at high ZnO concentrations.					zhang, lingling/HDM-2189-2022; Ding, Yulong/AAA-8358-2019; Povey, Megan/G-3287-2010; Jiang, Yunhong/O-9673-2017	HOSSAIN, MD ELIAS/0000-0003-1678-1115; Povey, Megan/0000-0002-9740-2596; Ding, Yulong/0000-0001-8490-5349; Jiang, Yunhong/0000-0003-3292-8164													1388-0764					JUN	2007	9	3					479	489		10.1007/s11051-006-9150-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11051-006-9150-1													WOS:000246388200012

CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												Ni-rich Li[NixCoyMn1-x-y]O-2 cathodes (x = 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.95) were tested to characterize the capacity fading mechanism of extremely rich Ni compositions. Increasing the Ni fraction in the cathode delivered a higher discharge capacity (192.9 mA h g(-1) for Li[Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2]O-2 versus 235.0 mA h g(-1) for Li[Ni0.95Co0.025Mn0.025]O-2); however, the cycling stability was substantially reduced. Li[Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2]O-2 and Li[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O-2 retained more than 95% of their respective initial capacities after 100 cycles, while the capacity retention of Li[Ni0.9Co0.05Mn0.05]O-2 and Li[Ni0.95Co0.025Mn0.025]O-2 was limited to 85% during the same cycling period. The relatively inferior cycling stability of Li[NixCoyMn1-x-y]O-2 with x > 0.8 is attributed to the phase transition near the charge-end, causing an abrupt anisotropic shrinkage (or expansion during discharge), which was suppressed for compositions of x < 0.8. Residual stress stemming from the phase transition destabilized the internal microcracks and allowed the microcracks to propagate to the surface, providing channels for electrolyte penetration and subsequent degradation of the exposed internal surfaces formed by the microcracks. Further developments in particle morphology are required to dissipate the intrinsic lattice strain, stabilize the surface, and modify the composition to attain a satisfactory long-term cycling stability, and hence battery life.

Electric-field control of local ferromagnetism using a magnetoelectric multiferroic	NATURE MATERIALS												Multiferroics are of interest for memory and logic device applications, as the coupling between ferroelectric and magnetic properties enables the dynamic interaction between these order parameters. Here, we report an approach to control and switch local ferromagnetism with an electric field using multiferroics. We use two types of electromagnetic coupling phenomenon that are manifested in heterostructures consisting of a ferromagnet in intimate contact with the multiferroic BiFeO(3). The first is an internal, magnetoelectric coupling between antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in the BiFeO3 film that leads to electric-field control of the antiferromagnetic order. The second is based on exchange interactions at the interface between a ferromagnet (Co(0.9)Fe(0.1)) and the antiferromagnet. We have discovered a one-to-one mapping of the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic domains, mediated by the colinear coupling between the magnetization in the ferromagnet and the projection of the antiferromagnetic order in the multiferroic. Our preliminary experiments reveal the possibility to locally control ferromagnetism with an electric field.

We demonstrate that, different from the current consensus, Ge2Sb2Te5, the material of choice in DVD-RAM, does not possess the rocksalt structure but more likely consists of well-defined rigid building blocks that are randomly oriented in space consistent with cubic symmetry. Laser-induced amorphization results in drastic shortening of covalent bonds and a decrease in the mean-square relative displacement, demonstrating a substantial increase in the degree of short-range ordering, in sharp contrast to the amorphization of typical covalently bonded solids. This novel order-disorder transition is due to an umbrella-flip of Ge atoms from an octahedral position into a tetrahedral position without rupture of strong covalent bonds. It is this unique two-state nature of the transformation that ensures fast DVD performance and repeatable switching over ten million cycles.

Three different types of gold nanoparticles were prepared and studied: citrate-stabilized nanoparticles in five different sizes; oleylamide-protected gold nanoparticles with a core diameter of 8 nm, and a decanethiolprotected nanoparticles with a diameter of around 4 nm. A linear relationship between the logarithms of extinction coefficients and core diameters of bold particles was found independent of the capping ligands on the particle surface and the solvents used to dissolve the nanoparticles. This linear relation may be used as a calibration curve to determine the concentration or average size of an unknown nanoparticle or nanoparticle-biomolecule conjugate sample. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The performances of classical lithium-ion technology based on liquid electrolytes have made great advances in the past two decades, but the intrinsic instability of liquid electrolytes results in safety issues. Solid polymer electrolytes would be a perfect solution to those safety issues, miniaturization and enhancement of energy density. However, as in liquids, the fraction of charge carried by lithium ions is small (<20%), limiting the power performances. Solid polymer electrolytes operate at 80 degrees C, resulting in poor mechanical properties and a limited electrochemical stability window. Here we describe a multifunctional single-ion polymer electrolyte based on polyanionic block copolymers comprising polystyrene segments.

J	Stevens, DA; Dahn, JR				Stevens, DA; Dahn, JR			The mechanisms of lithium and sodium insertion in carbon materials	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY												In this paper, we compare the interaction, of lithium and sodium with a range of carbon materials in electrochemical cells. Through wide angle in situ X-ray scattering studies, we demonstrate that both lithium and sodium can be inserted into the interlayer space in disordered carbon materials. This insertion process is accompanied by an increase in the interlayer spacing in these materials. Small-angle in situ scattering studies are presented to clearly show the insertion of lithium and sodium into nanopores within disordered hard carbons. We also show that very little, if any, sodium can be inserted into graphitic materials in contrast to the large capacity seen for lithium insertion.

In this work, near-field electrospinning is used to direct-write poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers with in situ mechanical stretch and electrical poling characteristics to produce piezoelectric properties. Under mechanical stretching, nanogenerators have shown repeatable and consistent electrical outputs with energy conversion efficiency an order of magnitude higher than those made of PVDF thin films. The early onset of the nonlinear domain wall motions behavior has been identified as one mechanism responsible for the apparent high piezoelectricity in nanofibers, rendering them potentially advantageous for sensing and actuation applications.

The low-voltage process is quite reversible over the 0.02 to 1.8 V range with a sustained capacity of about 150 mAh/g over a few hundred cycles. Within such a range of potential the polymer/gel-like is barely evolving while it vanishes as the oxidation potential is increased above 2 V. From the cyclic-voltammogram profiles we conclude that the origin of the low-voltage capacity is nested in the pseudocapacitive character of the in situ made polymeric/gel film. Tentative explanations based on comparisons with existing literature are made to explain such an unusual finding. (C) 2002 The Electrochemical Society.

The Tetragonal-Monoclinic Transformation in Zirconia: Lessons Learned and Future Trends	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY												Zirconia ceramics have found broad applications in a variety of energy and biomedical applications because of their unusual combination of strength, fracture toughness, ionic conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. These attractive characteristics are largely associated with the stabilization of the tetragonal and cubic phases through alloying with aliovalent ions. The large concentration of vacancies introduced to charge compensate of the aliovalent alloying is responsible for both the exceptionally high ionic conductivity and the unusually low, and temperature independent, thermal conductivity. The high fracture toughness exhibited by many of zirconia ceramics is attributed to the constraint of the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation and its release during crack propagation. In other zirconia ceramics containing the tetragonal phase, the high fracture toughness is associated with ferroelastic domain switching. However, many of these attractive features of zirconia, especially fracture toughness and strength, are compromised after prolonged exposure to water vapor at intermediate temperatures (similar to 30 degrees-300 degrees C) in a process referred to as low-temperature degradation (LTD), and initially identified over two decades ago. This is particularly so for zirconia in biomedical applications, such as hip implants and dental restorations. Less well substantiated is the possibility that the same process can also occur in zirconia used in other applications, for instance, zirconia thermal barrier coatings after long exposure at high temperature. Based on experience with the failure of zirconia femoral heads, as well as studies of LTD, it is shown that many of the problems of LTD can be mitigated by the appropriate choice of alloying and/or process control.

Here, we report the observation of room-temperature electronic conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls in the insulating multiferroic BiFeO3. The origin and nature of the observed conductivity are probed using a combination of conductive atomic force microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and first-principles density functional computations. Our analyses indicate that the conductivity correlates with structurally driven changes in both the electrostatic potential and the local electronic structure, which shows a decrease in the bandgap at the domain wall. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for device applications of such conducting nanoscale features.

The various kinds of new high strength alpha + beta and low-modulus beta-type titanium alloys composed of nontoxic elements, such as Nb, Ta, Zr, etc., are developed for biomedical applications because of the toxicity of alloying elements and lack of mechanical biocompatibility of conventional titanium alloys, such as Ti-6Al-4V.

Graphene/Polyurethane Nanocomposites for Improved Gas Barrier and Electrical Conductivity	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												Recently developed strategies for isolating single-layer carbon sheets from graphite have enabled production of electrically conductive, mechanically robust polymer nanocomposites with enhanced gas barrier performance at extremely low loading. In this article, we present processing, morphology, and properties of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) reinforced with exfoliated graphite. For the first time, we compare carbon sheets exfoliated from graphite oxide (GO) via two different processes: chemical modification (isocyanate treated GO, iGO) and thermal exfoliation (thermally reduced GO, TRG), and three different methods of dispersion: solvent blending, in situ polymerization, and melt compounding. Incorporation of as low as 0.5 wt % of TRG produced electrically conductive TPU. Up to a 10-fold increase in tensile stiffness and 90% decrease in nitrogen permeation of TPU were observed with only 3 wt % iGO, implying a high aspect ratio of exfoliated platelets. Real- and reciprocal-space morphological characterization indicated that solvent-based blending techniques more effectively distribute thin exfoliated sheets in the polymer matrix than melt processing. This observation is in good qualitative agreement with the dispersion level inferred from solid property enhancements. Although also processed in solvents, property increase via in situ polymerization was not as pronounced because of reduced hydrogen bonding in the TPU produced.

Therefore, there is a growing need for testing platforms to rapidly determine the mechanical properties of thin polymer films and coatings. We introduce here an elegant, efficient measurement method that yields the elastic moduli of nanoscale polymer films in a rapid and quantitative manner without the need for expensive equipment or material-specific modelling. The technique exploits a buckling instability that occurs in bilayers consisting of a stiff, thin film coated onto a relatively soft, thick substrate. Using the spacing of these highly periodic wrinkles, we calculate the film's elastic modulus by applying well-established buckling mechanics. We successfully apply this new measurement platform to several systems displaying a wide range of thicknessess (nanometre to micrometre) and moduli (MPa to GPa).

Herein, we demonstrate high-performance supercapacitors by building a three-dimensional (3D) macroporous structure that consists of chemically modified graphene (CMG). These 3D macroporous electrodes, namely, embossed-CMG (e-CMG) films, were fabricated by using polystyrene colloidal particles as a sacrificial template. Furthermore, for further capacitance boost, a thin layer of MnO2 was additionally deposited onto e-CMG. The porous graphene structure with a large surface area facilitates fast ionic transport within the electrode while preserving decent electronic conductivity and thus endows MnO2/e-CMG composite electrodes with excellent electrochemical properties such as a specific capacitance of 389 F/g at 1 A/g and 97.7% capacitance retention upon a current Increase to 35 A/g. Moreover, when the MnO2/e-CMG composite electrode was asymmetrically assembled with an e-CMG electrode, the assembled full cell shows remarkable cell performance: energy density of 44 Wh/kg, power density of 25 kW/kg, and excellent cycle life.

An alternative way to induce a spin torque using an electric current has been proposed based on intrinsic spin-orbit magnetic fields(9,10) and recently realized in a strained low-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor(11). Here we demonstrate that strong magnetic fields can be induced in ferromagnetic metal films lacking structure inversion symmetry through the Rashba effect. Owing to the combination of spin-orbit and exchange interactions, we show that an electric current flowing in the plane of a Co layer with asymmetric Pt and AlO(x) interfaces produces an effective transverse magnetic field of 1 T per 10(8) Acm(-2). Besides its fundamental significance, the high efficiency of this process makes it a realistic candidate for room-temperature spintronic applications.

Microstructural observation revealed that surface structures that can trap air are Important for the preparation of low-sliding-angle surfaces. We have also derived an equation that describes relationship between sliding angles and contact angles on superhydrophobic surfaces with roughness. The results calculated on the basis of this equation agreed well with the experimental ones. Moreover, we have successfully prepared a transparent superhydrophobic film whose sliding angle is similar to 1 degrees for a 7 mg water droplet.

The influence of edge structure on the electronic properties of graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons	NATURE MATERIALS												Graphene shows promise as a future material for nanoelectronics owing to its compatibility with industry-standard lithographic processing, electron mobilities up to 150 times greater than Si and a thermal conductivity twice that of diamond. The electronic structure of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and quantum dots (GQDs) has been predicted to depend sensitively on the crystallographic orientation of their edges; however, the influence of edge structure has not been verified experimentally. Here, we use tunnelling spectroscopy to show that the electronic structure of GNRs and GQDs with 2-20nm lateral dimensions varies on the basis of the graphene edge lattice symmetry. Predominantly zigzag-edge GQDs with 7-8 nm average dimensions are metallic owing to the presence of zigzag edge states. GNRs with a higher fraction of zigzag edges exhibit a smaller energy gap than a predominantly armchair-edge ribbon of similar width, and the magnitudes of the measured GNR energy gaps agree with recent theoretical calculations.																			1476-1122	1476-4660				MAR	2009	8	3					235	242		10.1038/NMAT2378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT2378								19219032					WOS:000263556800024

An experimentally validated bimorph cantilever model for piezoelectric energy harvesting from base excitations	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES												Piezoelectric transduction has received great attention for vibration-to-electric energy conversion over the last five years. A typical piezoelectric energy harvester is a unimorph or a bimorph cantilever located on a vibrating host structure, to generate electrical energy from base excitations. Several authors have investigated modeling of cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvesters under base excitation. The existing mathematical modeling approaches range from elementary single-degree-of-freedom models to approximate distributed parameter solutions in the sense of Rayleigh-Ritz discretization as well as analytical solution attempts with certain simplifications. Recently, the authors have presented the closed-form analytical solution for a unimorph cantilever under base excitation based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumptions. In this paper, the analytical solution is applied to bimorph cantilever configurations with series and parallel connections of piezoceramic layers. The base excitation is assumed to be translation in the transverse direction with a superimposed small rotation. The closed-form steady state response expressions are obtained for harmonic excitations at arbitrary frequencies, which are then reduced to simple but accurate single-mode expressions for modal excitations. The electromechanical frequency response functions (FRFs) that relate the voltage output and vibration response to translational and rotational base accelerations are identified from the multi-mode and single-mode solutions. Experimental validation of the single-mode coupled voltage output and vibration response expressions is presented for a bimorph cantilever with a tip mass. It is observed that the closed-form single-mode FRFs obtained from the analytical solution can successfully predict the coupled system dynamics for a wide range of electrical load resistance. The performance of the bimorph device is analyzed extensively for the short circuit and open circuit resonance frequency excitations and the accuracy of the model is shown in all cases.

The power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells has reached certified values of over 20% in just a few years. However, one of the major hindrances for application of these materials in real-world devices is the performance degradation in humid conditions, leading to a rapid loss of photovoltaic response. Here, we demonstrate that hydrophobic tertiary and quaternary alkyl ammonium cations can be successfully assembled on the perovskite surface as efficient water-resisting layers via a facile surface functionalization technique. Such layers can protect the perovskite film under high relative humidity ( 90 +/- 5%) over 30 days. More importantly, devices based on such films can retain the photovoltaic capacities of bulk perovskites, with power conversion efficiencies over 15%. Improving the humidity tolerance of perovskite materials is a necessary step towards large-scale production of high- performance perovskite-based devices under ambient humidity.

In a solid, phase transitions involve collective atomic displacements, but such atomic processes have so far only been investigated using macroscopic approaches. Here, we show that in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy can be used to follow the structural transformation between semiconducting (2H) and metallic (11) phases in single-layered MoS2, with atomic resolution. The 2H/1T phase transition involves gliding atomic planes of sulphur and/or molybdenum and requires an intermediate phase (a-phase) as a precursor. The migration of two kinds of boundaries (beta- and gamma-boundaries) is also found to be responsible for the growth of the second phase. Furthermore, we show that areas of the 1T phase can be controllably grown in a layer of the 2H phase using an electron beam.

The present work developed a facile in situ method to construct g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free isotype heterojunction with molecular composite precursors with the aim to greatly promote the charge separation. Considering the fact that g-C3N4 samples prepared from urea and thiourea separately have different band structure, the molecular composite precursors of urea and thiourea were treated simultaneously under the same thermal conditions, in situ creating a novel layered g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free heterojunction (g-g CN heterojunction). This synthesis method is facile, economic, and environmentally benign using easily available earth-abundant green precursors. The confirmation of isotype g-g CN heterojunction was based on XRD, HRTEM, valence band XPS, ns-level PL, photocurrent, and EIS measurement. Upon visible-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons transfer from g-C3N4 (thiourea) to g-C3N4 (urea) driven by the conduction band offset of 0.10 eV, whereas the photogenerated holes transfer from g-C3N4 (urea) to g-C3N4 (thiourea) driven by the valence band offset of 0.40 eV. The potential difference between the two g-C3N4 components in the heterojunction is the main driving force for efficient charge separation and transfer. For the removal of NO in air, the g-g CN heterojunction exhibited significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity over g-C3N4 alone and physical mixture of g-C3N4 samples. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of g-g CN isotype heterojunction can be directly ascribed to efficient charge separation and transfer across the heterojunction interface as well as prolonged lifetime of charge carriers. This work demonstrated that rational design and construction of isotype heterojunction could open up a new avenue for the development of new efficient visible-light photocatalysts.
