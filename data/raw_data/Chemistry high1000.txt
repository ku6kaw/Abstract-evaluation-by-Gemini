J	Sheldrick, GM				Sheldrick, George M.			A short history of <i>SHELX</i>	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA A-FOUNDATION AND ADVANCES												An account is given of the development of the SHELX system of computer programs from SHELX-76 to the present day. In addition to identifying useful innovations that have come into general use through their implementation in SHELX, a critical analysis is presented of the less-successful features, missed opportunities and desirable improvements for future releases of the software. An attempt is made to understand how a program originally designed for photographic intensity data, punched cards and computers over 10000 times slower than an average modern personal computer has managed to survive for so long. SHELXL is the most widely used program for small-molecule refinement and SHELXS and SHELXD are often employed for structure solution despite the availability of objectively superior programs. SHELXL also finds a niche for the refinement of macromolecules against high-resolution or twinned data; SHELXPRO acts as an interface for macromolecular applications. SHELXC, SHELXD and SHELXE are proving useful for the experimental phasing of macromolecules, especially because they are fast and robust and so are often employed in pipelines for high-throughput phasing. This paper could serve as a general literature citation when one or more of the open-source SHELX programs (and the Bruker AXS version SHELXTL) are employed in the course of a crystal-structure determination.																			2053-2733					JAN	2008	64		1				112	122		10.1107/S0108767307043930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0108767307043930								18156677					WOS:000251924000011
J	Sheldrick, GM				Sheldrick, George M.			Crystal structure refinement with <i>SHELXL</i>	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION C-STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY												The improvements in the crystal structure refinement program SHELXL have been closely coupled with the development and increasing importance of the CIF (Crystallographic Information Framework) format for validating and archiving crystal structures. An important simplification is that now only one file in CIF format (for convenience, referred to simply as 'a CIF') containing embedded reflection data and SHELXL instructions is needed for a complete structure archive; the program SHREDCIF can be used to extract the .hkl and .ins files required for further refinement with SHELXL. Recent developments in SHELXL facilitate refinement against neutron diffraction data, the treatment of H atoms, the determination of absolute structure, the input of partial structure factors and the refinement of twinned and disordered structures. SHELXL is available free to academics for the Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems, and is particularly suitable for multiple-core processors.																			2053-2296					JAN	2015	71		1				3	8		10.1107/S2053229614024218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2053229614024218								25537383					WOS:000347804100002
J	Geim, AK; Novoselov, KS				Geim, A. K.; Novoselov, K. S.			The rise of graphene	NATURE MATERIALS												Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.

Chimera is segmented into a core that provides basic services and visualization, and extensions that provide most higher level functionality. This architecture ensures that the extension mechanism satisfies the demands of outside developers who wish to incorporate new features. Two unusual extensions are presented: Multiscale, which adds the ability to visualize large-scale molecular assemblies such as viral coats, and Collaboratory, which allows researchers to share a Chimera session interactively despite being at separate locales. Other extensions include Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future directions. Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to academic and nonprofit users, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, SGI IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/.

J	Grimme, S; Antony, J; Ehrlich, S; Krieg, H				Grimme, Stefan; Antony, Jens; Ehrlich, Stephan; Krieg, Helge			A consistent and accurate ab initio parametrization of density functional dispersion correction (DFT-D) for the 94 elements H-Pu	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C-6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.

J	Lu, T; Chen, FW				Lu, Tian; Chen, Feiwu			Multiwfn: A multifunctional wavefunction analyzer	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												Multiwfn is a multifunctional program for wavefunction analysis. Its main functions are: (1) Calculating and visualizing real space function, such as electrostatic potential and electron localization function at point, in a line, in a plane or in a spatial scope. (2) Population analysis. (3) Bond order analysis. (4) Orbital composition analysis. (5) Plot density-of-states and spectrum. (6) Topology analysis for electron density. Some other useful utilities involved in quantum chemistry studies are also provided. The built-in graph module enables the results of wavefunction analysis to be plotted directly or exported to high-quality graphic file. The program interface is very user-friendly and suitable for both research and teaching purpose. The code of Multiwfn is substantially optimized and parallelized. Its efficiency is demonstrated to be significantly higher than related programs with the same functions. Five practical examples involving a wide variety of systems and analysis methods are given to illustrate the usefulness of Multiwfn. The program is free of charge and open-source.

J	Grimme, S				Grimme, Stefan			Semiempirical GGA-type density functional constructed with a long-range dispersion correction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C-6 . R-6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group 11 element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol(-1). The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C-6 . R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.

The latter were obtained by (partly) modifying bases developed previously. A large set of more than 300 molecules representing (nearly) all elements - except lanthanides - in their common oxidation states was used to assess the quality of the bases all across the periodic table. Quantities investigated were atomization energies, dipole moments and structure parameters for Hartree-Fock, density functional theory and correlated methods, for which we had chosen Moller-Plesset perturbation theory as an example. Finally recommendations are given which type of basis set is used best for a certain level of theory and a desired quality of results.

J	Spek, AL				Spek, AL			Single-crystal structure validation with the program <i>PLATON</i>	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY												The results of a single-crystal structure determination when in CIF format can now be validated routinely by automatic procedures. In this way, many errors in published papers can be avoided. The validation software generates a set of ALERTS detailing issues to be addressed by the experimenter, author, referee and publication journal. Validation was pioneered by the IUCr journal Acta Crystallographica Section C and is currently standard procedure for structures submitted for publication in all IUCr journals. The implementation of validation procedures by other journals is in progress. This paper describes the concepts of validation and the classes of checks that are carried out by the program PLATON as part of the IUCr checkCIF facility. PLATON validation can be run at any stage of the structure refinement, independent of the structure determination package used, and is recommended for use as a routine tool during or at least at the completion of every structure determination. Two examples are discussed where proper validation procedures could have avoided the publication of incorrect structures that had serious consequences for the chemistry involved.																			1600-5767					FEB	2003	36		1				7	13		10.1107/S0021889802022112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0021889802022112													WOS:000180457300002

The novel phasing algorithms implemented in Phaser have been developed using maximum likelihood and multivariate statistics. For molecular replacement, the new algorithms have proved to be significantly better than traditional methods in discriminating correct solutions from noise, and for single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experimental phasing, the new algorithms, which account for correlations between F+ and F-, give better phases (lower mean phase error with respect to the phases given by the refined structure) than those that use mean F and anomalous differences Delta F. One of the design concepts of Phaser was that it be capable of a high degree of automation. To this end, Phaser (written in C++) can be called directly from Python, although it can also be called using traditional CCP4 keyword-style input.

The M06 functional is parametrized including both transition metals and nonmetals, whereas the M06-2X functional is a high-nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X), and it is parametrized only for nonmetals. The functionals, along with the previously published M06-L local functional and the M06-HF full-Hartree-Fock functionals, constitute the M06 suite of complementary functionals. We assess these four functionals by comparing their performance to that of 12 other functionals and Hartree-Fock theory for 403 energetic data in 29 diverse databases, including ten databases for thermochemistry, four databases for kinetics, eight databases for noncovalent interactions, three databases for transition metal bonding, one database for metal atom excitation energies, and three databases for molecular excitation energies. We also illustrate the performance of these 17 methods for three databases containing 40 bond lengths and for databases containing 38 vibrational frequencies and 15 vibrational zero point energies. We recommend the M06-2X functional for applications involving main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, noncovalent interactions, and electronic excitation energies to valence and Rydberg states. We recommend the M06 functional for application in organometallic and inorganometallic chemistry and for noncovalent interactions.

J	Wang, JM; Wolf, RM; Caldwell, JW; Kollman, PA; Case, DA				Wang, JM; Wolf, RM; Caldwell, JW; Kollman, PA; Case, DA			Development and testing of a general amber force field	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Angstrom, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Angstrom) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Angstrom, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 A and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Angstrom and 1.18 kcal/mol. respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field.

Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation toolkit GROMACS which now both achieves extremely high performance on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines. The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs; for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.					van der Spoel, David/A-5471-2008; Lindahl, Erik/D-4590-2013	Lindahl, Erik/0000-0002-2734-2794; Hess, Berk/0000-0002-7498-7763													1549-9618	1549-9626				MAR	2008	4	3					435	447		10.1021/ct700301q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ct700301q								26620784					WOS:000254277900007

The information content of the CSD, together with methods for data acquisition, processing and validation, are summarized, with particular emphasis on the chemical information added by CSD editors. Nearly 80% of new structural data arrives electronically, mostly in CIF format, and the CCDC acts as the official crystal structure data depository for 51 major journals. The CCDC now maintains both a CIF archive (more than 73000 CIFs dating from 1996), as well as the distributed binary CSD archive; the availability of data in both archives is discussed.

In this approach the velocities of all the particles are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling.

Chai and M. Head-Gordon, J. Chem. Phys., 2008, 128, 084106] to include empirical atom-atom dispersion corrections. The resulting functional, omega B97X-D yields satisfactory accuracy for thermochemistry, kinetics, and non-covalent interactions. Tests show that for non-covalent systems, omega B97X-D shows slight improvement over other empirical dispersion-corrected density functionals, while for covalent systems and kinetics it performs noticeably better. Relative to our previous functionals, such as omega B97X, the new functional is significantly superior for non-bonded interactions, and very similar in performance for bonded interactions.

J	Grimme, S; Ehrlich, S; Goerigk, L				Grimme, Stefan; Ehrlich, Stephan; Goerigk, Lars			Effect of the Damping Function in Dispersion Corrected Density Functional Theory	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard "zero-damping" formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional.

Here we establish that such dynamic structural complexity in a prototypical two-dimensional lead iodide perovskite gives rise to the coexistence of diverse excitonic resonances, each with a distinct degree of polaronic character. By means of high-resolution resonant impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy, we identify vibrational wavepacket dynamics that evolve along different configurational coordinates for distinct excitons and photocarriers. Employing density functional theory calculations, we assign the observed coherent vibrational modes to various low-frequency (less than or similar to 50 cm(-1)) optical phonons involving motion in the lead iodide layers. We thus conclude that different excitons induce specific lattice reorganizations, which are signatures of polaronic binding. This insight into the energetic/configurational landscape involving globally neutral primary photoexcitations may be relevant to a broader class of emerging hybrid semiconductor materials.

Improved Synthesis of Graphene Oxide	ACS NANO												An improved method for the preparation of graphene oxide (GO) is described. Currently, Hummers' method (KMnO4, NaNO3, H2SO4) is the most common method used for preparing graphene oxide. We have found that excluding the NaNO3, increasing the amount of KMnO4, and performing the reaction in a 9:1 mixture of H2SO4/H3PO4 improves the efficiency of the oxidation process. This improved method provides a greater amount of hydrophilic oxidized graphene material as compared to Hummers' method or Hummers' method with additional KMnO4. Moreover, even though the GO produced by our method is more oxidized than that prepared by Hummers' method, when both are reduced in the same chamber with hydrazine, chemically converted graphene (CCG) produced from this new method is equivalent in its electrical conductivity. In contrast to Hummers' method, the new method does not generate toxic gas and the temperature is easily controlled. This improved synthesis of GO may be important for large-scale production of GO as well as the construction of devices composed of the subsequent CCG.

We used that method in combination with detailed density functional calculations to develop a detailed description of the free-energy landscape of the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction over Pt(111) as a function of applied bias. This allowed us to identify the origin of the overpotential found for this reaction. Adsorbed oxygen and hydroxyl are found to be very stable intermediates at potentials close to equilibrium, and the calculated rate constant for the activated proton/electron transfer to adsorbed oxygen or hydroxyl can account quantitatively for the observed kinetics. On the basis of a database of calculated oxygen and hydroxyl adsorption energies, the trends in the oxygen reduction rate for a large number of different transition and noble metals can be accounted for. Alternative reaction mechanisms involving proton/electron transfer to adsorbed molecular oxygen were also considered, and this peroxide mechanism was found to dominate for the most noble metals.

The Cambridge Structural Database	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION B-STRUCTURAL SCIENCE CRYSTAL ENGINEERING AND MATERIALS												The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) contains a complete record of all published organic and metal-organic small-molecule crystal structures. The database has been in operation for over 50 years and continues to be the primary means of sharing structural chemistry data and knowledge across disciplines. As well as structures that are made public to support scientific articles, it includes many structures published directly as CSD Communications. All structures are processed both computationally and by expert structural chemistry editors prior to entering the database. A key component of this processing is the reliable association of the chemical identity of the structure studied with the experimental data. This important step helps ensure that data is widely discoverable and readily reusable. Content is further enriched through selective inclusion of additional experimental data. Entries are available to anyone through free CSD community web services. Linking services developed and maintained by the CCDC, combined with the use of standard identifiers, facilitate discovery from other resources. Data can also be accessed through CCDC and third party software applications and through an application programming interface.

When the MoS2 crystal is thinned to monolayer, however, a strong photoluminescence emerges, indicating an indirect to direct bandgap transition in this d-electron system.

J	Goodenough, JB; Park, KS				Goodenough, John B.; Park, Kyu-Sung			The Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery: A Perspective	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Each cell of a battery stores electrical energy as chemical energy in two electrodes, a reductant (anode) and an oxidant (cathode), separated by an electrolyte that transfers the ionic component of the chemical reaction inside the cell and forces the electronic component outside the battery. The output on discharge is an external electronic current I at a voltage V for a time Delta t. The chemical reaction of a rechargeable battery must be reversible on the application of a charging I and V. Critical parameters of a rechargeable battery are safety, density of energy that can be stored at a specific power input and retrieved at a specific power output, cycle and shelf life, storage efficiency, and cost of fabrication. Conventional ambient-temperature rechargeable batteries have solid electrodes and a liquid electrolyte. The positive electrode (cathode) consists of a host framework into which the mobile (working) cation is inserted reversibly over a finite solid solution range. The solid solution range, which is reduced at higher current by the rate of transfer of the working ion across electrode/electrolyte interfaces and within a host, limits the amount of charge per electrode formula unit that can be transferred over the time Delta t = Delta t(I). Moreover, the difference between energies of the LUMO and the HOMO of the electrolyte, i.e., electrolyte window, determines the maximum voltage for a long shelf and cycle life. The maximum stable voltage with an aqueous electrolyte is 1.5 V; the Li-ion rechargeable battery uses an organic electrolyte with a larger window, which increase the density of stored energy for a given Delta t. Anode or cathode electrochemical potentials outside the electrolyte window can increase V, but they require formation of a passivating surface layer that must be permeable to Li+ and capable of adapting rapidly to the changing electrode surface area as the electrode changes volume during cycling. A passivating surface layer adds to the impedance of the Li+ transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface and lowers the cycle life of a battery cell. Moreover, formation of a passivation layer on the anode robs Li from the cathode irreversibly on an initial charge, further lowering the reversible Delta t. These problems plus the cost of quality control of manufacturing plague development of Li-ion rechargeable batteries that can compete with the internal combustion engine for powering electric cars and that can provide the needed low-cost storage of electrical energy generated by renewable wind and/or solar energy. Chemists are contributing to incremental improvements of the conventional strategy by investigating and controlling electrode passivation layers, improving the rate of Li+ transfer across electrode/electrolyte interfaces, identifying electrolytes with larger windows while retaining a Li+ conductivity sigma(Li) > 10(-3) S cm(-1), synthesizing electrode morphologies that reduce the size of the active particles while pinning them on current collectors of large surface area accessible by the electrolyte, lowering the cost of cell fabrication, designing displacement-reaction anodes of higher capacity that allow a safe, fast charge, and designing alternative cathode hosts. However, new strategies are needed for batteries that go beyond powering hand-held devices, such as using electrode hosts with two-electron redox centers; replacing the cathode hosts by materials that undergo displacement reactions (e.g. sulfur) by liquid cathodes that may contain flow-through redox molecules, or by catalysts for air cathodes; and developing a solid electrolyte separator membrane that allows an organic and aqueous liquid electrolyte on the anode and cathode sides, respectively. Opportunities exist for the chemist to bring together oxide and polymer or graphene chemistry in imaginative morphologies.

Here a novel regiospecific copper(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of terminal alkynes to azides on solid-phase is reported. Primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl azides, aryl azides, and an azido sugar were used successfully in the copper(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition producing diversely 1,4-substituted [1,2,3]-triazoles in peptide backbones or side chains. The reaction conditions were fully compatible with solid-phase peptide synthesis on polar supports. The copper(I) catalysis is mild and efficient (> 95% conversion and purity in most cases) and furthermore, the X-ray structure of 2-azido-2-methylpropanoic acid has been solved, to yield structural information on the 1,3-dipoles entering the reaction.

PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.

The Amber ff99SB force field improved protein secondary structure balance and dynamics from earlier force fields like ff99, but weaknesses in side chain rotamer and backbone secondary structure preferences have been identified. Here, we performed a complete refit of all amino acid side chain dihedral parameters, which had been carried over from ff94. The training set of conformations included multidimensional dihedral scans designed to improve transferability of the parameters. Improvement in all amino acids was obtained as compared to ff99SB. Parameters wer also generated for alternate protonation states of ionizable side chains. Average errors in relative energies of pairs of conformations were under 1.0 kcal/mol as compared to QM, reduced 35% from ff99SB. We also took the opportunity to make empirical adjustments to the protein backbone dihedral parameters as compared to ff99SB. Multiple small adjustments of phi and psi parameters were tested against NMR scalar coupling data and secondary structure content for short peptides. The best results were obtained from a physically motivated adjustment to the phi rotational profile that compensates for lack of ff99SB QM training data in the beta-ppII transition region. Together, these backbone and side chain modifications (hereafter called ff14SB) not only better reproduced their benchmarks, but also improved secondary structure content in small peptides and reproduction of NMR chi 1 scalar coupling measurements for proteins in solution. We also discuss the Amber ff12SB parameter set, a preliminary version of ff14SB that includes most of its improvements.

Detection of individual gas molecules adsorbed on graphene	NATURE MATERIALS												The ultimate aim of any detection method is to achieve such a level of sensitivity that individual quanta of a measured entity can be resolved. In the case of chemical sensors, the quantum is one atom or molecule. Such resolution has so far been beyond the reach of any detection technique, including solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity(1-4). The fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due to thermal motion of charges and defects(5), which lead to intrinsic noise exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many orders of magnitude. Here, we show that micrometre-size sensors made from graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule attaches to or detaches from graphene's surface. The adsorbed molecules change the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic field or mechanical strain are required.

Nanocrystals of Cesium Lead Halide Perovskites (CsPbX<sub>3</sub>, X = Cl, Br, and I): Novel Optoelectronic Materials Showing Bright Emission with Wide Color Gamut	NANO LETTERS												Metal halides perovskites, such as hybrid organic-inorganic CH3NH3PbI3, are newcomer optoelectronic materials that have attracted enormous attention as solution-deposited absorbing layers in solar cells with power conversion efficiencies reaching 20%. Herein we demonstrate a new avenue for halide perovskites by designing highly luminescent perovskite-based colloidal quantum dot materials. We have synthesized monodisperse colloidal nanocubes (4-15 nm edge lengths) of fully inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I or mixed halide systems Cl/Br and Br/I) using inexpensive commercial precursors. Through compositional modulations and quantum size-effects, the bandgap energies and emission spectra are readily tunable over the entire visible spectral region of 410-700 nm. The photoluminescence of CsPbX3 nanocrystals is characterized by narrow emission line-widths of 12-42 nm, wide color gamut covering up to 140% of the NTSC color standard, high quantum yields of up to 90%, and radiative lifetimes in the range of 1-29 ns. The compelling combination of enhanced optical properties and chemical robustness makes CsPbX3 nanocrystals appealing for optoelectronic applications, particularly for blue and green spectral regions (410-530 nm), where typical metal chalcogenide-based quantum dots suffer from photodegradation.

Avogadro: an advanced semantic chemical editor, visualization, and analysis platform	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS												Background: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. Results: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. Conclusions: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

Particular attention is devoted to large systems requiring suitable iterative algorithms to compute the solvation charges: the fast multipole method (FMM) has been extensively used to ensure a linear scaling of the computational times with the size of the solute.

We develop an approach to detect noncovalent interactions in real space, based on the electron density and its derivatives. Our approach reveals the underlying chemistry that compliments the covalent structure. It provides a rich representation of van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and steric repulsion in small molecules, molecular complexes, and solids. Most importantly, the method, requiring only knowledge of the atomic coordinates, is efficient and applicable to large systems, such as proteins or DNA. Across these applications, a view of nonbonded interactions emerges as continuous surfaces rather than close contacts between atom pairs, offering rich insight into the design of new and improved ligands.

It combines the hybrid qualities of B3LYP and the long-range correction presented by Tawada et al. [J. Chem. Phys., in press]. We demonstrate that CAM-B3LYP yields atomization energies of similar quality to those from B3LYP, while also performing well for charge transfer excitations in a dipeptide model, which B3LYP underestimates enormously. The CAM-B3LYP functional comprises of 0.19 Hartree-Fock (HF) plus 0.81 Becke 1988 (1388) exchange interaction at short-range, and 0.65 HF plus 0.35 B88 at long-range.

PACKMOL: A Package for Building Initial Configurations for Molecular Dynamics Simulations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules Must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining Such a molecular arrangement can be considered it packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules Must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms. grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straight forward. In addition. different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in Such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements call be built, as micelles. lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies front a few seconds to a few Minutes in a personal Computer.

Resolving surface chemical states in XPS analysis of first row transition metals, oxides and hydroxides: Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												Chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of first row transition metals and their oxides and hydroxides is challenging due to the complexity of their 2p spectra resulting from peak asymmetries, complex multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structure, and uncertain, overlapping binding energies. Our previous paper [M. C. Biesinger et al., Appl. Surf. Sci. 257 (2010) 887-898.] in which we examined Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn species, has shown that all the values of the spectral fitting parameters for each specific species, i.e. binding energy (eV), full wide at half maximum (FWHM) value (eV) for each pass energy, spin-orbit splitting values and asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, are not all normally provided in the literature and data bases, and are necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis. A more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve fitting was developed based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of literature references and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. This paper extends this approach to the chemical states of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni metals, and various oxides and hydroxides where intense, complex multiplet splitting in many of the chemical states of these elements poses unique difficulties for chemical state analysis. The curve fitting procedures proposed use the same criteria as proposed previously but with the additional complexity of fitting of multiplet split spectra which has been done based on spectra of numerous reference materials and theoretical XPS modeling of these transition metal species. Binding energies, FWHM values, asymmetric peak shape fitting parameters, multiplet peak separation and peak area percentages are presented. The procedures developed can be utilized to remove uncertainties in the analysis of surface states in nano-particles, corrosion, catalysis and surface-engineered materials. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Assessment of a long-range corrected hybrid functional	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Common approximate exchange-correlation functionals suffer from self-interaction error, and as a result, their corresponding potentials have incorrect asymptotic behavior. The exact asymptote can be imposed by introducing range separation into the exchange component and replacing the long-range portion of the approximate exchange by the Hartree-Fock counterpart. The authors show that this long-range correction works particularly well in combination with the short-range variant of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange functional. This long-range-corrected hybrid, here denoted LC-omega PBE, is remarkably accurate for a broad range of molecular properties, such as thermochemistry, barrier heights of chemical reactions, bond lengths, and most notably, description of processes involving long-range charge transfer.

For each element only one auxiliary basis set is needed to approximate Coulomb energies in conjunction with orbital basis sets of split valence, triple zeta valence and quadruple zeta valence quality with errors of typically below ca. 0.15 kJ mol(-1) per atom; this was demonstrated in conjunction with the recently developed orbital basis sets of types def2-SV(P), def2-TZVP and def2-QZVPP for a large set of small molecules representing (nearly) each element in all of its common oxidation states. These auxiliary bases are slightly more than three times larger than orbital bases of split valence quality. Compared to non-approximated treatments, computation times for the Coulomb part are reduced by a factor of ca. 8 for def2-SV(P) orbital bases, ca. 25 for def2-TZVP and ca. 100 for def2-QZVPP orbital bases.

It includes tools for editing, displaying, analyzing, converting, and animating molecular systems. A conformational search tool is implemented using a molecular mechanics or a semiempirical potential. Input files can be generated for the computational chemistry software supported by Gabedit. Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly from the output of the computational chemistry programs; others are calculated by Gabedit before display. Molecular orbitals, electron density, electrostatic potential, nuclear magnetic resonance shielding density, and any other volumetric data properties can be displayed. It can display electronic circular dichroism, UV-visible, infrared, and Raman-computed spectra after a convolution. Gabedit can generate a Povray file for geometry, surfaces, contours, and color-coded planes. Output can be exported to a selection of popular image and vector graphics file formats; the program can also generate a series of pictures for animation. Quantum mechanical electrostatic potentials can be calculated using the partial charges on atoms, or by solving the Poisson equation using the multigrid method. The atoms in molecule charges can also be calculated. Gabedit is platform independent.

Open Babel: An open chemical toolbox	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS												Background: A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats. Results: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion. Conclusions: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry.

Their unique properties are based on the molecular-scale porous character. However, a principal limitation of zeolites and similar oxide-based materials is the relatively small size of the pores, typically in the range of medium-sized molecules, limiting their use in pharmaceutical and fine chemical applications. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) provided a breakthrough in this respect. New MOFs appear at a high and an increasing pace, but the appearances of new, stable inorganic building bricks are rare. Here we present a new zirconium-based inorganic building brick that allows the synthesis of very high surface area MOFs with unprecedented stability. The high stability is based on the combination of strong Zr-O bonds and the ability of the inner Zr-6-cluster to rearrange reversibly upon removal or addition of mu(3)-OH groups, without any changes in the connecting carboxylates. The weak thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of most MOFs is probably the most important property that limits their use in large scale industrial applications. The Zr-MOFs presented in this work have the toughness needed for industrial applications; decomposition temperature above 500 degrees C and resistance to most chemicals, and they remain crystalline even after exposure to 10 tons/cm(2) of external pressure.					; Bordiga, Silvia/M-3875-2014; Lamberti, Carlo/C-5901-2013	Hafizovic Cavka, Jasmina/0000-0002-9809-7335; Bordiga, Silvia/0000-0003-2371-4156; Lamberti, Carlo/0000-0001-8004-2312; Olsbye, Unni/0000-0003-3693-2857; Lillerud, Karl Petter/0000-0001-7692-1701													0002-7863					OCT 22	2008	130	42					13850	13851		10.1021/ja8057953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja8057953								18817383					WOS:000260047700020

Phosphorene: An Unexplored 2D Semiconductor with a High Hole Mobility	ACS NANO												We introduce the 2D counterpart of layered black phosphorus, which we call phosphorene, as an unexplored p-type semiconducting material. Same as graphene and MoS2, single-layer phosphorene is flexible and can be mechanically exfoliated. We find phosphorene to be stable and, unlike graphene, to have an inherent, direct, and appreciable band gap. Our ab initio calculations indicate that the band gap is direct, depends on the number of layers and the in-layer strain, and is significantly larger than the bulk value of 0.31-036 eV. The observed photoluminescence peak of single-layer phosphorene in the visible optical range confirms that the band gap is larger than that of the bulk system. Our transport studies indicate a hole mobility that reflects the structural anisotropy of phosphorene and complements n-type MoS2. At room temperature, our few-layer phosphorene field-effect transistors with 1.0 mu m channel length display a high on-current of 194 mA/mm, a high hole field-effect mobility of 286 cm(2) N.s, and an on/off ratio of up to 10(4). We demonstrate the possibility of phosphorene integration by constructing a 2D CMOS inverter consisting of phosphorene PMOS and MoS2 NMOS transistors.

The phenomenon now known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect fur lipid and macromolecular agents has been observed to be universal in solid tumors. Primarily, enhanced vascular permeability will sustain an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen for rapid tumor growth. The EPR effect also provides a great opportunity for more selective targeting of lipid- or polymer-conjugated anticancer drugs, such as SMANCS and PK-1, to the turner. In the present review, the basic characteristics of the EPR effect, particularly the factors involved, are described, as well as its modulation for improving delivery of macromolecular drugs to the tumor. Tumor-specific vascular physiology is also described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Benchmarking Heterogeneous Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Objective evaluation of the activity of electrocatalysts for water oxidation is of fundamental importance for the development of promising energy conversion technologies including integrated solar water-splitting devices, water electrolyzers, and Li-air batteries. However, current methods employed to evaluate oxygen-evolving catalysts are not standardized, making it difficult to compare the activity and stability of these materials. We report a protocol for evaluating the activity, stability, and Faradaic efficiency of electro-deposited oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts. In particular, we focus on methods for determining electrochemically active surface area and measuring electrocatalytic activity and stability under conditions relevant to an integrated solar water-splitting device. Our primary figure of merit is the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) per geometric area, approximately the current density expected for a 10% efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device. Utilizing the aforementioned surface area measurements, one can determine electrocatalyst turnover frequencies. The reported protocol was used to examine the oxygen-evolution activity of the following systems in acidic and alkaline solutions: CoOx, CoPi, CoFeOx, NiOx, NiCeOx, NiCoOx, NiCuOx, NiFeOx, and NiLaOx. The oxygen-evolving activity of an electrodeposited IrOx catalyst was also investigated for comparison. Two general observations are made from comparing the catalytic performance of the OER catalysts investigated: (1) in alkaline solution, every non-noble metal system achieved 10 mA cm(-2) current densities at similar operating overpotentials between 0.35 and 0.43 V, and (2) every system but IrOx was unstable under oxidative conditions in acidic solutions.

J	Sheldrick, GM				Sheldrick, George M.			<i>SHELXT</i> - Integrated space-group and crystal-structure determination	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA A-FOUNDATION AND ADVANCES												The new computer program SHELXT employs a novel dual-space algorithm to solve the phase problem for single-crystal reflection data expanded to the space group P1. Missing data are taken into account and the resolution extended if necessary. All space groups in the specified Laue group are tested to find which are consistent with the P1 phases. After applying the resulting origin shifts and space-group symmetry, the solutions are subject to further dual-space recycling followed by a peak search and summation of the electron density around each peak. Elements are assigned to give the best fit to the integrated peak densities and if necessary additional elements are considered. An isotropic refinement is followed for non-centrosymmetric space groups by the calculation of a Flack parameter and, if appropriate, inversion of the structure. The structure is assembled to maximize its connectivity and centred optimally in the unit cell. SHELXT has already solved many thousand structures with a high success rate, and is optimized for multiprocessor computers. It is, however, unsuitable for severely disordered and twinned structures because it is based on the assumption that the structure consists of atoms.																			2053-2733					JAN	2015	71		1				3	8		10.1107/S2053273314026370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2053273314026370													WOS:000350545100002

Catalysts with single-atom dispersions are thus highly desirable to maximize atom efficiency, but making them is challenging. Here we report the synthesis of a single-atom catalyst that consists of only isolated single Pt atoms anchored to the surfaces of iron oxide nanocrystallites. This single-atom catalyst has extremely high atom efficiency and shows excellent stability and high activity for both CO oxidation and preferential oxidation of CO in H-2. Density functional theory calculations show that the high catalytic activity correlates with the partially vacant 5d orbitals of the positively charged, high-valent Pt atoms, which help to reduce both the CO adsorption energy and the activation barriers for CO oxidation.

A highly ordered nanostructured carbon-sulphur cathode for lithium-sulphur batteries	NATURE MATERIALS												The Li-S battery has been under intense scrutiny for over two decades, as it offers the possibility of high gravimetric capacities and theoretical energy densities ranging up to a factor of five beyond conventional Li-ion systems. Herein, we report the feasibility to approach such capacities by creating highly ordered interwoven composites. The conductive mesoporous carbon framework precisely constrains sulphur nanofiller growth within its channels and generates essential electrical contact to the insulating sulphur. The structure provides access to Li+ ingress/egress for reactivity with the sulphur, and we speculate that the kinetic inhibition to diffusion within the framework and the sorption properties of the carbon aid in trapping the polysulphides formed during redox. Polymer modification of the carbon surface further provides a chemical gradient that retards diffusion of these large anions out of the electrode, thus facilitating more complete reaction. Reversible capacities up to 1,320m Ah g(-1) are attained. The assembly process is simple and broadly applicable, conceptually providing new opportunities for materials scientists for tailored design that can be extended to many different electrode materials.

The DSC is currently the most efficient(2) and stable(3) excitonic photocell. Central to this device is a thick nanoparticle film that provides a large surface area for the adsorption of light-harvesting molecules. However, nanoparticle DSCs rely on trap-limited diffusion for electron transport, a slow mechanism that can limit device efficiency, especially at longer wavelengths. Here we introduce a version of the dye-sensitized cell in which the traditional nanoparticle film is replaced by a dense array of oriented, crystalline ZnO nanowires. The nanowire anode is synthesized by mild aqueous chemistry and features a surface area up to one-fifth as large as a nanoparticle cell. The direct electrical pathways provided by the nanowires ensure the rapid collection of carriers generated throughout the device, and a full Sun efficiency of 1.5% is demonstrated, limited primarily by the surface area of the nanowire array.

Polymer solar cells have shown potential to harness solar energy in a cost-effective way. Significant efforts are underway to improve their efficiency to the level of practical applications. Here, we report highly efficient polymer solar cells based on a bulk heterojunction of polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) and methanofullerene. Controlling the active layer growth rate results in an increased hole mobility and balanced charge transport. Together with increased absorption in the active layer, this results in much-improved device performance, particularly in external quantum efficiency. The power-conversion efficiency of 4.4% achieved here is the highest published so far for polymer-based solar cells. The solution process involved ensures that the fabrication cost remains low and the processing is simple. The high efficiency achieved in this work brings these devices one step closer to commercialization.

Despite tremendous efforts, developing oxygen electrode catalysts with high activity at low cost remains a great challenge. Here, we report a hybrid material consisting of Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on reduced graphene oxide as a high-performance bi-functional catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although Co3O4 or graphene oxide alone has little catalytic activity, their hybrid exhibits an unexpected, surprisingly high ORR activity that is further enhanced by nitrogen doping of graphene. The Co3O4/N-doped graphene hybrid exhibits similar catalytic activity but superior stability to Pt in alkaline solutions. The same hybrid is also highly active for OER, making it a high-performance non-precious metal-based bi-catalyst for both ORR and OER.

NANO ENERGY												Charges induced in triboelectric process are usually referred as a negative effect either in scientific research or technological applications, and they are wasted energy in many cases. Here, we demonstrate a simple, low cost and effective approach of using the charging process in friction to convert mechanical energy into electric power for driving small electronics. The triboelectric generator (TEG) is fabricated by stacking two polymer sheets made of materials having distinctly different triboelectric characteristics, with metal films deposited on the top and bottom of the assembled structure. Once subjected to mechanical deformation, a friction between the two films, owing to the nano-scale surface roughness, generates equal amount but opposite signs of charges at two sides. Thus, a triboelectric potential layer is formed at the interface region, which serves as a charge "pump" for driving the flow of electrons in the external toad if there is a variation in the capacitance of the system. Such a flexible polymer TEG gives an output voltage of up to 3.3 V at a power density of similar to 10.4 mW/cm(3). TEGs have the potential of harvesting energy from human activities, rotating tires, ocean waves, mechanical vibration and more, with great applications in self-powered systems for personal electronics, environmental monitoring, medical science and even large-scale power.

These unique properties provide the potential of designing novel optically active reagents for simultaneous molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. It is desirable to use agents that are active in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the radiation spectrum to minimize the light extinction by intrinsic chromophores in native tissue. Gold nanorods with suitable aspect ratios (length divided by width) can absorb and scatter strongly in the NIR region (650-900 nm). In the present work, we provide an in vitro demonstration of gold nanorods as novel contrast agents for both molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. Nanorods are synthesized and conjugated to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibodies and incubated in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCat) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). The anti-EGFR anti body-conjugated nanorods bind specifically to the surface of the malignant-type cells with a much higher affinity due to the overexpressed EGFR on the cytoplasmic membrane of the malignant cells. As a result of the strongly scattered red light from gold nanorods in dark field, observed using a laboratory microscope, the malignant cells are clearly visualized and diagnosed from the nonmalignant cells. It is found that, after exposure to continuous red laser at 800 nm, malignant cells require about half the laser energy to be photothermally destroyed than the nonmalignant cells. Thus, both efficient cancer cell diagnostics and selective photothermal therapy are realized at the same time.

ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as R-ij --> 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.

In the present article, an extension of the CHARMM force field to drug-like molecules is presented. The resulting CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) covers a wide range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules, including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds. The parametrization philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it possible to perform "all-CHARMM" simulations on drug-target interactions thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant systems.

J	Matuszewski, BK; Constanzer, ML; Chavez-Eng, CM				Matuszewski, BK; Constanzer, ML; Chavez-Eng, CM			Strategies for the assessment of matrix effect in quantitative bioanalytical methods based on HPLC-MS/MS	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												In recent years, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) detection has been demonstrated to be a powerful technique for the quantitative determination of drugs and metabolites in biological fluids. However, the common and early perception that utilization of HPLC-MS/MS practically guarantees selectivity is being challenged by a number of reported examples of lack of selectivity due to ion suppression or enhancement caused by the sample matrix and interferences from metabolites. In light of these serious method liabilities, questions about how to develop and validate reliable HPLC-MS/MS methods, especially for supporting long-term human pharmacokinetic studies, are being raised. The central issue is what experiments, in addition to the validation data usually provided for the conventional bioanalytical methods, need to be conducted to confirm HPLC-MS/MS assay selectivity and reliability. The current regulatory requirements include the need for the assessment and elimination of the matrix effect in the bioanalytical. methods, but the experimental procedures necessary to assess the matrix effect are not detailed. Practical, experimental approaches for studying, identifying, and eliminating the effect of matrix on the results of quantitative analyses by HPLC-MS/MS are described in this paper. Using as an example a set of validation experiments performed for one of our investigational new drug candidates, the concepts of the quantitative assessment of the "absolute" versus "relative" matrix effect are introduced. In addition, experiments for the determination of, the "true" recovery of analytes using HPLC-MS/MS are described eliminating the uncertainty about the effect of matrix on the determination of this commonly measured method parameter. Determination of the matrix effect allows the assessment of the reliability and selectivity of an existing HPLC-MS/MS method. If the results of these studies are not satisfactory, the parameters determined may provide a guide to what changes in the method need to be made to improve assay selectivity. In addition, a direct comparison of the extent of the matrix effect using two different interfaces (a heated nebulizer, HN, and ion spray, ISP) under otherwise the same sample preparation and chromatographic conditions was made. It was demonstrated that, for the investigational drug under study, the matrix effect was clearly observed when ISP interface was utilized but it was absent when the HN interface was employed.																			0003-2700					JUL 1	2003	75	13					3019	3030		10.1021/ac020361s	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac020361s								12964746					WOS:000183975300017
J	Westrip, SP				Westrip, Simon P.			<i>publCIF</i>: software for editing, validating and formatting crystallographic information files	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY												publCIF is an application designed for creating, editing and validating crystallographic information files (CIFs) that are used in journal publication. It validates syntax and dictionary-defined data attributes through internal routines, and also provides a web interface to the checkCIF service of the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), which provides a full crystallographic analysis of the structural data. The graphical interface allows users to edit the CIF either in its 'raw' ASCII form (using a text editor with context-sensitive data validation and input facilities) or as a formatted representation of a structure report (using a word-processing environment), as well as via a number of convenience tools (e. g. spreadsheet representations of looped data). Beyond file and data validation, publCIF provides access to resources to facilitate preparation of a structure report (e. g. databases of author details, experimental data, standard references etc., either distributed with the program or collected during its use), along with tools for reference parsing, spell checking, structure visualization and image management. publCIF was commissioned by the IUCr, both as free software for authors and as a tool for in-house journal production; the tool for authors is described here. Binary distributions for Linux, MacOS and Windows operating systems are available.

Bacteriological tests were performed in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium on solid agar plates and in liquid systems supplemented with different concentrations of nanosized silver particles. These particles were shown to be an effective bactericide. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) were used to study the biocidal action of this nanoscale material. The results confirmed that the treated E. coli cells were damaged, showing formation of "pits" in the cell wall of the bacteria, while the silver nanoparticles were found to accumulate in the bacterial membrane. A membrane with such a morphology exhibits a significant increase in permeability, resulting in death of the cell. These nontoxic nanomaterials, which can be prepared in a simple and cost-effective manner, may be suitable for the formulation of new types of bactericidal materials. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

A linear relation between V-oc and the oxidation potential is found (see figure).

The rational design of the central fused ring unit of these acceptor molecules is crucial to maximize device performance. Here, we report a new class of non-fullerene acceptor, Y6, that employs a ladder-type electron-deficient-core-based central fused ring (dithienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole) with a benzothiadiazole (BT) core to fine-tune its absorption and electron affinity. OPVs made from Y6 in conventional and inverted architectures each exhibited a high efficiency of 15.7%, measured in two separate labs. Inverted device structures were certified at Enli Tech Laboratory demonstrated an efficiency of 14.9%. We further observed that the Y6-based devices maintain a high efficiency of 13.6% with an active layer thickness of 300 nm. The electron-deficient-core-based fused ring reported in this work opens a new door in the molecular design of high-performance acceptors for OPVs.

J	Nikoobakht, B; El-Sayed, MA				Nikoobakht, B; El-Sayed, MA			Preparation and growth mechanism of gold nanorods (NRs) using seed-mediated growth method	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												A method is used for preparing gold NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 10 for which the surface plasmon absorption maxima are between 600 and 1300 nm. This method has been adapted from a previously published seed-mediated growth method (Jana et al. Adv. Mater. 2001, 13, 1389). The disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e., formation of noncylindrical NRs, phi-shaped particles, and formation of a large fraction of spherical particles) have been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one. In a single-component surfactant system, the silver content of the growth solution was used to grow NRs to a desired length. This results in reproducible formation of NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. To grow longer NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown in this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs. Effects of the silver ion and the cosurfactant along with the growth mechanism of NRs are discussed.

In this work, we developed a selective solvothermal synthesis of MoS2 nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets suspended in solution. The resulting MoS2/RGO hybrid material possessed nanoscopic few-layer MoS2 structures with an abundance of exposed edges stacked onto graphene, in strong contrast to large aggregated MoS2 particles grown freely in solution without GO. The MoS2/RGO hybrid exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) relative to other MoS2 catalysts. A Tafel slope of similar to 41 mV/decade was measured for MoS2 catalysts in the HER for the first time; this exceeds by far the activity of previous MoS2 catalysts and results from the abundance of catalytic edge sites on the MoS2 nanoparticles and the excellent electrical coupling to the underlying graphene network. The similar to 41 mV/decade Tafel slope suggested the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the MoS2-catalyzed HER, with electrochemical desorption of hydrogen as the rate-limiting step.

Semiconducting Tin and Lead Iodide Perovskites with Organic Cations: Phase Transitions, High Mobilities, and Near-Infrared Photoluminescent Properties	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY												A broad organic-inorganic series of hybrid metal iodide perovskites with the general formulation AMI(3), where A is the methylammonium (CH3NH3+) or formamidinium (HC(NH2)(2)(+)) cation and M is Sn (1 and 2) or Pb (3 and 4) are reported. The compounds have been prepared through a variety of synthetic approaches, and the nature of the resulting materials is discussed in terms of their thermal stability and optical and electronic properties. We find that the chemical and physical properties of these materials strongly depend on the preparation method. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of 1-4 classifies the compounds in the perovskite structural family. Structural phase transitions were observed and investigated by temperature-dependent single crystal X-ray diffraction in the 100-400 K range. The charge transport properties of the materials are discussed in conjunction with diffuse reflectance studies in the mid-IR region that display characteristic absorption features. Temperature-dependent studies show a strong dependence of the resistivity as a function of the crystal structure. Optical absorption measurements indicate that 1-4 behave as direct-gap semiconductors with energy band gaps distributed in the range of 1.25-1.75 eV. The compounds exhibit an intense near-IR photoluminescence (PL) emission in the 700-1000 nm range (1.1-1.7 eV) at room temperature. We show that solid solutions between the Sn and Pb compounds are readily accessible throughout the composition range. The optical properties such as energy band gap, emission intensity, and wavelength can be readily controlled as we show for the isostructural series of solid solutions CH3NH3Sn1-xPbxI3 (5). The charge transport type in these materials was characterized by Seebeck coefficient and Hall-effect measurements. The compounds behave as p- or n-type semiconductors depending on the preparation method. The samples with the lowest carrier concentration are prepared from solution and are n-type; p-type samples can be obtained through solid state reactions exposed in air in a controllable manner. In the case of Sri compounds, there is a facile tendency toward oxidation which causes the materials to be doped with Sn4+ and thus behave as p-type semiconductors displaying metal-like conductivity. The compounds appear to possess very high estimated electron and hole mobilities that exceed 2000 cm(2)/(V s) and 300 cm(2)/(V s), respectively, as shown in the case of CH3NH3SnI3 (1). We also compare the properties of the title hybrid materials with those of the all inorganic CsSnI3 and CsPbI3 prepared using identical synthetic methods.					, Kanatzidis/ABH-7936-2022; Stoumpos, Constantinos/P-6677-2016	Stoumpos, Constantinos/0000-0001-8396-9578													0020-1669	1520-510X				AUG 5	2013	52	15					9019	9038		10.1021/ic401215x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ic401215x								23834108					WOS:000322863300085

The procedure involves initial single-phase extraction of 10 g sample with 10 mL acetonitrile, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning formed by addition of 4 g anhydrous MgSO4 Plus 1 g NaCl. Removal of residual water and cleanup are performed simultaneously by using a rapid procedure called dispersive solid-phase extraction (dispersive-SPE), in which 150 mg anhydrous MgSO4 and 25 mg primary secondary amine (PSA) sorbent are simply mixed with 1 mL acetonitrile extract. The dispersive-SPE with PSA effectively removes many polar matrix components, such as organic acids, certain polar pigments, and sugars, to some extent from the food extracts. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is then used for quantitative and confirmatory analysis of GC-amenable pesticides. Recoveries between 85 and 101% (mostly >95%) and repeatabilities typically <5% have been achieved for a wide range of fortified pesticides, including very polar and basic compounds such as methamidophos, acephate, omethoate, imazalil, and thiabendazole. Using this method, a single chemist can prepare a batch of 6 previously chopped samples in <30 min with approximately $1 (U.S.) of materials per sample.																			1060-3271	1944-7922				MAR-APR	2003	86	2					412	431											12723926					WOS:000182138800023
J	Grimme, S				Grimme, S			Accurate description of van der Waals complexes by density functional theory including empirical corrections	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C-6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The "double counting" of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N-2, F-2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene. pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene (.) H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of the interaction energies.

With the addition of inorganic cesium, the resulting triple cation perovskite compositions are thermally more stable, contain less phase impurities and are less sensitive to processing conditions.

The MARTINI force field: Coarse grained model for biomolecular simulations	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												We present an improved and extended version of our coarse grained lipid model. The new version, coined the MARTINI force field, is parametrized in a systematic way, based on the reproduction of partitioning free energies between polar and apolar phases of a large number of chemical compounds. To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations.

However, we recently demonstrated that a pseudocapacitive mechanism occurs when lithium ions are inserted into mesoporous and nanocrystal films of orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T-Nb2O5; refs 1,2). Here, we quantify the kinetics of charge storage in T-Nb2O5: currents that vary inversely with time, charge-storage capacity that is mostly independent of rate, and redox peaks that exhibit small voltage offsets even at high rates. We also define the structural characteristics necessary for this process, termed intercalation pseudocapacitance, which are a crystalline network that offers two-dimensional transport pathways and little structural change on intercalation. The principal benefit realized from intercalation pseudocapacitance is that high levels of charge storage are achieved within short periods of time because there are no limitations from solid-state diffusion. Thick electrodes (up to 40 mu m thick) prepared with T-Nb2O5 offer the promise of exploiting intercalation pseudocapacitance to obtain high-rate charge-storage devices.

J	Pei, SF; Cheng, HM				Pei, Songfeng; Cheng, Hui-Ming			The reduction of graphene oxide	CARBON												Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene. Different reduction processes result in different properties of reduced GO (rGO), which in turn affect the final performance of materials or devices composed of rGO. In this contribution, we review the state-of-art status of the reduction of GO on both techniques and mechanisms. The development in this field will speed the applications of graphene.

J	Rogers, D; Hahn, M				Rogers, David; Hahn, Mathew			Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING												Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECEPs) are a novel class of topological fingerprints for molecular characterization. Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECEPs were developed specifically for structure activity modeling. ECEPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can he tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses. While the use of ECEPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.																			1549-9596	1549-960X				MAY	2010	50	5					742	754		10.1021/ci100050t	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci100050t								20426451					WOS:000277911600004

In this paper, we consider another contribution, that of the capacitive effects, which become increasingly important at nanoscale dimensions. Nanocrystalline TiO2 (anatase) was studied over a dimensional regime where both capacitive and lithium intercalation processes contribute to the total stored charge. An analysis of the voltammetric sweep data was used to distinguish between the amount of charge stored by these two processes. At particle sizes below 10 nm, capacitive contributions became increasingly important, leading to greater amounts of total stored charge (gravimetrically normalized) with decreasing TiO2 particle size. The area normalized capacitance was determined to be well above 100,mu F/cm(2), confirming that the capacitive contribution was pseudocapacitive in nature. Moreover, reducing the particle size to the nanoscale regime led to faster charge/discharge rates because the diffusion-controlled lithium ion intercalation process was replaced by faradaic reactions which occur at the surface of the material. The charge storage and kinetics benefits derived from using nanoscale metal oxides provide an interesting direction for the design of materials that offer both power density and energy density.

The number of S-Mo-S layers of the samples was independently determined by contact-mode atomic force microscopy. Two Raman modes, E-2g(1) and A(1g), exhibited sensitive thickness dependence, with the frequency of the former decreasing and that of the latter increasing with thickness. The results provide a convenient and reliable means for determining layer thickness with atomic-level precision. The opposite direction of the frequency shifts, which cannot be explained solely by van der Waals interlayer coupling, is attributed to Coulombic interactions and possible stacking-induced changes of the intralayer bonding. This work exemplifies the evolution of structural parameters in layered materials in changing from the three-dimensional to the two-dimensional regime.

Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance.

The use of a mixed solvent of gamma-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis.

Here, we report a molecularly engineered porphyrin dye, coded SM315, which features the prototypical structure of a donor-pi-bridge-acceptor and both maximizes electrolyte compatibility and improves light-harvesting properties. Linear-response, time-dependent density functional theory was used to investigate the perturbations in the electronic structure that lead to improved light harvesting. Using SM315 with the cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle resulted in dye-sensitized solar cells that exhibit a high open-circuit voltage V-OC of 0.91 V, short-circuit current density J(SC) of 18.1 mA cm(-2), fill factor of 0.78 and a power conversion efficiency of 13%.

Sodium-Ion Batteries	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												The status of ambient temperature sodium ion batteries is reviewed in light of recent developments in anode, electrolyte and cathode materials. These devices, although early in their stage of development, are promising for large-scale grid storage applications due to the abundance and very low cost of sodium-containing precursors used to make the components. The engineering knowledge developed recently for highly successful Li ion batteries can be leveraged to ensure rapid progress in this area, although different electrode materials and electrolytes will be required for dual intercalation systems based on sodium. In particular, new anode materials need to be identified, since the graphite anode, commonly used in lithium systems, does not intercalate sodium to any appreciable extent. A wider array of choices is available for cathodes, including high performance layered transition metal oxides and polyanionic compounds. Recent developments in electrodes are encouraging, but a great deal of research is necessary, particularly in new electrolytes, and the understanding of the SEI films. The engineering modeling calculations of Na-ion battery energy density indicate that 210 Wh kg1 in gravimetric energy is possible for Na-ion batteries compared to existing Li-ion technology if a cathode capacity of 200 mAh g1 and a 500 mAh g1 anode can be discovered with an average cell potential of 3.3 V.

Here we report the development of a third-generation point-charge all-atom force field for proteins. Following the earlier approach of Cornell et al., the charge set was obtained by fitting to the electrostatic potentials of dipeptides calculated using B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. The main-chain torsion parameters were obtained by fitting to the energy profiles of Ace-Ala-Nme and Ace-Gly-Nme di-peptides calculated using MP2/cc-PVTZ//HF/6-31G** quantum mechanical methods. All other parameters were taken from the existing AMBER data base. The major departure from previous force fields is that all quantum mechanical calculations were done in the condensed phase with continuum solvent models and an effective dielectric constant of epsilon = 4. We anticipate that this force field parameter set will address certain critical short comings of previous force fields in condensed-phase simulations of proteins. Initial tests on peptides demonstrated a high-degree of similarity between the calculated and the statistically measured Ramanchandran maps for both Ace-Gly-Nme and Ace-Ala-Nme di-peptides. Some highlights of Our results include (1) well-preserved balance between the extended and helical region distributions, and (2) favorable type-II poly-proline helical region in agreement with recent experiments. Backward compatibility between the new and Cornell et al. charge sets. as judged by overall agreement between dipole moments, allows a smooth transition to the new force field in the area of ligand-binding calculations. Test simulations on a large set of proteins are also discussed. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Studying disorder in graphite-based systems by Raman spectroscopy	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Raman spectroscopy has historically played an important role in the structural characterization of graphitic materials, in particular providing valuable information about defects, stacking of the graphene layers and the finite sizes of the crystallites parallel and perpendicular to the hexagonal axis. Here we review the defect-induced Raman spectra of graphitic materials from both experimental and theoretical standpoints and we present recent Raman results on nanographites and graphenes. The disorder-induced D and D' Raman features, as well as the G'-band (the overtone of the D-band which is always observed in defect-free samples), are discussed in terms of the double-resonance (DR) Raman process, involving phonons within the interior of the 1st Brillouin zone of graphite and defects. In this review, experimental results for the D, D' and G' bands obtained with different laser lines, and in samples with different crystallite sizes and different types of defects are presented and discussed. We also present recent advances that made possible the development of Raman scattering as a tool for very accurate structural analysis of nano-graphite, with the establishment of an empirical formula for the in-and out-of-plane crystalline size and even fancier Raman-based information, such as for the atomic structure at graphite edges, and the identification of single versus multi-graphene layers. Once established, this knowledge provides a powerful machinery to understand newer forms of sp(2) carbon materials, such as the recently developed pitch-based graphitic foams. Results for the calculated Raman intensity of the disorder-induced D-band in graphitic materials as a function of both the excitation laser energy (E-laser) and the in-plane size (L-a) of nano-graphites are presented and compared with experimental results. The status of this research area is assessed, and opportunities for future work are identified.

The photophysics of such photoactive devices is based on the photo-induced charge transfer from donor-type semiconducting conjugated polymers to acceptor-type conjugated polymers or acceptor molecules such as Buckminsterfullerene, C-60. This photo-induced charge transfer is reversible, ultrafast (within 100 fs) with a quantum efficiency approaching unity, and the charge-separated state is metastable (up to milliseconds at 80 K). Being similar to the first steps in natural photosynthesis, this photo-induced electron transfer leads To a number of potentially interesting applications, which include sensitization of the photoconductivity and photovoltaic phenomena. Examples of photovoltaic architectures are presented and their potential in terrestrial solar energy conversion discussed. Recent progress in the realization of improved photovoltaic elements with 3 % power conversion efficiency is reported.

This overview provides a basis and rationale for developing standardized antioxidant capacity methods for the food, nutraceutical, and dietary supplement industries. From evaluation of data presented at the First International Congress on Antioxidant Methods in 2004 and in the literature, as well as consideration of potential end uses of antioxidants, it is proposed that procedures and applications for three assays be considered for standardization: the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and possibly the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. ORAC represent a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction mechanism, which is most relevant to human biology. The Folin-Ciocalteu method is an electron transfer (ET) based assay and gives reducing capacity, which has normally been expressed as phenolic contents. The TEAC assay represents a second ET-based method. Other assays may need to be considered in the future as more is learned about some of the other radical sources and their importance to human biology.																			0021-8561	1520-5118				MAY 18	2005	53	10					4290	4302		10.1021/jf0502698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf0502698								15884874					WOS:000229049000082

Peptides that correspond to more than a single protein in the sequence database are apportioned among all corresponding proteins, and a minimal protein list sufficient to account for the observed peptide assignments is derived using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Using peptide assignments to spectra generated from a sample of 18 purified proteins, as well as complex H. influenzae and Halobacterium samples, the model is shown to produce probabilities that are accurate and have high power to discriminate correct from incorrect protein identifications. This method allows filtering of large-scale proteomics data sets with predictable sensitivity and false positive identification error rates. Fast, consistent, and transparent, it provides a standard for publishing large-scale protein identification data sets in the literature and for comparing the results obtained from different experiments.

We use Mie theory and discrete dipole approximation method to calculate absorption and scattering efficiencies and optical resonance wavelengths for three commonly used classes of nanoparticles: gold nanospheres, silica-gold nanoshells, and gold nanorods. The calculated spectra clearly reflect the well-known dependence of nanoparticle optical properties viz. the resonance wavelength, the extinction cross-section, and the ratio of scattering to absorption, on the nanoparticle dimensions. A systematic quantitative study of the various trends is presented. By increasing the size of gold nanospheres from 20 to 80 nm, the magnitude of extinction as well as the relative contribution of scattering to the extinction rapidly increases. Gold nanospheres in the size range commonly employed (similar to 40 nm) show an absorption cross-section 5 orders higher than conventional absorbing dyes, while the magnitude of light scattering by 80-nm gold nanospheres is 5 orders higher than the light emission from strongly fluorescing dyes. The variation in the plasmon wavelength maximum of nanospheres, i.e., from similar to 520 to 550 nm, is however too limited to be useful for in vivo applications. Gold nanoshells are found to have optical cross-sections comparable to and even higher than the nanospheres. Additionally, their optical resonances lie favorably in the near-infrared region. The resonance wavelength can be rapidly increased by either increasing the total nanoshell size or increasing the ratio of the core-to-shell radius. The total extinction of nanoshells shows a linear dependence on their total size, however, it is independent of the core/shell radius ratio. The relative scattering contribution to the extinction can be rapidly increased by increasing the nanoshell size or decreasing the ratio of the core/shell radius. Gold nanorods show optical cross-sections comparable to nanospheres and nanoshells, however, at much smaller effective size. Their optical resonance can be linearly tuned across the near-infrared region by changing either the effective size or the aspect ratio of the nanorods. The total extinction as well as the relative scattering contribution increases rapidly with the effective size, however, they are independent of the aspect ratio. To compare the effectiveness of nanoparticles of different sizes for real biomedical applications, size-normalized optical cross-sections or per micron coefficients are calculated. Gold nanorods show per micron absorption and scattering coefficients that are an order of magnitude higher than those for nanoshells and nanospheres. While nanorods with a higher aspect ratio along, with a smaller effective radius are the best photoabsorbing nanoparticles, the highest scattering contrast for imaging applications is obtained from nanorods of high aspect ratio with a larger effective radius.

They are used to power electric and hybrid electric vehicles and to store wind and solar energy in smart grids. Electrochemical devices with high energy and power densities can currently be powered only by batteries with organic liquid electrolytes. However, such batteries require relatively stringent safety precautions, making large-scale systems very complicated and expensive. The application of solid electrolytes is currently limited because they attain practically useful conductivities (10(-2) S cm(-1)) only at 50-80 degrees C, which is one order of magnitude lower than those of organic liquid electrolytes(3-8). Here, we report a lithium superionic conductor, Li(10)GeP(2)S(12) that has a new three-dimensional framework structure. It exhibits an extremely high lithium ionic conductivity of 12 mS cm(-1) at room temperature. This represents the highest conductivity achieved in a solid electrolyte, exceeding even those of liquid organic electrolytes. This new solid-state battery electrolyte has many advantages in terms of device fabrication (facile shaping, patterning and integration), stability (non-volatile), safety (non-explosive) and excellent electrochemical properties (high conductivity and wide potential window)(9-11).					; Hirayama, Masaaki/B-5781-2011	Kato, Yuki/0000-0002-2402-9815; KAMAYA, NORIAKI/0000-0003-0394-7593; Yonemura, Masao/0000-0002-4444-1997; Hirayama, Masaaki/0000-0003-4804-4208													1476-1122					SEP	2011	10	9					682	686		10.1038/NMAT3066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT3066								21804556					WOS:000294156800012

J	Wang, JM; Cieplak, P; Kollman, PA				Wang, JM; Cieplak, P; Kollman, PA			How well does a restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) model perform in calculating conformational energies of organic and biological molecules?	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												In this study, we present conformational energies for a molecular mechanical model (Parm99) developed for organic and biological molecules using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) approach to derive the partial charges. This approach uses the simple "generic" force field model (Parm94), and attempts to add a minimal number of extra Fourier components to the torsional energies, but doing so only when there is a physical justification. The results are quite encouraging, not only for the 34-molecule set that has been studied by both the highest level ab initio model (GVB/LMP2) and experiment, but also for the 55-molecule set for which high-quality experimental data are available. Considering the 55 molecules studied by all the force field models for which there are experimental data, the average absolute errors (AAEs) are 0.28 (this model), 0.52 (MM3), 0.57 (CHARMm [MSI]), and 0.43 kcal/mol (MMFF). For the 34-molecule set, the AAEs of this model versus experiment and nb initio are 0.28 and 0.27 kcal/mol, respectively. This is a lower error than found with MM3 and CHARMm, and is comparable to that found with MMFF (0.31 and 0.22 kcal/mol). We also present two examples of how well the torsional parameters are transferred from the training set to the test set. The absolute errors of molecules in the test set are only slightly larger than in the training set (differences of <0.1 kcal/mol). Therefore, it can be concluded that a simple "generic" force field with a limited number of specific torsional parameters can describe intra- and intermolecular interactions, although all comparison molecules were selected from our 82-compound training set. We also show how this effective two-body model can be extended for use with a nonadditive force field (NAFF), both with and without lone pairs. Without changing the torsional parameters, the use of more accurate charges and polarization leads to an increase in average absolute error compared with experiment, but adjustment of the parameters restores the level of agreement found with the additive model. After reoptimizing the psi, Phi torsional parameters in peptides using alanine dipeptide (6 conformational pairs) and alanine tetrapeptide (11 conformational pairs), the new model gives better energies than the Cornell et al. (J Am Chem Soc 1995, 117, 5179-5197) force field. The average absolute error of this model for high-level nb initio calculation is 0.82 kcal/mol for alanine dipeptide and tetrapeptide as compared with 1.80 kcal/mol for the Cornell et al. model. For nucleosides, the new model also gives improved energies compared with the Cornell et al. model. To optimize force field parameters, we developed a program called parmscan, which can iteratively scan the torsional parameters in a systematic manner and finally obtain the best torsional potentials. Besides the organic molecules in our test set, parmscan was also successful in optimizing the Psi, Phi torsional parameters in peptides to significantly improve agreement between molecular mechanical and high-level nb initio energies.

Most of the existing carrier materials show poor drug loading (usually less than 5 wt% of the transported drug versus the carrier material) and/or rapid release of the proportion of the drug that is simply adsorbed (or anchored) at the external surface of the nanocarrier. In this context, porous hybrid solids, with the ability to tune their structures and porosities for better drug interactions and high loadings, are well suited to serve as nanocarriers for delivery and imaging applications. Here we show that specific non-toxic porous iron(III)-based metal-organic frameworks with engineered cores and surfaces, as well as imaging properties, function as superior nanocarriers for efficient controlled delivery of challenging antitumoural and retroviral drugs (that is, busulfan, azidothymidine triphosphate, doxorubicin or cidofovir) against cancer and AIDS. In addition to their high loadings, they also potentially associate therapeutics and diagnostics, thus opening the way for theranostics, or personalized patient treatments.

J	Stuart, SJ; Tutein, AB; Harrison, JA				Stuart, SJ; Tutein, AB; Harrison, JA			A reactive potential for hydrocarbons with intermolecular interactions	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												A potential function is presented that can be used to model both chemical reactions and intermolecular interactions in condensed-phase hydrocarbon systems such as liquids, graphite, and polymers. This potential is derived from a well-known dissociable hydrocarbon force field, the reactive empirical bond-order potential. The extensions include an adaptive treatment of the nonbonded and dihedral-angle interactions, which still allows for covalent bonding interactions. Torsional potentials are introduced via a novel interaction potential that does not require a fixed hybridization state. The resulting model is intended as a first step towards a transferable, empirical potential capable of simulating chemical reactions in a variety of environments. The current implementation has been validated against structural and energetic properties of both gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons, and is expected to prove useful in simulations of hydrocarbon liquids, thin films, and other saturated hydrocarbon systems.

Several band combinations for spectral analysis have been tested, and a combination of four Lorentzian-shaped bands (G, D1, D2, D4) at about 1580, 1350, 1620, and 1200 cm(-1), respectively, with a Gaussian-shaped band (W) at similar to 1500 cm(-1) was best suited for the first-order spectra. The second-order spectra were best fitted with Lorentzian-shaped bands at about 2450, 2700, 2900, and 3100 cm(-1). Spectral parameters (band positions, full widths at half maximum, and intensity ratios) are reported for several types of industrial carbon black (Degussa Printex, Cabot Monarch), diesel soot (particulate matter from modern heavy duty vehicle and passenger car engine exhaust, NIST SRM1650), spark-discharge soot (Palas GfG100), and graphite. Several parameters, in particular the width of the D1 band at similar to 1350 cm(-1), provide structural information and allow to discriminate the sample materials, but the characterisation and distinction of different types of soot is limited by the experimental reproducibility of the spectra and the statistical uncertainties of curve fitting. The results are discussed and compared with X-ray diffraction measurements and earlier Raman spectroscopic studies of comparable materials, where different measurement and fitting procedures had been applied.

The resultant N-graphene was demonstrated to act as a metal-free electrode with a much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than platinum for oxygen reduction via a four-electron pathway in alkaline fuel cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of graphene and its derivatives as metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction.

Two-Dimensional Transition Metal Carbides	ACS NANO												Herein we report on the synthesis of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and carbonitrides by immersing select MAX phase powders in hydrofluoric acid, HF. The MAX phases represent a large (>60 members) family of ternary, layered, machinable transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides. Herein we present evidence for the exfoliation of the following MAX phases: Ti2AlC, Ta4AlC3, (Ti-0.5,Nb-0.5)(2)AlC, (V-0.5,Cr-0.5)(3)AlC2, and Ti3AlCN by the simple immersion of their powders, at room temperature, in HF of varying concentrations for times varying between 10 and 72 h followed by sonication. The removal of the "A" group layer from the MAX phases results in 2-D layers that we are labeling MXenes to denote the loss of the A element and emphasize their structural similarities with graphene. The sheet resistances of the MXenes were found to be comparable to multilayer graphene. Contact angle measurements with water on pressed MXene surfaces showed hydrophilic behavior.

In the series of RTILs studied here, the choice of anion determines water miscibility and has the most dramatic effect on the properties. Hydrophilic anions (e.g., chloride and iodide) produce ionic liquids that are miscible in any proportion with water but, upon the removal of some water from the solution, illustrate how sensitive the physical properties are to a change in water content. In comparison, for ionic liquids containing more hydrophobic anions (e.g., PF((6)- and N(SO2CF3)(2)(-)), the removal of water has a smaller affect on the resulting properties. For a series of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations, increasing the alkyl chain length from butyl to hexyl to octyl increases the hydrophobicity and the viscosities of the ionic liquids increase, whereas densities and surface tension values decrease. Thermal analyses indicate high temperatures are attainable prior to decomposition and DSC studies reveal a glass transition for several samples. ILs incorporating PF6- have been used in liquid/liquid partitioning of organic molecules from water and the results for two of these are also discussed here. On a cautionary note, the chemistry of the individual cations and anions of the ILs should not be overlooked as, in the case of certain conditions for PF6- ILs, contact with an aqueous phase may result in slow hydrolysis of the PF6- with the concomitant release of HF and other species.

It is shown that only the Raman frequencies of E-2g(1) and A(1g) peaks vary monotonously with the layer number of ultrathin MoS2 flakes, while intensities or widths of the peaks vary arbitrarily. The coupling between electronic transitions and phonons are found to become weaker when the layer number of MoS2 decreases, attributed to the increased electronic transition energies or elongated intralayer atomic bonds in ultrathin MoS2. The asymmetric Raman peak at 454 cm-1, which has been regarded as the overtone of longitudinal optical M phonons in bulk MoS2, is actually a combinational band involving a longitudinal acoustic mode (LA(M)) and an optical mode (A(2u)). Our findings suggest a clear evolution of the coupling between electronic transition and phonon when MoS2 is scaled down from three- to two-dimensional geometry.

Resolving surface chemical states in XPS analysis of first row transition metals, oxides and hydroxides: Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												Chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of first row transition metals and their oxides and hydroxides is challenging due to the complexity of the 2p spectra resulting from peak asymmetries, complex multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structure, and uncertain, overlapping binding energies. A review of current literature shows that all values necessary for reproducible, quantitative chemical state analysis are usually not provided. This paper reports a more consistent, practical and effective approach to curve-fitting the various chemical states in a variety of Sc, Ti, V, Cu and Zn metals, oxides and hydroxides. The curve-fitting procedures proposed are based on a combination of (1) standard spectra from quality reference samples, (2) a survey of appropriate literature databases and/or a compilation of the literature references, and (3) specific literature references where fitting procedures are available. Binding energies, full-width at half maximum (FWHM) values, spin-orbit splitting values, asymmetric peak-shape fitting parameters, and, for Cu and Zn, Auger parameters values are presented. The quantification procedure for Cu species details the use of the shake-up satellites for Cu(II)-containing compounds and the exact binding energies of the Cu(0) and Cu(I) peaks. The use of the modified Auger parameter for Cu and Zn species allows for corroborating evidence when there is uncertainty in the binding energy assignment.

A series of graphene-based composites(4-6) and macroscopic structures(7-11) have been recently fabricated using chemically derived graphene sheets. However, these composites and structures suffer from poor electrical conductivity because of the low quality and/or high inter-sheet junction contact resistance of the chemically derived graphene sheets. Here we report the direct synthesis of three-dimensional foam-like graphene macrostructures, which we call graphene foams (GFs), by template-directed chemical vapour deposition. A GF consists of an interconnected flexible network of graphene as the fast transport channel of charge carriers for high electrical conductivity. Even with a GF loading as low as similar to 0.5 wt%, GF/poly(dimethyl siloxane) composites show a very high electrical conductivity of similar to 10 S cm(-1), which is similar to 6 orders of magnitude higher than chemically derived graphene-based composites(4). Using this unique network structure and the outstanding electrical and mechanical properties of GFs, as an example, we demonstrate the great potential of GF/poly(dimethyl siloxane) composites for flexible, foldable and stretchable conductors(12).

The fitting technique combines using accurate ab initio data as the target, choosing an efficient fitting subspace of the whole potential-energy surface, and determining weights for each of the fitting points based on magnitudes of the potential-energy gradient. The average energy RMS deviation from the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)//HF/6-31G** data is reduced by ca. 40% from 0.81 to 0.47 kcal/mol as a result of the fitting for the electrostatically uncharged dipeptides, Transferability of the parameters is demonstrated by using the same alanine dipeptide-fitted backbone torsional parameters for all of the other dipeptides (with the appropriate side-chain refitting) and the alanine tetrapeptide. Parameters of nonbonded interactions have also been refitted for the sulfur-containing dipeptides (cysteine and methionine), and the validity of the new Coulombic charges and the van der Waals sigma 's and epsilon 's is proved through reproducing gas-phase energies of complex formation heats of vaporization and densities of pure model liquids. Moreover, a novel approach to fitting torsional parameters for electrostatically charged molecular systems has been presented and successfully tested on five dipeptides with charged side chains.

The theoretical overpotential was calculated by applying standard density functional theory in combination with the computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) model. We showed that by the discovery of a universal scaling relation between the adsorption energies of HOO* vs HO*, it is possible to analyze the reaction free energy diagrams of all the oxides in a general way. This gave rise to an activity volcano that was the same for a wide variety of oxide catalyst materials and a universal descriptor for the oxygen evolution activity, which suggests a fundamental limitation on the maximum oxygen evolution activity of planar oxide catalysts.

Recently, this method has also been applied as a scoring function in computational drug design. Here a new tool g_mmpbsa, which implements the MM-PBSA approach using subroutines written in-house or sourced from the GROMACS and APBS packages is described. g_mmpbsa was developed as part of the Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD) consortium. Its aim is to integrate high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with binding energy calculations. The tool provides options to select alternative atomic radii and different nonpolar solvation models including models based on the solvent accessible surface area (SASA), solvent accessible volume (SAV), and a model which contains both repulsive (SASA-SAV) and attractive components (described using a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen like integral method). We showcase the effectiveness of the tool by comparing the calculated interaction energy of 37 structurally diverse HIV-1 protease inhibitor complexes with their experimental binding free energies. The effect of varying several combinations of input parameters such as atomic radii, dielectric constant, grid resolution, solute solvent dielectric boundary definition, and nonpolar models was investigated. g_mmpbsa can also be used to estimate the energy contribution per residue to the binding energy. It has been used to identify those residues in HIV-1 protease that are most critical for binding a range of inhibitors.

Exfoliation of bulk MoS2 via Li intercalation is an attractive route to large-scale synthesis of monolayer crystals. However, this method results in loss of pristine semiconducting properties of MoS2 due to structural changes that occur during Li intercalation. Here, we report structural and electronic properties of chemically exfoliated MoS2. The metastable metallic phase that emerges from Li intercalation was found to dominate the properties of as-exfoliated material, but mild annealing leads to gradual restoration of the semiconducting phase. Above an annealing temperature of 300 degrees C, chemically exfoliated MoS2 exhibit prominent band gap photoluminescence, similar to mechanically exfoliated monolayers, indicating that their semiconducting properties are largely restored.

Formamidinium lead trihalide: a broadly tunable perovskite for efficient planar heterojunction solar cells	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Perovskite-based solar cells have attracted significant recent interest, with power conversion efficiencies in excess of 15% already superceding a number of established thin-film solar cell technologies. Most work has focused on a methylammonium lead trihalide perovskites, with a bandgaps of similar to 1.55 eV and greater. Here, we explore the effect of replacing the methylammonium cation in this perovskite, and show that with the slightly larger formamidinium cation, we can synthesise formamidinium lead trihalide perovskites with a bandgap tunable between 1.48 and 2.23 eV. We take the 1.48 eV-bandgap perovskite as most suited for single junction solar cells, and demonstrate long-range electron and hole diffusion lengths in this material, making it suitable for planar heterojunction solar cells. We fabricate such devices, and due to the reduced bandgap we achieve high short-circuit currents of >23 mA cm(-2), resulting in power conversion efficiencies of up to 14.2%, the highest efficiency yet for solution processed planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. Formamidinium lead triiodide is hence promising as a new candidate for this class of solar cell.

Software and computers have now developed to a level where such calculations can be used as tools for material and process development. In the present paper some of the latest software developments at Thermo-Calc Software are presented together with application examples. It is shown how advanced thermodynamic calculations have become more accessible since: - A more user-friendly windows version of Thermo-Calc, TCW, has been developed. - There is an increasing amount of thermodynamic databases for different materials available. - Thermo-Calc can be accessed from user-written software through several different programming interfaces are available which enables access to the thermodynamic software from a user-written software. Accurate data for thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria can then easily be incorporated into software written in e.g. C++, Matlab and FORTRAN. Thermo-Calc Software also produces DICTRA, a software for simulation of diffusion controlled phase transformations. Using DICTRA it is possible to simulate processes such as homogenization, carburising, microsegregation and coarsening in multicomponent alloys. The different models in the DICTRA software are briefly presented in the present paper together with some application examples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Spek, AL				Spek, Anthony L.			<i>PLATON</i> SQUEEZE: a tool for the calculation of the disordered solvent contribution to the calculated structure factors	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION C-STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY												The completion of a crystal structure determination is often hampered by the presence of embedded solvent molecules or ions that are seriously disordered. Their contribution to the calculated structure factors in the least-squares refinement of a crystal structure has to be included in some way. Traditionally, an atomistic solvent disorder model is attempted. Such an approach is generally to be preferred, but it does not always lead to a satisfactory result and may even be impossible in cases where channels in the structure are filled with continuous electron density. This paper documents the SQUEEZE method as an alternative means of addressing the solvent disorder issue. It conveniently interfaces with the 2014 version of the least-squares refinement program SHELXL [Sheldrick (2015). Acta Cryst. C71. In the press] and other refinement programs that accept externally provided fixed contributions to the calculated structure factors. The PLATON SQUEEZE tool calculates the solvent contribution to the structure factors by back-Fourier transformation of the electron density found in the solvent-accessible region of a phase-optimized difference electron-density map. The actual least-squares structure refinement is delegated to, for example, SHELXL. The current versions of PLATON SQUEEZE and SHELXL now address several of the unnecessary complications with the earlier implementation of the SQUEEZE procedure that were a necessity because least-squares refinement with the now superseded SHELXL97 program did not allow for the input of fixed externally provided contributions to the structure-factor calculation. It is no longer necessary to subtract the solvent contribution temporarily from the observed intensities to be able to use SHELXL for the least-squares refinement, since that program now accepts the solvent contribution from an external file (.fab file) if the ABIN instruction is used. In addition, many twinned structures containing disordered solvents are now also treatable by SQUEEZE. The details of a SQUEEZE calculation are now automatically included in the CIF archive file, along with the unmerged reflection data. The current implementation of the SQUEEZE procedure is described, and discussed and illustrated with three examples. Two of them are based on the reflection data of published structures and one on synthetic reflection data generated for a published structure.																			2053-2296					JAN	2015	71		1				9	18		10.1107/S2053229614024929	http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2053229614024929								25567569					WOS:000347804100003

To overcome this, as well as make other improvements in the model, we present a combination of refinements that should result in enhanced accuracy in simulations of proteins. The common (non-Gly, -Pro) backbone CMAP potential has been refined against experimental solution NMR data for weakly structured peptides, resulting in a rebalancing of the energies of the alpha-helix and extended regions of the Ramachandran map, correcting the alpha-helical bias of CHARMM22/CMAP. The Gly and Pro CMAPs have been refitted to more accurate quantum-mechanical energy surfaces. Side-chain torsion parameters have been optimized by fitting to backbone-dependent quantum-mechanical energy surfaces, followed by additional empirical optimization targeting NMR scalar couplings for unfolded proteins. A comprehensive validation of the revised force field was then performed against a collection of experimental data: (i) comparison of simulations of eight proteins in their crystal environments with crystal structures; (ii) comparison with backbone scalar couplings for weakly structured peptides; (iii) comparison with NMR residual dipolar couplings and scalar couplings for both backbone and side-chains in folded proteins; (iv) equilibrium folding of mini-proteins. The results indicate that the revised CHARMM 36 parameters represent an improved model for modeling and simulation studies of proteins, including studies of protein folding, assembly, and functionally relevant conformational changes.

The CPU time required by the improved algorithm to perform the Bader analysis scales linearly with the number of interatomic surfaces in the system. The new algorithm corrects systematic deviations from the true Bader surface, calculated by the original method and also does not require explicit representation of the interatomic surfaces, resulting in a more robust method of partitioning charge density among atoms in the system. Applications of the method to some small systems are given and it is further demonstrated how the method can be used to define an energy per atom in ab initio calculations.

Since the original discovery, more than 20 different compositions have been synthesized by the selective etching of MAX phase and other precursors and many more theoretically predicted. They offer a variety of different properties, making the family promising candidates in a wide range of applications, such as energy storage, electromagnetic interference shielding, water purification, electrocatalysis, and medicine. These solution-processable materials have the potential to be highly scalable, deposited by spin, spray, or dip coating, painted or printed, or fabricated in a variety of ways. Due to this promise, the amount of research on MXenes has been increasing, and methods of synthesis and processing are expanding quickly. The fast evolution, of the material can also be noticed in the wide range of synthesis and processing protocols that determine the yield of delamination, as well as the quality of the 2D flakes produced. Here we describe the experimental methods and best practices we use to synthesize the most studied MXene, titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), using different etchants and delamination methods. We also explain effects of synthesis parameters on the size and quality of Ti3C2Tx and suggest the optimal processes for the desired application.

Computational high-throughput screening of electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen evolution	NATURE MATERIALS												The pace of materials discovery for heterogeneous catalysts and electrocatalysts could, in principle, be accelerated by the development of efficient computational screening methods. This would require an integrated approach, where the catalytic activity and stability of new materials are evaluated and where predictions are benchmarked by careful synthesis and experimental tests. In this contribution, we present a density functional theory-based, high-throughput screening scheme that successfully uses these strategies to identify a new electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER). The activity of over 700 binary surface alloys is evaluated theoretically; the stability of each alloy in electrochemical environments is also estimated. BiPt is found to have a predicted activity comparable to, or even better than, pure Pt, the archetypical HER catalyst. This alloy is synthesized and tested experimentally and shows improved HER performance compared with pure Pt, in agreement with the computational screening results.

Update of the CHARMM All-Atom Additive Force Field for Lipids: Validation on Six Lipid Types	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2%, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (S-CD) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the S-CD) for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of C-13 NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.

The proposed radii show a well behaved periodic dependence that allows us to interpolate a few radii for elements for which structural data is lacking, notably the noble gases. The proposed set of radii therefore fills most of the gaps and solves some inconsistencies in currently used covalent radii. The transition metal and lanthanide contractions as well as the differences in covalent atomic radii between low spin and high spin configurations in transition metals are illustrated by the proposed radii set.

Similarly, reaction of Fe(acac)(3) and Co(acac)(2) or Mn(acac)(2) with the same diol results in monodisperse CoFe2O4 or MnFe2O4 nanoparticles. Particle diameter can be tuned from 3 to 20 nm by varying reaction conditions or by seed-mediated growth. The as-synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles have a cubic spinel structure as characterized by HRTEM, SAED, and XRD. Further, Fe3O4 can be oxidized to Fe2O3, as evidenced by XRD, NEXAFS spectroscopy, and SQUID magnetometry. The hydrophobic nanoparticles can be transformed into hydrophilic ones by adding bipolar surfactants, and aqueous nanoparticle dispersion is readily made. These iron oxide nanoparticles and their dispersions in various media have great potential in magnetic nanodevice and biomagnetic applications.

J	Irwin, JJ; Shoichet, BK				Irwin, JJ; Shoichet, BK			ZINC - A free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING												A critical barrier to entry into structure-based virtual screening is the lack of a suitable, easy to access database of purchasable compounds. We have therefore prepared a library of 727 842 molecules, each with 3D structure, using catalogs of compounds from vendors (the size of this library continues to grow). The molecules have been assigned biologically relevant protonation states and are annotated with properties such as molecular weight, calculated LogP, and number of rotatable bonds. Each molecule in the library contains vendor and purchasing information and is ready for docking using a number of popular docking programs. Within certain limits, the molecules are prepared in multiple protonation states and multiple tautomeric forms. In one format, multiple conformations are available for the molecules. This database is available for free download (http://zinc.docking.org) in several common file formats including SMILES, mol2, 3D SDF, and DOCK flexibase format. A Web-based query tool incorporating a molecular drawing interface enables the database to be searched and browsed and subsets to be created. Users can process their own molecules by uploading them to a server. Our hope is that this database will bring virtual screening libraries to a wide community of structural biologists and medicinal chemists.

J	Spackman, MA; McKinnon, JJ				Spackman, MA; McKinnon, JJ			Fingerprinting intermolecular interactions in molecular crystals	CRYSTENGCOMM												We have recently described a remarkable new way of exploring packing modes and intermolecular interactions in molecular crystals using a novel partitioning of crystal space. These molecular Hirshfeld surfaces reflect intermolecular interactions in a novel visual manner, offering a hitherto unseen picture of molecular shape in a crystalline environment. The surfaces encode information about all intermolecular interactions simultaneously, but sophisticated interactive graphics are required in order to extract the information most efficiently. To overcome this we have devised a two-dimensional mapping which summarizes quantitatively the nature and type of intermolecular interaction experienced by a molecule in the bulk, and presents it in a convenient graphical format. The mapping takes advantage of the triangulation of the Hirshfeld surfaces, and plots the fraction of points on the surface as a function of the closest distances from the point to nuclei inside and outside the surface. In this manner all interaction types (for example, hydrogen bonding, close and distant van der Waals contacts, C-H...pi interactions, pi-pi stacking) are readily identifiable, and it becomes a straightforward matter to classify molecular crystals by the nature of interactions, and to rapidly identify similarities and differences which can become obscured when examining crystal packing diagrams. These plots are a novel visual representation of all the intermolecular interactions simultaneously, and are unique for a given crystal structure and polymorph. Applications to a wide variety of molecular crystals and intermolecular interactions are presented, including polymorphic systems, as well as crystals where Z' > 1.

Benchmarking Hydrogen Evolving Reaction and Oxygen Evolving Reaction Electrocatalysts for Solar Water Splitting Devices	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Objective comparisons of electrocatalyst activity and stability using standard methods under identical conditions are necessary to evaluate the viability of existing electrocatalysts for integration into solar-fuel devices as well as to help inform the development of new catalytic systems. Herein, we use a standard protocol as a primary screen for evaluating the activity, short-term (2 h) stability, and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 18 electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 26 electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under conditions relevant to an integrated solar water-splitting device in aqueous acidic or alkaline solution. Our primary figure of merit is the overpotential necessary to achieve a magnitude current density of 10 mA cm(-2) per geometric area, the approximate current density expected for a 10% efficient solar-to-fuels conversion device under 1 sun illumination. The specific activity per ECSA of each material is also reported. Among HER catalysts, several could operate at 10 mA cm(-2) with overpotentials <0.1 V in acidic and/or alkaline solutions. Among OER catalysts in acidic solution, no non-noble metal based materials showed promising activity and stability, whereas in alkaline solution many OER catalysts performed with similar activity achieving 10 mA cm(-2) current densities at overpotentials of similar to 0.33-0.5 V. Most OER catalysts showed comparable or better specific activity per ECSA when compared to Ir and Ru catalysts in alkaline solutions, while most HER catalysts showed much lower specific activity than Pt in both acidic and alkaline solutions. For select catalysts, additional secondary screening measurements were conducted including Faradaic efficiency and extended stability measurements.

DLLME is a very simple and rapid method for extraction and preconcentration of organic compounds from water samples. In this method, the appropriate mixture of extraction solvent (8.0 mu L C2Cl4) and disperser solvent (1.00 mL acetone) are injected into the aqueous sample (5.00 mL) by syringe, rapidly. Therefore, cloudy solution is formed. In fact, it is consisted of fine particles of extraction solvent which is dispersed entirely into aqueous phase. After centrifuging, the fine particles of extraction solvent are sedimented in the bottom of the conical test tube (5.0 +/- 0.2 mu L). The performance of DLLME is illustrated with the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water samples by using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Some important parameters, such as kind of extraction and disperser solvent and volume of them, and extraction time were investigated. Under the optimum conditions the enrichment factor ranged from 603 to 1113 and the recovery ranged from 60.3 to 111.3%. The linear range was 0.02-200 mu g/L (four orders of magnitude) and limit of detection was 0.007-0.030 mu g/L for most of analytes. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for 2 mu g/L of PAHs in water by using internal standard were in the range 1.4-10.2% (n = 5). The recoveries of PAHs from surface water at spiking level of 5.0 mu g/L were 82.0-111.0%. The ability of DLLME technique in the extraction of other organic compounds such as organochlorine pesticides, organophosphorus pesticides and substituted benzene compounds (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes) from water samples were studied. The advantages of DLLME method are simplicity of operation, rapidity, low cost, high recovery, and enrichment factor. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we functionalized nanographene oxide (NGO), a novel graphitic material, with branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) to obtain a biocompatible NGO-PEG conjugate stable in various biological solutions, and used them for attaching hydrophobic aromatic molecules including a camptothecin (CPT) analogue, SN38, noncovalently via Pi-Pi stacking. The resulting NGO-PEG-SN38 complex exhibited excellent water solubility while maintaining its high cancer cell killing potency similar to that of the free SN38 molecules in organic solvents. The efficacy of NGO-PEG-SN38 was far higher than that of irinotecan (CPT-11), a FDA-approved water soluble SN38 prodrug used for the treatment of colon cancer.

The physical properties are significantly affected by the structure of the carboxylic acid but the phase behavior of the mixtures can be simply modeled by taking account of the mole fraction of carboxylic acid in the mixture. The physical properties such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface tension of these DES are similar to ambient temperature ionic liquids and insight into the cause of these properties is gained using hole-theory. It is shown that the conductivity and viscosity of these liquids is controlled by ion mobility and the availability of voids of suitable dimensions, and this is consistent with the fluidity of other ionic liquids and molten salts. The DES are also shown to be good solvents for metal oxides, which could have potential application for metal extraction.

The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In an effort to promote integration of both sides and to accelerate the drug discovery from herbal medicines, an efficient systems pharmacology platform that represents ideal information convergence of pharmacochemistry, ADME properties, drug-likeness, drug targets, associated diseases and interaction networks, are urgently needed. Description: The traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP) was built based on the framework of systems pharmacology for herbal medicines. It consists of all the 499 Chinese herbs registered in the Chinese pharmacopoeia with 29,384 ingredients, 3,311 targets and 837 associated diseases. Twelve important ADME-related properties like human oral bioavailability, half-life, drug-likeness, Caco-2 permeability, blood-brain barrier and Lipinski's rule of five are provided for drug screening and evaluation. TCMSP also provides drug targets and diseases of each active compound, which can automatically establish the compound-target and target-disease networks that let users view and analyze the drug action mechanisms. It is designed to fuel the development of herbal medicines and to promote integration of modern medicine and traditional medicine for drug discovery and development. Conclusions: The particular strengths of TCMSP are the composition of the large number of herbal entries, and the ability to identify drug-target networks and drug-disease networks, which will help revealing the mechanisms of action of Chinese herbs, uncovering the nature of TCM theory and developing new herb-oriented drugs.

Present challenges for batteries are twofold. In the first place, the increasing demand for powering systems of portable electronic devices and zero-emission vehicles stimulates research towards high energy and high voltage systems. In the second place, low cost batteries are required in order to advance towards smart electric grids that integrate discontinuous energy flow from renewable sources, optimizing the performance of clean energy sources. Na-ion batteries can be the key for the second point, because of the huge availability of sodium, its low price and the similarity of both Li and Na insertion chemistries. In spite of the lower energy density and voltage of Na-ion based technologies, they can be focused on applications where the weight and footprint requirement is less drastic, such as electrical grid storage. Much work has to be done in the field of Na-ion in order to catch up with Li-ion technology. Cathodic and anodic materials must be optimized, and new electrolytes will be the key point for Na-ion success. This review will gather the up-to-date knowledge about Na-ion battery materials, with the aim of providing a wide view of the systems that have already been explored and a starting point for the new research on this battery technology.

Photocurrent generated from the phototransistor is solely determined by the illuminated optical power at a constant drain or gate voltage. The switching behavior of photocurrent generation and annihilation can be completely finished within ca. 50 ms, and it shows good stability. Especially, the single-layer MoS2 phototransistor exhibits a better photoresponsivity as compared with the graphene-based device. The unique characteristics of Incident-light control, prompt photoswitching, and good photoresponsivity from the MoS2 phototransistor pave an avenue to develop the single-layer semiconducting materials for multifunctional optoelectronic device applications in the future.

Optimization of parameters for semiempirical methods V: Modification of NDDO approximations and application to 70 elements	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING												Several modifications that have been made to the NDDO core-core interaction term and to the method of parameter optimization are described. These changes have resulted in a more complete parameter optimization, called PM6, which has, in turn, allowed 70 elements to be parameterized. The average unsigned error (AUE) between calculated and reference heats of formation for 4,492 species was 8.0 kcal mol(-1). For the subset of 1,373 compounds involving only the elements H, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, and Br, the PM6 AUE was 4.4 kcal mol(-1). The equivalent AUE for other methods were: RM1: 5.0, B3LYP 6-31G*: 5.2, PM5: 5.7, PM3: 6.3, HF 6-31G*: 7.4, and AM1: 10.0 kcal mol(-1). Several long-standing faults in AM1 and PM3 have been corrected and significant improvements have been made in the prediction of geometries.																			1610-2940	0948-5023				DEC	2007	13	12					1173	1213		10.1007/s00894-007-0233-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00894-007-0233-4								17828561					WOS:000250308000001

Single sheet functionalized graphene by oxidation and thermal expansion of graphite	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												A detailed analysis of the thermal expansion mechanism of graphite oxide to produce functionalized graphene sheets is provided. Exfoliation takes place when the decomposition rate of the epoxy and hydroxyl sites of graphite oxide exceeds the diffusion rate of the evolved gases, thus yielding pressures that exceed the van der Waals forces holding the graphene sheets together. A comparison of the Arrhenius dependence of the reaction rate against the calculated diffusion coefficient based on Knudsen diffusion suggests a critical temperature of 550 degrees C which must be exceeded for exfoliation to occur. As a result of their wrinkled nature, the functionalized and defective graphene sheets do not collapse back to graphite oxide but are highly agglomerated. After dispersion by ultrasonication in appropriate solvents, statistical analysis by atomic force microscopy shows that 80% of the observed flakes are single sheets.

Herein is shown that g-C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness of around 2 nm can be easily obtained by a simple top-down strategy, namely, thermal oxidation etching of bulk g-C3N4 in air. Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, the highly anisotropic 2D-nanosheets possess a high specific surface area of 306 m2 g-1, a larger bandgap (by 0.2 eV), improved electron transport ability along the in-plane direction, and increased lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers because of the quantum confinement effect. As a consequence, the photocatalytic activities of g-C3N4 nanosheets have been remarkably improved in terms of OH radical generation and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

This is threatened unless renewable energy resources can be developed in the near future. Chemistry is expected to make important contributions to identify environmentally friendly solutions of the energy problem. One attractive strategy discussed in this Forum Article is the development of solar cells that are based on the sensitization of mesoscopic oxide films by dyes or quantum dots. These systems have already reached conversion efficiencies exceeding 11%. The underlying fundamental processes of light harvesting by the sensitizer, heterogeneous electron transfer from the electronically excited chromophore into the conduction band of the semiconductor oxide, and percolative migration of the injected electrons through the mesoporous film to the collector electrode will be described below in detail.

J	Hollister, SJ				Hollister, SJ			Porous scaffold design for tissue engineering	NATURE MATERIALS												A paradigm shift is taking place in medicine from using synthetic implants and tissue grafts to a tissue engineering approach that uses degradable porous material scaffolds integrated with biological cells or molecules to regenerate tissues. This new paradigm requires scaffolds that balance temporary mechanical function with mass transport to aid biological delivery and tissue regeneration. Little is known quantitatively about this balance as early scaffolds were not fabricated with precise porous architecture. Recent advances in both computational topology design ( CTD) and solid free- form fabrication ( SFF) have made it possible to create scaffolds with controlled architecture. This paper reviews the integration of CTD with SFF to build designer tissue- engineering scaffolds. It also details the mechanical properties and tissue regeneration achieved using designer scaffolds. Finally, future directions are suggested for using designer scaffolds with in vivo experimentation to optimize tissue- engineering treatments, and coupling designer scaffolds with cell printing to create designer material/ biofactor hybrids.

An extensive analysis of both basis set and relativistic effects is given. Results are compared with established pure density functionals. For lattice constants, HSE outperforms local spin-density approximation (LSDA) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.037 A for HSE vs 0.047 A for LSDA. For this specific test set, all pure functionals tested produce MAEs for band gaps of 1.0-1.3 eV, consistent with the very well-known fact that pure functionals severely underestimate this property. On the other hand, HSE yields a MAE smaller than 0.3 eV. Importantly, HSE correctly predicts semiconducting behavior in systems where pure functionals erroneously predict a metal, such as, for instance, Ge. The short-range nature of the exchange integrals involved in HSE calculations makes their computation notably faster than regular hybrid functionals. The current results, paired with earlier work, suggest that HSE is a fast and accurate alternative to established density functionals, especially for solid state calculations.

J	Heyd, J; Scuseria, GE				Heyd, J; Scuseria, GE			Efficient hybrid density functional calculations in solids: Assessment of the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof screened Coulomb hybrid functional	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												The present work introduces an efficient screening technique to take advantage of the fast spatial decay of the short range Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange used in the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) screened Coulomb hybrid density functional. The screened HF exchange decay properties and screening efficiency are compared with traditional hybrid functional calculations on solids. The HSE functional is then assessed using 21 metallic, semiconducting, and insulating solids. The examined properties include lattice constants, bulk moduli, and band gaps. The results obtained with HSE exhibit significantly smaller errors than pure density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For structural properties, the errors produced by HSE are up to 50% smaller than the errors of the local density approximation, PBE, and TPSS functionals used for comparison. When predicting band gaps of semiconductors, we found smaller errors with HSE, resulting in a mean absolute error of 0.2 eV (1.3 eV error, for all pure DFT functionals). In addition, we present timing results which show the computational time requirements of HSE to be only a factor of 2-4 higher than pure DFT functionals. These results make HSE an attractive choice for calculations of all types of solids. (C) 2004 American,Institute of Physics..

TIP4P/2005 is a rigid four site model which consists of three fixed point charges and one Lennard-Jones center. The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123 to 573 K and pressures up to 40 000 bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions. For example, it gives excellent predictions for the densities at 1 bar with a maximum density at 278 K and an averaged difference with experiment of 7x10(-4) g/cm(3).					Abascal, Jose L.

J	VandeVondele, J; Hutter, J				VandeVondele, Joost; Hutter, Juerg			Gaussian basis sets for accurate calculations on molecular systems in gas and condensed phases	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												We present a library of Gaussian basis sets that has been specifically optimized to perform accurate molecular calculations based on density functional theory. It targets a wide range of chemical environments, including the gas phase, interfaces, and the condensed phase. These generally contracted basis sets, which include diffuse primitives, are obtained minimizing a linear combination of the total energy and the condition number of the overlap matrix for a set of molecules with respect to the exponents and contraction coefficients of the full basis. Typically, for a given accuracy in the total energy, significantly fewer basis functions are needed in this scheme than in the usual split valence scheme, leading to a speedup for systems where the computational cost is dominated by diagonalization. More importantly, binding energies of hydrogen bonded complexes are of similar quality as the ones obtained with augmented basis sets, i.e., have a small (down to 0.2 kcal/mol) basis set superposition error, and the monomers have dipoles within 0.1 D of the basis set limit. However, contrary to typical augmented basis sets, there are no near linear dependencies in the basis, so that the overlap matrix is always well conditioned, also, in the condensed phase. The basis can therefore be used in first principles molecular dynamics simulations and is well suited for linear scaling calculations. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.

However, the OER activities of thermodynamically stable rutile iridium oxide (r-IrO2) and rutile iridium oxide (r-RuO2), normalized to catalyst mass or true surface area are not well-defined. Here we report a synthesis of r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) of similar to 6 nm, and examine their OER activities in acid and alkaline solutions. Both r-IrO2 and r-RuO2 NPs were highly active for OER, with r-RuO2 exhibiting up to 10 A/g(oxide) at 1.48 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. When comparing the two, r-RuO2 NPs were found to have slightly higher intrinsic and mass OER activities than r-IrO2 in both acid and basic solutions. Interestingly, these oxide NPs showed higher stability under OER conditions than commercial Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts. Our study shows that these r-RuO2 and r-IrO2 NPs can serve as a benchmark in the development of active OER catalysts for electrolyzers, metal-air batteries, and photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.

The goal of the software is to provide a powerful framework for data processing and interpretation, while giving users the ability to implement their own data reduction protocols. It is intended to be highly interactive, providing the user with a complete overview of the data at all stages of processing, and allowing the freedom to change parameters and reprocess data at any point. The program presents a variety of windows for the selection and viewing of data versus time, as well as features for the generation of X-Y plots, summary reports and export of data. In addition, it is capable of generating X-Y images from laser ablation rasters, and combining information from up to four separate elemental concentrations (intensities of red, green and blue, and the z-axis) in a false-colour three-dimensional image. By virtue of its underlying computing environment-Igor Pro-Iolite is capable of processing very large datasets (i.e., millions of timeslices) rapidly, and is thus ideal for the interrogation of multi-hour sessions of laser ablation data that can not be easily manipulated in conventional spreadsheet applications, for example. It is also well suited to multi-day sessions of solution-mode inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) or thermal ionisation mass spectrometer (TIMS) data. A strong emphasis is placed on the interpolation of parameters that vary with time by a variety of user selectable methods including smoothed cubic splines. Data are processed on a timeslice-by-timeslice basis, allowing outlier rejection and calculation of statistics to be employed directly on calculated results. This approach can reduce the risk of processing biases associated with the manipulation of integrated datasets, while also allowing the implementation of more complex data reduction methods.

Describing these noncovalent interactions accurately, including their positions in real space, constitutes a first step in the process of decoupling the complex balance of forces that define noncovalent interactions. Because of the size of macromolecules, the most common approach has been to assign van der Waals interactions (vdW), steric dashes (SC), and hydrogen bonds (HBs) based on pairwise distances between atoms according to their vdW radii. We recently developed an alternative perspective, derived from the electronic density: the non-covalent interactions (NCI) index [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 6498]. This index has the dual advantages of being generally transferable to diverse chemical applications and being very fast to compute, since it can be calculated from promolecular densities. Thus, NCI analysis is applicable to large systems, including proteins and DNA, where analysis of noncovalent interactions is of great potential value. Here, we describe the NCI computational algorithms and their implementation for the analysis and visualization of weak interactions, using both self-consistent fully quantum-mechanical as well as promolecular densities.

Here we report dramatically enhanced HER catalysis (an electrocatalytic current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a low overpotential of 187 mV vs RHE and a Tafel slope of 43 mV/decade) from metallic nanosheets of 1T-MoS2 chemically exfoliated via lithium intercalation from semiconducting 2H-MoS2 nanostructures grown directly on graphite. Structural characterization and electrochemical studies confirmed that the nanosheets of the metallic MoS2 polymorph exhibit facile electrode kinetics and low-loss electrical transport and possess a proliferated density of catalytic active sites. These distinct and previously unexploited features of 1T-MoS2 make these metallic nanosheets a highly competitive earth-abundant HER catalyst.

J	Derfus, AM; Chan, WCW; Bhatia, SN				Derfus, AM; Chan, WCW; Bhatia, SN			Probing the cytotoxicity of semiconductor quantum dots	NANO LETTERS												With their bright, photostable fluorescence, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) show promise as alternatives to organic dyes for biological labeling. Questions about their potential cytotoxicity, however, remain unanswered. While cytotoxicity of bulk cadmium selenide (CdSe) is well documented, a number of groups have suggested that CdSe QDs are cytocompatible, at least with some immortalized cell lines. Using primary hepatocytes as a liver model, we found that CdSe-core QDs were indeed acutely toxic under certain conditions. Specifically, we found that the cytotoxicity of QDs was modulated by processing parameters during synthesis, exposure to ultraviolet light, and surface coatings. Our data further suggest that cytotoxicity correlates with the liberation of free Cd2+ ions due to deterioration of the CdSe lattice. When appropriately coated, CdSe-core QDs can be rendered nontoxic and used to track cell migration and reorganization in vitro. Our results provide information for design criteria for the use of QDs in vitro and especially in vivo, where deterioration over time may occur.

Efficiency enhancement in low-bandgap polymer solar cells by processing with alkane dithiols	NATURE MATERIALS												High charge-separation efficiency combined with the reduced fabrication costs associated with solution processing and the potential for implementation on flexible substrates make 'plastic' solar cells a compelling option for tomorrow's photovoltaics. Attempts to control the donor/acceptor morphology in bulk heterojunction materials as required for achieving high power-conversion efficiency have, however, met with limited success. By incorporating a few volume per cent of alkanedithiols in the solution used to spin-cast films comprising a low-bandgap polymer and a fullerene derivative, the power-conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells (air-mass 1.5 global conditions) is increased from 2.8% to 5.5% through altering the bulk heterojunction morphology. This discovery can potentially enable morphological control in bulk heterojunction materials where thermal annealing is either undesirable or ineffective.

PROPKA3: Consistent Treatment of Internal and Surface Residues in Empirical p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> Predictions	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION												In this study, we have revised the rules and parameters for one of the most commonly used empirical pK(a) predictors, PROPKA, based on better physical description of the desolvation and dielectric response for the protein. We have introduced a new and consistent approach to interpolate the description between the previously distinct classifications into internal and surface residues, which otherwise is found to give rise to an erratic and discontinuous behavior. Since the goal of this study is to lay out the framework and validate the concept, it focuses on Asp and Glu residues where the protein pK(a) values and structures are assumed to be more reliable. The new and improved implementation is evaluated and discussed; it is found to agree better with experiment than the previous implementation (in parentheses): rmsd = 0.79 (0.91) for Asp and Glu, 0.75 (0.97) for Tyr, 0.65 (0.72) for Lys, and 1.00 (1.37) for His residues. The most significant advance, however, is in reducing the number of outliers and removing unreasonable sensitivity to small structural changes that arise from classifying residues as either internal or surface.

Determination of size and concentration of gold nanoparticles from UV-Vis spectra	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The dependence of the optical properties of spherical gold nanoparticles on particle size and wavelength were analyzed theoretically using multipole scattering theory, where the complex refractive index of gold was corrected for the effect of a reduced mean free path of the conduction electrons in small particles. To compare these theoretical results to experimental data, gold nanoparticles in the size range of 5 to 100 nm were synthesized and characterized with TEM and UV-vis. Excellent agreement was found between theory and experiment. It is shown that the data produced here can be used to determine both size and concentration of gold nanoparticles directly from UV-vis spectra. Equations for this purpose are derived, and the precision of various methods is discussed. The major aim of this work is to provide a simple and fast method to determine size and concentration of nanoparticles.

The toxicity of starch-coated silver nanoparticles was studied using normal human lung fibroblast cells (IMR-90) and human glioblastoma cells (U251). The toxicity was evaluated using changes in cell morphology, cell viability, metabolic activity, and oxidative stress. Ag-np reduced ATP content of the cell caused damage to mitochondria and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. DNA damage, as measured by single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) and cytokinesis blocked micronucleus assay (CBMN), was also dose-dependent and more prominent in the cancer cells. The nanoparticle treatment caused cell cycle arrest in G(2)/M phase possibly due to repair of damaged DNA. Annexin-V propidium iodide (PI) staining showed no massive apoptosis or necrosis. The transmission electron microscopic ITEM) analysis indicated the presence of Ag-np inside the mitochondria and nucleus, implicating their direct involvement in the mitochondrial toxicity and DNA damage. A possible mechanism of toxicity is proposed which involves disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by Ag-np leading to production of ROS and interruption of ATP synthesis, which in turn cause DNA damage. It is anticipated that DNA damage is augmented by deposition, followed by interactions of Ag-np to the DNA leading to cell cycle arrest in the G(2)/M phase. The higher sensitivity of U251 cells and their arrest in G2/M phase could be explored further for evaluating the potential use of Ag-np in cancer therapy.

Chemical analysis of graphene oxide films after heat and chemical treatments by X-ray photoelectron and Micro-Raman spectroscopy	CARBON												Several nanometer-thick graphene oxide films deposited on silicon nitride-on silicon substrates were exposed to nine different heat treatments (three in Argon, three in Argon and Hydrogen, and three in ultra-high vacuum), and also a film was held at 70 degrees C while being exposed to a vapor from hydrazine monohydrate. The films were characterized with atomic force microscopy to obtain local thickness and variation in thickness over extended regions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to measure significant reduction of the oxygen content of the films; heating in ultra-high vacuum was particularly effective. The overtone region of the Raman spectrum was used, for the first time, to provide a "fingerprint" of changing oxygen content. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mackerell, AD; Feig, M; Brooks, CL				Mackerell, AD; Feig, M; Brooks, CL			Extending the treatment of backbone energetics in protein force fields: Limitations of gas-phase quantum mechanics in reproducing protein conformational distributions in molecular dynamics simulations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules. The LMP2/ce-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of phi and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement. with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A perpendicular-anisotropy CoFeB-MgO magnetic tunnel junction	NATURE MATERIALS												Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJS) with ferromagnetic electrodes possessing a perpendicular magnetic easy axis are of great interest as they have a potential for realizing next-generation hight-density non-volatile memory and logic chips with high thermal stability and low critical current for current-induced magnetization switching(1-3). To attain perpendicular anisotropy, a number of material system have been explored as electrodes, which include rare-earth/transition-metal alloys(4,5), L1(0)-ordered (Co, Fe)-Pt alloys(3,6,7) and Co/(Pd, Pt) multilayers(1,8-10). However, none of them so far satisfy high thermal stability at reduced dimension, low-current current-induced magnetization switching and high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio all at the same time. Here, we use interfacial perpendicular anisotropy between the ferro-magnetic electrodes and the tunnel barrier of the MTJ by employing the material combination of CoFeB-MgO, a system widely adopted to produce a giant tunnel magnetoresistance ratio in MTJs with in-plane anisotropy(11-13). This approach requires no material other than those used in conventional in-plane-anisotropy MTJs. The perpendicular MTJs consisting of Ta/CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/Ta show a high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, over 120%, high thermal stability at dimension as low as 40 nm diameter and a low switching current of 49 mu A.

Here we synthesize and explore the biological applications of nano-graphene oxide (NGO), i.e., single-layer graphene oxide sheets down to a few nanometers in lateral width. We develop functionalization chemistry in order to impart solubility and compatibility of NGO in biological environments. We obtain size separated pegylated NGO sheets that are soluble in buffers and serum without agglomeration. The NGO sheets are found to be photoluminescent in the visible and infrared regions. The intrinsic photoluminescence (PL) of NGO is used for live cell imaging in the near-infrared (NIR) with little background. We found that simple physisorption via pi-stacking can be used for loading doxorubicin, a widely used cancer drug onto NGO functionalized with antibody for selective killing of cancer cells in vitro. Owing to its small size, intrinsic optical properties, large specific surface area, low cost, and useful non-covalent interactions with aromatic drug molecules, NGO is a promising new material for biological and medical applications.

Graphitic carbon nitride materials: variation of structure and morphology and their use as metal-free catalysts	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY												Graphitic carbon nitride, g-C3N4, can be made by polymerization of cyanamide, dicyandiamide or melamine. Depending on reaction conditions, different materials with different degrees of condensation, properties and reactivities are obtained. The firstly formed polymeric C3N4 structure, melon, with pendant amino groups, is a highly ordered polymer. Further reaction leads to more condensed and less defective C3N4 species, based on tri-s-triazine (C6N7) units as elementary building blocks. High resolution transmission electron microscopy proves the extended two-dimensional character of the condensation motif. Due to the polymerization-type synthesis from a liquid precursor, a variety of material nanostructures such as nanoparticles or mesoporous powders can be accessed. Those nanostructures also allow fine tuning of properties, the ability for intercalation, as well as the possibility to give surface-rich materials for heterogeneous reactions. Due to the special semiconductor properties of carbon nitrides, they show unexpected catalytic activity for a variety of reactions, such as for the activation of benzene, trimerization reactions, and also the activation of carbon dioxide. Model calculations are presented to explain this unusual case of heterogeneous, metal-free catalysis. Carbon nitride can also act as a heterogeneous reactant, and a new family of metal nitride nanostructures can be accessed from the corresponding oxides.

The experiments were performed on two 30W air-cooled Incoatec I mu S microfocus sources with multilayer optics mounted on a Bruker D8 goniometer with a SMART APEX II CCD detector. All data were analysed, processed and refined using standard Bruker software. The results show that AgK radiation can be beneficial when heavy elements are involved. A numerical absorption correction based on the positions and indices of the crystal faces is shown to be of limited use for the highly focused microsource beams, presumably because the assumption that the crystal is completely bathed in a (top-hat profile) beam of uniform intensity is no longer valid. Fortunately the empirical corrections implemented in SADABS, although originally intended as a correction for absorption, also correct rather well for the variations in the effective volume of the crystal irradiated. In three of the cases studied (two Ag and one Mo) the final SHELXL R1 against all data after application of empirical corrections implemented in SADABS was below 1%. Since such corrections are designed to optimize the agreement of the intensities of equivalent reflections with different paths through the crystal but the same Bragg 2 angles, a further correction is required for the 2 dependence of the absorption. For this, SADABS uses the transmission factor of a spherical crystal with a user-defined value of r (where is the linear absorption coefficient and r is the effective radius of the crystal); the best results are obtained when r is biased towards the smallest crystal dimension. The results presented here suggest that the IUCr publication requirement that a numerical absorption correction must be applied for strongly absorbing crystals is in need of revision.

J	Grosvenor, AP; Kobe, BA; Biesinger, MC; McIntyre, NS				Grosvenor, AP; Kobe, BA; Biesinger, MC; McIntyre, NS			Investigation of multiplet splitting of Fe 2p XPS spectra and bonding in iron compounds	SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS												Ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) compounds were investigated by XPS to determine the usefulness of calculated multiplet peaks to fit high-resolution iron 2p(3/2) spectra from high-spin compounds. The multiplets were found to fit most spectra well, particularly when contributions attributed to surface peaks and shake-up satellites were included. This information was useful for fitting of the complex Fe 2p(3/2) spectra for Fe3O4 where both Fe2+ and Fe3+ species are present. It was found that as the ionic bond character of the iron - ligand bond increased, the binding energy associated with either the ferrous or ferric 2p(3/2) photoelectron peak also increased. This was determined to be due to the decrease in shielding of the iron cation by the more increasingly electronegative ligands. It was also observed that the difference in energy between a high-spin iron 2p(3/2) peak and its corresponding shake-up satellite peak increased as the electronegativity of the ligand increased. The extrinsic loss spectra for ion oxides are also reported; these are as characteristic of each species as are the photoelectron peaks. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

These materials are high-k dielectrics with degenerate or thermally activated n-type semiconductivity. Conventional super-exchange or double-exchange interactions cannot produce long-range magnetic order at concentrations of magnetic cations of a few percent. We propose that ferromagnetic exchange here, and in dilute ferromagnetic nitrides, is mediated by shallow donor electrons that form bound magnetic polarons, which overlap to create a spin-split impurity band. The Curie temperature in the mean-field approximation varies as (xdelta)(1/2) where x and delta are the concentrations of magnetic cations and donors, respectively. High Curie temperatures arise only when empty minority-spin or majority-spin d states lie at the Fermi level in the impurity band. The magnetic phase diagram includes regions of semiconducting and metallic ferromagnetism, cluster paramagnetism, spin glass and canted antiferromagnetism.

A key limitation to this technology is its low energy density and for this reason there is considerable interest in exploring pseudocapacitive materials where faradaic mechanisms offer increased levels of energy storage. Here we show that the capacitive charge-storage properties of mesoporous films of iso-oriented alpha-MoO3 are superior to those of either mesoporous amorphous material or non-porous crystalline MoO3. Whereas both crystalline and amorphous mesoporous materials show redox pseudocapacitance, the iso-oriented layered crystalline domains enable lithium ions to be inserted into the van der Waals gaps of the alpha-MoO3. We propose that this extra contribution arises from an intercalation pseudocapacitance, which occurs on the same timescale as redox pseudocapacitance. The result is increased charge-storage capacity without compromising charge/discharge kinetics in mesoporous crystalline MoO3.

Trends in electrocatalysis on extended and nanoscale Pt-bimetallic alloy surfaces	NATURE MATERIALS												One of the key objectives in fuel-cell technology is to improve and reduce Pt loading as the oxygen-reduction catalyst. Here, we show a fundamental relationship in electrocatalytic trends on Pt3M (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Ti, V) surfaces between the experimentally determined surface electronic structure (the d-band centre) and activity for the oxygen-reduction reaction. This relationship exhibits 'volcano-type' behaviour, where the maximum catalytic activity is governed by a balance between adsorption energies of reactive intermediates and surface coverage by spectator (blocking) species. The electrocatalytic trends established for extended surfaces are used to explain the activity pattern of Pt3M nanocatalysts as well as to provide a fundamental basis for the catalytic enhancement of cathode catalysts. By combining simulations with experiments in the quest for surfaces with desired activity, an advanced concept in nanoscale catalyst engineering has been developed.

During the hydrothermal reaction, both of the reduction of graphene oxide and loading of P25 were achieved. The as-prepared P25-graphene photocatalyst possessed great adsorptivity of dyes, extended light absorption range, and efficient charge separation properties simultaneously, which was rarely reported in other TiO2-carbon photocatalysts. Hence, in the photodegradation of methylene blue, a significant enhancement in the reaction rate was observed with P25-graphene, compared to the bare P25 and P25-CNTs with the same carbon content.

Quantifying Defects in Graphene via Raman Spectroscopy at Different Excitation Energies	NANO LETTERS												We present a Raman study of Ar+-bombarded graphene samples with increasing ion doses. This allows us to have a controlled, increasing, amount of defects. We find that I the ratio between the D and G peak intensities, for a given defect density, strongly depends on the laser excitation energy. We quantify this effect and present a simple equation for the determination of the point defect density in graphene via Raman spectroscopy for any visible excitation energy. We note that, for all excitations, the D to G intensity ratio reaches a maximum for an interdefect distance similar to 3 nm. Thus, a given ratio could correspond to two different defect densities, above or below the maximum. The analysis of the G peak width and its dispersion with excitation energy solves this ambiguity.

Engineering the surface structure of MoS<sub>2</sub> to preferentially expose active edge sites for electrocatalysis	NATURE MATERIALS												Controlling surface structure at the atomic scale is paramount to developing effective catalysts. For example, the edge sites of MoS2 are highly catalytically active and are thus preferred at the catalyst surface over MoS2 basal planes, which are inert. However, thermodynamics favours the presence of the basal plane, limiting the number of active sites at the surface. Herein, we engineer the surface structure of MoS2 to preferentially expose edge sites to effect improved catalysis by successfully synthesizing contiguous large-area thin films of a highly ordered double-gyroid MoS2 bicontinuous network with nanoscaled pores. The high surface curvature of this catalyst mesostructure exposes a large fraction of edge sites, which, along with its high surface area, leads to excellent activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This work elucidates how morphological control of materials at the nanoscale can significantly impact the surface structure at the atomic scale, enabling new opportunities for enhancing surface properties for catalysis and other important technological applications.

Complexes 1-3 were synthesized from the respective ligand and [Cu(CH3CN)(4)] PF6 in a 2 : 1 molar ratio: [Cu(HL)(2)] PF6 (1), [Cu-2( HLMe3)(4)](PF6)(2) (2), [Cu(HLPh3)(2)]PF6 (3). Complex 4, [Cu(HL)(CH3CN)(PPh3)]PF6, was synthesized from the reaction of HL with [Cu(CH3CN)(4)]PF6 and PPh3 in a 1: 1:1 molar ratio. X-Ray crystal structures reveal that complexes 1, 3 and 4 are mononuclear Cu(I) species, while complex 2 is a Cu(I) dimer. The copper ions are four-coordinate with geometries ranging from distorted tetrahedral to seesaw in 1, 2, and 4. Complexes 1 and 2 are very air sensitive and they display similar electrochemical properties. The coordination geometry of complex 3 is nearly linear, two-coordinate. Complex 3 is exceptionally stable with respect to oxidation in the air, and its cyclic voltammetry shows no oxidation wave in the range of 0 - 1.5 V. The unusual inertness of complex 3 towards oxidation is attributed to the protection from bulky triphenyl substituent of the HLPh3 ligand.

Their key limitation has been extremely low electronic conductivity, until now believedto be intrinsic to this family of compounds. Here we show that controlled cation non-stoichiometry combined with solid-solution doping by metals supervalent to Li+ increases the electronic conductivity of LiFePO4 by a factor of similar to10(8).

A fundamental link between these two fields can be established using molecular magnetic materials and, in particular, single-molecule magnets. Here, we review the first progress in the resulting field, molecular spintronics, which will enable the manipulation of spin and charges in electronic devices containing one or more molecules. We discuss the advantages over more conventional materials, and the potential applications in information storage and processing.

Nickel-Iron Oxyhydroxide Oxygen-Evolution Electrocatalysts: The Role of Intentional and Incidental Iron Incorporation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Fe plays a critical, but not yet understood, role in enhancing the activity of the Ni-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. We report electrochemical, in situ electrical, photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurements on Ni1-xFex(OH)(2)/Ni1-xFexOOH thin films to investigate the changes in electronic properties, OER activity, and structure as a result of Fe inclusion. We developed a simple method for purification of KOH electrolyte that uses precipitated bulk Ni(OH)(2) to absorb Fe impurities. Cyclic voltammetry on rigorously Fe-free Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH reveals new Ni redox features and no significant OER current until >400 mV overpotential, different from previous reports which were likely affected by Fe impurities. We show through controlled crystallization that beta-NiOOH is less active for OER than the disordered gamma-NiOOH starting material and that previous reports of increased activity for beta-NiOOH are due to incorporation of Fe-impurities during the crystallization process. Through-film in situ conductivity measurements show a >30-fold increase in film conductivity with Fe addition, but this change in conductivity is not sufficient to explain the observed changes in activity. Measurements of activity as a function of film thickness on Au and glassy carbon substrates are consistent with the hypothesis that Fe exerts a partial-charge-transfer activation effect on Ni, similar to that observed for noble-metal electrode surfaces. These results have significant implications for the design and study of Ni1-xFexOOH OER electrocatalysts, which are the fastest measured OER catalysts under basic conditions.

J	Henkelman, G; Jónsson, H				Henkelman, G; Jónsson, H			Improved tangent estimate in the nudged elastic band method for finding minimum energy paths and saddle points	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												An improved way of estimating the local tangent in the nudged elastic band method for finding minimum energy paths is presented. In systems where the force along the minimum energy path is large compared to the restoring force perpendicular to the path and when many images of the system are included in the elastic band, kinks can develop and prevent the band from converging to the minimum energy path. We show how the kinks arise and present an improved way of estimating the local tangent which solves the problem. The task of finding an accurate energy and configuration for the saddle point is also discussed and examples given where a complementary method, the dimer method, is used to efficiently converge to the saddle point. Both methods only require the first derivative of the energy and can, therefore, easily be applied in plane wave based density-functional theory calculations. Examples are given from studies of the exchange diffusion mechanism in a Si crystal, Al addimer formation on the Al(100) surface, and dissociative adsorption of CH4 on an Ir(111) surface.

Organic semiconductors and colloidal quantum dots are considered the main candidates for this application. However, stumbling blocks in organic lasing(1-4) include intrinsic losses from bimolecular annihilation and the conflicting requirements of high charge carrier mobility and large stimulated emission; whereas challenges pertaining to Auger losses and charge transport in quantum dots(5-7) still remain. Herein, we reveal that solution-processed organic-inorganic halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3 where X = Cl, Br, I), which demonstrated huge potential in photovoltaics(8-11), also have promising optical gain. Their ultra-stable amplified spontaneous emission at strikingly low thresholds stems from their large absorption coeffcients, ultralow bulk defect densities and slow Auger recombination. Straightforward visible spectral tunability (390-790 nm) is demonstrated. Importantly, in view of their balanced ambipolar charge transport characteristics(8), these materials may show electrically driven lasing.

J	Grimme, S				Grimme, S			Semiempirical hybrid density functional with perturbative second-order correlation	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (a(x)) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G2/97 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum a(x) is found to be quite large (53% with c=27%) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G2/97 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5 kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minium errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10-20 kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.

Transfer of Large-Area Graphene Films for High-Performance Transparent Conductive Electrodes	NANO LETTERS												Graphene, a two-dimensional monolayer of sp(2)-bonded carbon atoms, has been attracting great interest due to its unique transport properties. One of the promising applications of graphene is as a transparent conductive electrode owing to its high optical transmittance and conductivity. In this paper, we report on an improved transfer process of large-area graphene grown on Cu foils by chemical vapor deposition. The transferred graphene films have high electrical conductivity and high optical transmittance that make them suitable for transparent conductive electrode applications. The improved transfer processes will also be of great value for the fabrication of electronic devices such as field effect transistor and bilayer pseudospin field effect transistor devices.

Theoretic studies show that intentional doping is a promising route for this goal, and the doped graphene might promise fascinating properties and widespread applications. However, there is no experimental example and electrical testing of the substitutionally doped graphene up to date. Here, we synthesize the N-doped graphene by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. We find that most of them are few-layer graphene, although single-layer graphene can be occasionally detected. As doping accompanies with the recombination of carbon atoms into graphene in the CVD process, N atoms can be substitutionally doped into the graphene lattice, which is hard to realize by other synthetic methods. Electrical measurements show that the N-doped graphene exhibits an n-type behavior, indicating substitutional doping can effectively modulate the electrical properties of graphene. Our finding provides a new experimental instance of graphene and would promote the research and applications of graphene.

Alloys of platinum and early transition metals as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts	NATURE CHEMISTRY												The widespread use of low-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells for mobile applications will require significant reductions in the amount of expensive Pt contained within their cathodes, which drive the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Although progress has been made in this respect, further reductions through the development of more active and stable electrocatalysts are still necessary. Here we describe a new set of ORR electrocatalysts consisting of Pd or Pt alloyed with early transition metals such as Sc or Y. They were identified using density functional theory calculations as being the most stable Pt- and Pd-based binary alloys with ORR activity likely to be better than Pt. Electrochemical measurements show that the activity of polycrystalline Pt(3)Sc and Pt(3)Y electrodes is enhanced relative to pure Pt by a factor of 1.5-1.8 and 6-10, respectively, in the range 0.9-0.87 V.

The iridium complexes have two cyclometalated ((CN)-N-boolean AND) ligands and a single monoanionic, bidentate ancillary ligand (LX). i.e., (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(LX). The (CN)-N-boolean AND ligands can be any of a wide variety of organometallic ligands. The LX ligands used for this study were all beta -diketonates, with the major emphasis placed On acetylacetonate (acac) complexes. The majority of the (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(acac) complexes phosphoresce with high quantum efficiencies (solution quantum yields, 0.1-0.6), and microsecond lifetimes (e.g., 1-14 mus). The strongly allowed phosphorescence in these complexes is the result of significant spin-orbit coupling of the Ir center, The lowest energy (emissive) excited state in these (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(acac) complexes is a mixture of (MLCT)-M-3 and (3)(pi-pi*) states. By choosing the appropriate (CN)-N-boolean AND ligand, (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(acac) complexes can be prepared which emit in any color from green to red. Simple, systematic changes in the (CN)-N-boolean AND ligands, which lead to bathochromic shifts of the free ligands, lead to similar bathochromic shifts in the Ir complexes of the same ligands, consistent with "(CN2)-N-boolean AND-Ir"-centered emission. Three of the (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(acac) complexes were used as dopants for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The three Ir complexes, i.e., bis(2-phenylpyridinato-N,C-2')iridium(acetylacetonate) [ppy(2)Ir(acac)], bis(2-phenyl benzothiozolato-N,C-2')iridium(acetylacetonate) [bt(2)Ir(acac)], and bis(2-(2'-benzothienyl)-pyridinato-N,C-3')iridium(acetylacetonate) [btp(2)Ir(acac)], were doped into the emissive region of multilayer, vapor-deposited OLEDs. The ppy(2)Ir(acac)-, bt(2)Ir(acac)-, and btp(2)Ir(acac)-based OLEDs give green, yellow, and red electroluminescence, respectively, with very similar current-voltage characteristics. The OLEDs give high external quantum efficiencies, ranging from 6 to 12.3%, with the ppy(2)Ir(acac) giving the highest efficiency (12.3%, 38 lm/W, > 50 Cd/A). The btp(2)Ir(acac)-based device gives saturated red emission with a quantum efficiency of 6.5% and a luminance efficiency of 2.2 lm/W. These (CN2Ir)-N-boolean AND(acac)-doped OLEDs show some of the highest efficiencies reported for organic light emitting diodes. The high efficiencies result from efficient trapping and radiative relaxation of the singlet and triplet excitons formed in the electroluminescent process.

Graphite is a practical anode material used for LIB, because of its capability for reversible lithium ion intercalation in the layered crystals, and the structural similarities of GNS to graphite may provide another type of intercalation anode compound. While the accommodation of lithium in these layered compounds is influenced by the layer spacing between the graphene nanosheets, control of the intergraphene sheet distance through interacting molecules such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) or fullerenes (C-60) might be crucial for enhancement of the storage capacity. The specific capacity of GNS was found to be 540 mAh/g, which is much larger than that of graphite, and this was increased up to 730 mAh/g and 784 mAh/g, respectively, by the incorporation of macromolecules of CNT and C-60 to the GNS.

A purification procedure was developed to obtain pure N-bonded isomers of both types of sensitizers. The photovoltaic data of the purified N3 and N621 sensitizers adsorbed on TiO2 films in their monoprotonated and diprotonated state, exhibited remarkable power conversion efficiency at 1 sun, 11.18 and 9.57%, respectively. An extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT)-Time Dependent DFT study of these sensitizers in solution was performed, investigating the effect of protonation of the terminal carboxylic groups and of the counterions on the electronic structure and optical properties of the dyes. The calculated absorption spectra are in good agreement with the experiment, thus allowing a detailed assignment of the UV-vis spectral features of the two types of dyes. The computed alignments of the molecular orbitals of the different complexes with the band edges of a model TiO2 nanoparticle provide additional insights into the electronic factors governing the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cell devices.

To mimic the tactile sensing properties of natural skin, large arrays of pixel pressure sensors on a flexible and stretchable substrate are required. We demonstrate flexible, capacitive pressure sensors with unprecedented sensitivity and very short response times that can be inexpensively fabricated over large areas by microstructuring of thin films of the biocompatible elastomer polydimethylsiloxane. The pressure sensitivity of the microstructured films far surpassed that exhibited by unstructured elastomeric films of similar thickness, and is tunable by using different microstructures. The microstructured films were integrated into organic field-effect transistors as the dielectric layer, forming a new type of active sensor device with similarly excellent sensitivity and response times.

J	Ritchie, RO				Ritchie, Robert O.			The conflicts between strength and toughness	NATURE MATERIALS												The attainment of both strength and toughness is a vital requirement for most structural materials; unfortunately these properties are generally mutually exclusive. Although the quest continues for stronger and harder materials, these have little to no use as bulk structural materials without appropriate fracture resistance. It is the lower-strength, and hence higher-toughness, materials that find use for most safety-critical applications where premature or, worse still, catastrophic fracture is unacceptable. For these reasons, the development of strong and tough (damage-tolerant) materials has traditionally been an exercise in compromise between hardness versus ductility. Drawing examples from metallic glasses, natural and biological materials, and structural and biomimetic ceramics, we examine some of the newer strategies in dealing with this conflict. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between the mechanisms that individually contribute to strength and toughness, noting that these phenomena can originate from very different lengthscales in a material's structural architecture. We show how these new and natural materials can defeat the conflict of strength versus toughness and achieve unprecedented levels of damage tolerance within their respective material classes.

J	Sreerama, N; Woody, RW				Sreerama, N; Woody, RW			Estimation of protein secondary structure from circular dichroism spectra: Comparison of CONTIN, SELCON, and CDSSTR methods with an expanded reference set	ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY												We have expanded the reference set of proteins used in SELCON3 by including 11 additional proteins (selected from the reference sets of Yang and co-workers and Keiderling and co-workers). Depending on the wavelength range and whether or not denatured proteins are included in the reference set, five reference sets were constructed with the number of reference proteins varying from 29 to 48. The performance of three popular methods for estimating protein secondary structure fractions from CD spectra (implemented in software packages CONTIN, SELCON3, and CDSSTR) and a variant of CONTIN, CONTIN/LL, that incorporates the variable selection method in the locally linearized model in CONTIN, were examined using the five reference sets described here, and a aa-protein reference set. Secondary structure assignments from DSSP were used in the analysis. The performances of all three methods were comparable, in spite of the differences in the algorithms used in the three software packages. While CDSSTR performed the best with a smaller reference set and larger wavelength range, and CONTIN/LL performed the best with a larger reference set and smaller wavelength range, the performances for individual secondary structures were mixed. Analyzing protein CD spectra using all three methods should improve the reliability of predicted secondary structural fractions. The three programs are provided in CDPro software package and have been modified for easier use with the different reference sets described in this paper.

All simulations were carried out in the microcanonical NVE ensemble, using 901 water molecules in a cubic simulation cell furnished with periodic boundary conditions at 298 K. The SHAKE algorithm was used to keep water molecules rigid. Nanosecond trajectories were calculated with all water models for high statistical accuracy. The characteristic self-diffusion coefficients D and radial distribution functions, g(OO), g(OH), and g(HH) for all five water models were determined and compared to experimental data. The effects of velocity resealing on the self-diffusion coefficient D were examined. All these empirical water models used in this study are similar by having three interaction sites, but the small differences in their pair potentials composed of Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic terms give significant differences in the calculated self-diffusion coefficients, and in the height of the second peak of the radial distribution function g(OO).

Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY	Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry											The ability to control the size, shape, and material of a surface has reinvigorated the field of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Because excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance of a nanostructured surface or nanoparticle lies at the heart of SERS, the ability to reliably control the surface characteristics has taken SERS from an interesting surface phenomenon to a rapidly developing analytical tool. This article first explains many fundamental features of SERS and then describes the use of nanosphere lithography for the fabrication of highly reproducible and robust SERS substrates. In particular, we review metal film over nanosphere surfaces as excellent candidates for several experiments that were once impossible with more primitive SERS substrates (e.g., metal island films). The article also describes progress in applying S LAX'S to the detection of chemical warfare agents and several biological molecules.

More work has been done using microporous carbons than with the other materials and most of the commercially available devices use carbon electrodes and an organic electrolytes. The energy density of these devices is 3-5 Wh/kg with a power density of 300-500 W/kg for high efficiency (90-95%) charge/discharges. Projections of future developments using carbon indicate that energy densities of 10 Wh/kg or higher are likely with power densities of 1-2 kW/kg. A key problem in the fabrication of these advanced devices is the bonding of the thin electrodes to a current collector such the contact resistance is less than 0.1 Omega cm(2) Special attention is given in the paper to comparing the power density characteristics of ultracapacitors and batteries. The comparisons should be made at the same charge/discharge efficiency. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Here, we quantify the ability of the recently presented CHARMM36 (C36) force field (FF) to reproduce various NMR observables using MD simulations. The studied NMR properties include backbone scalar couplings across hydrogen bonds, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and relaxation order parameter, as well as scalar couplings, RDCs, and order parameters for side-chain amino- and methyl-containing groups. It is shown that the C36 FF leads to better correlation with experimental data compared to the CHARMM22/CMAP FF and suggest using C36 in protein simulations. Although both CHARMM FFs contains the same nonbond parameters, our results show how the changes in the internal parameters associated with the peptide backbone via CMAP and the (1) and (2) dihedral parameters leads to improved treatment of the analyzed nonbond interactions. This highlights the importance of proper treatment of the internal covalent components in modeling nonbond interactions with molecular mechanics FFs. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Synthesis of water soluble graphene	NANO LETTERS												A facile and scalable preparation of aqueous solutions of isolated, sparingly sulfonated graphene is reported. C-13 NMR and FTIR spectra indicate that the bulk of the oxygen-containing functional groups was removed from graphene oxide. The electrical conductivity of thin evaporated films of graphene (1250 S/m) relative to similarly prepared graphite (6120 S/m) implies that an extended conjugated Sp(2) network is restored in the water soluble graphene.																			1530-6984	1530-6992				JUN	2008	8	6					1679	1682		10.1021/nl080604h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl080604h								18498200					WOS:000256742000021

The main program, PRIMUS, has a menu-driven graphical user interface calling computational modules to perform data manipulation and analysis. Experimental data in binary OTOKO format can be reduced by calling the program SAPOKO, which includes statistical analysis of time frames, averaging and scaling. Tools to generate the angular axis and detector response files from diffraction patterns of calibration samples, as well as binary to ASCII transformation programs, are available. Several types of ASCII files can be directly imported into PRIMUS, in particular, sasCIF or ILL-type files are read without modification. PRIMUS provides basic data manipulation functions ( averaging, background subtraction, merging of data measured in different angular ranges, extrapolation to zero sample concentration, etc.) and computes invariants from Guinier and Porod plots. Several external modules coupled with PRIMUS via pop-up menus enable the user to evaluate the characteristic functions by indirect Fourier transformation, to perform peak analysis for partially ordered systems and to find shape approximations in terms of three-parametric geometrical bodies. For the analysis of mixtures, PRIMUS enables model-independent singular value decomposition or linear fitting if the scattering from the components is known. An interface is also provided to the general non-linear fitting program MIXTURE, which is designed for quantitative analysis of multicomponent systems represented by simple geometrical bodies, taking shape and size polydispersity as well as interparticle interference effects into account.

Photodegradation Performance of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> Fabricated by Directly Heating Melamine	LANGMUIR												The g-C3N4 photocatalyst was synthesized by directly heating the low-cost melamine. The methyl orange dye (MO) was selected as a photodegrading goal to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of as-prepared g-C3N4. The comparison experiments indicate that the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 can be largely improved by the Ag loading. The strong acid radical ion (SO42- or NO3-) can promote the degrading rate of MO for g-C3N4 photocatalysis system. The MO degradation over the g-C3N4 is mainly attributed to the photoreduction process induced by the photogenerated electrons. Our results clearly indicate that the metal-free g-C3N4 has good performance in photodegradation of organic pollutant.					李, 朝升/J-4034-2016; Zou, Zhigang/AFG-8475-2022; zhang, jingxing/KCY-4726-2024	Yan, Shicheng/0000-0002-3432-9117													0743-7463					SEP 1	2009	25	17					10397	10401		10.1021/la900923z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la900923z								19705905					WOS:000269197500107

Perovskites: The Emergence of a New Era for Low-Cost, High-Efficiency Solar Cells	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS												Over the last 12 months, we have witnessed an unexpected breakthrough and rapid evolution in the field of emerging photovoltaics, with the realization of highly efficient solid-state hybrid solar cells based on organometal trihalide perovskite absorbers. In this Perspective, the steps that have led to this discovery are discussed, and the future of this rapidly advancing concept have been considered. It is likely that the next few years of solar research will advance this technology to the very highest efficiencies while retaining the very lowest cost and embodied energy. Provided that the stability of the perovskite-based technology can be proven, we will witness the emergence of a contender for ultimately low-cost solar power.

Trends in activity for the water electrolyser reactions on 3<i>d</i> M(Ni,Co,Fe,Mn) hydr(oxy)oxide catalysts	NATURE MATERIALS												Design and synthesis of materials for efficient electrochemical transformation of water to molecular hydrogen and of hydroxyl ions to oxygen in alkaline environments is of paramount importance in reducing energy losses in water-alkali electrolysers. Here, using 3d-M hydr(oxy)oxides, with distinct stoichiometries and morphologies in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) regions, we establish the overall catalytic activities for these reaction as a function of a more fundamental property, a descriptor, OH-M2+delta bond strength (0 <= delta <= 1.5). This relationship exhibits trends in reactivity (Mn < Fe < Co < Ni), which is governed by the strength of the OH-M2+delta energetic (Ni < Co < Fe < Mn). These trends are found to be independent of the source of the OH, either the supporting electrolyte (for the OER) or the water dissociation product (for the HER). The successful identification of these electrocatalytic trends provides the foundation for rational design of 'active sites' for practical alkaline HER and OER electrocatalysts.

J	Jakalian, A; Jack, DB; Bayly, CI				Jakalian, A; Jack, DB; Bayly, CI			Fast, efficient generation of high-quality atomic charges. AM1-BCC model: II. Parameterization and validation	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AMI population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of >2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER. 13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules.

Many researchers are devoting considerable effort to finding materials with larger bandgaps than that of GaN. Here we show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising material for such laser devices because it has a direct bandgap in the ultraviolet region. We obtained a pure hBN single crystal under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, which shows a dominant luminescence peak and a series of s-like exciton absorption bands around 215 nm, proving it to be a direct-bandgap material. Evidence for room-temperature ultraviolet lasing at 215 nm by accelerated electron excitation is provided by the enhancement and narrowing of the longitudinal mode, threshold behaviour of the excitation current dependence of the emission intensity, and a far-field pattern of the transverse mode.

Black dye containing different degrees of protonation {(C2H5)(3)NH}[Ru(H(3)tcterpy)(NCS)(3)] 1, {(C4H9)(4)N}(2)[Ru(H(2)tcterpy)(NCS)(3)] 2, {(C4H9)(4)N}(3)[RU(Htcterpy)(NCS)(3)] 3, and {(C4H9)(4)N}(4)[Ru(tcterpy)(NCS)(3)] 4 (tcterpy = 4,4',4 " -tricarboxy-2,2':6',2 " -terpyridine) have been synthesized and fully characterized by UV-vis, emission, IR, Raman, NMR, cyclic voltammetry, and X-ray diffraction studies. The crystal structure of complex 2 confirms the presence of a Ru(II)N6 central core derived from the terpyridine ligand and three N-bonded thiocyanates. Intermolecular H-bonding between carboxylates on neighboring terpyridines gives rise to 2-D H-bonded arrays. The absorption and emission maxima of the black dye show a bathochromic shift with decreasing pH and exhibit pH-dependent excited-state lifetimes. The red-shift of the emission maxima is due to better pi -acceptor properties of the acid form that lowers the energy of the CT excited state. The low-energy metal-to-ligand charge-transfer absorption band showed marked solvatochromism due to the presence of thiocyanate ligands. The Ru(II)/(III) oxidation potential of the black dye and the ligand-based reduction potential shifted cathodically with decreasing number of protons and showed more reversible character. The adsorption of complex 3 from methoxyacetonitrile solution onto transparent TiO2 films was interpreted by a Langmuir isotherm yielding an adsorption equilibrium constant, K-ads, of (1.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(5) M-1. The amount of dye adsorbed at monolayer saturation was (n(alpha) = 6.9 +/- 0.3) x 10(-8) mol/mg of TiO2, which is around 30% less than that of the cis-di(thiocyanato)bis(2,2'-bipyridyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate)-ruthenium(II) complex. The black dye, when anchored to nanocrystalline;TiO2. films achieves very efficient sensitization over the whole visible range extending into the near-IR region up to 920 nm, yielding over 80% incident photon to-current efficiencies (IPCE). solar cells containing the black dye were subjected to analysis by a photovoltaic calibration laboratory (NREL, U.S.A.) to determine their solar-to-electric conversion efficiency under standard AM 1.5 sunlight. A short circuit photocurrent density obtained was 20.5 mA/cm(2), and the open circuit voltage was 0.72 V corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 10.4%.

Graphene oxide dispersions in organic solvents	LANGMUIR												The dispersion behavior of graphene oxide indifferent organic solvents has been investigated. As-prepared graphite oxide could be dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, tetrahydrofuran, and ethylene glycol. In all of these solvents, full exfoliation of the graphite oxide material into individual, single-layer graphene oxide sheets was achieved by sonication. The graphene oxide dispersions exhibited long-term stability and were made of sheets between a few hundred nanometers and a few micrometers large, similar to the case of graphene oxide dispersions in water. These results should facilitate the manipulation and processing of graphene-based materials for different applications.					Alonso, Julio/D-5781-2016; Tascon, Juan M.

Thin MnO2 films deposited on a platinum substrate and thick MnO2 composite electrodes were used. First, the cyclic voltammetry data established that only a thin layer of MnO2 is involved in the redox process and electrochemically active. Second, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that the manganese oxidation state was varying from III to IV for the reduced and oxidized forms of thin film electrodes, respectively, during the charge/discharge process. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data also show that Na+ cations from the electrolyte were involved in the charge storage process of MnO2 thin film electrodes. However, the Na/ Mn ratio for the reduced electrode was much lower than what was anticipated for charge compensation dominated by Na+, thus suggesting the involvement of protons in the pseudofaradaic mechanism. An important finding of this work is that, unlike thin film electrodes, no change of the manganese oxidation state was detected for a thicker composite electrode because only a very thin layer is involved in the charge storage process.

Molecular interactions between chemical reactants and the catalytic surface control the activity and efficiency, and hence need to be optimized; however, generalized experimental strategies to do so are scarce. Here we show how lattice strain can be used experimentally to tune the catalytic activity of dealloyed bimetallic nanoparticles for the oxygen-reduction reaction, a key barrier to the application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. We demonstrate the core-shell structure of the catalyst and clarify the mechanistic origin of its activity. The platinum-rich shell exhibits compressive strain, which results in a shift of the electronic band structure of platinum and weakening chemisorption of oxygenated species. We combine synthesis, measurements and an understanding of strain from theory to generate a reactivity-strain relationship that provides guidelines for tuning electrocatalytic activity.

J	Dewanto, V; Wu, XZ; Adom, KK; Liu, RH				Dewanto, V; Wu, XZ; Adom, KK; Liu, RH			Thermal processing enhances the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing total antioxidant activity	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Processed fruits and vegetables have been long considered to have lower nutritional value than their fresh commodities due to the loss of vitamin C during processing. This research group found vitamin C in apples contributed <0.4% of total antioxidant activity, indicating most of the activity comes from the natural combination of phytochemicals. This suggests that processed fruits and vegetables may retain their antioxidant activity despite the loss of vitamin C. Here it is shown that thermal processing elevated total antioxidant activity and bioaccessible lycopene content in tomatoes and produced no significant changes in the total phenolics and total flavonoids content, although loss of vitamin C was observed. The raw tomato had 0.76 ± 0.03 μmol of vitamin C/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 °C, the vitamin C content significantly dropped to 0.68 ±0.02, 0.64 ± 0.01, and 0.54 ± 0.02 μmol of vitamin C/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). The raw tomato had 2.01 +/- 0.04 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degreesC, the translycopene content had increased to 3.11 +/- 0.04, 5.45 +/- 0.02, and 5.32 +/- 0.05 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato (p < 0.01). The antioxidant activity of raw tomatoes was 4.13 ± 0.36 μmol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato. With heat treatment at 88 °C for 2, 15, and 30 min, the total antioxidant activity significantly increased to 5.29 ± 0.26, 5.53 ± 0.24, and 6.70 ± 0.25 μmol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in either total phenolics or total flavonoids. These findings indicate thermal processing enhanced the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing the bioaccessible lycopene content and total antioxidant activity and are against the notion that processed fruits and vegetables have lower nutritional value than fresh produce. This information may have a significant impact on consumers' food selection by increasing their consumption of fruits and vegetables to reduce the risks of chronic diseases.

Random Forest is an ensemble of unpruned classification or regression trees created by using bootstrap samples of the training data and random feature selection in tree induction. Prediction is made by aggregating (majority vote or averaging) the predictions of the ensemble. We built predictive models for six cheminformatics data sets. Our analysis demonstrates that Random Forest is a powerful tool capable of delivering performance that is among the most accurate methods to date. We also present three additional features of Random Forest: built-in performance assessment, a measure of relative importance of descriptors, and a measure of compound similarity that is weighted by the relative importance of descriptors. It is the combination of relatively high prediction accuracy and its collection of desired features that makes Random Forest uniquely suited for modeling in cheminformatics.

Routine Microsecond Molecular Dynamics Simulations with AMBER on GPUs. 2. Explicit Solvent Particle Mesh Ewald	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION												We present an implementation of explicit solvent all atom classical molecular dynamics (MD) within the AMBER program package that runs entirely on CUDA-enabled GPUs. First released publicly in April 2010 as part of version 11 of the AMBER MD package and further improved and optimized over the last two years, this implementation supports the three most widely used statistical mechanical ensembles (NVE, NVT, and NPT), uses particle mesh Ewald (PME) for the long-range electrostatics, and runs entirely on CUDA-enabled NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs), providing results that are statistically indistinguishable from the traditional CPU version of the software and with performance that exceeds that achievable by the CPU version of AMBER software running on all conventional CPU-based clusters and supercomputers. We briefly discuss three different precision models developed specifically for this work (SPDP, SPFP, and DPDP) and highlight the technical details of the approach as it extends beyond previously reported work [Gotz et al., J.

Due to their unique physicochemical, optical and electrical properties, a wide variety of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts have been designed to drive various reduction and oxidation reactions under light irradiation with suitable wavelengths. In this review, we have systematically summarized the photocatalytic fundamentals of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, including fundamental mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis, advantages, challenges and the design considerations of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. The versatile properties of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts are highlighted, including their crystal structural, surface phisicochemical, stability, optical, adsorption, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and electronic properties. Various design strategies are also thoroughly reviewed, including band-gap engineering, defect control, dimensionality tuning, pore texture tailoring, surface sensitization, heterojunction construction, co-catalyst and nanocarbon loading. Many important applications are also addressed, such as photocatalytic water splitting (H-2 evolution and overall water splitting), degradation of pollutants, carbon dioxide reduction, selective organic transformations and disinfection. Through reviewing the important state-of-the-art advances on this topic, it may provide new opportunities for designing and constructing highly effective g-C(3)N(4-)based photocatalysts for various applications in photocatalysis and other related fields, such as solar cell, photoelectrocatalysis, electrocatalysis, lithium battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell and separation and purification.

Owing to their superb mechanical and electrical properties, many potential applications have been proposed for them. However, polydispersity and poor solubility in both aqueous and non-aqueous solution impose a considerable challenge for their separation and assembly, which is required for many applications. Here we report our finding of DNA-assisted dispersion and separation of carbon nanotubes. Bundled single-walled carbon nanotubes are effectively dispersed in water by their sonication in the presence of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements provide evidence for individually dispersed carbon nanotubes. Molecular modelling suggests that ssDNA can bind to carbon nanotubes through pi-stacking, resulting in helical wrapping to the surface. The binding free energy of ssDNA to carbon nanotubes rivals that of two nanotubes for each other. We also demonstrate that DNA-coated carbon nanotubes can be separated into fractions with different electronic structures by ion-exchange chromatography. This finding links one of the central molecules in biology to a technologically very important nanomaterial, and opens the door to carbon-nanotube-based applications in biotechnology.																			1476-1122					MAY	2003	2	5					338	342		10.1038/nmat877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat877								12692536					WOS:000182679900023

Lead halide perovskite nanowire lasers with low lasing thresholds and high quality factors	NATURE MATERIALS												The remarkable performance of lead halide perovskites in solar cells can be attributed to the long carrier lifetimes and low non-radiative recombination rates, the same physical properties that are ideal for semiconductor lasers. Here, we show room-temperature and wavelength-tunable lasing from single-crystal lead halide perovskite nanowires with very low lasing thresholds (220 nJ cm(-2)) and high quality factors (Q similar to 3,600). The lasing threshold corresponds to a charge carrier density as low as 1.5 x 1016 cm(-3). Kinetic analysis based on time-resolved fluorescence reveals little charge carrier trapping in these single-crystal nanowires and gives estimated lasing quantum yields approaching 100%. Such lasing performance, coupled with the facile solution growth of single-crystal nanowires and the broad stoichiometry-dependent tunability of emission colour, makes lead halide perovskites ideal materials for the development of nanophotonics, in parallel with the rapid development in photovoltaics from the same materials.					zhu, y/IVU-7833-2023; Trinh, Minh/A-9740-2009; Jin, Song/B-4300-2008; Wu, Xiaoxi/Q-5877-2016	Trinh, Minh Tuan/0000-0001-8393-5669; Wu, Xiaoxi/0000-0002-1900-8964; Gong, Zizhou/0000-0002-8835-385X; Jin, Song/0000-0001-8693-7010													1476-1122	1476-4660				JUN	2015	14	6					636	U115		10.1038/NMAT4271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT4271								25849532					WOS:000354801500028

In addition to a prompt removal of the color, TiO(2)/LTV-based photocatalysis was simultaneously able to oxidize the dye, with an almost complete mineralization of carbon and of nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms into CO(2) NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-) respectively. A detailed degradation pathway has been determined by a careful identification of intermediate products, in particular aromatics, whose successive hydroxylations lead to the aromatic ring opening. These results suggest that TiO(2)/UV photocatalysis may be envisaged as a method for treatment of diluted waste waters in textile industries.

The mechanical properties measured were the Young's modulus, ultimate tensile strength, fracture toughness, fracture energy, and the material's resistance to fatigue crack propagation. The results indicate that grapheme platelets significantly out-perform carbon nanotube additives. The Young's modulus of the graphene nanocomposite was similar to 31% greater than the pristine epoxy as compared to similar to 3% increase for single-walled Carbon nanotubes. The tensile strength of the baseline epoxy was enhanced by similar to 40% with graphene platelets compared to similar to 14% improvement for multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The mode I fracture toughness of the nanocomposite with graphene platelets showed similar to 53% increase over the epoxy compared to similar to 20% improvement for multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The fatigue resistance results also showed significantly different trends. While the fatigue suppression response of nanotube/epoxy composites degrades dramatically as the stress intensity factor amplitude is increased, the reverse effect is seen for graphene-based nanocomposites. The superiority of graphene platelets over carbon nanotubes in terms of mechanical properties enhancement may be related to their high specific surface area, enhanced nanofiller-matrix adhesion/interlocking arising from their wrinkled (rough) surface, as well as the two-dimensional (planar) geometry of graphene platelets.

Here, we report the synthesis of ultrathin nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanoplates on mildly oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Incorporation of Fe into the nickel hydroxide induced the formation of NiFe-LDH. The crystalline NiFe-LDH phase in nanoplate form is found to be highly active for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solutions.

New insights into the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide on metallic copper surfaces	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												We report new insights into the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on a metallic copper surface, enabled by the development of an experimental methodology with unprecedented sensitivity for the identification and quantification of CO2 electroreduction products. This involves a custom electrochemical cell designed to maximize product concentrations coupled to gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance for the identification and quantification of gas and liquid products, respectively. We studied copper across a range of potentials and observed a total of 16 different CO2 reduction products, five of which are reported here for the first time, thus providing the most complete view of the reaction chemistry reported to date. Taking into account the chemical identities of the wide range of C-1-C-3 products generated and the potential-dependence of their turnover frequencies, mechanistic information is deduced. We discuss a scheme for the formation of multicarbon products involving enol-like surface intermediates as a possible pathway, accounting for the observed selectivity for eleven distinct C2+ oxygenated products including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and carboxylic acids.

Chemical oxidation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes	CARBON												The effect of oxidation on the structural integrity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes through acidic (nitric acid and a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide) and basic (ammonium hydroxide/hydrogen peroxide) agents has been studied. In order to purify the as-received material, a non-oxidative treatment (with hydrochloric acid) was also applied. Electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis clearly revealed that the nitric acid-treated material under reflux conditions suffered the highest degree of degradation, such as, nanotube shortening and additional defect generation in the graphitic network. Basic oxidative treatment led to the complete removal of amorphous carbon and metal oxide impurities but the structural integrity was found to be intact. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to confirm the different functionalities produced for each oxidation agent, whereas titration measurements determined the relative concentration of carboxylic functions onto the graphitic surface. Moreover, a general relationship between the chemical treatment and the amount of non-graphitic carbon was established by means of Raman spectroscopy measurements. The possibility of controlling the required amount of functionality, carboxylic and hydroxyl, via these oxidation procedures is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ZnO nanowire UV photodetectors with high internal gain	NANO LETTERS												ZnO nanowire (NW) visible-blind UV photodetectors with internal photoconductive gain as high as G similar to 10(8) have been fabricated and characterized. The photoconduction mechanism in these devices has been elucidated by means of time-resolved measurements spanning a wide temporal domain, from 10(-9) to 10(2) s, revealing the coexistence of fast (tau similar to 20 ns) and slow (tau similar to 10 s) components of the carrier relaxation dynamics. The extremely high photoconductive gain is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the NW surface, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime, as evidenced by the sensitivity of the photocurrrent to ambient conditions. Surprisingly, this mechanism appears to be effective even at the shortest time scale investigated of t < 1 ns. Despite the slow relaxation time, the extremely high internal gain of ZnO NW photodetectors results in gain-bandwidth products (GB) higher than similar to 10 GHz. The high gain and low power consumption of NW photodetectors promise a new generation of phototransistors for applications such as sensing, imaging, and intrachip optical interconnects.

J	Van Lenthe, E; Baerends, EJ				Van Lenthe, E; Baerends, EJ			Optimized slater-type basis sets for the elements 1-118	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												Seven different types of Slater type basis sets for the elements H (Z = 1) up to E 118 (Z = 118), ranging from a double zeta valence quality up to a quadruple zeta valence quality, are tested in their performance in neutral atomic and diatomic oxide calculations. The exponents of the Slater type functions are optimized for the use in (scalar relativistic) zeroth-order regular approximated (ZORA) equations. Atomic tests reveal that, on average, the absolute basis set error of 0.03 kcal/mol in the density functional calculation of the valence spinor energies of the neutral atoms with the largest all electron basis set of quadruple zeta quality is lower than the average absolute difference of 0.16 kcal/mol in these valence spinor energies if one compares the results of ZORA equation with those of the fully relativistic Dirac equation. This average absolute basis set error increases to about 1 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of triple zeta valence quality, and to approximately 4 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality. The molecular tests reveal that, on average, the calculated atomization energies of 118 neutral diatomic oxides MO, where-the nuclear charge Z of M ranges from Z = 1-118, with the all electron basis sets of triple zeta quality with two polarization functions added are within 1-2 kcal/mol of the benchmark results with the much larger all electron basis sets, which are of quadruple zeta valence quality with four polarization functions added. The accuracy is reduced to about 4-5 kcal/mol if only one polarization function is used in the triple zeta basis sets, and further reduced to approximately 20 kcal/mol if the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality are used. The inclusion of g-type STOs to the large benchmark basis sets had an effect of less than I kcal/mol in the calculation of the atomization energies of the group 2 and group 14 diatomic oxides. The basis sets that are optimized for calculations using the frozen core approximation (frozen core basis sets) have a restricted basis set in the core region compared to the all electron basis sets. On average, the use of these frozen core basis sets give atomic basis set errors that are approximately twice as large as the corresponding all electron basis set errors and molecular atomization energies that are close to the corresponding all electron results., Only if spin-orbit coupling is included in the frozen core calculations larger errors are found, especially for the heavier elements, due to the additional approximation that is made that the basis functions are orthogonalized on scalar relativistic core orbitals.

Several methods based on docking to study protein complexes have also been well developed over the past few years. Most of these approaches are not driven by experimental data but are based on a combination of energetics and shape complementarity. Here, we present an approach called HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein-protein Docking) that makes use of biochemical and/or biophysical interaction data such as chemical shift perturbation data resulting from NMR titration experiments or mutagenesis data. This information is introduced as Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRS) to drive the docking process. An AIR is defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues shown to be involved in the interaction. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated with three molecular complexes. For two of these complexes, for which both the complex and the free protein structures have been solved, NMR titration data were available. Mutagenesis data were used in the last example. In all cases, the best structures generated by HADDOCK, that is, the structures with the lowest intermolecular energies, were the closest to the published structure of the respective complexes (within 2.0 Angstrom backbone RMSD).

In contrast to graphene, monolayer MoS2 is a non-centrosymmetric material with a direct energy gap(2,5). Strong photoluminescence(2,3) a current on/off ratio exceeding 10(8) in field-effect transistors(6), and efficient valley and spin control by optical helicity(7-9) have recently been demonstrated in this material. Here we report the spectroscopic identification in a monolayer MoS2 field-effect transistor of tightly bound negative trions, a quasiparticle composed of two electrons and a hole. These quasiparticles, which can be optically created with valley and spin polarized holes, have no analogue in conventional semiconductors. They also possess a large binding energy (similar to 20 meV), rendering them significant even at room temperature.

Spatially resolved raman spectroscopy of single- and few-layer graphene	NANO LETTERS												We present Raman spectroscopy measurements on single- and few-layer graphene flakes. By using a scanning confocal approach, we collect spectral data with spatial resolution, which allows us to directly compare Raman images with scanning force micrographs. Single-layer graphene can be distinguished from double- and few-layer by the width of the D' line: the single peak for single-layer graphene splits into different peaks for the double-layer. These findings are explained using the double-resonant Raman model based on ab initio calculations of the electronic structure and of the phonon dispersion. We investigate the D line intensity and find no defects within the flake. A finite D line response originating from the edges can be attributed either to defects or to the breakdown of translational symmetry.

Identifying design principle that links material properties to the catalytic activity can accelerate the search for highly active and abundant transition-metal-oxide catalysts to replace platinum. Here, we demonstrate that the ORR activity for oxide catalysts primarily correlates to sigma*-orbital (e(g)) occupation and the extent of B-site transition-m covalency, which serves as a secondary activity descriptor. Our findings reflect the critical influences of the sigma* orbital and metal-oxygen covalency on the competition between O-2(2-)/OH- displacement and OH- regeneration surface transition-metal ions as the rate-limiting steps of the ORR, and thus highlight the importance of electronic structure in controlling oxide catalytic activity.

TiO<sub>2</sub>-graphene nanocomposites.: UV-assisted photocatalytic reduction of graphene oxide	ACS NANO												Graphene oxide suspended in ethanol undergoes reduction as it accepts electrons from UV-irradiated TiO2 suspensions. The reduction is accompanied by changes in the absorption of the graphene oxide, as the color of the suspension shifts from brown to black. The direct interaction between TiO2 particles and graphene sheets hinders the collapse of exfoliated sheets of graphene. Solid films cast on a borosilicate glass gap separated by gold-sputtered terminations show an order of magnitude decrease in lateral resistance following reduction with the TiO2 photocatalyst. The photocatalytic methodology not only provides an on-demand UV-assisted reduction technique but also opens up new ways to obtain photoactive graphene-semiconductor composites.

Electrolysis of water on oxide surfaces	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												In this paper, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to analyze the electrochemical water-splitting process producing molecular oxygen (O-2) and hydrogen (H-2). We investigate the trends in the electro-catalytic properties of (110) surfaces of three rutile-type oxides (RuO2, IrO2, and TiO2). The two first of these oxide anodes show lower O-2-evolving over-potentials than metal anodes, due to weak O binding but strong hydroxyl (HO*) binding on the surface. Furthermore, the binding energies of O, HO, and HOO on the (110) surfaces fulfill universal linear relations similar to those found on metal surfaces. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrogen-treated rutile TiO2 (H:TiO2) nanowires were prepared by annealing the pristine TiO2 nanowires in hydrogen atmosphere at various temperatures in a range of 200-550 degrees C. In comparison to pristine TiO2 nanowires, H:TiO2 samples show substantially enhanced photocurrent in the entire potential window. More importantly, H:TiO2 samples have exceptionally low photocurrent saturation potentials of -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs RHE), indicating very efficient charge separation and transportation. The optimized H:TiO2 nanowire sample yields a photocurrent density of similar to 1.97 mA/cm(2) at -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, in 1 M NaOH solution under the illumination of simulated solar light (100 mW/cm(2) from 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter). This photocurrent density corresponds to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of similar to 1.63%. After eliminating the discrepancy between the irradiance of the xenon lamp and solar light, by integrating the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the H:TiO2 nanowire sample with a standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum, the STH efficiency is calculated to be similar to 1.1%, which is the best value for a TiO2 photoanode. IPCE analyses confirm the photocurrent enhancement is mainly due to the improved photoactivity of TiO2 in the UV region. Hydrogen treatment increases the donor density of TiO2 nanowires by 3 orders of magnitudes, via creating a high density of oxygen vacancies that serve as electron donors. Similar enhancements in photocurrent were also observed in anatase H:TiO2 nanotubes. The capability of making highly photoactive H:TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes opens up new opportunities in various areas, including PEC water splitting, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.

Graphene has strong cytotoxicity toward bacteria. To better understand its antimicrobial mechanism, we compared the antibacterial activity of four types of graphene-based materials (graphite (Gt), graphite oxide (GtO), graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) toward a bacterial model Escherichia coli. Under similar concentration and incubation conditions, GO dispersion shows the highest antibacterial activity, sequentially followed by rGO, Gt, and GtO. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and dynamic light scattering analyses show that GO aggregates have the smallest average size among the four types of materials. SEM images display that the direct contacts with graphene nanosheets disrupt cell membrane. No superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is detected. However, the four types of materials can oxidize glutathione, which serves as redox state mediator in bacteria. Conductive rGO and Gt have higher oxidation capacities than insulating GO and GtO. Results suggest that antimicrobial actions are contributed by both membrane and oxidation stress. We propose that a three-step antimicrobial mechanism, previously used for carbon nanotubes, is applicable to graphene-based materials. It includes initial cell deposition on graphene-based materials, membrane stress cared by direct contact with sharp nanosheets, and the ensuing superoxide anion-independent oxidation. We envision that physicochemical properties of graphene-based materials, such as density of functional groups, size, and conductivity, can be precisely tailored to either reducing their health and environmental risks or increasing their application potentials.

The absorbance has been predicted to be independent of frequency. In principle, the interband optical absorbtion in zero-gap graphene could be saturated readily under strong excitation due to Pauli blocking. Here, use of atomic layer graphene as saturable absorber in a mode-locked fiber laser for the generation of ultrashort soliton pulses (756 fs) at the telecommunication band is demonstrated. The modulation depth can be tuned in a wide range from 66.5% to 6.2% by varying the graphene thickness. These results suggest that ultrathin graphene films are potentially useful as optical elements in fiber lasers. Graphene as a laser mode locker can have many merits such as lower saturation intensity, ultrafast recovery time, tunable modulation depth, and wideband tunability.

The main changes effect the definition of solute cavities, of solvation charges and of the PCM operator added to the molecular Hamiltonian, as well as the calculation of energy gradients, to be used in geometry optimizations. The procedure can be equally applied to quantum mechanical and to classical calculations; as shown also with a number of numerical tests, this PCM formulation is very efficient and reliable. It can also be applied to very large solutes, since all the bottlenecks have been eliminated to obtain a procedure whose time and memory requirements scale linearly with solute size.

The general approach to the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene (NG), such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) performed in gas phases, requires transitional metal catalysts which could contaminate the resultant products and thus affect their properties. In this paper, we propose a facile, catalyst-free thermal annealing approach for large-scale synthesis of NG using low-cost Industrial material melamine as the nitrogen source. This approach can completely, avoid the contamination of transition metal catalysts, and thus the intrinsic catalytic performance of pure NGs can be investigated. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectrum analysis of the resultant products shows that the atomic percentage of nitrogen In doped graphene samples can be adjusted up to 10.1%. Such a high doping level has not been reported previously. High-resolution N1s spectra reveal that the as-made NG mainly contains pyridine-like nitrogen atoms. Electrochemical characterizations clearly demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic activity of NG toward die oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) In alkaline electrolytes, which is Independent of nitrogen doping level. The present catalyst-free approach opens up the possibility for the synthesis of NG in gram-scale for electronic devices and cathodic materials for fuel cells and biosensors.

However, due to complexities in the structure and composition of clay and other hydrated minerals, and the inherent uncertainties of the experimental methods, it is important to apply theoretical molecular models for a fundamental atomic-level understanding, interpretation, and prediction of these phenomena. In this effort, we have developed a general force field, CLAYFF, suitable for the simulation of hydrated and multicomponent mineral systems and their interfaces with aqueous solutions. Interatomic potentials were derived from parametrizations incorporating structural and spectroscopic data for a variety of simple hydrated compounds. A flexible SPC-based water model is used to describe the water and hydroxyl behavior. Metal-oxygen interactions are described by a Lennard-Jones function and a Coulombic term with partial charges derived by Mulliken and ESP analysis of DFT results. Bulk structures, relaxed surface structures, and intercalation processes are evaluated and compared to experimental and spectroscopic findings for validation. Our approach differs from most others in that we treat most interatomic interactions as nonbonded. This allows us to effectively use the force field for a wide variety of phases and to properly account for energy and momentum transfer between the fluid phase and the solid, while keeping the number of parameters small enough to allow modeling of relatively large and highly disordered systems. Simulations of clay, hydroxide, and oxyhydroxide phases and their interfaces with aqueous solutions combine energy minimization and molecular dynamics methods to describe the structure and behavior of water, hydroxyl, surface species, and intercalates in these systems. The results obtained to date demonstrate that CLAYFF shows good promise to evolve into a widely adaptable and broadly effective force field for molecular simulations of fluid interfaces with clays and other clay-related phases, as well as other inorganic materials characterized by complex, disordered, and often ill-determined structure and composition.

J	Merrick, JP; Moran, D; Radom, L				Merrick, Jeffrey P.; Moran, Damian; Radom, Leo			An evaluation of harmonic vibrational frequency scale factors	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A												Scale factors for obtaining fundamental vibrational frequencies, low-frequency vibrational frequencies, zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVEs), and thermal contributions to enthalpy and entropy have been derived through a least-squares approach from harmonic frequencies determined at more than 100 levels of theory. Wave function procedures (HF, MP2, QCISD, QCISD(T), CCSD, and CCSD(T)) and a large and representative range of density functional theory (DFT) approaches (B3-LYP, BMK, EDF2, M05-2X, MPWBIK, O3-LYP, PBE, TPSS, etc.) have been examined in conjunction with basis sets such as 6-31G(d), 6-31+G(d,p), 6-31G(2df,p), 6-311 +G(d,p), and 6-311 +G(2df,p). The vibrational frequency scale factors were determined by a comparison of theoretical harmonic frequencies with the corresponding experimental fundamentals utilizing a standard set of 1066 individual vibrations. ZPVE scale factors were generally obtained from a comparison of the computed ZPVEs with experimental ZPVEs for a smaller standard set of 39 molecules, though the effect of expansion to a 48 molecule data set was also examined. In addition to evaluating the scale factors for a wide range of levels of theory, we have also probed the effect on scale factors of varying the percentage of incorporated exact exchange in hybrid DFT calculations using a modified B3-LYP functional. This has revealed a near-linear relationship between the magnitude of the scale factor and the proportion of exact exchange. Finally, we have investigated the effect of basis set size on HF, MP2, B3-LYP, and BMK scale factors by deriving values with basis sets ranging from 6-31G(d) up to 6-311++G(3df,3pd) as well as with basis sets in the cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pVnZ series and with the TZV2P basis.

Hydrogen evolution can be easily achieved by electrolysis at large potentials that can be lowered with expensive platinum-based catalysts. Replacement of Pt with inexpensive, earth-abundant electrocatalysts would be significantly beneficial for clean and efficient hydrogen evolution. To this end, promising results have been reported using 2H (trigonal prismatic) XS2 (where X = Mo or W) nanoparticles with a high concentration of metallic edges. The key challenges for XS2 are increasing the number and catalytic activity of active sites. Here we report monolayered nanosheets of chemically exfoliated WS2 as efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution with very low overpotentials. Analyses indicate that the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of WS2 is associated with the high concentration of the strained metallic 1T (octahedral) phase in the as-exfoliated nanosheets. Our results suggest that chemically exfoliated WS2 nanosheets are interesting catalysts for hydrogen evolution.

Graphene Plasmonics: A Platform for Strong Light-Matter Interactions	NANO LETTERS												Graphene plasmons provide a suitable alternative to noble-metal plasmons because they exhibit much tighter confinement and relatively long propagation distances, with the advantage of being highly tunable via electrostatic gating. Here, we propose to use graphene plasmons as a platform for strongly enhanced light-matter interactions. Specifically, we predict unprecedented high decay rates of quantum emitters in the proximity of a carbon sheet, observable vacuum Rabi splittings, and extinction cross sections exceeding the geometrical area in graphene nanoribbons and nanodisks. Our theoretical results provide the basis for the emerging and potentially far-reaching field of graphene plasmonics, offering an ideal platform for cavity quantum electrodynamics, and supporting the possibility of single-molecule, single-plasmon devices.

Photoredox Catalysis in Organic Chemistry	JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY												In recent years, photoredox catalysis has come to the forefront in organic chemistry as a powerful strategy for the activation of small molecules. In a general sense, these approaches rely on the ability of metal complexes and organic dyes to convert visible light into chemical energy by engaging in single-electron transfer with organic substrates, thereby generating reactive intermediates. In this Perspective, we highlight the unique ability of photoredox catalysis to expedite the development of completely new reaction mechanisms, with particular emphasis placed on multicatalytic strategies that enable the construction of challenging carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds.

Surface enhanced Raman scattering enhancement factors: a comprehensive study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C												This paper presents an in-depth study of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) enhancement factors (EFs) and cross-sections, including several issues often overlooked. In particular, various possible rigorous definitions of the SERS EFs are introduced and discussed in the context of SERS applications, such as analytical chemistry and single molecule SERS. These definitions highlight the importance of a careful characterization of the non-SERS cross-sections of the probes under consideration. This aspect is illustrated by experimental results for the non-SERS cross-sections of representative SERS probes along with average SERS EFs for the same probes. In addition, the accurate experimental determination of single molecule enhancement factors is tackled with two recently developed techniques, namely: bi-analyte SERS (BiASERS) and temperature-dependent SERS vibrational pumping. We demonstrate that SERS EFs as low as 10(7), as opposed to the figure of 10(14) often claimed in the literature, are sufficient for the observation of single molecule SERS signals, with maximum single molecule EFs typically on the order of similar to 10(14).

Our results demonstrate that fluorescein (FL) is superior to B-phycoerythrin. The oxidized FL products induced by peroxyl radical were identified by LC/MS, and the reaction mechanism was determined to follow a classic hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. In addition, methodological and mechanistic comparison of ORAC(FL) with other widely used methods was discussed.

OPLS3: A Force Field Providing Broad Coverage of Drug-like Small Molecules and Proteins	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION												The parametrization and validation of the OPLS3 force field for small molecules and proteins are reported. Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.					yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023; Dahlgren, Markus/E-9053-2011; Wu, Chuanjie/B-9210-2008														1549-9618	1549-9626				JAN	2016	12	1					281	296		10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00864								26584231					WOS:000368322500026

In this study, a high efficiency of the photocatalytic H(2) production was achieved using graphene nanosheets decorated with CdS clusters as visible-light-driven photocatalysts. The materials were prepared by a solvothermal method in which graphene oxide (GO) served as the support and cadmium acetate (Cd(Ac)(2)) as the CdS precursor. These nanosized composites reach a high H(2)-production rate of 1.12 mmol h(-1) (about 4.87 times higher than that of pure CdS nanoparticles) at graphene content of 1.0 wt % and Pt 0.5 wt % under visible-light irradiation and an apparent quantum efficiency (QE) of 22.5% at wavelength of 420 nm. This high photocatalytic H(2)-production activity is attributed predominantly to the presence of graphene, which serves as an electron collector and transporter to efficiently lengthen the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers from CdS nanoparticles.

However, aqueous Zn chemistry persistently suffers from irreversibility issues, as exemplified by its low coulombic efficiency (CE) and dendrite growth during plating/stripping, and sustained water consumption. In this work, we demonstrate that an aqueous electrolyte based on Zn and lithium salts at high concentrations is a very effective way to address these issues. This unique electrolyte not only enables dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping at nearly 100% CE, but also retains water in the open atmosphere, which makes hermetic cell configurations optional. These merits bring unprecedented flexibility and reversibility to Zn batteries using either LiMn2O4 or O-2 cathodes-the former deliver 180 W h kg(-1) while retaining 80% capacity for > 4,000 cycles, and the latter deliver 300 W h kg(-1) (1,000 W h kg(-1) based on the cathode) for > 200 cycles.

Storing and efficiently using electricity generated by intermittent sources and the transition of our transportation fleet to electric drive depend fundamentally on the development of EES systems with high energy and power densities. Supercapacitors are promising devices for highly efficient energy storage and power management, yet they still suffer from moderate energy densities compared to batteries. To establish a detailed understanding of the science and technology of carbon/carbon supercapacitors, this review discusses the basic principles of the electrical double-layer (EDL), especially regarding the correlation between ion size/ion solvation and the pore size of porous carbon electrodes. We summarize the key aspects of various carbon materials synthesized for use in supercapacitors. With the objective of improving the energy density, the last two sections are dedicated to strategies to increase the capacitance by either introducing pseudocapacitive materials or by using novel electrolytes that allow to increasing the cell voltage. In particular, advances in ionic liquids, but also in the field of organic electrolytes, are discussed and electrode mass balancing is expanded because of its importance to create higher performance asymmetric electrochemical capacitors.

Nevertheless, the need for high-energy ultraviolet radiation in most organic photochemical processes has limited both the practicality and environmental benefits of photochemical synthesis on industrially relevant scales. This Perspective describes recent approaches to the use of metal polypyridyl photocatalysts in synthetic organic transformations. Given the remarkable photophysical properties of these complexes, these new transformations, which use Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and related photocatalysts, can be conducted using almost any source of visible light, including both store-bought fluorescent light bulbs and ambient sunlight. Transition metal photocatalysis thus represents a promising strategy towards the development of practical, scalable industrial processes with great environmental benefits.

Growth of Oriented Single-Crystalline Rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> Nanorods on Transparent Conducting Substrates for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) made from oriented, one-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes are receiving attention because direct connection of the point of photogeneration with the collection electrode using such structures may improve the cell performance. Specifically, oriented single-Mstalline TiO2 nanorods or nanowires on a transparent conductive substrate would be most desirable, but achieving these structures has been limited by the availability of synthetic techniques. In this study, a facile, hydrothermal method was developed for the first time to grow oriented, single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorod films on transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. The diameter, length, and density of the nanorods could be varied by changing the growth parameters, such as growth time, growth temperature, initial reactant concentration, acidity, and additives. The epitaxial relation between the FTO substrate and rutile TiO2 with a small lattice mismatch plays a key role in driving the nucleation and growth of the rutile TiO2 nanorods on FTO. With TiCl4-treatment, a light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 3% could be achieved by using 4 mu m-long TiO2 nanorod films as the photoanode in a DSSC.

Synthesis and crystal chemistry of the hybrid perovskite (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>) PbI<sub>3</sub> for solid-state sensitised solar cell applications	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A												The hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3) PbI3 may find application in next generation solid-state sensitised solar cells. Although this material and related perovskites were discovered many decades ago, questions remain concerning their diverse structural chemistry and unusual properties. The article presents a review of previous work and provides a detailed description of the preparation, structural characterisation and physical characteristics of (CH3NH3) PbI3. The phase changes exhibited by (CH3NH3) PbI3 have been probed using variable temperature powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction, combined with differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and phase contrast transmission electron microscopy.

The highest efficiencies have been achieved using blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a fullerene derivative(8-12), but performance depends critically on the material properties and processing conditions. This variability is believed to be influenced by the self-organizing properties of P3HT, which means that both optical(13,14) and electronic(15,16) properties are sensitive to the molecular packing. However, the relationship between molecular nanostructure, optoelectronic properties of the blend material and device performance has not yet been demonstrated. Here we focus on the influence of polymer regioregularity (RR) on the molecular nanostructure, and hence on the resulting material properties and device performance. We find a strong influence of RR on solar-cell performance, which can be attributed to enhanced optical absorption and transport resulting from the organization of P3HT chains and domains. Further optimization of devices using the highest RR material resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 4.4%, even without optimization of electrodes(7).

Biomimetic 4D printing	NATURE MATERIALS												Shape-morphing systems can be found in many areas, including smart textiles(1), autonomous robotics(2), biomedical devices(3), drug delivery(4) and tissue engineering(5). The natural analogues of such systems are exemplified by nastic plant motions, where a variety of organs such as tendrils, bracts, leaves and flowers respond to environmental stimuli (such as humidity, light or touch) by varying internal turgor, which leads to dynamic conformations governed by the tissue composition and microstructural anisotropy of cell walls(6-10). Inspired by these botanical systems, we printed composite hydrogel architectures that are encoded with localized, anisotropic swelling behaviour controlled by the alignment of cellulose fibrils along prescribed four-dimensional printing pathways. When combined with a minimal theoretical framework that allows us to solve the inverse problem of designing the alignment patterns for prescribed target shapes, we can programmably fabricate plant-inspired architectures that change shape on immersion in water, yielding complex three-dimensional morphologies.

New insights into the structure and reduction of graphite oxide	NATURE CHEMISTRY												Graphite oxide is one of the main precursors of graphene-based materials, which are highly promising for various technological applications because of their unusual electronic properties. Although epoxy and hydroxyl groups are widely accepted as its main functionalities, the complete structure of graphite oxide has remained elusive. By interpreting spectroscopic data in the context of the major functional groups believed to be present in graphite oxide, we now show evidence for the presence of five- and six-membered-ring lactols. On the basis of this chemical composition, we devised a complete reduction process through chemical conversion by sodium borohydride and sulfuric acid treatment, followed by thermal annealing. Only small amounts of impurities are present in the final product (less than 0.5 wt% of sulfur and nitrogen, compared with about 3 wt% with other chemical reductions). This method is particularly effective in the restoration of the pi-conjugated structure, and leads to highly soluble and conductive graphene materials.

This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder, and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations of molecules allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds. We demonstrate our method in the domain of drug-like molecules and also in a set of molecules with fewer that nine heavy atoms.

An Investigation of Thin-Film Ni-Fe Oxide Catalysts for the Electrochemical Evolution of Oxygen	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												A detailed investigation has been carried out of the structure and electrochemical activity of electrodeposited Ni-Fe films for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. Ni-Fe films with a bulk and surface composition of 40% Fe exhibit OER activities that are roughly 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of a freshly deposited Ni film and about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of an Fe film. The freshly deposited Ni film increases in activity by as much as 20-fold during exposure to the electrolyte (KOH); however, all films containing Fe are stable as deposited. The oxidation of Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH in Ni films occurs at potentials below the onset of the OER. Incorporation of Fe into the film increases the potential at which Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox occurs and decreases the average oxidation state of Ni in NiOOH. The Tafel slope (40 mV dec(-1)) and reaction order in OH- (1) for the mixed Ni-Fe films (containing up to 95% Fe) are the same as those for aged Ni films. In situ Raman spectra acquired in 0.1 M KOH at OER potentials show two bands characteristic of NiOOH. The relative intensities of these bands vary with Fe content, indicating a change in the local environment of Ni-O. Similar changes in the relative intensities of the bands and an increase in OER activity are observed when pure Ni films are aged. These observations suggest that the OER is catalyzed by Ni in Ni-Fe films and that the presence of Fe alters the redox properties of Ni, causing a positive shift in the potential at which Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox occurs, a decrease in the average oxidation state of the Ni sites, and a concurrent increase in the activity of Ni cations for the OER.

Despite containing many constituents, both alloys had a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure that remained not only stable after exposure to 1400 degrees C, but also disordered, as confirmed by the absence of superlattice reflections in neutron diffraction data. Compressive flow properties and microstructure development of these alloys were determined from room temperature up to 1600 degrees C. Limited compressive plasticity and quasi-cleavage fracture at room temperature suggest that the ductile-to-brittle transition for these alloys occurs above room temperature. At 600 degrees C and above, both alloys showed extensive compressive plastic strain. The yield stress of both alloys dropped by 30-40% between room temperature and 600 degrees C, but was relatively insensitive to temperature above 600 degrees C, comparing favorably with conventional superalloys.

These results confirm the excellent electronic properties of perovskite thin films, enabling the very high open-circuit voltages reported for perovskite solar cells. Following intentional moisture ingress, we find that the absorption at photon energies below 2.4 eV is strongly reduced, pointing to a compositional change of the material.

Despite tremendous efforts, the present great challenge in materials science is to develop highly active photocatalysts for splitting of water at low cost. Here we report a new composite material consisting of TiO2 nanocrystals grown in the presence of a layered MoS2/graphene hybrid as a high-performance photocatalyst for H-2 evolution. This composite material was prepared by a two-step simple hydrothermal process using sodium molybdate, thiourea, and graphene oxide as precursors of the MoS2/graphene hybrid and tetrabutylorthotitanate as the titanium precursor. Even without a noble-metal cocatalyst, the TiO2/MoS2/graphene composite reaches a high H-2 production rate of 165.3 mu mol h(-1) when the content of the MoS2/graphene cocatalyst is 0.5 wt 96 and the content of graphene in this cocatalyst is 5.0 wt 96, and the apparent quantum efficiency reaches 9.796 at 365 nm. This unusual photocatalytic activity arises from the positive synergetic effect between the MoS2 and graphene components in this hybrid cocatalyst, which serve as an electron collector and a source of active adsorption sites, respectively. This study presents an inexpensive photocatalyst for energy conversion to achieve highly efficient H-2 evolution without noble metals.

The prepared F-doped TiO2 powders were characterized by differential thermal analysis-thermogravimetry (DTA-TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra (PL), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and BET surface areas. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the photocatalytic oxidation of acetone in air. The results showed that the crystallinity of anatase was improved upon F- doping. Moreover, fluoride ions not only suppressed the formation of brookite phase but also prevented phase transition of anatase to rutile. The F-doped TiO2 samples exhibited stronger absorption in the UV-visible range with a red shift in the band gap transition. The photocatalytic activity of F-doped TiO2 powders prepared by this method exceeded that of Degussa P25 when the molar ratio of NH4F to H2O was kept in the range of 0.5-3.

It has the potential for technological applications as a successor of silicon in the post Moore's law era(5-7), as a single-molecule gas sensor(8), in spintronics(9-11), in quantum computing(12) or as a terahertz oscillator(13). For such applications, uniform ordered growth of graphene on an insulating substrate is necessary. The growth of graphene on insulating silicon carbide (SiC) surfaces by high-temperature annealing in vacuum was previously proposed to open a route for large-scale production of graphene-based devices(5,6). However, vacuum decomposition of SiC yields graphene layers with small grains (30-200 nm; refs 14-16). Here, we show that the ex situ graphitization of Si-terminated SiC(0001) in an argon atmosphere of about 1 bar produces monolayer graphene films with much larger domain sizes than previously attainable. Raman spectroscopy and Hall measurements confirm the improved quality of the films thus obtained. High electronic mobilities were found, which reach mu = 2,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at T = 27 K. The new growth process introduced here establishes a method for the synthesis of graphene films on a technologically viable basis.

J	Wang, JC; Kaskel, S				Wang, Jiacheng; Kaskel, Stefan			KOH activation of carbon-based materials for energy storage	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY												Because of their availability, adjustable microstructure, varieties of forms, and large specific surface area, porous carbon materials are of increasing interest for use in hydrogen storage adsorbents and electrode materials in supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur cells from the viewpoint of social sustainability and environmental friendliness. Therefore, much effort has been made to synthesize and tailor the microstructures of porous carbon materials via various activation procedures (physical and chemical activation). In particular, the chemical activation of various carbon sources using KOH as the activating reagent is very promising because of its lower activation temperature and higher yields, and well-defined micropore size distribution and ultrahigh specific surface area up to 3000 m(2) g(-1) of the resulting porous carbons. In this feature article, we will cover recent research progress since 2007 on the synthesis of KOH-activated carbons for hydrogen and electrical energy storage (supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur batteries). The textural properties and surface chemistry of KOH-activated carbons depend on not only the synthesis parameters, but also different carbon sources employed including fossil/biomass-derived materials, synthetic organic polymers, and various nanostructured carbons (e.g. carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon aerogels, carbide-derived carbons, graphene, etc.). Following the introduction to KOH activation mechanisms and processing technologies, the characteristics and performance of KOH-activated carbons as well as their relationships are summarized and discussed through the extensive analysis of the literature based on different energy storage systems.					wang, Jiacheng/A-8458-2008; Kaskel, Stefan/T-8393-2017	Kaskel, Stefan/0000-0003-4572-0303; wang, jiacheng/0000-0003-4327-1508													0959-9428					DEC 7	2012	22	45					23710	23725		10.1039/c2jm34066f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2jm34066f													WOS:000311522500001

The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) method, developed over 30 years ago, is the method of choice for measuring total fiber in for- ages and other feeds. Several modifications that were made to improve its general applicability to all feeds and others developed in individual laboratories often resulted in variability among laboratories in measuring NDF. The amylase-treated NDF (aNDF) method, therefore, was developed as an accurate and precise method of measuring total insoluble fiber in feeds. A collaborative study was conducted to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of the aNDF method over the full range of animal feed materials. Twelve laboratories representing research, feed company, regulatory, and commercial feed testing laboratories analyzed 11 materials as blind duplicates. The materials represented feed matrixes, including animal products; high-protein, high-fat, and high-pectin feeds; oil seeds; grains; heated by-product feeds; and legume and grass hays and silages. Materials selected varied in chemical composition and contained 0-90% aNDF, 1-16% ash, 1-20% crude fat, 1-40% crude protein, and 0-50% starch. Correcting results for changes in blanks and reporting results as ash-free aNDF organic matter (aNDFom) improved the repeatability and reproducibility of results when aNDF was <25%. The within-laboratory repeatability standard deviation (Sr) for percentage aNDFom in feeds varied from 0.21 to 1.82 and among-laboratory reproducibility standard deviation (s(R)) varied from 0.37 to 2.24. The HORRAT Was <2 for all materials except feed materials containing >10% fat. However, standard deviations of repeatability and reproducibility for feeds with >10% fat were similar to those of other materials. It is recommended that the aNDF method be accepted for Official First Action status.

This is likely to continue to rise, but in the development of these solar cells there are unusual characteristics that have arisen, specifically an anomalous hysteresis in the current voltage curves. We identify this phenomenon and show some examples of factors that make the hysteresis more or less extreme. We also demonstrate stabilized power output under working conditions and suggest that this is a useful parameter to present, alongside the current-voltage scan derived power conversion efficiency. We hypothesize three possible origins of the effect and discuss its implications on device efficiency and future research directions. Understanding and resolving the hysteresis is essential for further progress and is likely to lead to a further step improvement in performance.

Highly ordered nanotube arrays of 46-nm pore diameter, 17-nm wall thickness, and 360-nm length were grown perpendicular to a fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass substrate by anodic oxidation of a titanium thin film. After crystallization by an oxygen anneal, the nanotube arrays are treated with TiCl4 to enhance the photogenerated current and then integrated into the DSC structure using a commercially available ruthenium-based dye. Although the negative electrode is only 360-nm-thick, under AM 1.5 illumination the generated photocurrent is 7.87 mA/cm(2), with a photocurrent efficiency of 2.9%. Voltage-decay measurements indicate that the highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays, in comparison to nanoparticulate systems, have superior electron lifetimes and provide excellent pathways for electron percolation. Our results indicate that remarkable photoconversion efficiencies may be obtained, possibly to the ideal limit of similar to 31% for a single photosystem scheme, with an increase of the nanotube-array length to several micrometers.

We considered three aspects of compatibility: the swelling of PDMS in a solvent, the partitioning of solutes between a solvent and PDMS, and the dissolution of PDMS oligomers in a solvent. Of these three parameters that determine the compatibility of PDMS with a solvent, the swelling of PDMS had the greatest influence. Experimental measurements of swelling were correlated with the solubility parameter, 6 (cal(1/2) cm(-3/2)), which is based on the cohesive energy densities, c (cal/cm(3)), of the materials. Solvents that swelled PDMS the least included water, nitromethane, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol, perfluorotributylamine, perfluorodecalin, acetonitrile, and propylene carbonate; solvents that swelled PDMS the most were diisopropylamine, triethylamine, pentane, and xylenes. Highly swelling solvents were useful for extracting contaminants from bulk PDMS and for changing the surface properties of PDMS. The feasibility of performing organic reactions in PDMS was demonstrated by performing a Diels-Alder reaction in a microchannel.																			0003-2700	1520-6882				DEC 1	2003	75	23					6544	6554		10.1021/ac0346712	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac0346712								14640726					WOS:000186986000028

Single and bilayer MoS2 is exfoliated from bulk and transferred to a substrate containing an array of microfabricated circular holes. The resulting suspended, free-standing membranes are deformed and eventually broken using an atomic force microscope. We find that the In-plane stiffness of monolayer MoS2 is 180 +/- 60 Nm(-1), corresponding to an effective Young's modulus of 270 +/- 100 GPa, which Is comparable to that of steel. Breaking occurs at an effective strain between 6 and 11% with the average breaking strength of 15 +/- 3 Nm(-1) (23 GPa). The strength of strongest monolayer membranes Is 11% of its Young's modulus, corresponding to the upper theoretical limit which indicates that the material can be highly crystalline and almost defect-free. Our results show that monolayer MoS2 could be suitable for a variety of applications such as reinforcing elements in composites and for fabrication of flexible electronic devices.

J	Barker, M; Rayens, W				Barker, M; Rayens, W			Partial least squares for discrimination	JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS												Partial least squares (PLS) was not originally designed as a tool for statistical discrimination. In spite of this, applied scientists routinely use PLS for classification and there is substantial empirical evidence to suggest that it performs well in that role. The interesting question is: why can a procedure that is principally designed for overdetermined regression problems locate and emphasize group structure? Using PLS in this manner has heurestic support owing to the relationship between PLS and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the relationship, in turn, between CCA and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This paper replaces the heuristics with a formal statistical explanation. As a consequence, it will become clear that PLS is to be preferred over PCA when discrimination is the goal and dimension reduction is needed.

However, the usual synthesis needs high temperature, inert gas protection, and localized injection operation, which are severely against applications. Moreover, the so unexpectedly high QYs are very confusing. Here, for the first time, the IPQDs' room-temperature (RT) synthesis, superior PL, underlying origins and potentials in lighting and displays are reported. The synthesis is designed according to supersaturated recrystallization (SR), which is operated at RT, within few seconds, free from inert gas and injection operation. Although formed at RT, IPQDs' PLs have QYs of 80%, 95%, 70%, and FWHMs of 35, 20, and 18 nm for red, green, and blue emissions. As to the origins, the observed 40 meV exciton binding energy, halogen self-passivation effect, and CsPbX3@X quantum-well band alignment are proposed to guarantee the excitons generation and high-rate radiative recombination at RT. Moreover, such superior optical merits endow them with promising potentials in lighting and displays, which are primarily demonstrated by the white light-emitting diodes with tunable color temperature and wide color gamut.

J	Grätzel, M				Grätzel, M			Conversion of sunlight to electric power by nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cells	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY					International Conference on Photochemistry	JUL 25, 2003	Nara, JAPAN					The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) provides a technically and economically credible alternative concept to present day p-n junction photovoltaic devices. In contrast to the conventional silicon systems, where the semiconductor assumes both the task of light absorption and charge carrier transport the two functions are separated here. Light is absorbed by a sensitizer, which is anchored to the surface of a wide band gap oxide semiconductor. Charge separation takes place at the interface via photo-induced electron injection from the dye into the conduction band of the solid. Carriers are transported in the conduction band of the semiconductor to the charge collector. The use of sensitizers having a broad absorption band in conjunction with oxide films of nanocrystalline morphology permits to harvest a large fraction of sunlight. Nearly quantitative conversion of incident photon into electric cur-rent is achieved over a large spectral range extending from the UV to the near IR region. Overall solar (standard AM 1.5) to current conversion efficiencies of 10.6% have been reached. New electrolytes based on ionic liquids have been developed that show excellent stability both under prolonged light soaking and high temperature stress. There are good prospects to produce these cells at lower cost than conventional devices. Here we present the current state of the field, and discuss the importance of mastering the interface of the mesoporous films by assisting the self-assembly of the sensitizer at the surface of the oxide nanocrystals.

A 'chain-of-spheres' algorithm for the Hartree-Fock exchange	CHEMICAL PHYSICS												In this paper, the possibility is explored to speed up Hartree-Fock and hybrid density functional calculations by forming the Coulomb and exchange parts of the Fock matrix by different approximations. For the Coulomb part the previously introduced Split-RI-J variant (F. Neese, J. Comput. Chem. 24 (2003) 1740) of the well-known 'density fitting' approximation is used. The exchange part is formed by semi-numerical integration techniques that are closely related to Friesner's pioneering pseudo-spectral approach. Our potentially linear scaling realization of this algorithm is called the 'chain-of-spheres exchange' (COSX). A combination of semi-numerical integration and density fitting is also proposed. Both Split-RI-J and COSX scale very well with the highest angular momentum in the basis sets. It is shown that for extended basis sets speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional implementations can be obtained in this way. Total energies are reproduced with an average error of <0.3 kcal/mol as determined from extended test calculations with various basis sets on a set of 26 molecules with 20-200 atoms and up to 2000 basis functions. Reaction energies agree to within 0.2 kcal/mol (Hartree-Fock) or 0.05 kcal/mol (hybrid DFT) with the canonical values. The COSX algorithm parallelizes with a speedup of 8.6 observed for 10 processes. Minimum energy geometries differ by less than 0.3 pm in the bond distances and 0.5 degrees in the bond angels from their canonical values. These developments enable highly efficient and accurate self-consistent field calculations including nonlocal Hartree-Fock exchange for large molecules. In combination with the RI-MP2 method and large basis sets, second-order many body perturbation energies can be obtained for medium sized molecules with unprecedented efficiency. The algorithms are implemented into the ORCA electronic structure system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Beyond Intercalation-Based Li-Ion Batteries: The State of the Art and Challenges of Electrode Materials Reacting Through Conversion Reactions	ADVANCED MATERIALS												Despite the imminent commercial introduction of Li-ion batteries in electric drive vehicles and their proposed use as enablers of smart grids based on renewable energy technologies, an intensive quest for new electrode materials that bring about improvements in energy density, cycle life, cost, and safety is still underway. This Progress Report highlights the recent developments and the future prospects of the use of phases that react through conversion reactions as both positive and negative electrode materials in Li-ion batteries. By moving beyond classical intercalation reactions, a variety of low cost compounds with gravimetric specific capacities that are two-to-five times larger than those attained with currently used materials, such as graphite and LiCoO2, can be achieved. Nonetheless, several factors currently handicap the applicability of electrode materials entailing conversion reactions. These factors, together with the scientific breakthroughs that are necessary to fully assess the practicality of this concept, are reviewed in this report.					Cabana, Jordi/G-6548-2012; Palacin, M.

In this paper, a facile approach to the synthesis of high quality graphene nanosheets in large scale through electrochemical reduction of exfoliated graphite oxide precursor at cathodic potentials (completely reduced potential: -1.5 V) is reported. This method is green and fast, and will not result in contamination of the reduced material. The electrochemically reduced graphene nanosheets have been carefully characterized by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques in comparison to the chemically reduced graphene-based product. Particularly, FTIR spectra indicate that a variety of the oxygen-containing functional groups have been thoroughly removed from the graphite oxide plane via electrochemical reduction. The chemically converted materials are not expected to exhibit graphene's electronic properties because of residual defects. Indeed, the high quality grapheme accelerates the electron transfer rate in dopamine electrochemistry (Delta E-p is as small as 44 mV which is much smaller than that on a glassy carbon electrode). This approach opens up the possibility for assembling graphene biocomposites for electrocatalysis and the construction of blosensors..					; , Hui-Lin/G-5096-2011	Xia, Xing-Hua/0000-0001-9831-4048; , Hui-Lin/0000-0003-1046-2033													1936-0851	1936-086X				SEP	2009	3	9					2653	2659		10.1021/nn900227d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn900227d								19691285					WOS:000269988600029

In order to enhance the HER activity, tremendous effort has been made to engineer MoS2 catalysts with either more active sites or higher conductivity. However, at present, synergistically structural and electronic modulations for HER still remain challenging. In this work, we demonstrate the successfully synergistic regulations of both structural and electronic benefits by controllable disorder engineering and simultaneous oxygen incorporation in MoS2 catalysts, leading to the dramatically enhanced HER activity. The disordered structure can offer abundant unsaturated sulfur atoms as active sites for HER, while the oxygen incorporation can effectively regulate the electronic structure and further improve the intrinsic conductivity. By means of controllable disorder engineering and oxygen incorporation, an optimized catalyst with a moderate degree of disorder was developed, exhibiting superior activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In general, the optimized catalyst exhibits onset overpotential as low as 120 mV, accompanied by extremely large cathodic current density and excellent stability. This work will pave a new pathway for improving the electrocatalytic activity by synergistically structural and electronic modulations.

In this work, for the first time we study the in vivo behaviors of nanographene sheets (NGS) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating by a fluorescent labeling method. In vivo fluorescence imaging reveals surprisingly high tumor uptake of NGS in several xenograft tumor mouse models. Distinctive from PEGylated carbon nanotubes, PEGylated NGS shows several interesting in vivo behaviors including highly efficient tumor passive targeting and relatively low retention in reticuloendothelial systems. We then utilize the strong optical absorbance of NGS in the near-infrared (NIR) region for in vivo photothermal therapy, achieving ultraefficient tumor ablation after intravenous administration of NGS and low-power NIR laser irradiation on the tumor. Furthermore, no obvious side effect of PEGylated NGS is noted for the injected mice by histology, blood chemistry, and complete blood panel analysis in our pilot toxicity study. Although a lot more efforts are required to further understand the in vivo behaviors and the long-term toxicology of this new type of nanomaterials, our work is the first success of using carbon nanomaterials for efficient in vivo photothermal therapy by intravenous administration and suggests the great promise of graphene in biomedical applications, such as cancer treatment.

The electrochemical surface characteristics of nanoparticles and bulk materials were studied by surface-sensitive cyclic voltammetry. Although basically similar voltammetric features were observed for nanoparticles and bulk materials of each metal, some differences were uncovered highlighting the changes in oxidation chemistry. On the basis of the electrochemical results, we demonstrated that Ru nanoparticles show lower passivation potentials compared to bulk Ru material. Ir nanoparticles completely lost their voltammetric metallic features during the voltage cycling, in contrast to the corresponding bulk material. Finally, Pt nanoparticles show an increased oxophilic nature compared to bulk Pt. With regard to the OER performance, the most pronounced effects of nanoscaling were identified for Ru and Pt catalysts. In particular, the Ru nanoparticles suffered from strong corrosion at applied OER potentials and were therefore unable to sustain the OER. The Pt nanoparticles exhibited a lower OER activity from the beginning on and were completely deactivated during the applied OER stability protocol, in contrast to the corresponding bulk Pt catalyst. We highlight that the OER activity and durability were comparable for Ir nanoparticles and bulk materials. Thus, Ir nanoparticles provide a high potential as nanoscaled OER catalyst.

The focus of this article is on contacts. We demonstrate that through a proper understanding and design of source/drain contacts and the right choice of number of MoS2 layers the excellent intrinsic properties of this 2-D material can be harvested. Using scandium contacts on 10-nm-thick exfoliated MoS2 flakes that are covered by a 15 nm Al2O3 film, high effective mobilities of 700 cm(2)/(V s) room temperature. This breakthrough is largely attributed to the fact that we succeeded in eliminating contact resistance effects that limited the device performance in the past unrecognized.

Electrical energy storage for transportation-approaching the limits of, and going beyond, lithium-ion batteries	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The escalating and unpredictable cost of oil, the concentration of major oil resources in the hands of a few politically sensitive nations, and the long-term impact of CO2 emissions on global climate constitute a major challenge for the 21st century. They also constitute a major incentive to harness alternative sources of energy and means of vehicle propulsion. Today's lithium-ion batteries, although suitable for small-scale devices, do not yet have sufficient energy or life for use in vehicles that would match the performance of internal combustion vehicles. Energy densities 2 and 5 times greater are required to meet the performance goals of a future generation of plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEVs) with a 40-80 mile all-electric range, and all-electric vehicles (EVs) with a 300-400 mile range, respectively. Major advances have been made in lithium-battery technology over the past two decades by the discovery of new materials and designs through intuitive approaches, experimental and predictive reasoning, and meticulous control of surface structures and chemical reactions. Further improvements in energy density of factors of two to three may yet be achievable for current day lithium-ion systems; factors of five or more may be possible for lithium-oxygen systems, ultimately leading to our ability to confine extremely high potential energy in a small volume without compromising safety, but only if daunting technological barriers can be overcome.

To develop this scheme, we suggest a new technique that constructs an approximate first-order density matrix that corresponds to a GGA exchange functional. The calculated results of the long-range correction scheme are found to support a previous argument that the lack of the long-range interactions in conventional exchange functionals may be responsible for the underestimation of 4s-3d interconfigurational energies of the first-row transition metals and for the overestimation of the longitudinal polarizabilities of pi -conjugated polyenes in DFT calculations.

These samples diffracted both synchrotron X-rays and neutrons to better than 1 Angstrom resolution (>300 unique reflections; P2(1)). The X-ray data were used to determine the C and 0 atom positions, The resulting structure consisted of two parallel chains having slightly different conformations and organized in sheets packed in a "parallel-up" fashion, with all hydroxymethyl groups adopting the tg conformation. The positions of hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen-bonding were determined from a Fourier-difference analysis using neutron diffraction data collected from hydrogenated and deuterated samples. The hydrogen atoms involved in the intramolecular O3...O5 hydrogen bonds have well-defined positions, whereas those corresponding to 02 and 06 covered a wider volume, indicative of multiple geometry with partial occupation. The observation of this disorder substantiates a recent infrared analysis and indicates that, despite their high crystallinity, crystals of cellulose Ibeta have an inherent disorganization of the intermolecular H-bond network that maintains the cellulose chains in sheets.

Remarkably, it was discovered that the viscosity of mixtures was dependent mainly on the mole fraction of added molecular solvents and only to a lesser extent upon their identity, allowing viscosity changes during the course of a reaction to be entirely predictable. While the addition of such molecular solvents decreases the viscosity and density, chloride impurities, arising from the preparation of the ionic liquids, increase viscosity dramatically. The commonly used methods of preparation were validated with respect to chloride impurity.

The graphene oxide nanowalls were obtained by electrophoretic deposition of Mg2+-graphene oxide nanosheets synthesized by a chemical exfoliation method. On the basis of measuring the efflux of cytoplasmic materials of the bacteria, it was found that the cell membrane damage of the bacteria caused by direct contact of the bacteria with the extremely sharp edges of the nanowalls was the effective mechanism in the bacterial inactivation. In this regard, the Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria with an outer membrane were more resistant to the cell membrane damage caused by the nanowalls than the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus lacking the outer membrane. Moreover, the graphene oxide nanowalls reduced by hydrazine were more toxic to the bacteria than the unreduced graphene oxide nanowalls. The better antibacterial activity of the reduced nanowalls was assigned to the better charge transfer between the bacteria and the more sharpened edges of the reduced nanowalls, during the contact interaction.

Lead-free organic-inorganic tin halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Already exhibiting solar to electrical power conversion efficiencies of over 17%, organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells are one of the most promising emerging contenders in the drive to provide a cheap and clean source of energy. One concern however, is the potential toxicology issue of lead, a key component in the archetypical material. The most likely substitute is tin, which like lead, is also a group 14 metal. While organic-inorganic tin halide perovskites have shown good semiconducting behaviour, the instability of tin in its 2+ oxidation state has thus far proved to be an overwhelming challenge. Here, we report the first completely lead-free, CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite solar cell processed on a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, reaching efficiencies of over 6% under 1 sun illumination. Remarkably, we achieve open circuit voltages over 0.88 V from a material which has a 1.23 eV band gap.

Identification of Highly Active Fe Sites in (Ni,Fe)OOH for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Highly active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are required for the development of photoelectrochemical devices that generate hydrogen efficiently from water using solar energy. Here, we identify the origin of a 500-fold OER activity enhancement that can be achieved with mixed (Ni,Fe)oxyhydroxides (Ni1-xFexOOH) over their pure Ni and Fe parent compounds, resulting in one of the most active currently known OER catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) using high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) reveals that Fe3+ in Ni1-xFexOOH occupies octahedral sites with unusually short Fe-O bond distances, induced by edge-sharing with surrounding [NiO6] octahedra. Using computational methods, we establish that this structural motif results in near optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates and low overpotentials at Fe sites. By contrast, Ni sites in Ni1-xFexOOH are not active sites for the oxidation of water.

Exploration of the active center structure of nitrogen-doped graphene-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												We present two different ways to fabricate nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) and demonstrate its use as a metal-free catalyst to study the catalytic active center for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). N-graphene was produced by annealing of graphene oxide (G-O) under ammonia or by annealing of a N-containing polymer/reduced graphene oxide (RG-O) composite (polyaniline/RG-O or polypyrrole/RG-O). The effects of the N precursors and annealing temperature on the performance of the catalyst were investigated. The bonding state of the N atom was found to have a significant effect on the selectivity and catalytic activity for ORR. Annealing of G-O with ammonia preferentially formed graphitic N and pyridinic N centers, while annealing of polyaniline/RG-O and polypyrrole/RG-O tended to generate pyridinic and pyrrolic N moieties, respectively. Most importantly, the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst was found to be dependent on the graphitic N content which determined the limiting current density, while the pyridinic N content improved the onset potential for ORR. However, the total N content in the graphene-based non-precious metal catalyst does not play an important role in the ORR process.

Crystal structure prediction using <i>ab initio</i> evolutionary techniques:: Principles and applications	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												We have developed an efficient and reliable methodology for crystal structure prediction, merging ab initio total-energy calculations and a specifically devised evolutionary algorithm. This method allows one to predict the most stable crystal structure and a number of low-energy metastable structures for a given compound at any P-T conditions without requiring any experimental input. Extremely high (nearly 100%) success rate has been observed in a few tens of tests done so far, including ionic, covalent, metallic, and molecular structures with up to 40 atoms in the unit cell. We have been able to resolve some important problems in high-pressure crystallography and report a number of new high-pressure crystal structures (stable phases: epsilon-oxygen, new phase of sulphur, new metastable phases of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen, stable and metastable phases of CaCO3). Physical reasons for the success of this methodology are discussed. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.

J	Aveyard, R; Binks, BP; Clint, JH				Aveyard, R; Binks, BP; Clint, JH			Emulsions stabilised solely by colloidal particles	ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												The preparation and properties of emulsions, stabilised solely by the adsorption of solid particles at the oil-water interface, are reviewed especially in the light of our own work with particles of well-controlled surface properties. Where appropriate, comparison is made with the behaviour of surfactant-stabilised emulsions. Hydrophilic particles tend to form oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions whereas hydrophobic particles form water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions. Many of the properties can be attributed to the very large free energy of adsorption for particles of intermediate wettability (contact angle at the oil-water interface, say, between 50 and 130degrees). This effectively irreversible adsorption leads to extreme stability for certain emulsions and is in contrast to the behaviour of surfactant molecules which are usually in rapid dynamic equilibrium between the oil-water interface and the bulk phases. There is. evidence that, in some systems, weak flocculation of the particles improves the emulsion stability. Phase inversion from w/o to o/w can be brought about by increasing the volume fraction of water. Emulsions close to this inversion point tend to be the most stable, again in contrast to surfactant systems. The volume fraction needed for inversion depends on the particle wettability and the nature of the oil and these effects have been rationalised in terms of surface energy components. Stable multiple emulsions (w/o/w and o/w/o) can be made using two types of particles with slightly different wettability. Similar multiple emulsions prepared with two types of surfactant tend to be much less stable. The possibility of preparing novel solid materials by evaporating solid-stabilised emulsions is also proposed. Finally we report on some extensions to the work of Levine et al. who obtained expressions for the free energy of formation of emulsion drops covered with close-packed monolayers of monodisperse spherical particles. In particular in the light of the observations that nanoparticles can act as excellent emulsion stabilisers, we have considered potential effects on the free energy of emulsion formation of the action of small (physically realistic) positive and negative line tensions in the 3-phase contact lines skirting particles adsorbed at the droplet interfaces. We also explore the possibility that curvature properties of close-packed particle monolayers can affect emulsion properties in much the same way that surfactant monolayer properties influence emulsion type and stability.

Water Adsorption in Porous Metal-Organic Frameworks and Related Materials	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Water adsorption in porous materials is important for many applications such as dehumidification, thermal batteries, and delivery of drinking water in remote areas. In this study, we have identified three criteria for achieving high performing porous materials for water adsorption. These criteria deal with condensation pressure of water in the pores, uptake capacity, and recyclability and water stability of the material. In search of an excellently performing porous material, we have studied and compared the water adsorption properties of 23 materials, 20 of which are metal organic frameworks (MOFs). Among the MOFs are 10 zirconium(IV) MOFs with a subset of these, MOF-801-SC (single crystal form), -802, -805, -806, -808, -812, and -841 reported for the first time. MOF-801-P (microcrystalline powder form) was reported earlier and studied here for its water adsorption properties. MOF-812 was only made and structurally characterized but not examined for water adsorption because it is a byproduct of MOF-841 synthesis. All the new zirconium MOFs are made from the Zr6O4(OH)(4)(-CO2)(n) secondary building units (n = 6, 8, 10, or 12) and variously shaped carboxyl organic linkers to make extended porous frameworks. The permanent porosity of all 23 materials was confirmed and their water adsorption measured to reveal that MOF-801-P and MOF-841 are the highest performers based on the three criteria stated above; they are water stable, do not lose capacity after five adsorption/desorption cycles, and are easily regenerated at room temperature. An X-ray single-crystal study and a powder neutron diffraction study reveal the position of the water adsorption sites in MOF-801 and highlight the importance of the intermolecular interaction between adsorbed water molecules within the pores.

Design of two-dimensional (2D)/2D surface-to-surface heterojunction is an effective method for improving photocatalytic activity since greater contact area can enhance interfacial charge transfer rate. Herein, ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-like composite heterojunction photocatalysts were fabricated by electrostatic self-assembly of ultrathin tungsten trioxide (WO3) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets. The ultrathin WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets were obtained by electrostatic-assisted ultrasonic exfoliation of bulk WO3 and a two-step thermal-etching of bulk g-C3N4, respectively. The thickness of ultrathin WO3 and g-C3N4 nanosheets are 2.5-3.5 nm, which is equivalent to 5-8 atomic or molecular layer thickness. This ultrathin layered heterojunction structure can enhance surface photocatalytic rate because photogenerated electrons and holes at heterogeneous interface more easily transfer to surface of photocatalysts. Therefore, the obtained ultrathin 2D/2D WO3/g-C3N4 step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited better Hz-production activity than pure g-C3N4 and WO3 with the same loading amount of Pt as cocatalyst. The mechanism and driving force of charge transfer and separation in S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are investigated and discussed. This investigation will provide new insight about designing and constructing novel S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts.

J	Scalmani, G; Frisch, MJ				Scalmani, Giovanni; Frisch, Michael J.			Continuous surface charge polarizable continuum models of solvation. I. General formalism	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Continuum solvation models are appealing because of the simplified yet accurate description they provide of the solvent effect on a solute, described either by quantum mechanical or classical methods. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) family of solvation models is among the most widely used, although their application has been hampered by discontinuities and singularities arising from the discretization of the integral equations at the solute-solvent interface. In this contribution we introduce a continuous surface charge (CSC) approach that leads to a smooth and robust formalism for the PCM models. We start from the scheme proposed over ten years ago by York and Karplus and we generalize it in various ways, including the extension to analytic second derivatives with respect to atomic positions. We propose an optimal discrete representation of the integral operators required for the determination of the apparent surface charge. We achieve a clear separation between "model" and "cavity" which, together with simple generalizations of modern integral codes, is all that is required for an extensible and efficient implementation of the PCM models. Following this approach we are now able to introduce solvent effects on energies, structures, and vibrational frequencies (analytical first and second derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates), magnetic properties (derivatives with respect of magnetic field using GIAOs), and in the calculation more complex properties like frequency-dependent Raman activities, vibrational circular dichroism, and Raman optical activity.

ZINC connects purchasable compounds to high-value ones such as metabolites, drugs, natural products, and annotated compounds from the literature. Compounds may be accessed by the genes for which they are annotated as well as the major and minor target classes to which those genes belong. It offers new analysis tools that are easy for nonspecialists yet with few limitations for experts. ZINC retains its original 3D roots - all molecules are available in biologically relevant, ready-to-dock formats. ZINC is freely available at http://zinc15.docking.org.

Doping GQDs with heteroatoms provides an attractive means of effectively tuning their intrinsic properties and exploiting new phenomena for advanced device applications. Herein we report a simple electrochemical approach to luminescent and electrocatalytically active nitrogen-doped GQDs (N-GQDs) with oxygen-rich functional groups. Unlike their N-free counterparts, the newly produced N-GQDs with a N/C atomic ratio of ca. 4.3% emit blue luminescence and possess an electrocatalytic activity comparable to that of a commercially available Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline medium. In addition to their use as metal-free ORR catalysts in fuel cells, the superior luminescence characteristic of N-GQDs allows them to be used for biomedical imaging and other optoelectronic applications.

J	Cody, RB; Laramée, JA; Durst, HD				Cody, RB; Laramée, JA; Durst, HD			Versatile new ion source for the analysis of materials in open air under ambient conditions	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												A new ion source has been developed for rapid, noncontact analysis of materials at ambient pressure and at ground potential. The new source, termed DART (for "Direct Analysis in Real Time"), is based on the reactions of electronic or vibronic excited-state species with reagent molecules and polar or nonpolar analytes. DART has been installed on a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) that provides improved selectivity and accurate elemental composition assignment through exact mass measurements. Although DART has been applied to the analysis of gases, liquids, and solids, a unique application is the direct detection of chemicals on surfaces without requiring sample preparation, such as wiping or solvent extraction. DART has demonstrated success in sampling hundreds of chemicals, including chemical agents and their signatures, pharmaceutics, metabolites, peptides and oligosaccharides, synthetic organics, organometallics, drugs of abuse, explosives, and toxic industrial chemicals. These species were detected on various surfaces, such as concrete, asphalt, human skin, currency, airline boarding passes, business cards, fruits, vegetables, spices, beverages, body fluids, horticultural leaves, cocktail glasses, and clothing. DART employs no radioactive components and is more versatile than devices using radioisotope-based ionization. Because its response is instantaneous, DART provides real-time information, a critical requirement for screening or high throughput.

The composite film has a layered structure, and PANI-NFs are sandwiched between CCG layers. Furthermore, it is mechanically stable and has a high flexibility; thus, it can be bent into large angles or be shaped into various desired structures. The conductivity of the composite film containing 44% CCG (5.5 x 10(2) S m(-1)) is about 10 times that of a PANI-NF film. Supercapacitor devices based on this conductive flexible composite film showed large electrochemical capacitance (210 F g(-1)) at a discharge rate of 0.3 A g(-1).

Substrate-induced bandgap opening in epitaxial graphene	NATURE MATERIALS												Graphene has shown great application potential as the host material for next-generation electronic devices. However, despite its intriguing properties, one of the biggest hurdles for graphene to be useful as an electronic material is the lack of an energy gap in its electronic spectra. This, for example, prevents the use of graphene in making transistors. Although several proposals have been made to open a gap in graphene's electronic spectra, they all require complex engineering of the graphene layer. Here, we show that when graphene is epitaxially grown on SiC substrate, a gap of approximate to 0.26 eV is produced. This gap decreases as the sample thickness increases and eventually approaches zero when the number of layers exceeds four. We propose that the origin of this gap is the breaking of sublattice symmetry owing to the graphene-substrate interaction. We believe that our results highlight a promising direction for bandgap engineering of graphene.

J	Furche, F; Ahlrichs, R				Furche, F; Ahlrichs, R			Adiabatic time-dependent density functional methods for excited state properties	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												This work presents theory, implementation, and validation of excited state properties obtained from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Based on a fully variational expression for the excited state energy, a compact derivation of first order properties is given. We report an implementation of analytic excited state gradients and charge moments for local, gradient corrected, and hybrid functionals, as well as for the configuration interaction singles (CIS) and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) methods. By exploiting analogies to ground state energy and gradient calculations, efficient techniques can be transferred to excited state methods. Benchmark results demonstrate that, for low-lying excited states, geometry optimizations are not substantially more expensive than for the ground state, independent of the molecular size. We assess the quality of calculated adiabatic excitation energies, structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies by comparison with accurate experimental data for a variety of excited states and molecules. Similar trends are observed for adiabatic excitation energies as for vertical ones. TDDFT is more robust than CIS and TDHF, in particular, for geometries differing significantly from the ground state minimum. The TDDFT excited state structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies are of a remarkably high quality, which is comparable to that obtained in ground state density functional calculations. Thus, yielding considerably more accurate results at similar computational cost, TDDFT rivals CIS as a standard method for calculating excited state properties in larger molecules.

Graphene Quantum Dots Derived from Carbon Fibers	NANO LETTERS												Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), which are edge-bound nanometer-size graphene pieces, have fascinating optical and electronic properties. These have been synthesized either by nanolithography or from starting materials such as graphene oxide (GO) by the chemical breakdown of their extended planar structure, both of which are multistep tedious processes. Here, we report that during the acid treatment and chemical exfoliation of traditional pitch-based carbon fibers, that are both cheap and commercially available, the stacked graphitic submicrometer domains of the fibers are easily broken down, leading to the creation of GQDs with different size distribution in scalable amounts. The as-produced GQDs, in the size range of 1-4 nm, show two-dimensional morphology, most of which present zigzag edge structure, and are 1-3 atomic layers thick. The photoluminescence of the GQDs can be tailored through varying the size of the GQDs by changing process parameters. Due to the luminescence stability, nanosecond lifetime, biocompatibility, low toxicity, and high water solubility, these GQDs are demonstrated to be excellent probes for high contrast bioimaging and biosensing applications.

J	Liu, HB; Sadygov, RG; Yates, JR				Liu, HB; Sadygov, RG; Yates, JR			A model for random sampling and estimation of relative protein abundance in shotgun proteomics	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Proteomic analysis of complex protein mixtures using proteolytic digestion and liquid chromatography in combination with tandem mass spectrometry is a standard approach in biological studies. Data-dependent acquisition is used to automatically acquire tandem mass spectra of peptides eluting into the mass spectrometer. In more complicated mixtures, for example, whole cell lysates, data-dependent acquisition incompletely samples among the peptide ions present rather than acquiring tandem mass spectra for all ions available. We analyzed the sampling process and developed a statistical model to accurately predict the level of sampling expected for mixtures of a specific complexity. The model also predicts how many analyses are required for saturated sampling of a complex protein mixture. For a yeast-soluble cell lysate 10 analyses are required to reach a 95% saturation level on protein identifications based on our model. The statistical model also suggests a relationship between the level of sampling observed for a protein and the relative abundance of the protein in the mixture. We demonstrate a linear dynamic range over 2 orders of magnitude by using the number of spectra (spectral sampling) acquired for each protein.

Comparison of the Mechanism of Toxicity of Zinc Oxide and Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles Based on Dissolution and Oxidative Stress Properties	ACS NANO												Nanomaterials (NM) exhibit novel physicochemical properties that determine their interaction with biological substrates and processes. Three metal oxide nanoparticles that are currently being produced in high tonnage, TiO2 ZnO, and CeO2 were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis process and compared in a mechanistic study to elucidate the physicochemical characteristics that determine cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and toxic effects based on a test paradigm that was originally developed for oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 and BEAS-2B cell lines. ZnO induced toxicity in both cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidant injury, excitation of inflammation, and cell death. Using ICP-MS and fluorescent-labeled ZnO, it is found that ZnO dissolution could happen in culture medium and endosomes. Nondissolved ZnO nanoparticles enter caveolae in BEAS-2B but enter lysosomes in RAW 264.7 cells in which smaller particle remnants dissolve. In contrast, fluorescent-labeled CeO2 nanoparticles were taken up intact into caveolin-1 and LAMP-1 positive endosomal compartments, respectively, in BEAS-2B and RAW 264.7 cells, without inflammation or cytotoxicity. Instead, CeO2 suppressed ROS production and induced cellular resistance to an exogenous source of oxidative stress. Fluorescent-labeled TiO2 was processed by the same uptake pathways as CeO2 but did not elicit any adverse or protective effects. These results demonstrate that metal oxide nanoparticles induce a range of biological responses that vary from cytotoxic to cytoprotective and can only be properly understood by using a tiered test strategy such as we developed for oxidative stress and adapted to study other aspects of nanoparticle toxicity.

PbI2 was dissolved in N,N-dimethyformamide with equimolar N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and CH3NH3I. Stretching vibration of S=O appeared at 1045 cm(-1) for bare DMSO, which was shifted to 1020 and 1015 cm(-1) upon reacting DMSO with PbI2 and PbI2 + CH3NH3I, respectively, indicative of forming the adduct of PbI2.DMSO and CH3NH3I.PbI2.DMSO due to interaction between Lewis base DMSO and/or iodide (I-) and Lewis acid PbI2. Spin-coating of a DMF solution containing PbI2, CH3NH3I, and DMSO (1:1:1 mol %) formed a transparent adduct film, which was converted to a dark brown film upon heating at low temperature of 65 degrees C for 1 min due to removal of the volatile DMSO from the adduct. The adduct-induced CH3NH3PbI3 exhibited high charge extraction characteristics with hole mobility as high as 3.9 x 10(-3) cm(2)/(V s) and slow recombination rate.

In the solid state, in particular, they often appear in the form of visual bonding indicators. Because the latter require the crystal orbitals to be constructed from local basis sets, the application of the most popular density-functional theory codes (namely, those based on plane waves and pseudopotentials) appears as being ill-fitted to retrieve the chemical bonding information. In this paper, we describe a way to re-extract Hamilton-weighted populations from plane-wave electronic-structure calculations to develop a tool analogous to the familiar crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) method. We derive the new technique, dubbed "projected COHP" (pCOHP), and demonstrate its viability using examples of covalent, ionic, and metallic crystals (diamond, GaAs, CsCl, and Na). For the first time, this chemical bonding information is directly extracted from the results of plane-wave calculations.

Photocatalyts provide a potential strategy to solve these problems because these materials not only can directly convert solar energy into usable or storable energy resources but also can decompose organic pollutants under solar-light irradiation. However, the aforementioned applications require photocatalysts with a wide absorption range, long-term stability, high charge-separation efficiency and strong redox ability. Unfortunately, it is often difficult for a single-component photocatalyst to simultaneously fulfill all these requirements. The artificial heterogeneous Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, mimicking the natural photosynthesis process, overcome the drawbacks of single-component photocatalysts and satisfy those aforementioned requirements. Such multi-task systems have been extensively investigated in the past decade. Especially, the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems without redox pair have been widely used in the water splitting, solar cells, degradation of pollutants and CO2 conversion, which have a huge potential to solve the current energy and environmental crises facing the modern industrial development. Thus, this review gives a concise overview of the all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic systems, including their composition, construction, optimization and applications.

High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.

Synthesis and exfoliation of isocyanate-treated graphene oxide nanoplatelets	CARBON												A number of functionalized graphite oxides were prepared by treatment of graphite oxide (GO) with organic isocyanates. These isocyanate-treated GOs (iGOs) can then be exfoliated into functionalized graphene oxide nanoplatelets that can form a stable dispersion in polar aprotic solvents. Characterization of iGOs by FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis suggested that the isocyanate treatment results in the functionalization of the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in GO via formation of amides and carbamate esters, respectively. The degree of GO functionalization can be controlled via either the reactivity of the isocyanate or the reaction time.

J	Guo, YG; Hu, JS; Wan, LJ				Guo, Yu-Guo; Hu, Jin-Song; Wan, Li-Jun			Nanostructured materials for electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices	ADVANCED MATERIALS												One of the greatest challenges for our society is providing powerful electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells are amongst the most promising candidates in terms of energy densities and power densities. Nanostructured materials are currently of interest for such devices because of their high surface area, novel size effects, significantly enhanced kinetics, and so on. This Progress Report describes some recent developments in nanostructured anode and cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, addressing the benefits of nanometer-size effects, the disadvantages of 'nano', and strategies to solve these issues such as nano/micro hierarchical structures and surface coatings, as well as developments in the discovery of nanostructured Pt-based electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Approaches to lowering the cost of Pt catalysts include the use of i) novel nanostructures of Pt, ii) new cost-effective synthesis routes, iii) binary or multiple catalysts, and iv) new catalyst supports.

It can be explained by the presence of a region of positive electrostatic potential, the sigma-hole, on the outermost portion of the halogen's surface, centered on the R-X axis. We have carried out a natural bond order B3LYP analysis of the molecules CF3X, with X = F, Cl, Br and I. It shows that the Cl, Br and I atoms in these molecules closely approximate the s(2)p(x)(2)p(y)(2)p(z)(1) configuration, where the z-axis is along the R-X bond. The three unshared pairs of electrons produce a belt of negative electrostatic potential around the central part of X, leaving the outermost region positive, the sigma-hole. This is not found in the case of fluorine, for which the combination of its high electronegativity plus significant sp-hybridization causes an influx of electronic charge that neutralizes the sigma-hole. These factors become progressively less important in proceeding to Cl, Br and I, and their effects are also counteracted by the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents in the remainder of the molecule. Thus a sigma-hole is observed for the Cl in CF3Cl, but not in CH3Cl.

They often crystallize to form atomically smooth thin films, nanotubes, and platelet or fullerene-like nanoparticles due to the anisotropic bonding. Structures that predominately expose edges of the layers exhibit high surface energy and are often considered unstable. In this communication, we present a synthesis process to grow MoS2 and MoSe2 thin films with vertically aligned layers, thereby maximally exposing the edges on the film surface. Such edge-terminated films are metastable structures of MoS2 and MoSe2, which may find applications in diverse catalytic reactions. We have confirmed their catalytic activity in a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which the exchange current density correlates directly with the density of the exposed edge sites.

Activating the MoS2 basal plane could further enhance its HER activity but is not often a strategy for doing so. Herein, we report the first activation and optimization of the basal plane of monolayer 2H-MoS2 for HER by introducing sulphur (S) vacancies and strain. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the S-vacancies are new catalytic sites in the basal plane, where gap states around the Fermi level allow hydrogen to bind directly to exposed Mo atoms. The hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H)) can be further manipulated by straining the surface with S-vacancies, which fine-tunes the catalytic activity. Proper combinations of S-vacancy and strain yield the optimal Delta G(H) = 0 eV, which allows us to achieve the highest intrinsic HER activity among molybdenum-sulphide-based catalysts.

Bandgap Engineering of Strained Monolayer and Bilayer MoS<sub>2</sub>	NANO LETTERS												We report the influence of uniaxial tensile mechanical strain in the range 0-2.2% on the phonon spectra and bandstructures of monolayer and bilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) two-dimensional crystals. First, we employ Raman spectroscopy to observe phonon softening with increased strain, breaking the degeneracy in the E' Raman mode of MoS2, and extract a Gruneisen parameter of similar to 1.06. Second, using photoluminescence spectroscopy we measure a decrease in the optical band gap of MoS2 that is approximately linear with strain, similar to 45 meV/% strain for monolayer MoS2 and similar to 120 meV/% strain for bilayer MoS2. Third, we observe a pronounced strain-induced decrease in the photoluminescence intensity of monolayer MoS2 that is indicative of the direct-to-indirect transition of the character of the optical band gap of this material at applied strain of similar to 1%. These observations constitute a demonstration of strain engineering the band structure in the emergent class of two-dimensional crystals, transition-metal dichalcogenides.

However, many fundamental questions, such as the relations between the pore size of carbon electrodes, ion size of the electrolyte, and the capacitance have not yet been fully answered. We show that the pore size leading to the maximum double-layer capacitance of a TiC-derived carbon electrode in a solvent-free ethyl-methylimmidazolium-bis(trifluoro-methane-suffonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI) ionic liquid is roughly equal to the ion size (-0.7 nm). The capacitance values of TiC-CDC produced at 500 degrees C are more than 160 F/g and 85 F/cm(3) at 60 degrees C, while standard activated carbons with larger pores and a broader pore size distribution present capacitance values lower than 100 F/g and 50 F/cm(3) in ionic liquids. A significant drop in capacitance has been observed in pores that were larger or smaller than the ion size by just an angstrom, suggesting that the pore size must be tuned with sub-angstrom accuracy when selecting a carbon/ion couple. This work suggests a general approach to EDLC design leading to the maximum energy density, which has been now proved for both solvated organic salts and solvent-free liquid electrolytes.

The Accuracy of Binding Free Energy Calculations Based on Molecular Dynamics Simulations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING												The Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) and the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) methods calculate binding free energies for macromolecules by combining molecular mechanics calculations and continuum solvation models. To systematically evaluate the performance of these methods, we report here an extensive study of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3) Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free energies. Our results showed that MM/PBSA performed better in calculating absolute, but not necessarily relative, binding free energies than MM/GBSA. Considering its computational efficiency, MM/GBSA can serve as a powerful tool in drug design, where correct ranking of inhibitors is often emphasized.

Zinc oxide has substantial advantages including large exciton binding energy, as demonstrated by efficient excitonic lasing on optical excitation(5,6). Several groups have postulated the use of p-type ZnO doped with nitrogen, arsenic or phosphorus(7-10), and even p-n junctions(11-13). However, the choice of dopant and growth technique remains controversial and the reliability of p-type ZnO is still under debate(14). If ZnO is ever to produce long-lasting and robust devices, the quality of epitaxial layers has to be improved as has been the protocol in other compound semiconductors(15). Here we report high-quality undoped films with electron mobility exceeding that in the bulk. We have used a new technique to fabricate p-type ZnO reproducibly. Violet electroluminescence from homostructural p-i-n junctions is demonstrated at room-temperature.

Enhanced charge-collection efficiencies and light scattering in dye-sensitized solar cells using oriented TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes arrays	NANO LETTERS												We report on the microstructure and dynamics of electron transport and recombination in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) incorporating oriented TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays. The morphology of the NT arrays, which were prepared from electrochemically anodized Ti foils, were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The arrays were found to consist of closely packed NTs, several micrometers in length, with typical wall thicknesses and intertube spacings of 8-10 nm and pore diameters of about 30 nm. The calcined material was fully crystalline with individual NTs consisting of about 30 nm sized crystallites. The transport and recombination properties of the NT and nanoparticle (NP) films used in DSSCs were studied by frequency-resolved modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopies. While both morphologies display comparable transport times, recombination was much slower in the NT films, indicating that the NT-based DSSCs have significantly higher charge-collection efficiencies than their NP-based counterparts. Dye molecules were shown to cover both the interior and exterior walls of the NTs. Analysis of photocurrent measurements indicates that the light-harvesting efficiencies of NT-based DSSCs were higher than those found for DSSCs incorporating NPs owing to stronger internal light-scattering effects.

The essential novelty in this so-called GFN2-xTB method is the inclusion of anisotropic second order density fluctuation effects via short-range damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments. Without noticeable increase in the computational demands, this results in a less empirical and overall more physically sound method, which does not require any classical halogen or hydrogen bonding corrections and which relies solely on global and element-specific parameters (available up to radon, Z = 86). Moreover, the atomic partial charge dependent D4 London dispersion model is incorporated self-consistently, which can be naturally obtained in a tight-binding picture from second order density fluctuations. Fully analytical and numerically precise gradients (nuclear forces) are implemented. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked for a wide variety of systems and compared with other semiempirical methods. Along with excellent performance for the "target" properties, we also find lower errors for "off-target" properties such as barrier heights and molecular dipole moments. High computational efficiency along with the improved physics compared to its precursor GFN-xTB makes this method well-suited to explore the conformational space of molecular systems. Significant improvements are furthermore observed for various benchmark sets, which are prototypical for biomolecular systems in aqueous solution.

It is found that the sheet resistance of graphite oxide film reduced using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is much lower than that of films reduced using hydrazine (N2H4). This is attributed to the formation of C-N groups in the N2H4 case, which may act as donors compensating the hole carriers in reduced graphite oxide. In the case of NaBH4 reduction, the interlayer distance is first slightly expanded by the formation of intermediate boron oxide complexes and then contracted by the gradual removal of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups along with the boron oxide complexes. The fabricated conducting film comprising a NaBH4-reduced graphite oxide reveals a sheet resistance comparable to that of dispersed graphene.

Here we developed a ligand-assisted reprecipitation strategy to luminescent and color-tunable colloidal CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I, Cl) quantum dots with absolute quantum yield up to 70% at room temperature and low excitation fluencies. To illustrate the photoluminescence enhancements in these quantum dots, we conducted comprehensive composition and surface characterizations and determined the time- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra. Comparisons between small-sized CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dots (average diameter 3.3 nm) and corresponding micrometer-sized bulk particles (2-8 mu m) suggest that the intense increased photoluminescence quantum yield originates from the increase of exciton binding energy due to size reduction as well as proper chemical passivations of the Br-rich surface.

Moreover, colloidal CH3NH3PbBX3 quantum dots are expected to exhibit interesting nanoscale excitonic properties and also have other potential applications in lasers, electroluminescence devices, and optical sensors.

Particularly, the interface between protein digestion and mass spectrometric analysis has a large influence on the overall quality and sensitivity of the analysis. We here describe a novel procedure in which a very small disk of beads embedded in a Teflon meshwork is placed as a microcolumn into pipet tips. Termed Stage, for Slop And Go Extraction, the procedure has been implemented with commercially available material (C18 Empore Disks (3M, Minneapolis, MN)) as frit and separation material. The disk is introduced in a simple and fast process yielding a convenient and completely reliable procedure for the production of self-packed microcolumns in pipet tips. It is held in place free of obstacles solely by the narrowing tip, ensuring optimized loading and elution of analytes. Five disks are conveniently placed in 1 min, adding <0.1 cent in material costs to the price of each tip. The system allows fast loading with low backpressure (> 300 muL/min for the packed column using manual force) while eliminating the possibility of blocking. The loading capacity of C(18)-StageTips (column bed: 0.4 mm diameter, 0.5 mm length) is 2-4 mug of protein digest, which can be increased by using larger diameter or stacked disks. Five femtomole of tryptic BSA digest could be recovered quantitatively. We have found that the Stage system is well-suited as a universal sample preparation system for proteomics.

It has been proven that the use of these antitubercular agents together, shortens the treatment period from 12-18 months to 6 months [1]. In this work we use a new Density Functional Theory chemistry model called CHIH-DFT (Chihuahua-Heterocycles-Density Functional Theory) that reflects the mixture of Hartree Fock exchange and DFT exchange, according to a mixing parameter based on empirical rules suited for heterocyclic systems. This new chemistry model was used to calculate the molecular structure of these antitubercular compounds, as well as their infrared, UV spectra, chemical reactivity and electronic properties. The UV and infrared spectra were obtained by experimental techniques. The calculated molecular structure, UV and IR spectra values from CHIH-DFT were compared with experimentally obtained values and theoretical studies. These results are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical studies. We also predicted using the relative electrophilicity and relative nucleophilicity concepts as defined by Roy et al. [2] the chemical active sites for the three antitubercular compounds as well as their electronegativity, ionization potential, electron affinity, hardness, dipole moment, E-HOMO-E-LUMO gap energy, etc.					Glossman-Mitnik, Daniel/I-5742-2013; Gallo, Marco/F-4383-2019; Glossman-Mitnik, Daniel/C-4019-2011	Glossman-Mitnik, Daniel/0000-0002-9583-4256; Gallo, Marco/0000-0001-7400-9233													1610-2940	0948-5023				APR	2007	13	4					505	518		10.1007/s00894-007-0170-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00894-007-0170-2								17260147					WOS:000244786200005

Peter; Marrink, Siewert-Jan			The MARTINI coarse-grained force field: Extension to proteins	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION												Many biologically interesting phenomena occur on a time scale that is too long to be studied by atomistic simulations. These phenomena include the dynamics of large proteins and self-assembly of biological materials. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling allows computer simulations to be run on length and time scales that are 2-3 orders of magnitude larger compared to atomistic simulations, providing a bridge between the atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed a new CG model for proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force field. Here, we validate the model for its use in peptide-bilayer systems. In order to validate the model, we calculated the potential of mean force for each amino acid as a function of its distance from the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer. We then compared amino acid association constants, the partitioning of a series of model pentapeptides, the partitioning and orientation,of WALP23 in DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. A comparison with results obtained from atomistic models shows good agreement in all of the tests performed. We also performed a systematic investigation of the partitioning of five series of polyalanine-leucine peptides (with different lengths and compositions) in DPPC bilayers. As expected, the fraction of peptides partitioned at the interface increased with decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine content, demonstrating that the CG model is capable of discriminating partitioning behavior arising from subtle differences in the amino acid composition. Finally, we simulated the concentration-dependent formation of transmembrane pores by magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with atomistic simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In conclusion, the model is computationally efficient and effectively reproduces peptide-lipid interactions and the partitioning of amino acids and peptides in lipid bilayers.

When carboxylate contents formed from the primary hydroxyl groups of the celluloses reached approximately 1.5 mmol/g, the oxidized cellulose/water slurries were mostly converted to transparent and highly viscous dispersions by mechanical treatment. Transmission electron microscopic observation showed that the dispersions consisted of individualized cellulose nanofibers 3-4 nm in width and a few microns in length. No intrinsic differences between never-dried and once-dried celluloses were found for preparing the dispersion, as long as carboxylate contents in the TEMPO-oxidized celluloses reached approximately 1.5 mmol/g. Changes in viscosity of the dispersions during the mechanical treatment corresponded with those in the dispersed states of the cellulose nanofibers in water.

In the past, ISO, IUPAC, and AOAC International have cooperated to produce a-reed protocols or guidelines on the "Design, conduct and interpretation of method performance studies" [1], on the "Proficiency testing of (chemical) analytical laboratories" [2], on "Internal quality control in analytical chemistry laboratories" [3], and on "The use of recovery information in analytical measurement" [4]. The Working Group that produced these protocols/guidelines has now been mandated by IUPAC to prepare guidelines on the single-laboratory validation of methods of analysis. These guidelines provide minimum recommendations on procedures that should be employed to ensure adequate validation of analytical methods. A draft of the guidelines has been discussed at an International Symposium on the Harmonization of Quality Assurance Systems in Chemical Laboratory, the proceedings from which have been published by the UK Royal Society of Chemistry.

The control of human mesenchymal cell differentiation using nanoscale symmetry and disorder	NATURE MATERIALS												A key tenet of bone tissue engineering is the development of scaffold materials that can stimulate stem cell differentiation in the absence of chemical treatment to become osteoblasts without compromising material properties. At present, conventional implant materials fail owing to encapsulation by soft tissue, rather than direct bone bonding. Here, we demonstrate the use of nanoscale disorder to stimulate human mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) to produce bone mineral in vitro, in the absence of osteogenic supplements. This approach has similar efficiency to that of cells cultured with osteogenic media. In addition, the current studies show that topographically treated MSCs have a distinct differentiation profile compared with those treated with osteogenic media, which has implications for cell therapies.

Epitaxial graphene on ruthenium	NATURE MATERIALS												Graphene has been used to explore the fascinating electronic properties of ideal two-dimensional carbon, and shows great promise for quantum device architectures. The primary method for isolating graphene, micromechanical cleavage of graphite, is difficult to scale up for applications. Epitaxial growth is an attractive alternative, but achieving large graphene domains with uniform thickness remains a challenge, and substrate bonding may strongly affect the electronic properties of epitaxial graphene layers. Here, we show that epitaxy on Ru(0001) produces arrays of macroscopic single-crystalline graphene domains in a controlled, layer-by-layer fashion. Whereas the first graphene layer indeed interacts strongly with the metal substrate, the second layer is almost completely detached, shows weak electronic coupling to the metal, and hence retains the inherent electronic structure of graphene. Our findings demonstrate a route towards rational graphene synthesis on transition-metal templates for applications in electronics, sensing or catalysis.

The basis functions generalize the 6-31G and 6-31G* sets commonly used for atoms up to Ar. A reexamination of the 6-31G* basis set for K and Ca developed earlier leads to the inclusion of 3d orbitals into the valence space for these atoms. Now the 6-31G basis for the whole third-row K through Kr has six primitive Gaussians for 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals, and a split-valence pair of three and one primitives for valence orbitals, which are 4s, 4p, and 3d. The nature of the polarization functions for third-row atoms is reexamined as well. The polarization functions for K, Ca, and Ga through Kr are single set of Cartesian d-type primitives. The polarization functions for transition metals are defined to be a single 7f set of uncontracted primitives. Comparison with experimental data shows good agreement with bond lengths and angles for representative vapor-phase metal complexes. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Since the discovery of this new family of nanoporous materials and the concept of so called 'reticular design', nowadays several hundred different types of MOF are known. The self assembly of metal ions, which act as coordination centres, linked together with a variety of polyatomic organic bridging ligands, results in tailorable nanoporous host materials as robust solids with high thermal and mechanical stability. Describing examples of different zinc-containing structures, e.g. MOF-2, MOF-5 and IRMOF8 verified synthesis methods will be given, as well as a totally novel electrochemical approach for transition metal based MOFs will be presented for the first time. With sufficient amounts of sample now being available, the testing of metal-organic frameworks in fields of catalysis and gas processing is exemplified. Report is given on the catalytic activation of alkynes (formation of methoxypropene from propyne, vinylester synthesis from acetylene). Removal of impurities in natural gas (traces of tetrahydrothiophene in methane), pressure swing separation of rare gases (krypton and xenon) and storage of hydrogen (3.3 wt% at 2.0 MPa/77 K on Cu-BTC-MOF) will underline the prospective future industrial use of metal-organic frameworks in gas processing.

J	Steele, BCH				Steele, BCH			Appraisal of Ce<sub>1-<i>y</i></sub>Gd<i><sub>y</sub></i>O<sub>2-<i>y</i>/2</sub> electrolytes for IT-SOFC operation at 500°C	SOLID STATE IONICS												Recent thermodynamic and electrical conductivity data are evaluated to select the most appropriate electrolyte composition for IT-SOFC operation at 500 degrees C. Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has an ionic lattice conductivity of 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 500 degrees C, and the Gd3+ ion is the preferred dopant, compared to Sm3+ and Y3+, at this temperature. Thermodynamic investigations indicate that for CeO2-Re2O3 solid solutions at intermediate temperatures it becomes easier to reduce Ce4+ as the concentration of Re2O3 is increased. As the associated electron mobilities do not appear to be a strong function of composition it follows that Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has a wider ionic domain than Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 at intermediate temperatures. particular attention is drawn to the deleterious effects of impurities (principally SiO2) which are responsible for large dopant concentration dependent grain boundary resistivities. These grain boundary resistivities can obscure the intrinsic lattice ionic conductivities and cause investigators to select non-optimal dopant compositions. It follows that the use of clean (SiO2 < 50 ppm) powders is strongly recommended, particularly as these are now commercially available. At present there is also no compelling evidence to confirm that the intrinsic lattice electronic conductivity is significantly changed by co-doping with Pr6O11. Finally the I-V characteristics of single cells incorporating 25-mu m thick Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolytes are modelled, and the requirements for composite electrodes briefly discussed so that power densities of 0.4 W cm(-2) at 500 degrees C can be attained.

High-Throughput Droplet Digital PCR System for Absolute Quantitation of DNA Copy Number	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Digital PCR enables the absolute quantitation of nucleic acids in a sample. The lack of scalable and practical technologies for digital PCR implementation has hampered the widespread adoption of this inherently powerful technique. Here we describe a high-throughput droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) system that enables processing of similar to 2 million PCR reactions using conventional TaqMan assays with a 96-well plate workflow. Three applications demonstrate that the massive partitioning afforded by our ddPCR system provides orders of magnitude more p:recision and sensitivity than real-time PCR. First, we show the accurate measurement of germline copy number variation. Second, for rare alleles, we show sensitive detection of mutant DNA in a 100000-fold excess of wildtype background. Third, we demonstrate absolute quantitation of circulating fetal and maternal DNA from cell-free plasma. We anticipate this ddPCR system will allow researchers to explore complex genetic landscapes, discover and validate new disease associations, and define a new era of molecular diagnostics.

Regardless of the x value, the quantum yield values from irradiating with Vis light was lower than with UV light, which suggests that the isolated narrow band formed above the valence band is responsible for the Vis light response in the present nitrogen doped TiO2. In addition, increasing the nitrogen concentration when irradiating with UV light lowered the quantum yields, indicating that the doping sites could also serve as recombination sites.

Although the structural regularity provides this new type of porous material with high potentials in catalysis, no example has been presented so far. Herein, we report the first application of a new COF material, COF-LZU1, for highly efficient catalysis. The easily prepared imine-linked COF-LZU1 possesses a two-dimensional eclipsed layered-sheet structure, making its incorporation with metal ions feasible. Via a simple post-treatment, a Pd(II)-containing COF, Pd/COF-LZU1, was accordingly synthesized, which showed excellent catalytic activity in catalyzing the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction. The superior utility of Pd/COF-LZU1 in catalysis was elucidated by the broad scope of the reactants and the excellent yields (96-98%) of the reaction products, together with the high stability and easy recyclability of the catalyst. We expect that our approach will further boost research on designing and employing functional COF materials for catalysis.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful and unique technique for structure characterization. The most important application of TEM is the atomic-resolution real-space imaging of nanoparticles. This article introduces the fundamentals of TEM and its applications in structural determination of shape-controlled nanocrystals and their assemblies. By forming a nanometer size electron probe, TEM is unique in identifying and quantifying the chemical and electronic structure of individual nanocrystals. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy analysis of the solid-state effects and mapping the valence states art: even more attractive. In situ TEM is demonstrated for characterizing and measuring the thermodynamic, electric, and mechanical properties of individual nanostructures, from which the structure-property relationship can be registered with a specific nanoparticle/structure.

The obtained graphene oxide/PANI composites with different mass ratios were reduced to graphene using hydrazine followed by reoxidation and reprotonation of the reduced PANI to give the graphene/PANI nanocomposites. The morphology, composition, and electronic structure of the composites together with pure polyaniline fibers (PANI-F), graphene oxide (GO), and graphene (GR) were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid-state C-13 NMR, FT-IR, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the chemically modified graphene and the PANI nanofibers formed a uniform nanocomposite with the PANI Fibers absorbed on the graphene surface and/or Filled between the graphene sheets. Such uniform structure together with the observed high conductivities afforded high specific capacitance and good cycling stability during the charge-discharge process when used as supercapacitor electrodes. A specific capacitance of as high as 480 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g was achieved over a PANI-doped graphene composite. The research data revealed that high specific capacitance and good cycling stability can be achieved either by doping chemically modified graphenes with PANI or by doping the bulky PAN Is with graphene/graphene oxide.

Herein, we report an unusual single crystal structure of a 25-gold-atom cluster (1.27 nm diameter, surface-to-surface distance) protected by eighteen phenylethanethiol ligands. The Au-25 cluster features a centered icosahedral Au-13 core capped by twelve gold atoms that are situated in six pairs around the three mutually perpendicular 2-fold axes of the icosahedron. The thiolate ligands bind to the Au-25 core in an exclusive bridging mode. This highly symmetric structure is distinctly different from recent predictions of density functional theory, and it also violates the empirical golden rule-cluster of clusters", which would predict a biicosahedral structure via vertex sharing of two icosahedral M-13 building blocks as previously established in various 25-atom metal clusters protected by phosphine ligands. These results point to the importance of the ligand-gold core interactions. The Au-25(SR)(18) clusters exhibit multiple molecular-like absorption bands, and we find the results are in good correspondence with time-dependent density functional theory calculations for the observed structure.

T.; Goddard, William A., III			ReaxFF reactive force field for molecular dynamics simulations of hydrocarbon oxidation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A												To investigate the initial chemical events associated with high-temperature gas-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons, we have expanded the ReaxFF reactive force field training set to include additional transition states and chemical reactivity of systems relevant to these reactions and optimized the force field parameters against a quantum mechanics (QM)-based training set. To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, we performed a range of NVT-MD simulations on various hydrocarbon/O-2 systems. From simulations on methane/O-2, o-xylene/O-2, propene/O-2, and benzene/O-2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene > o-xylene > methane > benzene), following the trend in the C-H bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO/CO2/H2O mixture and found that the pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition-and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and hydrocarbon radical species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system. Since ReaxFF is capable of simulating complicated reaction pathways without any preconditioning, we believe that atomistic modeling with ReaxFF provides a useful method for determining the initial events of oxidation of hydrocarbons under extreme, conditions and can enhance existing combustion models.

Flexible, stretchable and wearable sensors can be easily mounted on clothing or directly attached onto the body. Especially, highly stretchable and sensitive strain sensors are needed for the human motion detection. Here, we report highly flexible, stretchable and sensitive strain sensors based on the nanocomposite of silver nanowire (AgNW) network and PDMS elastomer in the form of the sandwich structure (i.e., AgNW thin film embedded between two layers of PDMS). The AgNW network-elastomer nanocomposite based strain sensors show strong piezoresistivity with tunable gauge factors in the ranges of 2 to 14 and a high stretchability up to 70%. We demonstrate the applicability of our high performance strain sensors by fabricating a glove Integrated with five strain sensors for the motion detection of fingers and control of an avatar in the virtual environment.

The strategy is based on a pyrolysis process of predesigned bimetallic Zn/Co metal-organic frameworks, during which Co can be reduced by carbonization of the organic linker and Zn is selectively evaporated away at high temperatures above 800 degrees C. The spherical aberration correction electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements both confirm the atomic dispersion of Co atoms stabilized by as-generated N-doped porous carbon. Surprisingly, the obtained Co-N-x single sites exhibit superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential (0.881V) that is more positive than commercial Pt/C (0.811V) and most reported non-precious metal catalysts. Durability tests revealed that the Co single atoms exhibit outstanding chemical stability during electrocatalysis and thermal stability that resists sintering at 900 degrees C.

This methodology has the potential to be used in many different areas of chemistry, for example it provides a perfect opportunity for the late-stage diversification of various kinds of organic scaffolds, ranging from relatively small molecules like drug candidates, to complex polydisperse organic compounds such as polymers. In this way, C-H activation approaches enable relatively straightforward access to a plethora of analogues or can help to streamline the lead-optimization phase. Furthermore, synthetic pathways for the construction of complex organic materials can now be designed that are more atom-and step-economical than previous methods and, in some cases, can be based on synthetic disconnections that are just not possible without C-H activation. This Perspective highlights the potential of metal-catalysed C-H bond activation reactions, which now extend beyond the field of traditional synthetic organic chemistry.

These separated CDs emitted bright and stable luminescence in gradient colors from blue to red under a single-wavelength UV light. They exhibited high optical uniformity; that is, every sample showed only one peak in the PL excitation spectrum, only one peak in the excitation-independent PL emission spectrum, and similar monoexponential fluorescence lifetimes. Although these samples had similar distributions of particle size and graphite structure in their carbon cores, the surface state gradually varied among the samples, especially the degree of oxidation. Therefore, the observed red shift in their emission peaks from 440 to 625 nm was ascribed to a gradual reduction in their band gaps with the increasing incorporation of oxygen species into their surface structures. These energy bands were found to depend on the surface groups and structures but not on the particle size, not as in traditional semiconductor quantum dots. In addition, because of their excellent PL properties and low cytotoxicity, these CDs could be used to image cells in different colors under a single-wavelength light source, and the red-emitting CDs could be used to image live mice because of the strong penetration capability of their fluorescence.

Both high semiconductor charge-carrier mobility, optimized through understanding and control of the semiconductor microstructure, and stability of the semiconductor to ambient electrochemical oxidative processes are required. We report on new semiconducting liquid-crystalline thieno[3,2-b] thiophene polymers, the enhancement in charge-carrier mobility achieved through highly organized morphology from processing in the mesophase, and the effects of exposure to both ambient and low-humidity air on the performance of transistor devices. Relatively large crystalline domain sizes on the length scale of lithographically accessible channel lengths (similar to 200 nm) were exhibited in thin films, thus offering the potential for fabrication of single-crystal polymer transistors.

J	Yap, CW				Yap, Chun Wei			PaDEL-Descriptor: An Open Source Software to Calculate Molecular Descriptors and Fingerprints	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												Introduction: PaDEL-Descriptor is a software for calculating molecular descriptors and fingerprints. The software currently calculates 797 descriptors (663 1D, 2D descriptors, and 134 3D descriptors) and 10 types of fingerprints. These descriptors and fingerprints are calculated mainly using The Chemistry Development Kit. Some additional descriptors and fingerprints were added, which include atom type electrotopological state descriptors, McGowan volume, molecular linear free energy relation descriptors, ring counts, count of chemical substructures identified by Laggner, and binary fingerprints and count of chemical substructures identified by Klekota and Roth. Methods: PaDEL-Descriptor was developed using the Java language and consists of a library component and an interface component. The library component allows it to be easily integrated into quantitative structure activity relationship software to provide the descriptor calculation feature while the interface component allows it to be used as a standalone software. The software uses a Master/Worker pattern to take advantage of the multiple CPU cores that are present in most modern computers to speed up calculations of molecular descriptors. Results: The software has several advantages over existing standalone molecular descriptor calculation software. It is free and open source, has both graphical user interface and command line interfaces, can work on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS), supports more than 90 different molecular file formats, and is multithreaded. Conclusion: PaDEL-Descriptor is a useful addition to the currently available molecular descriptor calculation software.

Thermal annealing and passivation of oxide defects using chemical modification were found to increase the average transconductance from 45 to 800 nS and average mobility from 30 to 560 cm(2)/V(.)s with peak values of 2000 nS and 1350 cm(2)/V(.)s, respectively.

The graphene hybrids exhibit an interconnected macroporous framework of graphene sheets with uniform dispersion of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs). In studying the effects of the carbon support on the Fe3O4 NPs for the ORR, we found that Fe3O4/N-GAs show a more positive onset potential, higher cathodic density, lower H2O2 yield, and higher electron transfer number for the ORR in alkaline media than Fe3O4 NPs supported on N-doped carbon black or N-doped graphene sheets, highlighting the importance of the 3D macropores and high specific surface area of the GA support for improving the ORR performance. Furthermore, Fe3O4/N-GAs show better durability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst.

J	Mahoney, MW; Jorgensen, WL				Mahoney, MW; Jorgensen, WL			A five-site model for liquid water and the reproduction of the density anomaly by rigid, nonpolarizable potential functions	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												The ability of simple potential functions to reproduce accurately the density of liquid water from -37 to 100 degrees C at 1 to 10 000 atm has been further explored. The result is the five-site TIP5P model, which yields significantly improved results; the average error in the density over the 100 degrees temperature range from -37.5 to 62.5 degrees C at 1 atm is only 0.006 g cm(-3). Classical Monte Carlo statistical mechanics calculations have been performed to optimize the parameters, especially the position of the negative charges along the lone-pair directions. Initial calculations with 216 molecules in the NPT ensemble at 1 atm focused on finding a model that reproduced the shape of the liquid density curve as a function of temperature. Calculations performed for 512 molecules with the final TIP5P model demonstrate that the density maximum near 4 degrees C at 1 atm is reproduced, while high-quality structural and thermodynamic results are maintained. Attainment of high precision for the low-temperature runs required sampling for more than 1 billion Monte Carlo configurations. In addition, the dielectric constant was computed from the response to an applied electric field; the result is 81.5 +/- 1.5 at 25 degrees C and the experimental curve is mirrored from 0-100 degrees C at 1 atm. The TIP5P model is also found to perform well as a function of pressure; the density of liquid water at 25 degrees C is reproduced with an average error of similar to 2% over the range from 1 to 10 000 atm, and the shift of the temperature of maximum density to lower temperature with increasing pressure is also obtained.

E.; Yousefi, Ramin			X-ray analysis of ZnO nanoparticles by Williamson-Hall and size-strain plot methods	SOLID STATE SCIENCES												ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were prepared by a sol-gel combustion method from a zinc acetate precursor and acetic acid. The ZnO-NPs were synthesized at calcination temperatures of 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C for 1 h. The synthesized ZnO-NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and TEM. The XRD results revealed that the sample product was crystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite phase. High-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed single-crystal ZnO-NPs with nearly spherical shapes. The crystalline development in the ZnO-NPs was investigated by X-ray peak broadening. The Williamson-Hall (W-H) analysis and size-strain plot method were used to study the individual contributions of crystallite sizes and lattice strain on the peak broadening of the ZnO-NPs. The physical parameters such as strain, stress and energy density values were calculated more precisely for all the reflection peaks of XRD corresponding to the wurtzite hexagonal phase of ZnO lying in the range of 20 degrees-100 degrees from the modified form of the W-H plot assuming a uniform deformation model (UDM), uniform stress deformation model (USDM), uniform deformation energy density model (UDEDM) and by the size-strain plot method (SSP). The results obtained showed that the mean particle size of the ZnO-NPs estimated from the TEM, W-H analysis and the SSP method were highly intercorrelated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Liquid Phase Production of Graphene by Exfoliation of Graphite in Surfactant/Water Solutions	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												We have demonstrated a method to disperse and exfoliate graphite to give graphene suspended in water-surfactant solutions. Optical characterization of these suspensions allowed the partial optimization of the dispersion process. Transmission electron microscopy showed the dispersed phase to consist of small graphitic flakes. More than 40% of these flakes had <5 layers with similar to 3% of flakes consisting of monolayers. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy shows the monolayers to be generally free of defects. The dispersed graphitic flakes are stabilized against reaggregation by Coulomb repulsion due to the adsorbed surfactant. We use DLVO and Hamaker theory to describe this stabilization. However, the larger flakes tend to sediment out over similar to 6 weeks, leaving only small flakes dispersed. It is possible to form thin films by vacuum filtration of these dispersions. Raman and IR spectroscopic analysis of these films suggests the flakes to be largely free of defects and oxides, although X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows evidence of a small oxide population. Individual graphene flakes can be deposited onto mica by spray coating, allowing statistical analysis of flake size and thickness. Vacuum filtered films are reasonably conductive and are semitransparent. Further improvements may result in the development of cheap transparent conductors.

J	Cossi, M; Barone, V				Cossi, M; Barone, V			Time-dependent density functional theory for molecules in liquid solutions	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												A procedure based on the polarizable continuum model (PCM) has been applied to reproduce solvent effects on electronic spectra in connection with the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). To account for solute-solvent interactions, a suitable operator has been defined, which depends on the solute electronic density and can be used to modify the TD-DFT equations for the calculation of molecular polarizabilities and of electronic transition energies. The solute-solvent operator has been derived from a PCM approach depending on solute electrostatic potential: Recently, it has been shown that such an approach also provides an excellent treatment of the solute electronic charge lying far from the nuclei, being particularly reliable for this kind of applications. The method has been tested for formaldehyde in water and in diethyl-ether, and then applied to the calculation of solvent effects on the n --> pi* transition of diazabenzenes in different solvents. The computed transition energies are in fairly good agreement with experimental values. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.

Implicit solvation model for density-functional study of nanocrystal surfaces and reaction pathways	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Solid-liquid interfaces are at the heart of many modern-day technologies and provide a challenge to many materials simulation methods. A realistic first-principles computational study of such systems entails the inclusion of solvent effects. In this work, we implement an implicit solvation model that has a firm theoretical foundation into the widely used density-functional code Vienna ab initio Software Package. The implicit solvation model follows the framework of joint density functional theory. We describe the framework, our algorithm and implementation, and benchmarks for small molecular systems. We apply the solvation model to study the surface energies of different facets of semiconducting and metallic nanocrystals and the S(N)2 reaction pathway. We find that solvation reduces the surface energies of the nanocrystals, especially for the semiconducting ones and increases the energy barrier of the S(N)2 reaction.

Band alignment of rutile and anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>	NATURE MATERIALS												The most widely used oxide for photocatalytic applications owing to its low cost and high activity is TiO2. The discovery of the photolysis of water on the surface of TiO2 in 1972(1) launched four decades of intensive research into the underlying chemical and physical processes involved(2-5). Despite much collected evidence, a thoroughly convincing explanation of why mixed-phase samples of anatase and rutile outperform the individual polymorphs has remained elusive(6). One long-standing controversy is the energetic alignment of the band edges of the rutile and anatase polymorphs of TiO2 (ref. 7). We demonstrate, through a combination of state-of-the-art materials simulation techniques and X-ray photoemission experiments, that a type-II, staggered, band alignment of similar to 0.4 eV exists between anatase and rutile with anatase possessing the higher electron affinity, or work function. Our results help to explain the robust separation of photoexcited charge carriers between the two phases and highlight a route to improved photocatalysts.

The formation mechanism of these intriguing nanocomposites investigated by transmission electron microscopy and Raman and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy is proposed as intercalation and adsorption of manganese ions onto the GO sheets, followed by the nucleation and growth of the crystal species in a double solvent system via dissolution-crystallization and oriented attachment mechanisms, which in turn results in the exfoliation of GO sheets. Interestingly, it was found that the electrochemical performance of as-prepared nanocomposites could be enhanced by the chemical interaction between GO and MnO2. This method provides a facile and straightforward approach to deposit MnO2 nanoparticles onto the graphene oxide sheets (single layer of graphite oxide) and may be readily extended to the preparation of other classes of hybrids based on GO sheets for technological applications.

After removing the excess of negative charges from the surface of the nanosheets, highly conducting IT phase MoS2 nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward the evolution of hydrogen with a notably low Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec. By partially oxidizing MoS2, we found that the activity of 2H MoS2 is significantly reduced after oxidation, consistent with edge oxidation. On the other hand, IT MoS2 remains unaffected after oxidation, suggesting that edges of the nanosheets are not the main active sites. The importance of electrical conductivity of the two phases on the hydrogen evolution reaction activity has been further confirmed by using carbon nanotubes to increase the conductivity of 2H MoS2.

J	Chen, XQ; Niu, HY; Li, DZ; Li, YY				Chen, Xing-Qiu; Niu, Haiyang; Li, Dianzhong; Li, Yiyi			Modeling hardness of polycrystalline materials and bulk metallic glasses	INTERMETALLICS												Though extensively studied, hardness, defined as the resistance of a material to deformation, still remains a challenging issue for a formal theoretical description due to its inherent mechanical complexity. The widely applied Teter's empirical correlation between hardness and shear modulus has been considered to be not always valid for a large variety of materials. The main reason is that shear modulus only responses to elastic deformation whereas the hardness links both elastic and permanent plastic properties. We found that the intrinsic correlation between hardness and elasticity of materials correctly predicts Vickers hardness for a wide variety of crystalline materials as well as bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Our results suggest that, if a material is intrinsically brittle (such as BMGs that fail in the elastic regime), its Vickers hardness linearly correlates with the shear modulus (H-v = 0.151G). This correlation also provides a robust theoretical evidence on the famous empirical correlation observed by Teter in 1998. On the other hand, our results demonstrate that the hardness of polycrystalline materials can be correlated with the product of the squared Pugh's modulus ratio and the shear modulus (H-v = 2(k(2)G)(0.585) - 3 where k =G/B is Pugh's modulus ratio). Our work combines those aspects that were previously argued strongly, and, most importantly, is capable to correctly predict the hardness of all hard compounds known included in several pervious models.

Among them, nitrogen doping plays a critical role in regulating the electronic properties of carbon materials. Recently, graphene, as a true two-dimensional carbon material, has shown fascinating applications in bioelectronics and biosensors. In this paper, we report a facile strategy to prepare N-doped graphene by using nitrogen plasma treatment of graphene synthesized via a chemical method. Meanwhile, a possible schematic diagram has been proposed to detail the structure of N-doped graphene. By controlling the exposure time, the N percentage in host graphene can be regulated, ranging from 0.11 to 1.35%. Moreover, the as-prepared N-doped graphene has displayed high electrocatalytic activity for reduction of hydrogen peroxide and fast direct electron transfer kinetics for glucose oxidase. The N-doped graphene has further been used for glucose biosensing with concentrations as low as 0.01 mM in the presence of interferences.

The atomic-thick nanosheets are able to not only enhance the intrinsic properties of their bulk counterparts but also give birth to new promising properties. Herein, we highlight an available pathway to prepare the ultrathin graphitic-phase C3N4 (g-C3N4) nanosheets by a "green" liquid exfoliation route from bulk g-C3N4 in water for the first time. The as-obtained ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet solution is very stable in both the acidic and alkaline environment and shows pH-dependent photohuninenscence (PL). Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets show enhanced intrinsic photoabsorption and photoresponse, which induce their extremely high PL quantum yield up to 19.6%. Thus, benefiting from the inherent blue light PL with high quantum yields and high stability, good biocompatibility, and nontoxicity, the water-soluble ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet is a brand-new but promising candidate for bioimaging application.

J	Marrink, SJ; de Vries, AH; Mark, AE				Marrink, SJ; de Vries, AH; Mark, AE			Coarse grained model for semiquantitative lipid simulations	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												This paper describes the parametrization of a new coarse grained (CG) model for lipid and surfactant systems. Reduction of the number of degrees of freedom together with the use of short range potentials makes it computationally very efficient. Compared to atomistic models a gain of 3-4 orders of magnitude can be achieved. Micrometer length scales or millisecond time scales are therefore within reach. To encourage applications, the model is kept very simple. Only a small number of coarse grained atom types are defined, which interact using a few discrete levels of interaction. Despite the computational speed and the simplistic nature of the model, it proves to be both versatile in its applications and accurate in its predictions. We show that densities of liquid alkanes from decane up to eicosane can be reproduced to within 5%, and the mutual solubilities of alkanes in water and water in alkanes can be reproduced within 0.5 kT of the experimental values. The CG model for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is shown to aggregate spontaneously into a bilayer. Structural properties such as the area per headgroup and the phosphate-phosphate distance match the experimentally measured quantities closely. The same is true for elastic properties such as the bending modulus and the area compressibility, and dynamic properties such as the lipid lateral diffusion coefficient and the water permeation rate. The distribution of the individual lipid components along the bilayer normal is very similar to distributions obtained from atomistic simulations. Phospholipids with different headgroup (ethanolamine) or different tail lengths (lauroyl, stearoyl) or unsaturated tails (oleoyl) can also be modeled with the CG force field. The experimental area per headgroup can be reproduced for most lipids within 0.02 nm(2). Finally, the CG model is applied to nonbilayer phases. Dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) aggregates into small micelles that are structurally very similar to ones modeled atomistically, and DOPE forms an inverted hexagonal phase with structural parameters in agreement with experimental data.

Vertical and in-plane heterostructures from WS<sub>2</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayers	NATURE MATERIALS												Layer-by-layer stacking or lateral interfacing of atomic monolayers has opened up unprecedented opportunities to engineer two-dimensional heteromaterials. Fabrication of such artificial heterostructures with atomically clean and sharp interfaces, however, is challenging. Here, we report a one-step growth strategy for the creation of high-quality vertically stacked as well as in-plane interconnected heterostructures ofWS(2)/MoS2 via control of the growth temperature. Vertically stacked bilayers with WS2 epitaxially grown on top of the MoS2 monolayer are formed with preferred stacking order at high temperature. A strong interlayer excitonic transition is observed due to the type II band alignment and to the clean interface of these bilayers. Vapour growth at low temperature, on the other hand, leads to lateral epitaxy of WS2 on MoS2 edges, creating seamless and atomically sharp in-plane heterostructures that generate strong localized photoluminescence enhancement and intrinsic p-n junctions. The fabrication of heterostructures from monolayers, using simple and scalable growth, paves the way for the creation of unprecedented two-dimensional materials with exciting properties.

Such a charge distribution has direct influence in dictating the energetics of the composite by shifting the Fermi level to more negative potentials. The transfer of electrons to Au nanoparticles has now been probed by exciting TiO2 nanoparticles under steady-state and laser pulse excitation. Equilibration with the C-60/C-60(-) redox couple provides a means to determine the apparent Fermi level of the TiO2-Au composite system. The size-dependent shift in the apparent Fermi level of the TiO2-Au composite (20 mV for 8-nm diameter and 40 mV for 5-nm and 60 mV for 3-nm gold nanoparticles) shows the ability of Au nanoparticles to influence the energetics by improving the photoinduced charge separation.

Atomic sheets containing hybridized bonds involving elements B, N and C over wide compositional ranges could result in new materials with properties complementary to those of graphene and h-BN, enabling a rich variety of electronic structures, properties and applications. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of large-area atomic layers of h-BNC material, consisting of hybridized, randomly distributed domains of h-BN and C phases with compositions ranging from pure BN to pure graphene.

J	Garnett, E; Yang, PD				Garnett, Erik; Yang, Peidong			Light Trapping in Silicon Nanowire Solar Cells	NANO LETTERS												Thin-film structures can reduce the cost of solar power by using inexpensive substrates and a lower quantity and quality of semiconductor material. However, the resulting short optical path length and minority carrier diffusion length necessitates either a high absorption coefficient or excellent light trapping. Semiconducting nanowire arrays have already been shown to have low reflective losses compared to planar semiconductors, but their light-trapping properties have not been measured. Using optical transmission and photocurrent measurements on thin silicon films, we demonstrate that ordered arrays of silicon nanowires increase the path length of incident solar radiation by up to a Factor of 73. This extraordinary light-trapping path length enhancement factor is above the randomized scattering (Lambertian) limit (2n(2)similar to 25 without a back reflector) and is superior to other light-trapping methods. By changing the silicon film thickness and nanowire length, we show that there is a competition between improved absorption and increased surface recombination; for nanowire arrays fabricated from 8 mu m thick silicon films, the enhanced absorption can dominate over surface recombination, even without any surface passivation. These nanowire devices give efficiencies above 5%, with short-circuit photocurrents higher than planar control samples,					Yang, Peidong/E-4431-2011; Garnett, Erik/A-6847-2009	Garnett, Erik/0000-0002-9158-8326													1530-6984	1530-6992				MAR	2010	10	3					1082	1087		10.1021/nl100161z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl100161z								20108969					WOS:000275278200058

Therefore, it is desirable to establish a method that can measure the total antioxidant activity level directly from vegetable extracts. The current literature clearly states that there is no "total antioxidant" as a nutritional index available for food labeling because of the lack of standard quantitation methods. Thus, this work reports the development of a simple, widely applicable antioxidant capacity index for dietary polyphenols and vitamins C and E, utilizing the copper(II)-neocuproine [Cu(II)-Nc] reagent as the chromogenic oxidizing agent. Because the copper(II) (or cupric) ion reducing ability of polyphenols is measured, the method is named by our research group "cupric reducing antioxidant capacity" abbreviated as the CUPRAC method. This method should be advantageous over the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method because the redox chemistry of copper(II)-as opposed to that of ferric ion-involves faster kinetics. The method comprises mixing of the antioxidant solution (directly or after acid hydrolysis) with a copper(II) chloride solution, a neocuproine alcoholic solution, and an ammonium acetate aqueous buffer at pH 7 and subsequent measurement of the developed absorbance at 450 nm after 30 min. Because the color development is fast for compounds such as ascorbic acid, gallic acid, and quercetin but slow for naringin and naringenin, the latter compounds were assayed after incubation at 50degreesC on a water bath for 20 min [after Cu(II)-Nc reagent addition] so as to force the oxidation reaction to reach completion. The flavonoid glycosides were hydrolyzed to their corresponding aglycons by refluxing in 1.2 M HCl-containing 50% MeOH so as to exert maximal reducing power toward Cu(II)-Nc. Certain compounds also needed incubation after acid hydrolysis to fully exhibit their reducing capability. The CUPRAC antioxidant capacities of synthetic mixtures of antioxidants were experimentally measured as Trolox equivalents and compared to those theoretically found by making use of the principle of additivity of absorbances assuming no chemical interaction between the mixture constituents. Because ascorbic acid is not resistant to elevated temperature incubation, it should be assayed initially by measuring the absorbance (at 450 nm) difference of original and ascorbate oxidase-added mixture solutions at the end of 1 min of Cu(II)-Nc reagent addition. Thus, the total CUPRAC antioxidant capacity of a mixture containing various antioxidants should be that finally measured after a suitable combination of hydrolysis and incubation procedures, added to the initially measured capacity due to ascorbate. The antioxidant polyphenolic compounds tested demonstrate that the highest capacities in the CUPRAC method were observed for epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, fisetin, epigallocatechin, catechin, and caffeic acid in this order, in accordance with theoretical expectations, because the number and position of the hydroxyl groups as well as the degree of conjugation of the whole molecule are important. The antioxidant potency of flavonoids is nearly proportional to the total number of -OH groups and is positively affected by the presence of an o-dihydroxy moiety in the B-ring. P-Carotene, which did not react with the CUPRAC reagent in alcoholic aqueous medium, could be assayed in dichloromethane solvent. Linear calibration curves for ascorbic acid and flavonoids were redrawn in synthetic solutions containing a mixture of antioxidants, and also in real matrices such as grape and orange juices, green tea, and blackberry tea, showing an initial nonzero absorbance with the CUPRAC reagent. The parallellism of the linear calibration curves of pure compounds in a given complex matrix effectively demonstrated that there were no interferent chemical interactions among the solution constituents and that the antioxidant capacities of the tested antioxidants were additive. The CUPRAC reagent is reasonably selective, stable, easily accessible, and sensitive toward thiol-type oxidants, unlike the FRAP method. The reaction is carried out at nearly physiological pH as opposed to the unrealistic acidic pH of FRAP.

J	Trygg, J; Wold, S				Trygg, J; Wold, S			Orthogonal projections to latent structures (O-PLS)	JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS												A generic preprocessing method for multivariate data, called orthogonal projections to latent structures (O-PLS), is described. O-PLS removes variation from X (descriptor variables) that is not correlated to Y (property variables, e.g. yield, cost or toxicity). In mathematical terms this is equivalent to removing systematic variation in X that is orthogonal to Y. In an earlier paper, Wold et al. (Chemometrics Intell, Lab. Syst. 1998; 44:175-185) described orthogonal signal correction (OSC). In this paper a method with the same objective but with different means is described. The proposed O-PLS method analyzes the variation explained in each PLS component. The non-correlated systematic variation in X is removed, making interpretation of the resulting PLS model easier and with the additional benefit that the non-correlated variation itself can be analyzed further. As an example, near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra of wood chips were analyzed. Applying O-PLS resulted in reduced model complexity with preserved prediction ability, effective removal of noncorrelated variation in X and, not least, improved interpretational ability of both correlated and noncorrelated variation in the NIR spectra.

J	Matthews, JA; Wnek, GE; Simpson, DG; Bowlin, GL				Matthews, JA; Wnek, GE; Simpson, DG; Bowlin, GL			Electrospinning of collagen nanofibers	BIOMACROMOLECULES												Electrospinning is a fabrication process that uses an electric field to control the deposition of polymer fibers onto a target substrate. This electrostatic processing strategy can be used to fabricate fibrous polymer mats composed of fiber diameters ranging from several microns down to 100 nm or less. In this study, we describe how electrospinning can be adapted to produce tissue-engineering scaffolds composed of collagen nanofibers. Optimizing conditions for calfskin type I collagen produced a matrix composed of 100 nm fibers that exhibited the 67 nm banding pattern that is characteristic of native collagen. The structural properties of electrospun collagen varied with the tissue of origin (type I from skin vs type I from placenta), the isotype (type I vs type 111), and the concentration of the collagen solution used to spin the fibers. Electrospinning is a rapid and efficient process that can be used to selectively deposit polymers in a random fashion or along a predetermined and defined axis. Toward that end, our experiments demonstrate that it is possible to tailor subtle mechanical properties into a matrix by controlling fiber orientation. The inherent properties of the electrospinning process make it possible to fabricate complex, and seamless, three-dimensional shapes. Electrospun collagen promotes cell growth and the penetration of cells into the engineered matrix. The structural, material, and biological properties of electrospun collagen suggest that this material may represent a nearly ideal tissue engineering scaffold.

A theoretical model has been elaborated, to interpret the frequency response of the device. The high-frequency feature is attributed to the charge transfer at the counter electrode while the response in the intermediate-frequency region is associated with the electron transport in the mesoscopic TiO2 film and the back reaction at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The low-frequency region reflects the diffusion in the electrolyte. Using an appropriate equivalent circuit, the electron transport rate and electron lifetime in the mesoscopic film have been derived, which agree with the values derived from transient photocurrent and photovoltage measurements. The EIS measurements show that DSC performance variations under prolonged thermal aging result mainly from the decrease in the lifetime of the conduction band electron in the TiO2 film.

Electric vehicles, which are not equipped with an internal combustion engine, have been launched in the market. Manganese-and iron-based positive-electrode materials(1,2), such as LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4, are used in large-scale batteries for electric vehicles. Manganese and iron are abundant elements in the Earth's crust, but lithium is not. In contrast to lithium, sodium is an attractive charge carrier on the basis of elemental abundance. Recently, some layered materials(3-6), where sodium can be electrochemically and reversibly extracted/inserted, have been reported. However, their reversible capacity is typically limited to 100 mAh g(-1). Herein, we report a new electrode material, P2-Na-2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O-2, that delivers 190 m Ah g(-1) of reversible capacity in the sodium cells with the electrochemically active Fe3+/Fe4+ redox. These results will contribute to the development of rechargeable batteries from the earth-abundant elements operable at room temperature.

The latter were adjusted to multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock data based on the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. The outer-core (n-1)spd shells are explicitly treated together with the nsp valence shell with these PPs. The accompanying cc-pVnZ-PP and aug-cc-pVnZ-PP basis sets range in size from DZ to 5Z quality and yield systematic convergence of both Hartree-Fock and correlated total energies.

For the purposes of comparison, all-electron calculations using the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian have also been carried out for the halogen-containing molecules using basis sets of 5Z quality.

An overview of the Amber biomolecular simulation package	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR SCIENCE												Molecular dynamics (MD) allows the study of biological and chemical systems at the atomistic level on timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds. It complements experiment while also offering a way to follow processes difficult to discern with experimental techniques. Numerous software packages exist for conducting MD simulations of which one of the widest used is termed Amber. Here, we outline the most recent developments, since version 9 was released in April 2006, of the Amber and AmberTools MD software packages, referred to here as simply the Amber package. The latest release represents six years of continued development, since version 9, by multiple research groups and the culmination of over 33 years of work beginning with the first version in 1979. The latest release of the Amber package, version 12 released in April 2012, includes a substantial number of important developments in both the scientific and computer science arenas. We present here a condensed vision of what Amber currently supports and where things are likely to head over the coming years. Figure 1 shows the performance in ns/day of the Amber package version 12 on a single-core AMD FX-8120 8-Core 3.6GHz CPU, the Cray XT5 system, and a single GPU GTX680.

J	Liu, XH; Zhong, L; Huang, S; Mao, SX; Zhu, T; Huang, JY				Liu, Xiao Hua; Zhong, Li; Huang, Shan; Mao, Scott X.; Zhu, Ting; Huang, Jian Yu			Size-Dependent Fracture of Silicon Nanoparticles During Lithiation	ACS NANO												Lithiation of individual silicon nanopartides was studied in real time with in situ transmission electron microscopy. A strong size dependence of fracture was discovered; that Is, there exists a critical particle diameter of similar to 150 nm, below which the particles neither cracked nor fractured upon first lithiation, and above which the particles initially formed surface cracks and then fractured due to lithiation-induced swelling. The unexpected surface cracking arose owing to the buildup of large tensile hoop stress, which reversed the initial compression, in the surface layer. The stress reversal was attributed to the unique mechanism of lithiation in crystalline Si, taking place by movement of a two-phase boundary between the inner core of pristine Si and the outer shell of amorphous Li-Si alloy. While the resulting hoop tension tended to initiate surface cracks, the small-sized nanoparticles nevertheless averted fracture. This is because the stored strain energy from electrochemical reactions was insufficient to drive crack propagation, as dictated by the interplay between the two length scales, that is, particle diameter and crack size, that control the fracture. These results are diametrically opposite to those obtained previously from single-phase modeling, which predicted only compressive hoop stress In the surface layer and thus crack initiation from the center in lithiated Si particles and wires. Our work provides direct evidence of the mechanical robustness of small Si nanoparticles for applications in lithium ion batteries.

On treatment of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and chloroauric acid with Neem leaf extract, the rapid formation of stable silver and gold nanoparticles at high concentrations is observed to occur. The silver and gold nanoparticles are polydisperse, with a large percentage of gold particles exhibiting an interesting flat, platelike morphology. Competitive reduction of Au3+ and Ag+ ions present simultaneously in solution during exposure to Neem leaf extract leads to the synthesis of bimetallic Au core-Ag shell nanoparticles in solution. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the silver nanoparticles are adsorbed onto the gold nanoparticles, forming a core-shell structure. The rates of reduction of the metal ions by Neem leaf extract are much faster than those observed by us in our earlier studies using microorganisms such as fungi, highlighting the possibility that nanoparticle biological synthesis methodologies will achieve rates of synthesis comparable to those of chemical methods.

We consider some examples of published QSPR models, which in spite of their high fitted accuracy for the training sets and apparent mechanistic appeal, fail rigorous validation tests, and, thus, may lack practical utility as reliable screening tools. We present a set of simple guidelines for developing validated and predictive QSPR models. To this end, we discuss several validation strategies including (1) randomization of the modelled property, also called Y-scrambling, (2) multiple leave-many-out cross-validations, and (3) external validation using rational division of a dataset into training and test sets. We also highlight the need to establish the domain of model applicability in the chemical space to flag molecules for which predictions may be unreliable, and discuss some algorithms that can be used for this purpose. We advocate the broad use of these guidelines in the development of predictive QSPR models.

We determined that transferrin-coated Au NP entered the cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. The NPs exocytosed out of the cells in a linear relationship to size. This was different than the relationship between uptake and size. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical equation to predict the relationship of size versus exocytosis for different cell lines.

J	Haes, AJ; Van Duyne, RP				Haes, AJ; Van Duyne, RP			A nanoscale optical blosensor: Sensitivity and selectivity of an approach based on the localized surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy of triangular silver nanoparticles	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Triangular silver nanoparticles (similar to100 nm wide and 50 nm high) have remarkable optical properties. In particular, the peak extinction wavelength, lambda(max) of their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectrum is unexpectedly sensitive to nanoparticle size, shape, and local (similar to10-30 nm) external dielectric environment. This sensitivity of the LSPR lambda(max) to the nanoenvironment has allowed us to develop a new class of nanoscale affinity biosensors. The essential characteristics and operational principles of these LSPR nanobiosensors will be illustrated using the well-studied biotin-streptavidin system. Exposure of biotin-functionalized Ag nanotriangles to 100 nM streptavidin (SA) caused a 27.0 nm red-shift in the LSPR lambda(max). The LSPR lambda(max) shift, DeltaR/DeltaR(max), versus [SA] response curve was measured over the concentration range 10(-15) M < [SA] < 10(-6) M. Comparison of the data with the theoretical normalized response expected for 1:1 binding of a ligand to a multivalent receptor with different sites but invariant affinities yielded approximate values for the saturation response, DeltaR(max) = 26.5 nm, and the surface-confined thermodynamic binding constant K-a,K-surf = 10(11) M-1. At present, the limit of detection (LOD) for the LSPR nanobiosensor is found to be in the low-picomolar to high-femtomolar region. A strategy to amplify the response of the LSPR nanobiosensor using biotinylated Au colloids and thereby further improve the LOD is demonstrated. Several control experiments were performed to define the LSPR nanobiosensor's response to nonspecific binding as well as to demonstrate its response to the specific binding of another protein. These include the following: (1) electrostatic binding of SA to a nonbiotinylated surface, (2) nonspecific interactions of prebiotinylated SA to a biotinylated surface, (3) nonspecific interactions of bovine serum albumin to a biotinylated surface, and (4) specific binding of anti-biotin to a biotinylated surface. The LSPR nanobiosensor provides a pathway to ultrasensitive biodetection experiments with extremely simple, small, light, robust, low-cost instrumentation that will greatly facilitate field-portable environmental or point-of-service medical diagnostic applications.

Grains and grain boundaries in highly crystalline monolayer molybdenum disulphide	NATURE MATERIALS												Recent progress in large-area synthesis of monolayer molybdenum disulphide, a new two-dimensional direct-bandgap semiconductor, is paving the way for applications in atomically thin electronics. Little is known, however, about the microstructure of this material. Here we have refined chemical vapour deposition synthesis to grow highly crystalline islands of monolayer molybdenum disulphide up to 120 mu m in size with optical and electrical properties comparable or superior to exfoliated samples. Using transmission electron microscopy, we correlate lattice orientation, edge morphology and crystallinity with island shape to demonstrate that triangular islands are single crystals. The crystals merge to form faceted tilt and mirror twin boundaries that are stitched together by lines of 8- and 4-membered rings. Density functional theory reveals localized mid-gap states arising from these 8- 4 defects. We find that mirror twin boundaries cause strong photoluminescence quenching whereas tilt boundaries cause strong enhancement. Meanwhile, mirror twin boundaries slightly increase the measured in-plane electrical conductivity, whereas tilt boundaries slightly decrease the conductivity.

We report that flat, uniform thin films of this material can be deposited by a one-step, solvent-induced, fast crystallization method involving spin-coating of a DMF solution of CH3NH3PbI3 followed immediately by exposure to chlorobenzene to induce crystallization. Analysis of the devices and films revealed that the perovskite films consist of large crystalline grains with sizes up to microns. Planar heterojunction solar cells constructed with these solution-processed thin films yielded an average power conversion efficiency of 13.9 +/- 0.7% and a steady state efficiency of 13% under standard AM 1.5 conditions.

Scalable production of large quantities of defect-free few-layer graphene by shear exfoliation in liquids	NATURE MATERIALS												To progress from the laboratory to commercial applications, it will be necessary to develop industrially scalable methods to produce large quantities of defect-free graphene. Here we show that high-shear mixing of graphite in suitable stabilizing liquids results in large-scale exfoliation to give dispersions of graphene nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy show the exfoliated flakes to be unoxidized and free of basal-plane defects. We have developed a simple model that shows exfoliation to occur once the local shear rate exceeds 10(4) s(-1). By fully characterizing the scaling behaviour of the graphene production rate, we show that exfoliation can be achieved in liquid volumes from hundreds of millilitres up to hundreds of litres and beyond. The graphene produced by this method performs well in applications from composites to conductive coatings. This method can be applied to exfoliate BN, MoS2 and a range of other layered crystals.

We utilized a synthesis specifically designed for long and thin wires for improved performance in terms of sheet resistance and optical transmittance. Twenty Omega/sq and similar to 80% specular transmittance, and 8 ohms/sq and 80% diffusive transmittance in the visible range are achieved, which fall in the same range as the best indium tin oxide (ITO) samples on plastic substrates for flexible electronics and solar cells. The Ag NW electrodes show optical transparencies superior to ITO for near-infrared wavelengths (2-fold higher transmission). Owing to light scattering effects, the Ag NW network has the largest difference between diffusive transmittance and specular transmittance when compared with ITO and carbon nanotube electrodes, a property which could greatly enhance solar cell performance. A mechanical study shows that Ag NW electrodes on flexible substrates show excellent robustness when subjected to bending. We also study the electrical conductance of Ag nanowires and their junctions and report a facile electrochemical method for a Au coating to reduce the wire-to-wire junction resistance for better overall film conductance. Simple mechanical pressing was also found to increase the NW film conductance due to the reduction of junction resistance. The overall properties of transparent Ag NW electrodes meet the requirements of transparent electrodes for many applications and could be an immediate ITO replacement for flexible electronics and solar cells.

Because the capacitance and charge-discharge rates of EDLCs scale with surface area and electrical conductivity, respectively, porous carbons such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes and crosslinked or holey graphenes are used exclusively as the active electrode materials in EDLCs4-9. One class of materials whose surface area far exceeds that of activated carbons, potentially allowing them to challenge the dominance of carbon electrodes in EDLCs, is metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)(10). The high porosity of MOFs, however, is conventionally coupled to very poor electrical conductivity, which has thus far prevented the use of these materials as active electrodes in EDLCs. Here, we show that Ni-3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)(2) (Ni-3(HITP)(2)), a MOF with high electrical conductivity(11), can serve as the sole electrode material in an EDLC. This is the first example of a supercapacitor made entirely from neat MOFs as active materials, without conductive additives or other binders. The MOF-based device shows an areal capacitance that exceeds those of most carbon-based materials and capacity retention greater than 90% over 10,000 cycles, in line with commercial devices. Given the established structural and compositional tunability of MOFs, these results herald the advent of a new generation of supercapacitors whose active electrode materials can be tuned rationally, at the molecular level.

The single-layered nano-rGO sheets were similar to 20 nm in average lateral dimension, functionalized noncovalently by amphiphilic PEGylated polymer chains to render stability in biological solutions and exhibited 6-fold higher NIR absorption than nonreduced, covalently PEGylated nano-GO. Attaching a targeting peptide bearing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif to nano-rGO afforded selective cellular uptake in U87MG cancer cells and highly effective photoablation of cells in vitro. In the absence of any NIR irradiation, nano-rGO exhibited little toxicity in vitro at concentrations well above the doses needed for photothermal heating. This work established nano-rGO as a novel photothermal agent due to its small size, high photothermal efficiency, and low cost as compared to other NIR photothermal agents including gold nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes.

In this synthesis, reduction of [Ag(NH3)(2)](+) complex cation by four saccharides was performed. Four saccharides were used: two monosaccharides (glucose and galactose) and two disaccharides (maltose and lactose). The syntheses performed at various ammonia concentrations (0.005-0.20 mol L-1) and pH conditions (11.5-13.0) produced a wide range of particle sizes (25-450 nm) with narrow size distributions, especially at the lowest ammonia concentrations. The average size, size distribution, morphology, and structure of particles were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV/Visible absorption spectrophotometry. The influence of the saccharide structure (monosacharides versus disaccharides) on the size of silver particles is briefly discussed. The reduction of [Ag(NH3)(2)](+) by maltose produced silver particles with a narrow size distribution with an average size of 25 nm, which showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including highly multiresistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles was found to be dependent on the size of silver particles. A very low concentration of silver (as low as 1.69 mu g/mL Ag) gave antibacterial performance.

Here we show that nitrogen- or boron-doped graphene can be used as a promising anode for high-power and high-energy lithium ion batteries under high-rate charge and discharge conditions. The doped graphene shows a high reversible capacity of >1040 mAh g(-1) at a low rate of 50 mA g(-1). More importantly, it can be quickly charged and discharged in a very short time of 1 h to several tens of seconds together with high-rate capability and excellent long-term cyclability. For example, a very high capacity of similar to 199 and 235 mAh g(-1) was obtained for the N-doped graphene and B-doped graphene at 25 A g(-1) (about 30 s to full charge). We believe that the unique two-dimensional structure, disordered surface morphology, heteroatomic defects, better electrode/electrolyte wettability, increased intersheet distance, improved electrical conductivity, and thermal stability of the doped graphene are beneficial to rapid surface Li+ absorption and ultrafast Li+ diffusion and electron transport, and thus make the doped materials superior to those of pristine chemically derived graphene and other carbonaceous materials.

The conventional approach of modifying the electronic structure of a semiconductor photocatalyst for a wider absorption range by anion doping operates at the cost of reduced redox potentials and/or charge-carrier mobility, so that its photoreactivity is usually limited and some important reactions may not occur at all. Here, we report sulfur-doped graphitic C3N4 (C3N4-xSx) with a unique electronic structure that displays an increased valence bandwidth in combination with an elevated conduction band minimum and a slightly reduced absorbance. The C3N4-xSx shows a photoreactivity of H-2 evolution 7.2 and 8.0 times higher than C3N4 under lambda > 300 and 420 nm, respectively. More strikingly, the complete oxidation process of phenol under lambda > 400 nm can occur for sulfur-doped C3N4, which is impossible for C3N4 even under lambda > 300 nm. The homogeneous substitution of sulfur for lattice nitrogen and a concomitant quantum confinement effect are identified as the cause of this unique electronic structure and, consequently, the excellent photoreactivity of C3N4-xSx. The results acquired may shed light on general doping strategies for designing potentially efficient photocatalysts.

Interest in rod-shaped nanoparticles stems from their unique optical properties, which can be approximated by Mie-Gans theory. We begin by outlining briefly the origin of the shape-dependent optical properties of rods. The different synthetic strategies that have been developed to achieve decent yields and sample monodispersity are then described, and the methods used for physical characterization as well as results of inorganic structure studies follow. Some of the most innovative research dealing with surface modification and chemical reactivity of gold nanorods is highlighted, together with new directions such as the synthesis of core-shell particles and the interactions of gold nanorods with biomolecules. Gold nanorods can be excited by ultrafast laser-induced heating; the resulting relaxation processes are important in determining the material properties of the metal particles. In addition, vibrational modes and shape changes are elucidated, and a theoretical analysis of the expected behavior is also presented. The incorporation of the gold nanorods into thin films and gels provides a new avenue for designing and growing materials with anisotropic optical properties. Initial results on the optical properties of such nanocomposites are reviewed. This review is concluded with a section devoted to the future perspectives for gold rods as novel materials.

J	Azizian, S				Azizian, S			Kinetic models of sorption: a theoretical analysis	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												The kinetics of sorption from a solution onto an adsorbent has been explored theoretically. The general analytical solution was obtained for two cases. It has been shown that at high initial concentration of solute (sorbate) the general equation converts to a pseudo-first-order model and at lower initial concentration of solute it converts to a pseudo-second-order model. In other words, the sorption process obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics at high initial concentration of solute, while it obeys pseudo-second-order kinetics model at lower initial concentration of solute. The theoretical results (derived equations) show that the observed rate constants of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models are combinations of adsorption and desorption rate constants and also initial concentration of solute.

Single-crystalline Ni(OH)(2) hexagonal nanoplates directly grown on lightly oxidized, electrically conducting graphene sheets (GS) exhibit a high specific capacitance of similar to 1335 F/g at a charge and discharge current density of 2.8 A/g and similar to 953 F/g at 45.7 A/g with excellent cycling ability. The high specific capacitance and remarkable rate capability are promising for applications in supercapacitors with both high energy and power densities. A simple physical mixture of pre-synthesized Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates and graphene sheets shows lower specific capacitance, highlighting the importance of direct growth of nanomaterials on graphene to impart intimate interactions and efficient charge transport between the active nanomaterials and the conducting graphene network. Single-crystalline Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates directly grown on graphene sheets also significantly outperform small Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles grown on heavily oxidized, electrically insulating graphite oxide (GO), suggesting that the electrochemical performance of these composites is dependent on the quality of graphene substrates and the morphology and crystallinity of the nanomaterials grown on top. These results suggest the importance of rational design and synthesis of graphene-based nanocomposite materials for high-performance energy applications.

We present a highly active photocathode for solar H-2 production, consisting of electrodeposited cuprous oxide, which was protected against photocathodic decomposition in water by nanolayers of Al-doped zinc oxide and titanium oxide and activated for hydrogen evolution with electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles. The roles of the different surface protection components were investigated, and in the best case electrodes showed photocurrents of up to -7.6 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 0V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at mild pH. The electrodes remained active after 1 h of testing, cuprous oxide was found to be stable during the water reduction reaction and the Faradaic efficiency was estimated to be close to 100%.

The band gaps of the series decrease with increasing n values, from 2.24 eV (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)PbI4 (n = 1) to 1.52 eV CH3NH3PbI3 (n = infinity). The compounds exhibit strong light absorption in the visible region, accompanied by strong photoluminescence at room temperature, rendering them promising light absorbers for photovoltaic applications. Moreover, we find that thin films of the semi-2D perovskites display an ultrahigh surface coverage as a result of the unusual film self-assembly that orients the [Pb(n)I3(n+1)]- layers perpendicular to the substrates. We have successfully implemented this 2D perovskite family in solid-state solar cells, and obtained an initial power conversion efficiency of 4.02%, featuring an open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 929 mV and a short-circuit current density (J(sc)) of 9.42 mA/cm(2) from the n = 3 compound. This result is even more encouraging considering that the device retains its performance after long exposure to a high-humidity environment. Overall, the homologous 2D halide perovskites define a promising class of stable and efficient light-absorbing materials for solid-state photovoltaics and other applications.

Oxide-based resistance memory and the related memristor have succeeded in surpassing the specifications for a number of device requirements. However, a material or device structure that satisfies high-density, switching-speed, endurance, retention and most importantly power-consumption criteria has yet to be announced. In this work we demonstrate a TaOx-based asymmetric passive switching device with which we were able to localize resistance switching and satisfy all aforementioned requirements. In particular, the reduction of switching current drastically reduces power consumption and results in extreme cycling endurances of over 10(12). Along with the 10 ns switching times, this allows for possible applications to the working-memory space as well. Furthermore, by combining two such devices each with an intrinsic Schottky barrier we eliminate any need for a discrete transistor or diode in solving issues of stray leakage current paths in high-density crossbar arrays.

An orthophosphate semiconductor with photooxidation properties under visible-light irradiation	NATURE MATERIALS												The search for active semiconductor photocatalysts that directly split water under visible-light irradiation remains one of the most challenging tasks for solar-energy utilization(1-6). Over the past 30 years, the search for such materials has focused mainly on metal-ion substitution as in In(1-x)Ni(x)TaO(4) and (V-; Fe- or Mn-) TiO(2) (refs 7,8), non-metal-ion substitution as in TiO(2-x)N(x) and Sm(2)Ti(2)O(5)S(2) (refs 9,10) or solid-solution fabrication as in (Ga(1-x)Zn(x))(N(1-x)O(x)) and ZnS-CuInS(2)-AgInS(2) (refs 11,12). Here we report a new use of Ag(3)PO(4) semiconductor, which can harness visible light to oxidize water as well as decompose organic contaminants in aqueous solution. This suggests its potential as a photofunctional material for both water splitting and waste-water cleaning. More generally, it suggests the incorporation of p block elements and alkali or alkaline earth ions into a simple oxide of narrow bandgap as a strategy to design new photoelectrodes or photocatalysts.					李, 朝升/J-4034-2016; KAKO, Tetsuya/H-2932-2011; Cao, JUnyu/AAL-8605-2021; Luo, Wenjun/F-2676-2013; Yi, Zhiguo/F-7718-2011; KIKUGAWA, Naoki/H-2806-2011; Withers, Ray/H-8309-2014; YE, Jinhua/H-2755-2011; Liu, Yun/O-6153-2015	Luo, Wenjun/0000-0001-6760-6929; KIKUGAWA, Naoki/0000-0003-3975-4478; Withers, Ray/0000-0001-9017-2233; YE, Jinhua/0000-0002-8105-8903; Liu, Yun/0000-0002-5404-3909													1476-1122					JUL	2010	9	7					559	564		10.1038/NMAT2780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT2780								20526323					WOS:000279014300017

High-temperature (300 degreesC) aging of iron-oleic acid metal complex, which was prepared by the thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl in the presence of oleic acid at 100 degreesC, was found to generate monodisperse iron nanoparticles. The resulting iron nanoparticles were transformed to monodisperse gamma -Fe2O3 nanocrystallites by controlled oxidation by using trimethylamine oxide as a mild oxidant. Particle size can be varied from 4 to 16 nm by controlling the experimental parameters. Transmission electron microscopic images of the particles showed 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional assembly of particles, demonstrating the uniformity of these nanoparticles. Electron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of the nanoparticles showed the highly crystalline nature of the gamma -Fe2O3 structures. Monodisperse gamma -Fe2O3 nanocrystallites with a particle size of 13 mn also can be generated from the direct oxidation of iron pentacarbonyl in the presence of oleic acid with trimethylamine oxide as an oxidant.

The proper control of Co2+/Co3+ ratio in Co3O4 could lead to modifications on its electronic and thus catalytic properties. Herein, we designed an efficient Co3O4-based OER electrocatalyst by a plasma-engraving strategy, which not only produced higher surface area, but also generated oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 surface with more Co2+ formed. The increased surface area ensures the Co3O4 has more sites for OER, and generated oxygen vacancies on Co3O4 surface improve the electronic conductivity and create more active defects for OER. Compared to pristine Co3O4, the engraved Co3O4 exhibits a much higher current density and a lower onset potential. The specific activity of the plasma-engraved Co3O4 nanosheets (0.055mAcm(BET)(-2) at 1.6V) is 10 times higher than that of pristine Co3O4, which is contributed by the surface oxygen vacancies.

While previous proposals consider rutile as a passive electron sink hindering recombination in anatase, this research details the critical and active role of rutile in TiO2 formulations. The inactivity of pure-phase rutile is due in part to rapid rates of recombination. Yet, in mixed-phase TiO2, charges produced on rutile by visible light are stabilized through electron transfer to lower energy anatase lattice trapping sites. These results suggest that within mixed-phase titania (P25) there is a morphology of nanoclusters containing atypically small rutile crystallites interwoven with anatase crystallites. The transition points between these two phases allow for rapid electron transfer from rutile to anatase. Thus, rutile acts as an antenna to extend the photoactivity into visible wavelengths and the structural arrangement of the similarly sized TiO2 crystallites creates catalytic "hot spots" at the rutile-anatase interface.

The potential applications of MOFs can be developed further and extended by encapsulating various functional species (for example, nanoparticles) within the frameworks. However, despite increasing numbers of reports of nanoparticle/MOF composites, simultaneously to control the size, composition, dispersed nature, spatial distribution and confinement of the incorporated nanoparticles within MOF matrices remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a controlled encapsulation strategy that enables surfactant-capped nanostructured objects of various sizes, shapes and compositions to be enshrouded by a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). The incorporated nanoparticles are well dispersed and fully confined within the ZIF-8 crystals. This strategy also allows the controlled incorporation of multiple nanoparticles within each ZIF-8 crystallite. The as-prepared nanoparticle/ZIF-8 composites exhibit active (catalytic, magnetic and optical) properties that derive from the nanoparticles as well as molecular sieving and orientation effects that originate from the framework material.

This review is based on extensive studies of the behavior of Li, lithiated carbons and lithiated transition metal oxide electrodes in a wide variety of non-aqueous electrolyte solutions. These studies included spectroscopic measurements (FTIR, XPS, EDAX), morphological and structural analysis (XRD, SEM, AFM) in conjunction with impedance spectroscopy, EQCM and standard electrochemical techniques. It appears that the performance of both Li, Li-C anodes and LixMOy cathodes depends on their surface chemistry in solutions. We address complicated surface film formation on these electrodes, which either contribute to electrode stabilization or to capacity fading due to an increase in the electrodes' impedance. Several common classical phenomena occurring in these systems are reviewed and discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

Due to the high capacitances and excellent rate performances of graphene/MnO2 and ACN, as well as the synergistic effects of the two electrodes, such asymmetric cell exhibits superior electrochemical performances. An optimized asymmetric supercapacitor can be cycled reversibly in the voltage range of 0-1.8 V, and exhibits maximum energy density of 51.1 Wh kg(-1), which is much higher than that of MnO2//DWNT cell (29.1 Wh kg(-1)). Additionally, graphene/MnO2//ACN asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits excellent cycling durability, with 97% specific capacitance retained even after 1000 cycles. These encouraging results show great potential in developing energy storage devices with high energy and power densities for practical applications.

The force field is based on a comprehensive thermodynamic model that allows incorporation of intramolecular energies into the predicted free energy of binding. It also incorporates a charge-based method for evaluation of desolvation designed to use a typical set of atom types. The method has been calibrated on a set of 188 diverse protein-ligand complexes of known structure and binding energy, and tested on a set of 100 complexes of ligands with retroviral proteases.

Long-term stability remains a major obstacle for application on an industrial scale. Here, it is demonstrated that significant decomposition effects already occur during annealing of a methylammonium lead triiode perovskite at 85 degrees C even in inert atmosphere thus violating international standards. The observed behavior supports the view of currently used perovskite materials as soft matter systems with low formation energies, thus representing a major bottleneck for their application, especially in countries with high average temperatures. This result can trigger a broader search for new perovskite families with improved thermal stability.

High-performance lithium-ion anodes using a hierarchical bottom-up approach	NATURE MATERIALS												Si-based Li-ion battery anodes have recently received great attention, as they offer specific capacity an order of magnitude beyond that of conventional graphite. The applications of this transformative technology require synthesis routes capable of producing safe and easy-to-handle anode particles with low volume changes and stable performance during battery operation. Herein, we report a large-scale hierarchical bottom-up assembly route for the formation of Si on the nanoscale-containing rigid and robust spheres with irregular channels for rapid access of Li ions into the particle bulk. Large Si volume changes on Li insertion and extraction are accommodated by the particle's internal porosity. Reversible capacities over five times higher than that of the state-of-the-art anodes (1,950 mAh g(-1)) and stable performance are attained. The synthesis process is simple, low-cost, safe and broadly applicable, providing new avenues for the rational engineering of electrode materials with enhanced conductivity and power.

The new tags are designed to ensure that identical peptides labeled with different TMTs exactly comigrate in all separations. The tags require novel methods of quantification analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. The new tags and analysis methods allow peptides from different samples to be identified by their relative abundance with greater ease and accuracy than other methods. The new TMTs permit simultaneous determination of both the identity and relative abundances of peptide pairs using a collision induced dissociation (CID)-based analysis method. Relative abundance measurements made in the MS/MS mode using the new tags are accurate and sensitive. Compared to MS-mode measurements, a very high signal-to-noise ratio is achieved with MS/MS based detection. The new tags should be applicable to a wide variety of peptide isolation methods.																			0003-2700					APR 15	2003	75	8					1895	1904		10.1021/ac0262560	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac0262560								12713048					WOS:000182332600016

This approach gives access to perovskite semiconductor NCs with both structural and optical qualities comparable to those of directly synthesized NCs. We also show that anion exchange is a dynamic process that takes place in solution between NCs. Therefore, by mixing solutions containing perovskite NCs emitting in different spectral ranges (due to different halide compositions) their mutual fast exchange dynamics leads to homogenization in their composition, resulting in NCs emitting in a narrow spectral region that is intermediate between those of the parent nanoparticles.

The growth of ZnO nanowires was carried out in a simple chemical vapor transport and condensation (CVM system. Based on our fundamental understanding of the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) nanowire growth mechanism, different levels of growth controls (including positional, orientational, diameter, and density control) have been achieved. Power-dependent emission has been examined and lasing action was observed in these ZnO nanowires when the excitation intensity exceeds a threshold (similar to40 kW cm(-2)). These short-wavelength nanolasers operate at room temperature and the areal density of these nanolasers on substrate readily reaches 1 X 10(10) cm(-2). The observation of lasing, fabricated mirrors indicates these single-crystalline, well-facetted nanoaction in these nanowire arrays without any wires can function as self-contained optical resonance cavities. This argument is further supported by our recent near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) studies on single nanowires.

The Ti3C2 monolayer acts as a magnetic metal, while its derived Ti3C2F2 and Ti3C2(OH)(2) in their stable conformations are semiconductors with small band gaps. Li adsorption forms a strong Coulomb interaction with Ti3C2-based hosts but well preserves its structural integrity. The bare Ti3C2 monolayer exhibits a low barrier for Li diffusion and high Li storage capacity (up to Ti3C2Li2 stoichiometry). The surface functionalization of F and OH blocks Li transport and decreases Li storage capacity, which should be avoided in experiments. The exceptional properties, including good electronic conductivity, fast Li diffusion, low operating voltage, and high theoretical Li storage capacity, make Ti3C2 MXene a promising anode material for Li ion batteries.

Photoaction spectra for both the open-circuit potential and short-circuit current were in good agreement with the absorption spectrum of the gold nanoparticles in the TiO2 film. The gold nanoparticles are photoexcited due to plasmon resonance, and charge separation is accomplished by the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the gold particle to the TiO2 conduction band and the simultaneous transfer of compensative electrons from a donor in the solution to the gold particle. Besides its low-cost and facile preparation, a photovoltaic cell with the optimized electron mediator (Fe2+/3+) exhibits an optimum incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 26%. The Au-TiO2 can photocatalytically oxidize ethanol and methanol at the expense of oxygen reduction under visible light; it is potentially applicable to a new class of photocatalysts and photovoltaic fuel cells.

Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials.

Morphological Control for High Performance, Solution-Processed Planar Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												Organometal trihalide perovskite based solar cells have exhibited the highest efficiencies to-date when incorporated into mesostructured composites. However, thin solid films of a perovskite absorber should be capable of operating at the highest efficiency in a simple planar heterojunction configuration. Here, it is shown that film morphology is a critical issue in planar heterojunction CH3NH3PbI3-xClx solar cells. The morphology is carefully controlled by varying processing conditions, and it is demonstrated that the highest photocurrents are attainable only with the highest perovskite surface coverages. With optimized solution based film formation, power conversion efficiencies of up to 11.4% are achieved, the first report of efficiencies above 10% in fully thin-film solution processed perovskite solar cells with no mesoporous layer.

Electrochemical Considerations for Determining Absolute Frontier Orbital Energy Levels of Conjugated Polymers for Solar Cell Applications	ADVANCED MATERIALS												Narrow bandgap conjugated polymers in combination with fullerene acceptors are under intense investigation in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). The open circuit voltage, and thereby the power conversion efficiency, of the devices is related to the offset of the frontier orbital energy levels of the donor and acceptor components, [1, 2] which are widely determined by cyclic voltammetry. Inconsistencies have appeared in the use of the ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc(+)/Fc) redox couple, as well as the values used for the absolute potentials of standard electrodes, which can complicate the comparison of materials properties and determination of structure/property relationships.					li, wei/A-6679-2013; Bazan, Guillermo/AAJ-5313-2020														0935-9648	1521-4095				MAY 24	2011	23	20			SI		2367	2371		10.1002/adma.201004554	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.201004554								21462372					WOS:000291547600020

J	Curtiss, LA; Redfern, PC; Raghavachari, K				Curtiss, Larry A.; Redfern, Paul C.; Raghavachari, Krishnan			Gaussian-4 theory	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												The Gaussian-4 theory (G4 theory) for the calculation of energies of compounds containing first- (Li-F), second- (Na-Cl), and third-row main group (K, Ca, and Ga-Kr) atoms is presented. This theoretical procedure is the fourth in the Gaussian-n series of quantum chemical methods based on a sequence of single point energy calculations. The G4 theory modifies the Gaussian-3 (G3) theory in five ways. First, an extrapolation procedure is used to obtain the Hartree-Fock limit for inclusion in the total energy calculation. Second, the d-polarization sets are increased to 3d on the first-row atoms and to 4d on the second-row atoms, with reoptimization of the exponents for the latter. Third, the QCISD(T) method is replaced by the CCSD(T) method for the highest level of correlation treatment. Fourth, optimized geometries and zero-point energies are obtained with the B3LYP density functional. Fifth, two new higher level corrections are added to account for deficiencies in the energy calculations. The new method is assessed on the 454 experimental energies in the G3/05 test set [L. A. Curtiss, P. C. Redfern, and K. Raghavachari, J. Chem. Phys. 123, 124107 (2005)], and the average absolute deviation from experiment shows significant improvement from 1.13 kcal/mol (G3 theory) to 0.83 kcal/mol (G4 theory). The largest improvement is found for 79 nonhydrogen systems (2.10 kcal/mol for G3 versus 1.13 kcal/mol for G4). The contributions of the new features to this improvement are analyzed and the performance on different types of energies is discussed.

J	Zheng, W; Wang, SY				Zheng, W; Wang, SY			Antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds in selected herbs	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												The antioxidant capacities (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic contents in extracts of 27 culinary herbs and 12 medicinal herbs were determined. The ORAC values and total phenolic contents for the medicinal herbs ranged from 1.88 to 22.30 mu mol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of fresh weight and 0.23 to 2.85 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of fresh weight, respectively. Origanum x majoricum, O. vulgare ssp. hirtum, and Poliomintha longiflora have higher ORAC and phenolic contents as compared to other culinary herbs. The ORAC values and total phenolic content for the culinary herbs ranged from 2.35 to 92.18 mu mol of TE/g of fresh weight and 0.26 to 17.51 mg of GAE/g of fresh weight, respectively. These also were much higher than values found in the medicinal herbs. The medicinal herbs with the highest ORAC values were Catharanthus roseus, Thymus vulgaris, Hypericum perforatum, and Artemisia annua. A linear relationship existed between ORAC values and total phenolic contents of the medicinal herbs (R = 0.919) and culinary herbs (R = 0.986). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with diode-array detection was used to identify and quantify the phenolic compounds in selected herbs. Among the identified phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid was the predominant phenolic compound in Salvia officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, Origanum x majoricum, and P. longiflora, whereas quercetin-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 2)-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 6)-glucoside and kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 2)-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 6)-glucoside were predominant phenolic compounds in Ginkgo biloba leaves.																			0021-8561	1520-5118				NOV	2001	49	11					5165	5170		10.1021/jf010697n	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010697n								11714298					WOS:000172467200013

Its 3D framework is built up of infinite trans chains of corner-sharing AlO4(OH)(2) octahedra. The chains are interconnected by the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate groups, creating ID rhombic-shaped tunnels. Disordered 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid molecules are trapped inside these tunnels. Their evacuation upon heating, between 275 and 420degreesC. leads to a nanoporous open-framework (MIL-53ht (Al) or Al(OH)[O2C-C6H4-CO2]) with empty pores of diameter 8.5 Angstrom. This solid exhibits a Langmuir surface area of 1590(1) m(2)g(-1) together with a remarkable thermal stability, since it starts to decompose only at 500degreesC. At room temperature, the solid reversibly absorbs water in its tunnels, causing a very large breathing effect and shrinkage of the pores. Analysis of the hydration process by solid-state NMR (H-1, C-13, Al-27) has clearly indicated that the trapped water molecules interact with the carboxylate groups through hydrogen bonds, but do not affect the hydroxyl species bridging the aluminum atoms. ne hydrogen bonds between water and the oxygen atoms of the framework are responsible for the contraction of the rhombic channels. The structures of the three forms have been determined by means of powder X-ray diffraction analysis. Crystal data for MIL-53 as (Al) are as follows: orthorhombic system, Pnma (no. 62), a 17.129(2), b = 6.628(1), c = 12.182(1) A; for MIL-53ht (Al), orthorhombic system, Imma (no. 74), a = 6.608(1), b = 16.675(3), c = 12.813(2) Angstrom; for MIL-53 lt (Al), monoclinic system, Cc (no. 9), a = 19.513(2), b = 7.612(1), c = 6.576(1) Angstrom, beta = 104.24(1)degrees.

Ionic liquids (Is) and deep eutectic solvents, thus, have been paid great attention to replace current harsh organic solvents and have been applied to many chemical processing such as extraction and synthesis. However, current ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents have still limitations to be applied to a real chemical industry due to toxicity against human and environment and high cost of ILs and solid state of most deep eutectic solvents at room temperature. Recently we discovered that many plant abundant primary metabolites changed their state from solid to liquid when they were mixed in proper ratio. This finding made us hypothesize that natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) play a role as alternative media to water in living organisms and tested a wide range of natural products, which resulted in discovery of over 100 NADES from nature. In order to prove deep eutectic feature the interaction between the molecules was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. All the tested NADES show clear hydrogen bonding between components. As next step physical properties of NADES such as water activity, density, viscosity, polarity and thermal properties were measured as well as the effect of water on the physical properties. In the last stage the novel NADES were applied to the solubilization of wide range of biomolecules such as non-water soluble bioactive natural products, gluten, starch, and DNA. In most cases the solubility of the biomolecules evaluated in this study was greatly higher than water. Based on the results the novel NADES may be expected as potential green solvents at room temperature in diverse fields of chemistry. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Besides, GQDs, consisting of a single atomic layer of nano-sized graphite, have the excellent performances of graphene, such as high surface area, large diameter and better surface grafting using pi-pi conjugation and surface groups. Because of the structure of graphene, GQDs have some other special physical properties. Therefore, studies on GQDs in aspects of chemistry, physical, materials, biology and interdisciplinary science have been in full flow in the past decade. In this Feature Article, recent developments in preparation of GQDs are discussed, focusing on the main two approaches (top-down and bottom-down).

J	Song, CS				Song, CS			An overview of new approaches to deep desulfurization for ultra-clean gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel	CATALYSIS TODAY					International Symposium on Ultra-Clean Transportation Fuels held at the National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society	AUG 18-22, 2002	BOSTON, MA	Amer Chem Soc				This review discusses the problems of sulfur reduction in highway and non-road fuels and presents an overview of new approaches and emerging technologies for ultra-deep desulfurization of refinery streams for ultra-clean (ultra-low-sulfur) gasoline, diesel fuels and jet fuels. The issues of gasoline and diesel deep desulfurization are becoming more serious because the crude oils refined in the US are getting higher in sulfur contents and heavier in density, while the regulated sulfur limits are becoming lower and lower. Current gasoline desulfurization problem is dominated by the issues of sulfur removal from FCC naphtha, which contributes about 35% of gasoline pool but over 90% of sulfur in gasoline. Deep reduction of gasoline sulfur (from 330 to 30 ppm) must be made without decreasing octane number or losing gasoline yield. The problem is complicated by the high olefins contents of FCC naphtha which contributes to octane number enhancement but can be saturated under HDS conditions. Deep reduction of diesel sulfur (from 500 to < 15 ppm sulfur) is dictated largely by 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene, which represents the least reactive sulfur compounds that have substitutions on both 4- and 6-positions. The deep HDS problem of diesel streams is exacerbated by the inhibiting effects of co-existing polyaromatics and nitrogen compounds in the feed as well as H2S in the product. The approaches to deep desulfurization include catalysts and process developments for hydrodesulfurization (HDS), and adsorbents or reagents and methods for non-HDS-type processing schemes. The needs for dearomatization of diesel and jet fuels are also discussed along with some approaches. Overall, new and more effective approaches and continuing catalysis and processing research are needed for producing affordable ultra-clean (ultra-low-sulfur and low-aromatics) transportation fuels and non-road fuels, because meeting the new government sulfur regulations in 2006-2010 (15 ppm sulfur in highway diesel fuels by 2006 and non-road diesel fuels by 20 10; 30 ppm sulfur in gasoline by 2006) is only a milestone. Desulfurization research should also take into consideration of the fuel-cell fuel processing needs, which will have a more stringent requirement on desulfurization (e.g., < 1 ppm sulfur) than IC engines. The society at large is stepping on the road to zero sulfur fuel, so researchers should begin with the end in mind and try to develop long-term solutions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Gold and silver nanoparticles in sensing and imaging: Sensitivity of plasmon response to size, shape, and metal composition	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												Plasmonic metal nanoparticles have great potential for chemical and biological sensor applications, due to their sensitive spectral response to the local environment of the nanoparticle surface and ease of monitoring the light signal due to their strong scattering or absorption. In this work, we investigated the dependence of the sensitivity of the surface plasmon resonance (frequency and bandwidth) response to changes in their surrounding environment and the relative contribution of optical scattering to the total extinction, on the size and shape of nanorods and the type of metal, that is, Au vs Ag. Theoretical consideration on the surface plasmon resonance condition revealed that the spectral sensitivity, defined as the relative shift in resonance wavelength with respect to the refractive index change of surrounding materials, has two controlling factors: first the bulk plasma wavelength, a property dependent on the metal type, and second on the aspect ratio of the nanorods which is a geometrical parameter. It is found that the sensitivity is linearly proportional to both these factors. To quantitatively examine the dependence of the spectral sensitivity on the nanorod metal composition and the aspect ratio, the discrete dipole approximation method was used for the calculation of optical spectra of Ag-Au alloy metal nanorods as a function of Ag concentration. It is observed that the sensitivity does not depend on the type of the metal but depends largely on the aspect ratio of nanorods. The direct dependence of the sensitivity on the aspect ratio becomes more prominent as the size of nanorods becomes larger. However, the use of larger nanoparticles may induce an excessive broadening of the resonance spectrum due to an increase in the contribution of multipolar excitations. This restricts the sensing resolution. The insensitivity of the plasmon response to the metal composition is attributable to the fact that the bulk plasma frequency of the metal, which determines the spectral dispersion of the real dielectric function of metals and the surface plasmon resonance condition, has a similar value for the noble metals. On the other hand, nanorods with higher Ag concentration show a great enhancement in magnitude and sharpness of the plasmon resonance band, which gives better sensing resolution despite similar plasmon response. Furthermore, Ag nanorods have an additional advantage as better scatterers compared with Au nanorods of the same size.

The electrochemical and thermal properties of Li[NixCoyMnz]O-2 are strongly dependent on its composition. An increase of the Ni content results in an increase of specific discharge capacity and total residual lithium content but the corresponding capacity retention and safety characteristics gradually decreased. The structural stability is related to the thermal and electrochemical stabilities, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry. Developing an ideal cathode material with both high capacity and safety will be a challenging task that requires precise control of microstructure and physico-chemical properties of the electrode.

Selective growth of Mn3O4 nanoparticles on RGO sheets, in contrast to free particle growth in solution, allowed for the electrically insulating Mn3O4 nanoparticles to be wired up to a current collector through the underlying conducting graphene network. The Mn3O4 nanoparticles formed on RGO show a high specific capacity up to similar to 900 mAh/g, near their theoretical capacity, with good rate capability and cycling stability, owing to the intimate interactions between the graphene substrates and the Mn3O4 nanoparticles grown atop. The Mn3O4/RGO hybrid could be a promising candidate material for a high-capacity, low-cost, and environmentally friendly anode for lithium ion batteries. Our growth-on-graphene approach should offer a new technique for the design and synthesis of battery electrodes based on highly insulating materials.

Lithium resources are confirmed to be unevenly distributed in South America, and the cost of the lithium raw materials has roughly doubled from the first practical application in 1991 to the present and is increasing due to global demand for lithium-ion accumulators. Since the electrochemical equivalent and standard potential of sodium are the most advantageous after lithium, sodium based energy storage is of great interest to realize lithium-free high energy and high voltage batteries. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no successful reports on electrochemical sodium insertion materials for battery applications; the major challenge is the negative electrode and its passivation. In this study, we achieve high capacity and excellent reversibility sodium-insertion performance of hard-carbon and layered NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 electrodes in propylene carbonate electrolyte solutions. The structural change and passivation for hard-carbon are investigated to study the reversible sodium insertion. The 3-volt secondary Na-ion battery possessing environmental and cost friendliness, Na+-shuttlecock hard-carbon/NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cell, demonstrates steady cycling performance as next generation secondary batteries and an alternative to Li-ion batteries.

Exploiting single-ion anisotropy in the design of f-element single-molecule magnets	CHEMICAL SCIENCE												Scientists have long employed lanthanide elements in the design of materials with extraordinary magnetic properties, including the strongest magnets known, SmCo5 and Nd2Fe14B. The properties of these materials are largely a product of fine-tuning the interaction between the lanthanide ion and the crystal lattice. Recently, synthetic chemists have begun to utilize f-elements-both lanthanides and actinides-for the construction of single-molecule magnets, resulting in a rapid expansion of the field. The desirable magnetic characteristics of the f-elements are contingent upon the interaction between the single-ion electron density and the crystal field environment in which it is placed. This interaction leads to the single-ion anisotropies requisite for strong single-molecule magnets. Therefore, it is of vital importance to understand the particular crystal field environments that could lead to maximization of the anisotropy for individual f-elements. Here, we summarize a qualitative method for predicting the ligand architectures that will generate magnetic anisotropy for a variety of f-element ions. It is hoped that this simple model will serve to guide the design of stronger single-molecule magnets incorporating the f-elements.					, Jeff/AAI-3575-2020; Rinehart, Jeffrey/I-8331-2019	Rinehart, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5478-1995; Cador, Olivier/0000-0003-2064-6223													2041-6520	2041-6539					2011	2	11					2078	2085		10.1039/c1sc00513h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1sc00513h													WOS:000295732200001

Standards for photoluminescence quantum yield measurements in solution (IUPAC Technical Report)	PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY												The use of standards for the measurement of photoluminescence quantum yields (QYs) in dilute solutions is reviewed. Only three standards can be considered well established. Another group of six standards has been investigated by several independent researchers. A large group of standards is frequently used in recent literature, but the validity of these is less certain. The needs for future development comprise: (i) confirmation of the validity of the QY values of many commonly used standard materials, preferably in the form of SI traceable standards; (ii) extension of the set of standard materials to the UV and near-IR spectral ranges; and (iii) good standards or robust protocols for the measurements of low QYs.

These active optoelectronic materials produce and harvest light efficiently in the visible spectrum. The same functions are required in the infrared for telecommunications (1,300-1,600 nm), thermal imaging (1,500 nm and beyond), biological imaging (transparent tissue windows at 800 nm and 1,100 nm), thermal photovoltaics (>1,900 nm), and solar cells (800-2,000 nm). Photoconductive polymer devices have yet to demonstrate sensitivity beyond similar to800 nm (refs 2,3). Sensitizing conjugated polymers with infrared-active nanocrystal quantum dots provides a spectrally tunable means of accessing the infrared while maintaining the advantageous properties of polymers. Here we use such a nanocomposite approach in which PbS nanocrystals tuned by the quantum size effect sensitize the conjugated polymer poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy-p-phenylenevinylene)] (MEH-PPV) into the infrared. We achieve, in a solution-processed device and with sensitivity far beyond 800 nm, harvesting of infrared-photogenerated carriers and the demonstration of an infrared photovoltaic effect. We also make use of the wavelength tunability afforded by the nanocrystals to show photocurrent spectra tailored to three different regions of the infrared spectrum.

Using ultrasound, full reproducible food processes can now be completed in seconds or minutes with high reproducibility, reducing the processing cost, simplifying manipulation and work-up, giving higher purity of the final product, eliminating post-treatment of waste water and consuming only a fraction of the time and energy normally needed for conventional processes. Several processes such as freezing, cutting, drying, tempering, bleaching, sterilization, and extraction have been applied efficiently in the food industry. The advantages of using ultrasound for food processing, includes: more effective mixing and micro-mixing, faster energy and mass transfer, reduced thermal and concentration gradients, reduced temperature, selective extraction, reduced equipment size, faster response to process extraction control, faster start-up, increased production, and elimination of process steps. Food processes performed under the action of ultrasound are believed to be affected in part by cavitation phenomena and mass transfer enhancement. This review presents a complete picture of current knowledge on application of ultrasound in food technology including processing, preservation and extraction. It provides the necessary theoretical background and some details about ultrasound the technology, the technique, and safety precautions. We will also discuss some of the factors which make the combination of food processing and ultrasound one of the most promising research areas in the field of modern food engineering.

J	Weigend, F; Köhn, A; Hättig, C				Weigend, F; Köhn, A; Hättig, C			Efficient use of the correlation consistent basis sets in resolution of the identity MP2 calculations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												The convergence of the second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) correlation energy with the cardinal number X is investigated for the correlation consistent basis-set series cc-pVXZ and cc-pV(X+d)Z. For the aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z series the convergence of the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole moment is studied. It is found that, when d-shell electrons cannot be frozen, the cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets converge much slower for third-row elements then they do for first- and second-row elements. Based on the results of these studies criteria are deduced for the accuracy of auxiliary basis sets used in the resolution of the identity (RI) approximation for electron repulsion integrals. Optimized auxiliary basis sets for RI-MP2 calculations fulfilling these criteria are reported for the sets cc-pVXZ, cc-pV(X+d)Z, aug-cc-pVXZ, and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z with X=D, T, and Q. For all basis sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation energy is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the usual basis-set error. For the auxiliary aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the usual basis set error. Therefore extrapolations towards the basis-set limit are possible within the RI approximation for both energies and properties. The reduction in CPU time obtained with the RI approximation increases rapidly with basis set size. For the cc-pVQZ basis an acceleration by a factor of up to 170 is observed.

Here, an artificial tree with a reverse-tree design is demonstrated as a cost-effective, scalable yet highly efficient steam-generation device. The reverse-tree design implies that the wood is placed on the water with the tree-growth direction parallel to the water surface; accordingly, water is transported in a direction perpendicular to what occurs in natural tree. The artificial tree is fabricated by cutting the natural tree along the longitudinal direction followed by surface carbonization (called as C-L-Wood). The nature-made 3D interconnected micro-/nanochannels enable efficient water transpiration, while the layered channels block the heat effectively. A much lower thermal conductivity (0.11 W m(-1) K-1) thus can be achieved, only 1/3 of that of the horizontally cut wood. Meanwhile, the carbonized surface can absorb almost all the incident light. The simultaneous optimizations of water transpiration, thermal management, and light absorption results in a high efficiency of 89% at 10 kW m(-2), among the highest values in literature.

Structurally ordered intermetallic platinum-cobalt core-shell nanoparticles with enhanced activity and stability as oxygen reduction electrocatalysts	NATURE MATERIALS												To enhance and optimize nanocatalyst performance and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel-cell applications, we look beyond Pt-metal disordered alloys and describe a new class of Pt-Co nanocatalysts composed of ordered Pt3Co intermetallic cores with a 2-3 atomic-layer-thick platinum shell. These nanocatalysts exhibited over 200% increase in mass activity and over 300% increase in specific activity when compared with the disordered Pt3Co alloy nanoparticles as well as Pt/C. So far, this mass activity for the oxygen reduction reaction is the highest among the Pt-Co systems reported in the literature under similar testing conditions. Stability tests showed a minimal loss of activity after 5,000 potential cycles and the ordered core-shell structure was maintained virtually intact, as established by atomic-scale elemental mapping. The high activity and stability are attributed to the Pt-rich shell and the stable intermetallic Pt3Co core arrangement. These ordered nanoparticles provide a new direction for catalyst performance optimization for next-generation fuel cells.

J	Frackowiak, E				Frackowiak, Elzbieta			Carbon materials for supercapacitor application	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												The most commonly used electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors are activated carbons, because they are commercially available and cheap, and they can be produced with large specific surface area. However, only the electrochemically available surface area is useful for charging the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL formation is especially efficient in carbon pores of size below 1 nm because of the lack of space charge and a good attraction of ions along the pore walls. The pore size should ideally match the size of the ions. However, for good dynamic charge propagation, some small mesopores are useful. An asymmetric configuration, where the positive and negative electrodes are constructed from different materials, e. g., activated carbon, transition metal oxide or conducting polymer, is of great interest because of an important extension of the operating voltage. In such a case, the energy as well as power is greatly increased. It appears that nanotubes are a perfect conducting additive and/or support for materials with pseudocapacitance properties, e. g. MnO2, conducting polymers. Substitutional heteroatoms in the carbon network (nitrogen, oxygen) are a promising way to enhance the capacitance. Carbons obtained by one-step pyrolysis of organic precursors rich in heteroatoms (nitrogen and/or oxygen) are very interesting, because they are denser than activated carbons. The application of a novel type of electrolyte with a broad voltage window (ionic liquids) is considered, but the stability of this new generation of electrolyte during long term cycling of capacitors is not yet confirmed.

Stewart			New interpretations of XPS spectra of nickel metal and oxides	SURFACE SCIENCE												A current interpretation of XPS spectra of Ni metal assumes that the main 6 eV satellite is due to a two hole c3d(9)4s(2) (c is a core hole) final state effect. We report REELS observation in AES at low voltages of losses (plasmons and inter-band transitions) corresponding to the satellite structures in Ni metal 2p spectra. The satellite near 6 eV is attributed to a predominant surface plasmon loss. A current interpretation of Ni 2p spectra of oxides and other compounds is based oil charge transfer assignments of the main peak at 854.6 eV and the broad satellite centred at around 861 eV to the cd(9)L and the unscreened cd(8) final-state configurations, respectively (L is a ligand hole). Multiplet splittings have been shown to be necessary for assignment of Fe 2p and Cr 2p spectral profiles and chemical states. The assignments of Ni 2p states are re-examined with intra-atomic multiplet envelopes applied to Ni(OH)(2), NiOOH and NiO spectra. It is shown that the free ion inultiplet envelopes for Ni2+ and Ni3+ simulate the main line and satellite structures for Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH. Fitting the NiO Ni 2p spectral profile is not as straightforward as the hydroxide and oxyhydroxide. It may involve contributions from interatomic. non-local electronic coupling and screening effects with multiplet structures significantly different from the free ions as found for MnO. A scheme for fitting these spectra using multiplet envelopes is proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Advances in Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY												Rechargeable Li-S batteries have received ever-increasing attention recently due to their high theoretical specific energy density, which is 3 to 5 times higher than that of Li ion batteries based on intercalation reactions. Li-S batteries may represent a next-generation energy storage system, particularly for large scale applications. The obstacles to realize this high energy density mainly include high internal resistance, self-discharge and rapid capacity fading on cycling.

Unfortunately, uncontrollable dendritic lithium growth inherent in these batteries (upon repeated charge/discharge cycling) has prevented their practical application over the past 40 years. We show a novel mechanism that can fundamentally alter dendrite formation. At low concentrations, selected cations (such as cesium or rubidium ions) exhibit an effective reduction potential below the standard reduction potential of lithium ions. During lithium deposition, these additive cations form a positively charged electrostatic shield around the initial growth tip of the protuberances without reduction and deposition of the additives. This forces further deposition of lithium to adjacent regions of the anode and eliminates dendrite formation in lithium metal batteries. This strategy may also prevent dendrite growth in lithium-ion batteries as well as other metal batteries and transform the surface uniformity of coatings deposited in many general electrodeposition processes.

Use of the minimum population localization method	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												It is shown that localization is necessary to preserve size consistency in nonlinear extrapolations of molecular energies. We demonstrate that the unphysical behavior of Mulliken populations obtained from extended basis set wave functions can lead to incomplete localization of orbitals by the Pipek-Mezey population localization method, and introduce a modification to correct this problem. The new localization procedure, called minimum population localization, is incorporated into the CBS-QB3 and the new CBS-4M model chemistries, and their performance is assessed on the G2/97 test set. The errors found for CBS-QB3 are comparable with those for the G3 and G3(MP2) (mean absolute deviation of 1.10, 0.94, and 1.21 kcal/mol, respectively, on the G2/97 test set). The CBS-4M is less accurate than the other models (mean absolute deviation of 3.26 kcal/mol on the G2/97 test set), but can be applied to much larger systems. The modified localization method resolves several problem cases found with CBS-4 and improves the reliability of CBS-QB3. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. [S0021-9606(00)31015-7].

Prospectively, employing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as versatile nanofillers would notably broaden the scope of functionalities. However, synthesizing MOFs in the form of freestanding nanosheets has proved challenging. We present a bottom-up synthesis strategy for dispersible copper 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate MOF lamellae of micrometre lateral dimensions and nanometre thickness. Incorporating MOF nanosheets into polymer matrices endows the resultant composites with outstanding CO2 separation performance from CO2/CH4 gas mixtures, together with an unusual and highly desired increase in the separation selectivity with pressure. As revealed by tomographic focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, the unique separation behaviour stems from a superior occupation of the membrane cross-section by the MOF nanosheets as compared with isotropic crystals, which improves the efficiency of molecular discrimination and eliminates unselective permeation pathways. This approach opens the door to ultrathin MOF-polymer composites for various applications.

As compared to bare magnetite particles, the hybrids show a high binding capacity for As(III) and As(V), whose presence in the drinking water in wide areas of South Asia has been a huge problem.

The rate of H-2 evolution on CdS is increased by up to 36 times when loaded with only 0.2 wt % of MoS2, and the activity of MoS2/CdS is even higher than those of the CdS photocatalysts loaded with different noble metals, such as Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Au.

Jeffrey			Copper ion liquid-like thermoelectrics	NATURE MATERIALS												Advanced thermoelectric technology offers a potential for converting waste industrial heat into useful electricity, and an emission-free method for solid state cooling(1,2). Worldwide efforts to find materials with thermoelectric figure of merit, zT values significantly above unity, are frequently focused on crystalline semiconductors with low thermal conductivity(2). Here we report on Cu2-xSe, which reaches a zT of 1.5 at 1,000 K, among the highest values for any bulk materials. Whereas the Se atoms in Cu2-xSe form a rigid face-centred cubic lattice, providing a crystalline pathway for semiconducting electrons (or more precisely holes), the copper ions are highly disordered around the Se sublattice and are superionic with liquid-like mobility. This extraordinary 'liquid-like' behaviour of copper ions around a crystalline sublattice of Se in Cu2-xSe results in an intrinsically very low lattice thermal conductivity which enables high zT in this otherwise simple semiconductor. This unusual combination of properties leads to an ideal thermoelectric material. The results indicate a new strategy and direction for high-efficiency thermoelectric materials by exploring systems where there exists a crystalline sublattice for electronic conduction surrounded by liquid-like ions.					xu, fang/B-4789-2012; Zhang, Wenqing/K-1236-2012; LI, Qiang/HLQ-6133-2023; shi, xun/B-4499-2009; Liu, Huili/F-5148-2017; Zhang, Linlin/HGE-7116-2022; Chen, Lidong/F-2705-2010; Snyder, Jeff/E-4453-2011; shi, xun/A-1764-2019; Liu, Huili/B-7230-2012	Snyder, Jeff/0000-0003-1414-8682; shi, xun/0000-0002-8086-6407; Liu, Huili/0000-0001-8959-0315; Chen, Lidong/0000-0002-9683-037X													1476-1122	1476-4660				MAY	2012	11	5					422	425		10.1038/NMAT3273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT3273								22406814					WOS:000303108500019

FactSage was introduced in 2001 and is the fusion of the FACT-Win/F*A*C*T and ChemSage/SOLGASMIX thermochemical packages that were founded over 25 years ago. The FactSage package runs on a PC operating under Microsoft Windows(R) and consists of a series of information, database, calculation and manipulation modules that enable one to access and manipulate pure substances and solution databases. With the various modules one can perform a wide variety of thermochemical calculations and generate tables, graphs and figures of interest to chemical and physical metallurgists, chemical engineers, corrosion engineers, inorganic chemists, geochemists, ceramists, electrochemists, environmentalists, etc. In this article emphasis is placed on the calculation and manipulation of phase diagrams. However the reputation of FactSage has been established mainly in the field of complex chemical equilibria and process simulation where the software has unique capabilities. Some of these capabilities are also shown in this paper.

However, the growth of dendrites greatly hinders the practical applications of LMBs in portable electronics and electric vehicles. Constructing stable and efficient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is among the most effective strategies to inhibit the dendrite growth and thus to achieve a superior cycling performance. In this review, the mechanisms of SEI formation and models of SEI structure are briefly summarized. The analysis methods to probe the surface chemistry, surface morphology, electrochemical property, dynamic characteristics of SEI layer are emphasized. The critical factors affecting the SEI formation, such as electrolyte component, temperature, current density, are comprehensively debated. The efficient methods to modify SEI layer with the introduction of new electrolyte system and additives, ex-situ-formed protective layer, as well as electrode design, are summarized. Although these works afford new insights into SEI research, robust and precise routes for SEI modification with well-designed structure, as well as understanding of the connection between structure and electrochemical performance, is still inadequate. A multidisciplinary approach is highly required to enable the formation of robust SEI for highly efficient energy storage systems.

However, the synthetic approach to obtain high-quality and large-area MoS2 atomic thin layers is still rare. Here we report that the high-temperature annealing of a thermally decomposed ammonium thiomolybdate layer in the presence of sulfur can produce large-area MoS2 thin layers with superior electrical performance on insulating substrates. Spectroscopic and microscopic results reveal that the synthesized MoS2 sheets are highly crystalline. The electron mobility of the bottom-gate transistor devices made of the synthesized MoS2 layer is comparable with those of the micromechanically exfoliated thin sheets from MoS2 crystals. This synthetic approach is simple, scalable, and applicable to other transition metal dichalcogenides. Meanwhile, the obtained MoS2 films are transferable to arbitrary substrates, providing great opportunities to make layered composites by stacking various atomically thin layers.

We report the first observations of ferromagnetism above room temperature for dilute (<4 at.%) Mn-doped ZnO. The Mn is found to carry an average magnetic moment of 0.16 μ(B) per ion. Our ab initio calculations find a valance state of Mn2+ and that the magnetic moments are ordered ferromagnetically, consistent with the experimental findings. We have obtained room-temperature ferromagnetic ordering in bulk pellets, in transparent films 2-3 μm thick, and in the powder form of the same material. The unique feature of our sample preparation was the low-temperature processing. When standard high-temperature (T>700degreesC) methods were used, samples were found to exhibit clustering and were not ferromagnetic at room temperature. This capability to fabricate ferromagnetic Mn-doped ZnO semiconductors promises new spintronic devices as well as magneto-optic components.

J	Peterson, KA; Dunning, TH				Peterson, KA; Dunning, TH			Accurate correlation consistent basis sets for molecular core-valence correlation effects: The second row atoms Al-Ar, and the first row atoms B-Ne revisited	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Correlation consistent basis sets for accurately describing core-core and core-valence correlation effects in atoms and molecules have been developed for the second row atoms Al-Ar. Two different optimization strategies were investigated, which led to two families of core-valence basis sets when the optimized functions were added to the standard correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ). In the first case, the exponents of the augmenting primitive Gaussian functions were optimized with respect to the difference between all-electron and valence-electron correlated calculations, i.e., for the core-core plus core-valence correlation energy. This yielded the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets, which are analogous to the sets developed previously for the first row atoms [D. E. Woon and T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 103, 4572 (1995)]. Although the cc-pCVnZ sets exhibit systematic convergence to the all-electron correlation energy at the complete basis set limit, the intershell (core-valence) correlation energy converges more slowly than the intrashell (core-core) correlation energy. Since the effect of including the core electrons on the calculation of molecular properties tends to be dominated by core-valence correlation effects, a second scheme for determining the augmenting functions was investigated. In this approach, the exponents of the functions to be added to the cc-pVnZ sets were optimized with respect to just the core-valence (intershell) correlation energy, except that a small amount of core-core correlation energy was included in order to ensure systematic convergence to the complete basis set limit. These new sets, denoted weighted core-valence basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ), significantly improve the convergence of many molecular properties with n. Optimum cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row atoms were also developed and show similar advantages. Both the cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules (Al-2, Si-2, P-2, S-2, and Cl-2), as well as on selected diatomic molecules involving first row atoms (CO, SiO, PN, and BCl). For the calculation of core correlation effects on energetic and spectroscopic properties, the cc-pwCVnZ basis sets are recommended over the cc-pCVnZ ones. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.

J	Cohen-Tanugi, D; Grossman, JC				Cohen-Tanugi, David; Grossman, Jeffrey C.			Water Desalination across Nanoporous Graphene	NANO LETTERS												We show that nanometer-scale pores in single-layer freestanding graphene can effectively filter NaCl salt from water. Using classical molecular dynamics, we report the desalination performance of such membranes as a function of pore size, chemical functionalization, and applied pressure. Our results indicate that the membrane's ability to prevent the salt passage depends critically on pore diameter with adequately sized pores allowing for water flow while blocking ions. Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water flux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water flux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions. Overall, our results indicate that the water permeability of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reverse osmosis membranes, and that nanoporous graphene may have a valuable role to play for water purification.

The most expensive section of an FT complex is the production of purified syngas and so its composition should match the overall usage ratio of the FT reactions, which in turn depends on the product selectivity. The kinetics, reactor requirements, control of selectivity and the life of cobalt and iron catalysts are discussed and compared. Control of the FT conditions coupled with appropriate downstream processes results in high yields of gasoline, excellent quality diesel fuel or high value linear alpha-olefins. The history of the various FT options and of the improvements in FT reactor technologies over the last 50 years is reviewed. It appears that "new" technologies are re-discovered in cycles of 15-30 years and it often takes the same time for the implementation of new concepts. (C) 2002 EIsevier Science B.V.

These fullerene derivatives, methanofullerene [6,6]-plienyl C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a new azafulleroid, and a ketolactam quasifullerene, show a variation of almost 200 mV in their first reduction potential. The open circuit voltage of the corresponding devices was found to correlate directly with the acceptor strength of the fullerenes, whereas it was rather insensitive to variations of the work function of the negative electrode.

The resulting, graphene/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible spectrophotometry, nitrogen adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The transient photocurrent response was measured for several on-off cycles of intermittent irradiation. The effect of graphene content on the rate of visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production was studied for a series of graphene-graphitic carbon nitride composite samples containing Pt as a cocatalyst in methanol aqueous solutions. This study shows that graphene sheets act as electronic conductive channels to efficiently separate the photogenerated charge carriers and, consequently, to enhance the visible-light photocatalytic H-2-production activity of g-C3N4. The optimal graphene content was determined to be similar to 1.0 wt %, and the corresponding H-2-production rate was 451 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which exceeded that of pure g-C3N4 by more than 3.07 times. The proposed mechanism for the enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 modified by a 5 mall amount of graphene was further confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy and transient photocurrent response. The metal-free graphene/g-C3N4 composites showed high visible-light photocatalytic activity, which makes them promising nanomaterials for further applications in water treatment and dye-sensitized solar cells.

However, the structure of their active sites has remained elusive, delaying further advance. Here, we synthesized Fe-N-C materials quasi-free of crystallographic iron structures after argon or ammonia pyrolysis. These materials exhibit nearly identical Mossbauer spectra and identical X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra, revealing the same Fe-centred moieties. However, the much higher activity and basicity of NH3-pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials demonstrates that the turnover frequency of Fe-centred moieties depends on the physico-chemical properties of the support. Following a thorough XANES analysis, the detailed structures of two FeN4 porphyrinic architectures with different O-2 adsorption modes were then identified. These porphyrinic moieties are not easily integrated in graphene sheets, in contrast with Fe-centred moieties assumed hitherto for pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials. These new insights open the path to bottom-up synthesis approaches and studies on site-support interactions.					jaouen, frederic/D-7912-2019; Mineva, Tzonka/AGR-9642-2022; Zitolo, Andrea/J-2190-2019; Fonda, Emiliano/D-9666-2011; Stievano, Lorenzo/B-7801-2010; Sougrati, Moulay Tahar/B-6283-2011	jaouen, frederic/0000-0001-9836-3261; Stievano, Lorenzo/0000-0001-8548-0231; Fonda, Emiliano/0000-0001-6584-4587; Mineva, Tzonka/0000-0002-9156-2396; Zitolo, Andrea/0000-0002-2187-6699; Sougrati, Moulay Tahar/0000-0003-3740-2807													1476-1122	1476-4660				SEP	2015	14	9					937	+		10.1038/NMAT4367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT4367								26259106					WOS:000360192000029

Reversible photo-induced trap formation in mixed-halide hybrid perovskites for photovoltaics	CHEMICAL SCIENCE												We report on reversible, light-induced transformations in (CH3NH3) Pb(BrxI1-x) 3. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these perovskites develop a new, red-shifted peak at 1.68 eV that grows in intensity under constant, 1-sun illumination in less than a minute. This is accompanied by an increase in sub-bandgap absorption at similar to 1.7 eV, indicating the formation of luminescent trap states. Light soaking causes a splitting of X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks, suggesting segregation into two crystalline phases. Surprisingly, these photo-induced changes are fully reversible; the XRD patterns and the PL and absorption spectra revert to their initial states after the materials are left for a few minutes in the dark. We speculate that photoexcitation may cause halide segregation into iodide-rich minority and bromide-enriched majority domains, the former acting as a recombination center trap. This instability may limit achievable voltages from some mixed-halide perovskite solar cells and could have implications for the photostability of halide perovskites used in optoelectronics.

Principal results are presented in the form of statistical summaries of deviations from experiment for the G3/99 test set (223 enthalpies of formation, 86 ionization potentials, 58 electron affinities, 8 proton affinities) and three additional test sets involving 96 bond lengths, 82 harmonic vibrational frequencies, and 10 hydrogen-bonded complexes, all computed using the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis. The TPSS functional matches, or exceeds in accuracy all prior nonempirical constructions and, unlike semiempirical functionals, consistently provides a high-quality description of diverse systems and properties. The computational cost of self-consistent MGGA is comparable to that of ordinary GGA, and exact exchange (unavailable in some codes) is not required. A one-parameter global hybrid version of the TPSS functional is introduced and shown to give further improvement for most properties. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.

Using high precision simulations, and careful application of standard analytical corrections, we show that the new TIP4P-Ew potential has a density maximum at similar to1 degreesC, and reproduces experimental bulk-densities and the enthalpy of vaporization, DeltaH(vap), from -37.5 to 127 degreesC at 1 atm with an absolute average error of less than 1%. Structural properties are in very good agreement with x-ray scattering intensities at temperatures between 0 and 77 degreesC and dynamical properties such as self-diffusion coefficient are in excellent agreement with experiment. The parameterization approach used can be easily generalized to rehabilitate any water force field using available experimental data over a range of thermodynamic points.

In 2-3% hydrogen peroxide solution, these rods move predominantly along their axis in the direction of the Pt end at speeds of up to 10 body lengths per second. The dimensions of the rods and their speeds are similar to those of multiflagellar bacteria. The force along the rod axis, which is on the order of 10(-14) N, is generated by the oxygen concentration gradient, which in turn produces an interfacial tension force that balances the drag force at steady state. By solving the convection-diffusion equation in the frame of the moving rod, it was found that the interfacial tension force scales approximately as SR(2)gamma/muDL, where S is the area-normalized oxygen evolution rate, gamma is the liquid-vapor interfacial tension, R is the rod radius, mu is the viscosity, D is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen, and L is the length of the rod. Experiments in ethanol-water solutions confirmed that the velocity depends linearly with the product Sgamma, and scaling experiments showed a strong dependence of the velocity on R and L. The direction of motion implies that the gold surface is hydrophobic under the conditions of the experiment. Tapping-mode AFM images of rods in air-saturated water show soft features that are not apparent in images acquired in air. These features are postulated to be nanobubbles, which if present in hydrogen peroxide solutions, would account for the observed direction of motion.

J	Salahuddin, S; Dattat, S				Salahuddin, Sayeef; Dattat, Supriyo			Use of negative capacitance to provide voltage amplification for low power nanoscale devices	NANO LETTERS												It is well-known that conventional field effect transistors (FETs) require a change in the channel potential of at least 60 mV at 300 K to effect a change in the current by a factor of 10, and this minimum subthreshold slope S puts a fundamental lower limit on the operating voltage and hence the power dissipation in standard FET-based switches. Here, we suggest that by replacing the standard insulator with a ferroelectric insulator of the right thickness it should be possible to implement a step-up voltage transformer that will amplify the gate voltage thus leading to values of S lower than 60 mV/decade and enabling low voltage/low power operation. The voltage transformer action can be understood intuitively as the result of an effective negative capacitance provided by the ferroelectric capacitor that arises from an internal positive feedback that in principle could be obtained from other microscopic mechanisms as well. Unlike other proposals to reduce S, this involves no change in the basic physics of the FET and thus does not affect its current drive or impose other restrictions.																			1530-6984	1530-6992				FEB	2008	8	2					405	410		10.1021/nl071804g	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl071804g								18052402					WOS:000253166200006

Joshua			Memristors with diffusive dynamics as synaptic emulators for neuromorphic computing	NATURE MATERIALS												The accumulation and extrusion of Ca2+ in the pre- and postsynaptic compartments play a critical role in initiating plastic changes in biological synapses. To emulate this fundamental process in electronic devices, we developed diffusive Ag-in-oxide memristors with a temporal response during and after stimulation similar to that of the synaptic Ca2+ dynamics. In situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle dynamics simulations both demonstrate that Ag atoms disperse under electrical bias and regroup spontaneously under zero bias because of interfacial energy minimization, closely resembling synaptic influx and extrusion of Ca2+, respectively. The diffusive memristor and its dynamics enable a direct emulation of both short- and long-term plasticity of biological synapses, representing an advance in hardware implementation of neuromorphic functionalities.

Negligible Particle-Specific Antibacterial Activity of Silver Nanoparticles	NANO LETTERS												For nearly a decade, researchers have debated the mechanisms by which AgNPs exert toxicity to bacteria and other organisms. The most elusive question has been whether the AgNPs exert direct "particle-specific" effects beyond the known antimicrobial activity of released silver ions (Ag+). Here, we infer that Ag+ is the definitive molecular toxicant. We rule out direct particle-specific biological effects by showing the lack of toxicity of AgNPs when synthesized and tested under strictly anaerobic conditions that preclude Ag(0) oxidation and Ag+ release. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the toxicity of various AgNPs (PEG- or PVP- coated, of three different sizes each) accurately follows the dose response pattern of E. coli exposed to Ag+ (added as AgNO3). Surprisingly, E. coli survival was stimulated by relatively low (sublethal) concentration of all tested AgNPs and AgNO3 (at 3-8 mu g/L Ag+, or 12-31% of the minimum lethal concentration (MLC)), suggesting a hormetic response that would be counterproductive to antimicrobial applications. Overall, this work suggests that AgNP morphological properties known to affect antimicrobial activity are indirect effectors that primarily influence Ag+ release. Accordingly, antibacterial activity could be controlled (and environmental impacts could be mitigated) by modulating Ag+ release, possibly through manipulation of oxygen availability, particle size, shape, and/or type of coating.

Upon visible light excitation, CdSe QDs inject electrons into TiO2 nanocrystallites. Femtosecond transient absorption as well as emission quenching experiments confirm the injection from the excited state of CdSe QDs into TiO2 nanoparticles. Electron transfer from the thermally relaxed s-state occurs over a wide range of rate constant values between 7.3 x 10(9) and 1.95 x 10(11) s(-1). The injected charge carriers in a CdSe-modified TiO2 film can be collected at a conducting electrode to generate a photocurrent. The TiO2-CdSe composite, when employed as a photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell, exhibits a photon-to-charge carrier generation efficiency of 12%. Significant loss of electrons occurs due to scattering as well as charge recombination at TiO2/CdSe interfaces and internal TiO2 grain boundaries.

J	Kannan, N; Sundaram, MM				Kannan, N; Sundaram, MM			Kinetics and mechanism of removal of methylene blue by adsorption on various carbons - a comparative study	DYES AND PIGMENTS												The kinetics and mechanism of methylene blue adsorption on commercial activated carbon (CAC) and indigenously prepared activated carbons from bamboo dust, coconut shell, groundnut shell, rice husk, and straw, have been studied. The effects of various experimental parameters have been investigated using a batch adsorption technique to obtain information on treating effluents from the dye industry. The extent of dye removal increased with decrease in the initial concentration of the dye and particle size of the adsorbent and also increased with increase in contact time, amount of adsorbent used and the initial pH of the solution. Adsorption data were modeled using the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms and first order kinetic equations. The kinetics of adsorption were found to be first order with regard to intra-particle diffusion rate. The adsorption capacities of indigenous activated carbons have been compared with that of the commercial activated carbon. The results indicate that such carbons could be employed as low cost alternatives to commercial activated carbon in wastewater treatment for the removal of colour and dyes.

One limitation of electrochemical capacitors is their low energy density and for this reason, there is widespread interest in pseudocapacitive materials that use Faradaic reactions to store charge. One candidate pseudocapacitive material is orthorhombic MoO3 (alpha-MoO3), a layered compound with a high theoretical capacity for lithium (279 mA h g(-1) or 1,005 C g(-1)). Here, we report on the properties of reduced alpha-MoO3-x(R-MoO3-x) and compare it with fully oxidized alpha-MoO3 (F-MoO3). The introduction of oxygen vacancies leads to a larger interlayer spacing that promotes faster charge storage kinetics and enables the alpha-MoO3 structure to be retained during the insertion and removal of Li ions. The higher specific capacity of the R-MoO3-x is attributed to the reversible formation of a significant amount of Mo4+ following lithiation. This study underscores the potential importance of incorporating oxygen vacancies into transition metal oxides as a strategy for increasing the charge storage kinetics of redox-active materials.

Commercial pomegranate juices showed an antioxidant activity (18-20 TEAC) three times higher than those of red wine and green tea (6-8 TEAC). The activity was higher in commercial juices extracted from whole pomegranates than in experimental juices obtained from the arils only (12-14 TEAC). HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analyses of the juices revealed that commercial juices contained the pomegranate tannin punicalagin (1500-1900 mg/L) while only traces of this compound were detected in the experimental juice obtained from arils in the laboratory. This shows that pomegranate industrial processing extracts some of the hydrolyzable tannins present in the fruit rind. This could account for the higher antioxidant activity of commercial juices compared to the experimental ones. In addition, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable tannins were detected and quantified in the pomegranate juices.

Due to electrostatically induced hydration, surfaces coated with zwitterionic groups are highly resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and biofilm formation. Among zwitterionic materials, pCB is unique due to its abundant functional groups for the convenient immobilization of biomolecules. pCB can also be prepared in a hydrolyzable form as cationic pCB esters, which can kill bacteria or condense DNA. The hydrolysis of cationic pCB esters into nonfouling zwitterionic groups will lead to the release of killed microbes or the irreversible unpackaging of DNA. Furthermore, mixed-charge materials have been shown to be equivalent to zwitterionic materials in resisting nonspecific protein adsorption when they are uniformly mixed at the molecular scale.

J	Rowsell, JLC; Yaghi, OM				Rowsell, JLC; Yaghi, OM			Effects of functionalization, catenation, and variation of the metal oxide and organic linking units on the low-pressure hydrogen adsorption properties of metal-organic frameworks	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												The dihydrogen adsorption isotherms of eight metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), measured at 77 K up to a pressure of 1 atm, have been examined for correlations with their structural features. All materials display approximately Type I isotherms with no hysteresis, and saturation was not reached for any of the materials under these conditions. Among the six isoreticular MOFs (IRMOFs) studied, the catenated materials exhibit the largest capacities on a molar basis, up to 9.8 H-2 per formula unit. The addition of functional groups (-Br, -NH2, -C2H4-) to the phenylene links of IRMOF-1 (MOF-5), or their replacement with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene moieties in IRMOF-20, altered the adsorption behavior by a minor amount despite large variations in the pore volumes of the resulting materials. In contrast, replacement of the metal oxide units with those containing coordinatively unsaturated metal sites resulted in greater H2 uptake. The enhanced affinities of these materials, MOF-74 and HKUST-1, were further demonstrated by calculation of the isosteric heats of adsorption, which were larger across much of the range of coverage examined, compared to those of representative IRMOFs. The results suggest that under low-loading conditions, the H2 adsorption behavior of MOFs can be improved by imparting larger charge gradients on the metal oxide units and adjusting the link metrics to constrict the pore dimensions; however, a large pore volume is still a prerequisite feature.

Extraordinary Sunlight Absorption and One Nanometer Thick Photovoltaics Using Two-Dimensional Monolayer Materials	NANO LETTERS												Graphene and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising materials for next-generation ultrathin optoelectronic devices. Although visually transparent, graphene is an excellent sunlight absorber, achieving 2.3% visible light absorbance in just 3.3 angstrom thickness. TMD monolayers also hold potential as sunlight absorbers, and may enable ultrathin photovoltaic (PV) devices due to their semi-conducting character. In this work, we show that the three TMD monolayers MoS2, MoSe2, and WS2 can absorb up to 5-10% incident sunlight in a thickness of less than 1 nm, thus achieving 1 order of magnitude higher sunlight absorption than GaAs and Si. We further study PV devices based on just two stacked monolayers: (1) a Schottky barrier solar cell between MoS2 and graphene and (2) an excitonic solar cell based on a MoS2/WS2 bilayer. We demonstrate that such 1 nm thick active layers can attain power conversion efficiencies of up to similar to 1%, corresponding to approximately 1-3 orders of magnitude higher power densities than the best existing ultrathin solar cells. Our work shows that two-dimensional monolayer materials hold yet untapped potential for solar energy absorption and conversion at the nanoscale.

The GNS/Fe3O4 composite shows a reversible specific capacity approaching 1026 mA h(-1) g(-1) after 30 cycles at 35 mA g(-1) 580 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 700 mA g(-1) as well as improved cyclic stability and excellent rate capability. The multifunctional features of the GNS/Fe3O4 composite are considered as follows: (i) GNSs play a "flexible confinement" function to enwrap Fe3O4 particles, which can compensate for the volume change of Fe3O4 and prevent the detachment and agglomeration of pulverized Fe3O4, thus extending the cycling life of the electrode; (ii) GNSs provide a large contact surface for individual dispersion of well-adhered Fe3O4 particles and act as an excellent conductive agent to provide a highway for electron transport, improving the accessible capacity; (iii) Fe3O4 particles separate GNSs and prevent their restacking thus improving the adsorption and immersion of electrolyte on the surface of electroactive material; and (iv) the porosity formed by lateral GNSs and Fe3O4 particles facilitates ion transportation. As a result, this unique laterally confined GNS/Fe3O4 composite can dramatically improve the cycling stability and the rate capability of Fe3O4 as an anode material for lithium ion batteries.

Doped metal oxides are commonly used, but their optical transparency is limited for films with a low sheet resistance. Furthermore, they are prone to cracking when deposited on flexible substrates, are costly, and require a high-temperature step for the best performance. We demonstrate solution-processed transparent electrodes consisting of random meshes of metal nanowires that exhibit an optical transparency equivalent to or better than that of metal-oxide thin films for the same sheet resistance. Organic solar cells deposited on these electrodes show a performance equivalent to that of devices based on a conventional metal-oxide transparent electrode.

J	Hao, E; Schatz, GC				Hao, E; Schatz, GC			Electromagnetic fields around silver nanoparticles and dimers	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												We use the discrete dipole approximation to investigate the electromagnetic fields induced by optical excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances of silver nanoparticles, including monomers and dimers, with emphasis on what size, shape, and arrangement leads to the largest local electric field (E-field) enhancement near the particle surfaces. The results are used to determine what conditions are most favorable for producing enhancements large enough to observe single molecule surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Most of the calculations refer to triangular prisms, which exhibit distinct dipole and quadrupole resonances that can easily be controlled by varying particle size. In addition, for the dimer calculations we study the influence of dimer separation and orientation, especially for dimers that are separated by a few nanometers. We find that the largest \E\(2) values for dimers are about a factor of 10 larger than those for all the monomers examined. For all particles and particle orientations, the plasmon resonances which lead to the largest E-fields are those with the longest wavelength dipolar excitation. The spacing of the particles in the dimer plays a crucial role, and we find that the spacing needed to achieve a given \E\(2) is proportional to nanoparticle size for particles below 100 nm in size. Particle shape and curvature are of lesser importance, with a head to tail configuration of two triangles giving enhanced fields comparable to head to head, or rounded head to tail. The largest \E\(2) values we have calculated for spacings of 2 nm or more is similar to10(5). (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.

Herein, we made a highly reactive and stable isolated single-atom Fe/N-doped porous carbon (ISA Fe/CN) catalyst with Fe loading up to 2.16 wt%. The catalyst showed excellent ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.900 V, which outperformed commercial Pt/C and most non-precious-metal catalysts reported to date. Besides exceptionally high kinetic current density (J(k)) of 37.83 mVcm(-2) at 0.85 V, it also had a good methanol tolerance and outstanding stability. Experiments demonstrated that maintaining the Fe as isolated atoms and incorporating nitrogen was essential to deliver the high performance. First principle calculations further attributed the high reactivity to the high efficiency of the single Fe atoms in transporting electrons to the adsorbed OH species.					li, zhi/AHD-1517-2022; Wang, Dingsheng/F-4648-2011; Wang, Yang-Gang/AFV-5757-2022; Chen, Wenxing/AAE-9886-2020; Dong, Juncai/AEP-5445-2022; Zheng, Lirong/JDN-3637-2023; Zhuang, Zhongbin/H-8164-2016; Chen, Yuanjun/KGL-3895-2024; /D-6480-2015	Wang, Dingsheng/0000-0003-0074-7633; Dong, Juncai/0000-0001-8860-093X; Zheng, Lirong/0000-0003-0888-6769; Chen, Yuanjun/0000-0002-1560-3854; Chen, Wenxing/0000-0001-9669-4358; Li, Zhi/0000-0001-9071-4215; /0000-0002-0582-0855													1433-7851	1521-3773				JUN 6	2017	56	24					6937	6941		10.1002/anie.201702473	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201702473								28402604					WOS:000402523900044

The composite was prepared by conventional ceramic processing. The real part of the permittivity increases with increasing temperature, which is attributed to the shortened relaxation time of electron polarization, and the imaginary part also increases which is ascribed to the increasing electrical conductivity of the carbon fibers. The effect of frequency is found in reflection coefficient and absorption coefficient, and the corresponding mechanisms for the effect are proposed. Results indicate that the composite has good electromagnetic interference shielding property. By calculating the microwave-absorption as a single-layer absorber, we find that the reflection loss varies with the changes of thickness and temperature, due to the deviation of impedance matching condition.

Using a simple and inexpensive technique, we recorded surface plasmon resonance (SPR) scattering images and SPR absorption spectra from both colloidal gold nanoparticles and from gold nanoparticles conjugated to monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies after incubation in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCaT) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). Colloidal gold nanoparticles are found in dispersed and aggregated forms within the cell cytoplasm and provide anatomic labeling information, but their uptake is nonspecific for malignant cells. The anti-EGFR antibody conjugated nanoparticles specifically and homogeneously bind to the surface of the cancer type cells with 600% greater affinity than to the noncancerous cells. This specific and homogeneous binding is found to give a relatively sharper SPR absorption band with a red shifted maximum compared to that observed when added to the noncancerous cells. These results suggest that SPR scattering imaging or SPR absorption spectroscopy generated from antibody conjugated gold nanoparticles can be useful in molecular biosensor techniques for the diagnosis and investigation of oral epithelial living cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.

The resulting material, possessing a high surface area of 251 m(2) g(-1) and a large carbon content of 52.1 wt %, can be directly used as the working electrode for oxygen evolution reaction without employing extra substrates or binders. This novel oxygen evolution electrode can smoothly operate in alkaline solutions (e.g., 0.1 and 1.0 M KOH), affording a low onset potential of 1.47 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and a stable current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.52 V in 0.1 M KOH solution for at least 30 h, associated with a high Faradaic efficiency of 99.3%. The achieved ultrahigh oxygen evolution activity and strong durability, with superior performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art noble-metal/transition-metal and nonmetal catalysts, originate from the unique nanowire array electrode configuration and in situ carbon incorporation, which lead to the large active surface area, enhanced mass/charge transport capability, easy release of oxygen gas bubbles, and strong structural stability. Furthermore, the hybrid Co3O4-carbon porous nanowire arrays can also efficiently catalyze oxygen reduction reaction, featuring a desirable four electron pathway for reversible oxygen evolution and reduction, which is potentially useful for rechargeable metal-air batteries, regenerative fuel cells, and other important clean energy devices.

By calculating vertical excitation energies of typical molecules, it was found that LC-TDDFT gives accurate excitation energies, within an error of 0.5 eV, and reasonable oscillator strengths, while TDDFT employing a pure functional provides 1.5 eV lower excitation energies and two orders of magnitude lower oscillator strengths for the Rydberg excitations. It was also found that LC-TDDFT clearly reproduces the correct asymptotic behavior of the charge-transfer excitation energy of ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene dimer for the long intramolecular distance, unlike a conventional far-nucleus asymptotic correction scheme. It is, therefore, presumed that poor TDDFT results for pure functionals may be due to their lack of a long-range orbital-orbital interaction. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.

CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction at Low Overpotential on Cu Electrodes Resulting from the Reduction of Thick Cu<sub>2</sub>O Films	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Modified Cu electrodes were prepared by annealing Cu foil in air and electrochemically reducing the resulting Cu2O layers. The CO2 reduction activities of these electrodes exhibited a strong dependence on the initial thickness of the Cu2O layer. Thin Cu2O layers formed by annealing at 130 degrees C resulted in electrodes whose activities were indistinguishable from those of polycrystalline Cu. In contrast, Cu2O layers formed at 500 degrees C that were >= similar to 3 mu m thick resulted in electrodes that exhibited large roughness factors and required 0.5 V less overpotential than polycrystalline Cu to reduce CO2 at a higher rate than H2O. The combination of these features resulted in CO2 reduction geometric current densities > 1 mA/cm(2) at overpotentials < 0.4 V, a higher level of activity than all previously reported metal electrodes evaluated under comparable conditions. Moreover, the activity of the modified electrodes was stable over the course of several hours, whereas a polycrystalline Cu electrode exhibited deactivation within 1 h under identical conditions The electrodes described here may be particularly useful for elucidating the structural properties of Cu that determine the distribution between CO2 and H2O reduction and provide a promising lead for the development of practical catalysts for electrolytic fuel synthesis.

We have fabricated three types of regular and uniform polymer patterned arrays (line, cube, and pyramid) to improve the efficiency of the nanogenerator. The power generation of the pyramid-featured device far surpassed that exhibited by the unstructured films and gave an output voltage of up to 18 Vat a current density of similar to 0.13 mu A/cm(2). Furthermore, the as-prepared nanogenerator can be applied as a self-powered pressure sensor for sensing a water droplet (8 mg, similar to 3.6 Pa in contact pressure) and a falling feather (20 mg, Pa in contact pressure) with a low-end detection limit of similar to 13 mPa.

A procedure is described to analyze multiple solutions provided by bead modeling methods and to estimate stability and reliability of the shape reconstruction.

The average Hb adduct level measured in Swedish adults is preliminarily estimated to correspond to a daily intake approaching 100 mug of acrylamide. Because this uptake rate could be associated with a considerable cancer risk, it was considered important to identify its origin. It was hypothesized that acrylamide was formed at elevated temperatures in cooking, which was indicated in earlier studies of rats fed fried animal feed. This paper reports the analysis of acrylamide formed during heating of different human foodstuffs. Acrylamide levels in foodstuffs were analyzed by an improved gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method after bromination of acrylamide and by a new method for measurement of the underivatized acrylamide by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), using the MS/MS mode. For both methods the reproducibility, given as coefficient of variation, was similar to5%, and the recovery close to 100%. For the GC-MS method the achieved detection level of acrylamide was 5 mug/kg and for the LC-MS/MS method, 10 mug/kg. The analytic values obtained with the LC-MS/MS method were 0.99 (0.95-1.04; 95% confidence interval) of the GC-MS values. The LC-MS/MS method is simpler and preferable for most routine analyses. Taken together, the various analytic data should be considered as proof of the identity of acrylamide. Studies with laboratory-heated foods revealed a temperature dependence of acrylamide formation. Moderate levels of acrylamide (5-50 mug/kg) were measured in heated protein-rich foods and higher contents (150-4000 mug/kg) in carbohydrate-rich foods, such as potato, beetroot, and also certain heated commercial potato products and crispbread. Acrylamide could not be detected in unheated control or boiled foods (<5 mug/kg). Consumption habits indicate that the acrylamide levels in the studied heated foods could lead to a daily intake of a few tens of micrograms.

A t value between 0.8 and 1.0 is favorable for cubic perovskite structure, and larger (>1) or smaller (<0.8) values of tolerance factor usually result in nonperovskite structures. CH(NH2)(2)PbI3 (FAPbI(3)) can exist in the perovskite a-phase (black phase) with good photovoltaic properties. However, it has a large tolerance factor and is more stable in the hexagonal delta(H)-phase (yellow phase), with delta(H)-to-alpha phase-transition temperature higher than room temperature. On the other hand, CsPbI3 is stabilized to an orthorhombic structure (delta(o)-phase) at room temperature due to its small tolerance factor. We find that, by alloying FAPbI(3) with CsPbI3, the effective tolerance factor can be tuned, and the stability of the photo active a-phase of the mixed solid-state perovskite alloys FA(1-x)C(sx)bI(3) is enhanced, which is in agreement with our first-principles calculations. Thin films of the FA(0.85)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) perovskite alloy demonstrate much improved stability in a high-humidity environment; this contrasts significantly with the pure FAPbI(3) film for which the alpha-to-delta(H) phase transition (associated with yellowing appearance) is accelerated by humidity environment. Due to phase stabilization, the FA(0.86)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) solid-state alloy showed better solar cell performance and device stability than its FAPbI(3) counterparts. Our studies suggest that tuning the tolerance factor through solidstate alloying can be a general strategy to stabilize the desired perovskite structure for solar cell applications.

Recent inventions of several tough hydrogels show their potential as structural biomaterials, such as cartilage. Any given application, however, requires a combination of mechanical properties including stiffness, strength, toughness, damping, fatigue resistance and self-healing, along with biocompatibility. This combination is rarely realized. Here, we report that polyampholytes, polymers bearing randomly dispersed cationic and anionic repeat groups, form tough and viscoelastic hydrogels with multiple mechanical properties. The randomness makes ionic bonds of a wide distribution of strength. The strong bonds serve as permanent crosslinks, imparting elasticity, whereas the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. These physical hydrogels of supramolecular structure can be tuned to change multiple mechanical properties over wide ranges by using diverse ionic combinations. This polyampholyte approach is synthetically simple and dramatically increases the choice of tough hydrogels for applications.

J	Lopes, JNAC; Pádua, AAH				Lopes, JNAC; Pádua, AAH			Nanostructural organization in ionic liquids	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												Nanometer-scale structuring in room-temperature ionic liquids is observed using molecular simulation. The ionic liquids studied belong to the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium family with hexafluorophosphate or with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide as the anions, [C(n)mim][PF6] or [C(n)mim][(CF3SO2)(2)N], respectively. They were represented, for the first time in a simulation study focusing on long-range structures, by an all-atom force field of the AMBER/OPLS_AA family containing parameters developed specifically for these compounds. For ionic liquids with alkyl side chains longer than or equal to C-4, aggregation of the alkyl chains in nonpolar domains is observed. These domains permeate a tridimensional network of ionic channels formed by anions and by the imidazolium rings of the cations. The nanostructures can be visualized in a conspicuous way simply by color coding the two types of domains (in this work, we chose red = polar and green = nonpolar). As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the nonpolar domains become larger and more connected and cause swelling of the ionic network, in a manner analogous to systems exhibiting microphase separation. The consequences of these nanostructural features on the properties of the ionic liquids are analyzed.

Recent studies have proven that the carbon materials doped with the elements, which have the larger (N) or smaller (P, B) electronegative atoms than carbon such as N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs), P-doped graphite layers and B-doped CNTs, have also shown pronounced catalytic activity. Herein, we find that the graphenes doped with the elements, which have the similar electronegativity with carbon such as sulfur and selenium, can also exhibit better catalytic activity than the commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, indicating that these doped graphenes hold great potential far a substitute for Pt-based catalysts in FCs. The experimental results are believed to be significant because they not only give further insight Into the ORR mechanism of these metal-free doped carbon materials, but also open a way to fabricate other new low-cost NPMCs with high electrocatalytic activity by a simple, economical, and scalable approach for real FC applications.					zhou, xuemei/AGF-4466-2022; chen, xi'an/N-8232-2018; Huang, Shaoming/AAY-2942-2021; Yang, Zhi/ABD-3925-2021	huang, shaoming/0000-0003-0242-1143													1936-0851	1936-086X				JAN	2012	6	1					205	211		10.1021/nn203393d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn203393d								22201338					WOS:000299368300026
J	Knothe, G				Knothe, G			Dependence of biodiesel fuel properties on the structure of fatty acid alkyl esters	FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY												Biodiesel, defined as the mono-alkyl esters of vegetable oils or animal fats, is an "alternative" diesel fuel that is becoming accepted in a steadily growing number of countries around the world. Since the source of biodiesel varies with the location and other sources such as recycled oils are continuously gaining interest, it is important to possess data on how the various fatty acid profiles of the different sources can influence biodiesel fuel properties. The properties of the various individual fatty esters that comprise biodiesel determine the overall fuel properties of the biodiesel fuel. In turn, the properties of the various fatty esters are determined by the structural features of the fatty acid and the alcohol moieties that comprise a fatty ester. Structural features that influence the physical and fuel properties of a fatty ester molecule are chain length, degree of unsaturation, and branching of the chain. Important fuel properties of biodiesel that are influenced by the fatty acid profile and, in turn, by the structural features of the various fatty esters are cetane number and ultimately exhaust emissions, heat of combustion, cold flow, oxidative stability, viscosity, and lubricity.

It has been used for measuring neutral sugars in oligosaccharides, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. This method is used widely because of its sensitivity and simplicity. In its original form, it required 50-450 nmol of monosaccharides or equivalent for analysis and thus is inadequate for precious samples. A scaled-down version requiring only 10-80 nmol of sugars was reported previously. We have now modified and optimized this method to use 96-well microplates for high throughput, to gain greater sensitivity, and to economize the reagents. This modified and optimized method allows longer linear range (1-150 nmol for Man) and excellent sensitivity. Moreover, our method is more convenient, requiring neither shaking nor covering, and takes less than 15 min to complete. The speed and simplicity of this method would make it most suitable for analyses of large numbers of samples such as chromatographic fractions. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hydrogels with tunable stress relaxation regulate stem cell fate and activity	NATURE MATERIALS												Natural extracellular matrices (ECMs) are viscoelastic and exhibit stress relaxation. However, hydrogels used as synthetic ECMs for three-dimensional (3D) culture are typically elastic. Here, we report a materials approach to tune the rate of stress relaxation of hydrogels for 3D culture, independently of the hydrogel's initial elastic modulus, degradation, and cell-adhesion-ligand density. We find that cell spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are all enhanced in cells cultured in gels with faster relaxation. Strikingly, MSCs form a mineralized, collagen-1-rich matrix similar to bone in rapidly relaxing hydrogels with an initial elastic modulus of 17 kPa. We also show that the effects of stress relaxation are mediated by adhesion-ligand binding, actomyosin contractility and mechanical clustering of adhesion ligands. Our findings highlight stress relaxation as a key characteristic of cell-ECM interactions and as an important design parameter of biomaterials for cell culture.

Although, for example, the control of freely propagating waves (PWs; refs 1-6) and surface waves (SWs; refs 7-10) has separately become possible using transformation optics and metamaterials, a bridge linking both propagation types has not yet been found. Such a device has particular relevance given the many schemes of controlling electromagnetic waves at surfaces and interfaces, leading to trapped rainbows(11,12), lensing(13-16), beam bending(17), deflection(18-20), and even anomalous reflection/refraction(21,22). Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that a specific gradient-index meta-surface can convert a PW to a SW with nearly 100% efficiency. Distinct from conventional devices such as prism(23) or grating(24-26) couplers, the momentum mismatch between PW and SW is compensated by the reflection-phase gradient of the meta-surface, and a nearly perfect PW-SW conversion can happen for any incidence angle larger than a critical value. Experiments in the microwave region, including both far-field and near-field characterizations, are in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Our findings may pave the way for many applications, including high-efficiency surface plasmon couplers, anti-reflection surfaces, light absorbers, and so on.

The free acid can be removed by calcination giving the resulting solid, MIL-53ht or Cr-III(OH).{O2C-C6H4-CO2}. At room temperature, MIL-53ht adsorbs atmospheric water immediately to give Cr-III(OH).[O2C - C6H4-CO2}.H2O or MIL-53lt (It: low-temperature form, ht: high-temperature form). Both structures, which have been determined by using X-ray powder diffraction data, are built up from chains of chromium(Ill) octahedra linked through terephthalate dianions. This creates a three-dimensional structure with an array of one-dimensional large pore channels filled with free disordered terephthalic molecules (MIL-53as) or water molecules (MIL-53lt); when the free molecules are removed, this leads to a nanoporous solid (MIL-53ht) with a Langmuir surface area over 1500 m(2)/g. The transition between the hydrated form (MIL-53lt) and the anhydrous solid (MIL-53ht) is fully reversible and followed by a very high breathing effect (more than 5 A), the pores being clipped in the presence of water molecules (MIL-53It) and reopened when the channels are empty (MIL-53ht). The thermal behavior of the two solids has been investigated using TGA and X-ray thermodiffractometry. The sorption properties of MIL-53It have also been studied using several organic solvents. Finally, magnetism measurements performed on MIL-53as and MIL-53It revealed that these two phases are antiferromagnetic with Neel temperatures T-N of 65 and 55 K, respectively. Crystal data for MIL-53as is as follows: orthorhombic space group P-nam with a = 17.340(1) A, b = 12.178(1) Angstrom, c = 6.822(1) Angstrom, and Z = 4.

A large number of high-performance electrocatalysts have been developed for HER accompanied by recent significant advances in exploring its electrochemical nature. Herein we present a critical appraisal of both theoretical and experimental studies of HER electrocatalysts with special emphasis on the electronic structure, surface (electro)chemistry, and molecular design. It addresses the importance of correlating theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements toward better understanding of HER electrocatalysis at the atomic level.

In this work, we describe the new features and major improvements in Membrane Builder that allow users to robustly build realistic biological membrane systems, including (1) addition of new lipid types, such as phosphoinositides, cardiolipin (CL), sphingolipids, bacterial lipids, and ergosterol, yielding more than 180 lipid types, (2) enhanced building procedure for lipid packing around protein, (3) reliable algorithm to detect lipid tail penetration to ring structures and protein surface, (4) distance-based algorithm for faster initial ion displacement, (5) CHARMM inputs for P-21 image transformation, and (6) NAMD equilibration and production inputs. The robustness of these new features is illustrated by building and simulating a membrane model of the polar and septal regions of E. coli membrane, which contains five lipid types: CL lipids with two types of acyl chains and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids with three types of acyl chains. It is our hope that CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder becomes a useful tool for simulation studies to better understand the structure and dynamics of proteins and lipids in realistic biological membrane environments.

J	Öner, D; McCarthy, TJ				Öner, D; McCarthy, TJ			Ultrahydrophobic surfaces.: Effects of topography length scales on wettability	LANGMUIR												We discuss dynamic hydrophobicity from the perspective of the force required to move a water droplet on a surface and argue that the structure of the three-phase contact line is important. We studied the wettability of a series of silicon surfaces that were prepared by photolithography and hydrophobized using silanization reagents. Hydrocarbon, siloxane, and fluorocarbon surfaces were prepared. The surfaces contain posts of different sizes, shapes, and separations. Surfaces containing square posts with X-Y dimensions of 32 mu m and less exhibited ultrahydrophobic behavior with high advancing and receding water contact angles. Water droplets moved very easily on these surfaces and rolled off of slightly tilted surfaces. Contact angles were independent of the post height from 20 to 140 mu m and independent of surface chemistry. Water droplets were pinned on surfaces containing square posts with larger dimensions. Increasing the distance between posts and changing the shape of the posts from square to staggered rhombus, star, or indented square caused increases in receding contact angles. We ascribe these contact angle increases to decreases in the contact length and increases in tortuosity of the three-phase contact line. The maximum length scale of roughness that imparts ultrahydrophobicity is similar to 32 mu m.																			0743-7463					OCT 3	2000	16	20					7777	7782		10.1021/la000598o	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la000598o													WOS:000089728700037

These micro- and nanostructures provide a sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity and yet at the same time a high adhesive force with water. A water droplet on the surface of the petal appears spherical in shape, which cannot roll off even when the petal is turned upside down. We define this phenomenon as the "petal effect" as compared with the popular "lotus effect". Artificial fabrication of biomimic polymer films, with well-defined nanoembossed structures obtained by duplicating the petal's surface, indicates that the superhydrophobic surface and the adhesive petal are in Cassie impregnating wetting state.

J	Goerigk, L; Grimme, S				Goerigk, Lars; Grimme, Stefan			A thorough benchmark of density functional methods for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												A thorough energy benchmark study of various density functionals (DFs) is carried out with the new GMTKN30 database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions [Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2010, 6, 107; Goerigk and Grimme, J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2011, 7, 291]. In total, 47 DFs are investigated: two LDAs, 14 GGAs, three meta-GGAs, 23 hybrids and five double-hybrids. Besides the double-hybrids, also other modern approaches, i.e., the M05 and M06 classes of functionals and range-separated hybrids, are tested. For almost all functionals, the new DFT-D3 correction is applied in order to consistently test the performance also for important noncovalent interactions; the parameters are taken from previous works or determined for the present study. Basis set and quadrature grid issues are also considered. The general aim of the study is to work out which functionals are generally well applicable and robust to describe the energies of molecules. In summary, we recommend on the GGA level the B97-D3 and revPBE-D3 functionals. The best meta-GGA is oTPSS-D3 although meta-GGAs represent in general no clear improvement compared to numerically simpler GGAs. Notably, the widely used B3LYP functional performs worse than the average of all tested hybrids and is also very sensitive to the application of dispersion corrections. We discourage its usage as a standard method without closer inspection of the results, as it still seems to be often done nowadays. Surprisingly, long-range corrected exchange functionals do in general not perform better than the corresponding standard hybrids. However, the omega B97X-D functional seems to be a promising method. The most robust hybrid is Zhao and Truhlar's PW6B95 functional in combination with DFT-D3. If higher accuracy is required, double-hybrids should be applied. The corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and PWPB95-D3 variants are the most accurate and robust functionals of the entire study. Additional calculations with MP2 and and its spin-scaled variants SCS-MP2, S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 revealed that double-hybrids in general outperform those. Only SCS-MP2 can be recommended, particularly for reaction energies. We suggest its usage when a large self-interaction error is expected that prohibits usage of double-hybrids. Perdews' metaphoric picture of Jacob's Ladder for the classification of density functionals' performance could unbiasedly be confirmed with GMTKN30. We also show that there is no statistical correlation between a functional's accuracy for atomization energies and the performance for chemically more relevant reaction energies.

The database contains 605 electron-ionization mass spectrometry(EI-MS), 137 fast atom bombardment MS and 9276 electrospray ionization (E51)-MSn data of 2337 authentic compounds of metabolites, 11 545 EI-MS and 834 other-MS data of 10 286 volatile natural and synthetic compounds, and 3045 ESI-MS2 data of 679 synthetic drugs contributed by 16 research groups (January 2010). ESI-MS2 data were analyzed under nonstandardized, independent experimental conditions. MassBank is a distributed database. Each research group provides data from its own MassBank data servers distributed on the Internet. MassBank users can access either all of the MassBank data or a subset of the data by specifying one or more experimental conditions. In a spectral search to retrieve mass spectra similar to a query mass spectrum, the similarity score is calculated by a weighted cosine correlation in which weighting exponents on peak intensity and the mass-to-charge ratio are optimized to the ESI-MS2 data. MassBank also provides a merged spectrum for each compound prepared by merging the analyzed ESI-MS2 data on an identical compound under different collision-induced dissociation conditions. Data merging has significantly improved the precision of the identification of a chemical compound by 21-23% at a similarity score of 0.6. Thus, MassBank is useful for the identification of chemical compounds and the publication of experimental data. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This ligand confers unprecedented activity for these processes, allowing reactions to be performed at low catalyst levels, to prepare extremely hindered biaryls and to be carried out, in general, for reactions of aryl chlorides at room temperature. Additionally, structural studies of various 1(.)Pd complexes are presented along with computational data that help elucidate the efficacy that 1 imparts on Suzuki-Miyaura coupling processes. Moreover, a comparison of the reactions with 1 and with 2-(2 ',4 ',6 '-triisopropylbiphenyl)diphenylphosphine (2) is presented that is informative in determining the relative importance of ligand bulk and electron-donating ability in the high activity of catalysts derived from ligands of this type. Further, when the aryl bromide becomes too hindered, an interesting C-H bond functionalization-cross-coupling sequence intervenes to provide product in high yield.

The three resulting CDs emit bright and stable red, green and blue (RGB) colors of luminescence, under a single ultraviolet-light excitation. Alterations of PL emission of these CDs are tentatively proposed to result from the difference in their particle size and nitrogen content. Interestingly, up-conversion (UC) PL of these CDs is also observed. Moreover, flexible full-color emissive PVA films can be achieved through mixing two or three CDs in the appropriate ratios. These CDs also show low cytotoxicity and excellent cellular imaging capability. The facile preparation and unique optical features make these CDs potentially useful in numerous applications such as lightemitting diodes, full-color displays, and multiplexed (UC) PL bioimaging.

Ruddlesden-Popper Hybrid Lead Iodide Perovskite 2D Homologous Semiconductors	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS												The hybrid two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites have recently drawn significant interest because they can serve as excellent photoabsorbers in perovskite solar cells. Here we present the large scale synthesis, crystal structure, and optical characterization of the 2D (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NR3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, infinity) perovskites, a family of layered compounds with tunable semiconductor characteristics. These materials consist of well-defined inorganic perovskite layers intercalated with bulky butylammonium cations that act as spacers between these fragments, adopting the crystal structure of the Ruddlesden-Popper type. We find that the perovskite thickness (n) can be synthetically controlled by adjusting the ratio between the spacer cation and the small organic cation, thus allowing the isolation of compounds in pure form and large scale. The orthorhombic crystal structures of (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)-Pb2I7 (n = 2, Cc2m; a = 8.9470(4), b = 39.347(2) angstrom, c = 8.8589(6)), (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(2)Pb3I10 (n = 3, C2cb; a = 8.9275(6), b = 51.959(4) angstrom, c = 8.8777(6)), and (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(3)Pb4I13 (n = 4, Cc2m; a = 8.9274(4), b = 64.383(4) angstrom, c = 8.8816(4)) have been solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and are reported here for the first time. The compounds are noncentrosymmetric, as supported by measurements of the nonlinear optical properties of the compounds and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The band gaps of the series change progressively between 2.43 eV for the n = 1 member to 1.50 eV for the n = infinity adopting intermediate values of 2.17 eV (n = 2), 2.03 eV (n = 3), and 1.91 eV (n = 4) for those between the two compositional extrema. DFT calculations confirm this experimental trend and predict a direct band gap for all the members of the Ruddlesden Popper series. The estimated effective masses have values of m(h) = 0.14 m(0) and m(e) = 0.08 m(0) for holes and electrons, respectively, and are found to be nearly composition independent. The band gaps of higher n members indicate that these compounds can be used as efficient light absorbers in solar cells, which offer better solution processability and good environmental stability. The compounds exhibit intense room-temperature photoluminescence with emission wavelengths consistent with their energy gaps, 2.35 eV (n = 1), 2.12 eV (n = 2), 2.01 eV (n = 3), and 1.90 eV (n = 4) and point to their potential use in light-emitting diodes. In addition, owing to the low dimensionality and the difference in dielectric properties between the organic spacers and the inorganic perovskite layers, these compounds are naturally occurring multiple quantum well structures, which give rise to stable excitons at room temperature.					, Kanatzidis/ABH-7936-2022; Rondinelli, James/A-2071-2009; Hupp, Joseph/K-8844-2012; Young, Joshua/M-8282-2017; Stoumpos, Constantinos/P-6677-2016	Young, Joshua/0000-0001-8102-751X; Stoumpos, Constantinos/0000-0001-8396-9578													0897-4756	1520-5002				APR 26	2016	28	8					2852	2867		10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00847													WOS:000375244500043
J	Christopher, P; Xin, HL; Linic, S				Christopher, Phillip; Xin, Hongliang; Linic, Suljo			Visible-light-enhanced catalytic oxidation reactions on plasmonic silver nanostructures	NATURE CHEMISTRY												Catalysis plays a critical role in chemical conversion, energy production and pollution mitigation. High activation barriers associated with rate-limiting elementary steps require most commercial heterogeneous catalytic reactions to be run at relatively high temperatures, which compromises energy efficiency and the long-term stability of the catalyst. Here we show that plasmonic nanostructures of silver can concurrently use low-intensity visible light (on the order of solar intensity) and thermal energy to drive catalytic oxidation reactions-such as ethylene epoxidation, CO oxidation, and NH3 oxidation-at lower temperatures than their conventional counterparts that use only thermal stimulus. Based on kinetic isotope experiments and density functional calculations, we postulate that excited plasmons on the silver surface act to populate O-2 antibonding orbitals and so form a transient negative-ion state, which thereby facilitates the rate-limiting O-2-dissociation reaction. The results could assist the design of catalytic processes that are more energy efficient and robust than current processes.

Review of the proton exchange membranes for fuel cell applications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY					1st National Conference on Hydrogen and Fuel Cell (H2FC2009)	JAN 20-21, 2009	Iran Univ Sci Tech, Tehran, IRAN	Green Res Ctr	Iran Univ Sci Tech			Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are considered to be a promising technology for clean and efficient power generation in the twenty-first century. Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are the key components in fuel cell system. The researchers have focused to reach the proton exchange membrane with high proton conductivity, low electronic conductivity, low permeability to fuel, low electroosmotic drag coefficient, good chemical/thermal stability, good mechanical properties and low cost. These are classified into the "iron triangle" of performance, durability, and cost. Current PEMFC technology is based on expensive perflourinated proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) that operate effectively only under fully hydrated conditions. There is considerable application-driven interest in lowering the membrane cost and extending the operating window of PEMs. PEMFC system complexity could be reduced by the development of 'water-free' electrolytes that do not require hydration. It also enables the PEMFC to be operated under 'warm' conditions (i.e. above 100 degrees C) thus further improving its efficiency. Capital cost could also be further reduced because at warmer conditions less Pt could be used. This paper presents an overview of the key requirements for the proton exchange membranes (PEM) used in fuel cell applications, along with a description of the membrane materials currently being used and their ability to meet these requirements. A number of possible alternative candidates are reviewed and presented in this paper. Also discussed are some of the new materials, technologies, and research directions being pursued to try to meet the demanding performance and durability needs of the PEM fuel cell industry. The alternative PEMs are classified into three categories: (1) modified Nafion (R) composite membranes; (2) functionalized non-fluorinated membranes and composite membranes therein; and (3) acid base composite membranes. Several commonly used inorganic additives are reviewed in the context of composite membranes. Finally, the general methods of the measuring and evaluating of proton exchange membrane properties have been investigated such as proton conductivity, ion exchange capacity, water uptake, gas permeability, methanol permeability, durability, thermal stability and fuel cell performance test.

Here we report the generation and application of an engineered, structure-specific antibody employed to quantitatively visualize DNA G-quadruplex structures in human cells. We show explicitly that G-quadruplex formation in DNA is modulated during cell-cycle progression and that endogenous G-quadruplex DNA structures can be stabilized by a small-molecule ligand. Together these findings provide substantive evidence for the formation of G-quadruplex structures in the genome of mammalian cells and corroborate the application of stabilizing ligands in a cellular context to target G-quadruplexes and intervene with their function.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) was recently found to exhibit indirect-to-direct gap transition when the thickness is reduced to a single monolayer. Emerging photoluminescence (PL) from monolayer MoS2 opens up opportunities for a range of novel optoelectronic applications of the material. Here we report differential reflectance and PL spectra of mono- to few-layer WS2 and WSe2 that indicate that the band structure of these materials undergoes similar indirect-to-direct gap transition when thinned to a single monolayer. The transition is evidenced by distinctly enhanced PL peak centered at 630 and 750 nm in monolayer WS2 and WSe2, respectively. Few-layer flakes are found to exhibit comparatively strong indirect gap emission along with direct gap hot electron emission, suggesting high quality of synthetic crystals prepared by a chemical vapor transport method. Fine absorption and emission features and their thickness dependence suggest a strong effect of Se p-orbitals on the d electron band structure as well as interlayer coupling in WSe2.

A sharp resonance of nearly perfect transmission can arise within a broad absorption profile. These features show remarkable potential for slow light, novel sensors and low-loss metamaterials. In nanophotonics, plasmonic structures enable large field strengths within small mode volumes. Therefore, combining EIT with nanoplasmonics would pave the way towards ultracompact sensors with extremely high sensitivity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a nanoplasmonic analogue of EIT using a stacked optical metamaterial. A dipole antenna with a large radiatively broadened linewidth is coupled to an underlying quadrupole antenna, of which the narrow linewidth is solely limited by the fundamental non-radiative Drude damping. In accordance with EIT theory, we achieve a very narrow transparency window with high modulation depth owing to nearly complete suppression of radiative losses.

Extrapolation to the CBS limit is done by using two-point extrapolation methods and different basis sets (aug-cc-pVDZ-aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ-aug-cc-pVQZ, cc-pVTZ-ccp-VQZ) are utilized. The CCSD(T) correction term, determined as a difference between CCSD( T) and MP2 interaction energies, is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ). Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized or experimental ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set, which is now available to the chemical community, can be used for testing lower-level computational methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22) containing 22 model complexes can be recommended.

Herein, we report a novel hybrid nanostructure with CoP nanopartides (NPs) embedded in a N-doped carbon nanotube hollow polyhedron (NCNHP) through a pyrolysis-oxidation-phosphidation strategy derived from core-shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between highly active CoP NPs and NCNHP, the CoP/NCNHP hybrid exhibited outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performances. When the CoP/NCNHP was employed as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, a potential as low as 1.64 V was needed to achieve the current density of 10 rnA.cm(-2), and it still exhibited superior activity after continuously working for 36 h with nearly negligible decay in potential. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the electron transfer from NCNHP to CoP could increase the electronic states of the Co d-orbital around the Fermi level, which could increase the binding strength with H and therefore improve the electrocatalytic performance. The strong stability is attributed to high oxidation resistance of the CoP surface protected by the NCNHP.

It starts with an introduction highlighting the main advantages of nano-emulsions over macroemulsions for personal care and cosmetic formulations. It also describes the main problems with lack of progress on nano-emulsions. The second section deals with the mechanism of emulsification and the dynamic light scattering technique for measurement of the droplet size of nano-emulsions. This is followed by a section on methods of emulsification and the role of surfactants. Three methods are described for nano-emulsion preparation, namely high energy emulsification (using homogenisers), low energy emulsification whereby water is added to an oil solution of the surfactant and the principle of the phase inversion temperature (PIT). A section is devoted to steric stabilisation and the role of the adsorbed layer thickness. The problem of Ostwald ripening (which is the main instability process of nano-emulsions) is described in some detail. The methods that can be applied to reduce Ostwald ripening are briefly described. This involves the addition of a second less soluble oil phase such as squalene and/or addition of a strongly adsorbed and water insoluble polymeric surfactant. The last part of the review gives some examples of nano-emulsions that are prepared by the PIT method as well as using high pressure homogeniser. A comparison of the two methods is given and the rate of Ostwald ripening is measured in both cases. The effect of changing the alkyl chain length and branching of the oil was investigated using decane, dodecane, tertadecane, hexadecane and isohexadecane. The branched oil isohexadcecane showed higher Ostwald ripening rate when compared with a linear chain oil with the same carbon number. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Espinosa, E; Alkorta, I; Elguero, J; Molins, E				Espinosa, E; Alkorta, I; Elguero, J; Molins, E			From weak to strong interactions:: A comprehensive analysis of the topological and energetic properties of the electron density distribution involving X-H•••F-Y systems	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												The topological and energetic properties of the electron density distribution rho(r) of the isolated pairwise H...F interaction have been theoretically calculated at several geometries (0.8<d<2.5 Angstrom) and represented against the corresponding internuclear distances. From long to short geometries, the results presented here lead to three characteristic regions, which correspond to three different interaction states. While the extreme regions are associated to pure closed-shell (CS) and shared-shell (SS) interactions, the middle one has been related to the redistribution of rho(r) between those electronic states. The analysis carried out with this system has permitted to associate the transit region between pure CS and SS interactions to internuclear geometries involved in the building of the H-F bonding molecular orbital. A comparative analysis between the formation of this orbital and the behavior of some characteristic rho(r) properties has indicated their intrinsic correspondence, leading to the definition of a bond degree parameter [BD=H-CP/rho(CP); H-CP and rho(CP) being the total electron energy density and the electron density value at the H...F (3,-1) critical point]. Along with the isolated pairwise H...F interaction, 79 X-H...F-Y (neutral, positively and negatively charged) complexes have been also theoretically considered and analyzed in terms of relevant topological and energetic properties of rho(r) found at their H.F critical points. In particular, the interaction energies of X-H.F-Y pure CS interactions have been estimated by using the bond degree parameter. On the other hand, the [F...H...F](-) proton transfer geometry has been related to the local maximum of the electron kinetic energy density (G(CP))(max). (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.

The use of the CHARMM36 force field (C36 FF) in different MD simulation programs can result in disagreements with published simulations performed with CHARMM due to differences in the protocols used to treat the long-range and 14 nonbonded interactions. In this study, we systematically test the use of the C36 lipid FF in NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER, OpenMM, and CHARMM/OpenMM. A wide range of Lennard-Jones (LJ) cutoff schemes and integrator algorithms were tested to find the optimal simulation protocol to best match bilayer properties of six lipids with varying acyl chainsaturation and head groups. MD simulations of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer were used to obtain the optimal protocol for each program. MD simulations with all programs were found to reasonably match the DPPC bilayer properties (surface area per lipid, chain order parameters, and area compressibility modulus) obtained using the standard protocol used in CHARMM as well as from experiments. The optimal simulation protocol was then applied to the other five lipid simulations and resulted in excellent agreement between results from most simulation programs as well as with experimental data. AMBER compared least favorably with the expected membrane properties, which appears to be due to its use of the hard-truncation in the LJ potential versus a force-based switching function used to smooth the LJ potential as it approaches the cutoff distance. The optimal simulation protocol for each program has been implemented in CHARMM-GUI. This protocol is expected to be applicable to the remainder of the additive C36 FF including the proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecules.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study of GO sheets annealed at various reaction temperatures reveals that N-doping occurs at a temperature as low as 300 degrees C, while the highest doping level of similar to 5% N is achieved at 500 degrees C. N-doping is accompanied by the reduction of GO with decreases in oxygen levels from similar to 28% in as-made GO down to similar to 2% in 1100 degrees C NH3 reacted GO. XPS analysis of the N binding configurations of doped GO finds pyridinic N in the doped samples, with increased quaternary N (N that replaced the carbon atoms in the graphene plane) in GO annealed at higher temperatures (>= 900 degrees C). Oxygen groups in GO were found responsible for reactions with NH3 and C-N bond formation. Prereduced GO with fewer oxygen groups by thermal annealing in H-2 exhibits greatly reduced reactivity with NH3 and a lower N-doping level. Electrical measurements of individual GO sheet devices demonstrate that GO annealed in NH3 exhibits higher conductivity than those annealed in H-2, suggesting more effective reduction of GO by annealing in NH3 than in H-2, consistent with XPS data. The N-doped reduced GO shows clearly n-type electron doping behavior with the Dirac point (DP) at negative gate voltages in three terminal devices. Our method could lead to the synthesis of bulk amounts of N-doped, reduced GO sheets useful for various practical applications.

J	Coelho, AA				Coelho, Alan A.			<i>TOPAS</i> and <i>TOPAS</i>-<i>Academic</i>: an optimization program integrating computer algebra and crystallographic objects written in C plus	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY												TOPAS and its academic variant TOPAS-Academic are nonlinear least-squares optimization programs written in the C++ programming language. This paper describes their functionality and architecture. The latter is of benefit to developers seeking to reduce development time. TOPAS allows linear and nonlinear constraints through the use of computer algebra, with parameter dependencies, required for parameter derivatives, automatically determined. In addition, the objective function can include restraints and penalties, which again are defined using computer algebra. Of importance is a conjugate gradient solution routine with bounding constraints which guide refinements to convergence. Much of the functionality of TOPAS is achieved through the use of generic functionality; for example, flexible peak-shape generation allows neutron time-of-flight (TOF) peak shapes to be described using generic functions. The kernel of TOPAS can be run from the command line for batch mode operation or from a closely integrated graphical user interface. The functionality of TOPAS includes peak fitting, Pawley and Le Bail refinement, Rietveld refinement, single-crystal refinement, pair distribution function refinement, magnetic structures, constant wavelength neutron refinement, TOF refinement, stacking-fault analysis, Laue refinement, indexing, charge flipping, and structure solution through simulated annealing.																			1600-5767					FEB	2018	51		1				210	218		10.1107/S1600576718000183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S1600576718000183													WOS:000424121500024

Cobalt-Iron (Oxy)hydroxide Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts: The Role of Structure and Composition on Activity, Stability, and Mechanism	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Cobalt oxides and (oxy)hydroxides have been widely studied as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For related Ni-based materials, the addition of Fe dramatically enhances OER activity. The role of Fe in Co-based materials is not well-documented. We show that the intrinsic OER activity of Co1-xFex(OOH) is similar to 100-fold higher for x approximate to 0.6-0.7 than for x = 0 on a per-metal turnover frequency basis. Fe-free CoOOH absorbs Fe from electrolyte impurities if the electrolyte is not rigorously purified. Fe incorporation and increased activity correlate with an anodic shift in the nominally Co2+/3+ redox wave, indicating strong electronic interactions between the two elements and likely substitutional doping of Fe for Co. In situ electrical measurements show that Co1-xFex(OOH) is conductive under OER conditions (similar to 0.7-4 mS cm(-1) at similar to 300 mV overpotential), but that FeOOH is an insulator with measurable conductivity (2.2 x 10(-2) mS cm(-1)) only at high overpotentials >400 mV. The apparent OER activity of FeOOH is thus limited by low conductivity. Microbalance measurements show that films with x >= 0.54 (i.e., Fe-rich) dissolve in 1 M KOH electrolyte under OER conditions. For x < 0.54, the films appear chemically stable, but the OER activity decreases by 16-62% over 2 h, likely due to conversion into denser, oxide-like phases. We thus hypothesize that Fe is the most-active site in the catalyst, while CoOOH primarily provides a conductive, high-surface area, chemically stabilizing host. These results are important as Fe-containing Co- and Ni-(oxy)hydroxides are the fastest OER catalysts known.

Based on the relative dimensions of the shell thickness and core radius, nanoshells may be designed to scatter and/or absorb light over a broad spectral range including the near-infrared (NIR), a wavelength region that provides maximal penetration of light through tissue. The ability to control both wave length-dependent scattering and absorption of nanoshells offers the opportunity to design nanoshells which provide, in a single nanoparticle, both diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Here, we demonstrate a novel nanoshell-based all-optical platform technology for integrating cancer imaging and therapy applications. Immunotargeted nanoshells are engineered to both scatter light in the NIR enabling optical molecular cancer imaging and to absorb light, allowing selective destruction of targeted carcinoma cells through photothermal therapy. In a proof of principle experiment, dual imaging/therapy immunotargeted nanoshells are used to detect and destroy breast carcinoma cells that overexpress HER2, a clinically relevant cancer biomarker.

However, the acoustic analogue to electromagnetic metamaterials has, so far, not been investigated. We report a new class of ultrasonic metamaterials consisting of an array of subwavelength Helmholtz resonators with designed acoustic inductance and capacitance. These materials have an effective dynamic modulus with negative values near the resonance frequency. As a result, these ultrasonic metamaterials can convey acoustic waves with a group velocity antiparallel to phase velocity, as observed experimentally. On the basis of homogenized-media theory, we calculated the dispersion and transmission, which agrees well with experiments near 30 kHz. As the negative dynamic modulus leads to a richness of surface states with very large wavevectors, this new class of acoustic metamaterials may offer interesting applications, such as acoustic negative refraction and superlensing below the diffraction limit.

For use in practical applications, a Si electrode must have high capacity, long cycle life, high efficiency, and the fabrication must be industrially scalable. Here, we design and fabricate a yolk-shell structure to meet all these needs. The fabrication is carried out without special equipment and mostly at room temperature. Commercially available Si nanoparticles are completely sealed inside conformal, thin, self-supporting carbon shells, with rationally designed void space in between the particles and the shell. The well-defined void space allows the Si particles to expand freely without breaking the outer carbon shell, therefore stabilizing the solid-electrolyte interphase on the shell surface. High capacity (similar to 2800 mAh/g at C/10), long cycle life (1000 cycles with 74% capacity retention), and high Coulombic efficiency (99.84%) have been realized in this yolk-shell structured Si electrode.

A new kind of gel has been obtained by chemically cross-linking polyrotaxane molecules in solution. The polymer chains are topologically interlocked by figure-of-eight cross-links (see Figure), which can pass along the polymer chains freely to equalize the "tension" of the threaded polymer chains just like pulleys.

Biological hydrogen production processes are found to be more environment friendly and less energy intensive as compared to thermochemical and electrochemical processes. They are mostly controlled by either photosynthetic or fermentative organisms. Till today, more emphasis has been given on the former processes. Nitrogenase and hydrogenase play very important role. Genetic manipulation of cyanobacteria (hydrogenase negative gene) improves the hydrogen generation. The paper presents a survey of biological hydrogen production processes. The microorganisms and biochemical pathways involved in hydrogen generation processes are presented in some detail. Several developmental works are discussed. Immobilized system is found suitable for the continuous hydrogen production. About 28% of energy can be recovered in the form of hydrogen using sucrose as substrate. Fermentative hydrogen production processes have some edge over the other biological processes. (C) 2000 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The HCNWs used as anode material for Na-ion batteries deliver a high reversible capacity of 251 mAh g(-1) and 82.2% capacity retention over 400 charge-discharge cycles between 1.2 and 0.01 V (vs Na'/Na) at a constant current of 50 mA g(-1) (0.2 C). Excellent cycling stability is also observed at an even higher charge-discharge rate. A high reversible capacity of 149 rnAh g(-1) also can be obtained at a current rate of 500 rnA g(-1) (2C). The good Na-ion insertion property is attributed to the short diffusion distance in the HCNWIs and the large interlayer distance (0.37 nm) between the graphitic sheets, which agrees with the interlayered distance predicted by theoretical calculations to enable Na-ion insertion in carbon materials.

J	Stedmon, CA; Markager, S; Bro, R				Stedmon, CA; Markager, S; Bro, R			Tracing dissolved organic matter in aquatic environments using a new approach to fluorescence spectroscopy	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a complex and poorly understood mixture of organic polymers that plays an influential role in aquatic ecosystems. In this study we have successfully characterised the fluorescent fraction of DOM in the catchment of a Danish estuary using fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). PARAFAC aids the characterisation of fluorescent DOM by decomposing the fluorescence matrices into different independent fluorescent components. The results reveal that at least five different fluorescent DOM fractions present (in significant amounts) in the catchment and that the relative composition is dependent on the source (e.g. agricultural runoff, forest soil, aquatic production). Four different allochthonous fluorescent groups and one autochthonous fluorescent group were identified. The ability to trace the different fractions of the DOM pool using this relatively cheap and fast technique represents a significant advance within the fields of aquatic ecology and chemistry, and will prove to be useful for catchment management.

Mixed SAMs presenting different functional groups were prepared for screening using a synthetic protocol based on the reaction of organic amines with a SAM terminated by interchain carboxylic anhydride groups. Surfaces that presented derivatives of oligo(sarcosine), N-acetylpiperazine, and permethylated sorbitol groups were particularly effective in resisting the adsorption of proteins. Incorporation of these groups into single-component SAMs resulted in surfaces that are comparable to (but slightly less good than) single-component SAMs that present oligo(ethylene glycol) in their ability to resist the adsorption of proteins. In the group of surfaces examined, those that resisted the adsorption of proteins had the following properties: they were hydrophilic; they contained groups that were hydrogen-bond acceptors but not hydrogen-bond donors; and they were overall electrically neutral.																			0743-7463					SEP 4	2001	17	18					5605	5620		10.1021/la010384m	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la010384m													WOS:000170746800029

J	Ordóñez, FJ; Roggen, D				Ordonez, Francisco Javier; Roggen, Daniel			Deep Convolutional and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks for Multimodal Wearable Activity Recognition	SENSORS												Human activity recognition (HAR) tasks have traditionally been solved using engineered features obtained by heuristic processes. Current research suggests that deep convolutional neural networks are suited to automate feature extraction from raw sensor inputs. However, human activities are made of complex sequences of motor movements, and capturing this temporal dynamics is fundamental for successful HAR. Based on the recent success of recurrent neural networks for time series domains, we propose a generic deep framework for activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent units, which: (i) is suitable for multimodal wearable sensors; (ii) can perform sensor fusion naturally; (iii) does not require expert knowledge in designing features; and (iv) explicitly models the temporal dynamics of feature activations. We evaluate our framework on two datasets, one of which has been used in a public activity recognition challenge. Our results show that our framework outperforms competing deep non-recurrent networks on the challenge dataset by 4% on average; outperforming some of the previous reported results by up to 9%. Our results show that the framework can be applied to homogeneous sensor modalities, but can also fuse multimodal sensors to improve performance. We characterise key architectural hyperparameters' influence on performance to provide insights about their optimisation.

However, to date, there has been little success in the development of high-performance solid-state batteries using these exceptional materials, the major challenge being the high solid-solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and electrode materials. In this work, we effectively address the large interfacial impedance between a lithium metal anode and the garnet electrolyte using ultrathin aluminium oxide (Al2O3) by atomic layer deposition. Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLCZN) is the garnet composition of choice in this work due to its reduced sintering temperature and increased lithium ion conductivity. A significant decrease of interfacial impedance, from 1,710 Omega cm(2) to 1 Omega cm(2), was observed at room temperature, effectively negating the lithium metal/garnet interfacial impedance. Experimental and computational results reveal that the oxide coating enables wetting of metallic lithium in contact with the garnet electrolyte surface and the lithiated-alumina interface allows effective lithium ion transport between the lithium metal anode and garnet electrolyte. We also demonstrate a working cell with a lithium metal anode, garnet electrolyte and a high-voltage cathode by applying the newly developed interface chemistry.

The synthesis involves the co-electrodeposition of a bimetallic (Ni, Co) hydroxide precursor on a Ni foam support and subsequent thermal transformation to spinel mesoporous NiCo2O4. The as-prepared ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets with the thickness of a few nanometers possess many interparticle mesopores with a size range from 2 to 5 nm. The nickel foam supported ultrathin mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets promise fast electron and ion transport, large electroactive surface area, and excellent structural stability. As a result, superior pseudocapacitive performance is achieved with an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1450 F g(-1), even at a very high current density of 20 A g(-1), and excellent cycling performance at high rates, suggesting its promising application as an efficient electrode for electrochemical capacitors.

Field-deployable, high-resolution, time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The development of a new high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) is reported. The high-resolution capabilities of this instrument allow the direct separation of most ions from inorganic and organic species at the same nominal m/z, the quantification of several types of organic fragments (CxHy, CxHyOz, CxHyNp, CxHyOzNp), and the direct identification of organic nitrogen and organosulfur content. This real-time instrument is field-deployable, and its high time resolution (0.5 Hz has been demonstrated) makes it well-suited for studies in which time resolution is critical, such as aircraft studies. The instrument has two ion optical modes: a single-reflection configuration offers higher sensitivity and lower resolving power ( up to similar to 2100 at m/z 200), and a two-reflectron configuration yields higher resolving power ( up to similar to 4300 at m/z 200) with lower sensitivity. The instrument also allows the determination of the size distributions of all ions. One-minute detection limits for submicrometer aerosol are < 0.04 mu g m(-3) for all species in the high-sensitivity mode and < 0.4 mu g m(-3) in the high-resolution mode. Examples of ambient aerosol data are presented from the SOAR-1 study in Riverside, CA, in which the spectra of ambient organic species are dominated by CxHy and CxHyOz fragments, and different organic and inorganic fragments at the same nominal m/z show different size distributions. Data are also presented from the MIRAGE C-130 aircraft study near Mexico City, showing high correlation with independent measurements of surrogate aerosol mass concentration.

Herein, inspired by the superiority of carbon conductivity, the propitious H atom binding energy of metallic cobalt, and better OER activity of cobalt oxide, we synthesized cobalt-cobalt oxide/N-doped carbon hybrids (CoOx@CN) composed of Co-0, CoO, Co3O4 applied to HER and OER by simple one-pot thermal treatment method. CoOx@CN exhibited a small onset potential of 85 mV, low charge-transfer resistance (41 Omega), and considerable stability for HER. Electrocatalytic experiments further indicated the better performance of CoOx@CN for HER can be attributed to the high conductivity of carbon, the synergistic effect of metallic cobalt and cobalt oxide, the stability of carbon-encapsulated Co nanoparticles, and the introduction of electron-rich nitrogen. In addition, when used as catalysts of OER, the CoOx@CN hybrids required 0.26 V overpotential for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable even superior to many other non-noble metal catalysts. More importantly, an alkaline electrolyzer that approached similar to 20 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.55 V was fabricated by applying CoOx@CN as cathode and anode electrocatalyst, which opened new possibilities for exploring overall water splitting catalysts.

Some ZnO nanoparticles exhibit very strong blue emissions, the intensity of which first increase and then decrease with annealing. These visible emissions exhibit strong and interesting excitation dependences: 1) the optimal excitation energy for blue emissions is near the bandgap energy, but the effective excitation can obviously be lower, even 420 nm (2.95 eV < E-g = 3.26 eV); in contrast, green emissions can be excited only by energies larger than the bandgap energy; and, 2) there are several fixed emitting wavelengths at 415, 440, 455 and 488 nm in the blue wave band, which exhibit considerable stability in different excitation and annealing conditions. Mechanisms for blue emissions from ZnO are proposed with interstitial-zinc-related defect levels as initial states. EPR spectra reveal the predominance of interstitial zinc in as-prepared samples, and the evolutions of coexisting interstitial zinc and oxygen vacancies with annealing. Furthermore, good controllability of visible emissions is achieved, including the co-emission of blue and green emissions and peak adjustment from blue to yellow.

J	Grimme, S				Grimme, S			Improved second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory by separate scaling of parallel- and antiparallel-spin pair correlation energies	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												A simple modification of second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) to improve the description of molecular ground state energies is proposed. The total MP2 correlation energy is partitioned into parallel- and antiparallel-spin components which are separately scaled. The two parameters (scaling factors), whose values can be justified by basic theoretical arguments, have been optimized on a benchmark set of 51 reaction energies composed of 74 first-row molecules. It is found, that the new method performs significantly better than standard MP2: the rms [mean absolute error (MAE)] deviation drops from 4.6 (3.3) to 2.3 (1.8) kcal/mol. The maximum error is reduced from 13.3 to 5.1 kcal/mol. Significant improvements are especially observed for cases which are usually known as MP2 pitfalls while cases already described well with MP2 remain almost unchanged. Even for 11 atomization energies not considered in the fit, uniform improvements [MAE: 8.1 kcal/mol (MP2) versus 3.2 kcal/mol (new)] are found. The results are furthermore compared with those from density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) and quadratic configuration interaction [QCISD/QCISD(T)] calculations. Also for difficult systems including strong (nondynamical) correlation effects, the improved MP2 method clearly outperforms DFT/B3LYP and yields results of QCISD or sometimes QCISD(T) quality. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for ten diatomic molecules also show consistent enhancements. The uniformity with which the new method improves upon MP2, thereby rectifying many of its problems, indicates significant robustness and suggests it as a valuable quantum chemical method of general use.

Catalysts and Reaction Pathways for the Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS												The electrochemical reduction of CO2 has gained significant interest recently as it has the potential to trigger a sustainable solar-fuel-based economy. In this Perspective, we highlight several heterogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 and discuss the reaction pathways through which they form various products. Among those, copper is a unique catalyst as it yields hydrocarbon products, mostly methane, ethylene, and ethanol, with acceptable efficiencies. As a result, substantial effort has been invested to determine the special catalytic properties of copper and to elucidate the mechanism through which hydrocarbons are formed. These mechanistic insights, together with mechanistic insights of CO2 reduction on other metals and molecular complexes, can provide crucial guidelines for the design of future catalyst materials able to efficiently and selectively reduce CO2 to useful products.

Graphite shows moderate rate capability and relatively fast capacity fading.

The main modifications, as compared to Neuhoff's protocol, were: a 20% increment in dye concentration (from 0.1 % up to 0.12%) and a much higher level of phosphoric acid in the recipe (from 2% up to 10%). The "blue silver" exhibits a much faster dye uptake (80% during the first hour of coloration, vs. none with a commercial preparation from Sigma). Even at equilibrium (24 h staining), the "blue silver" exhibits a much higher sensitivity than all other recipes, approaching (but lower than) the one of the classical silver stain. Measurements of stain sensitivity after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) gave a detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio > 3) of 1 ng in a single zone. The somewhat lower sensitivity of "blue silver" as compared to classical silvering protocols in the presence of aldehydes is amply compensated for by its full compatibility with mass spectrometry of eluted polypeptide chains, after a two-dimensional map analysis, thus confirming that no dye is covalently bound (or permanently modifies) to any residue in the proteinaceous material. It is believed that the higher level of phosphoric acid in the recipe, thus its lower final pH, helps in protonating the last dissociated residues of Asp and Glu in the polypeptide coils, thus greatly favoring ionic anchoring of dye molecules to the protein moiety. Such a binding, though, must be followed by considerable hydrophobic association with the aromatic and hydrophobic residues along the polypeptide backbone.

These include reaction energies of both open- and closed-shell reactions, atomization energies, electron affinities, ionization potentials, equilibrium geometries, and harmonic vibrational frequencies. For all these quantities, results better than the AV5Z quality are obtained already with AVTZ basis sets, and usually AVDZ treatments reach at least the conventional AVQZ quality.

Here we report, for the first time, a synthetic method that leads to in situ growth of {210} high-index faceted Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF). We show that the resulting material, denoted Ni3S2/NF, can serve as a highly active, binder-free, bifunctional electro catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ni3S2/NF is found to give similar to 100% Faradaic yield toward both HER and OER and to show remarkable catalytic stability (for >200 h). Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that Ni3S2/NF's excellent catalytic activity is mainly due to the synergistic catalytic effects produced in it by its nanosheet arrays and exposed {210} high-index facets.

Biodegradable luminescent porous silicon nanoparticles for <i>in vivo</i> applications	NATURE MATERIALS												Nanomaterials that can circulate in the body hold great potential to diagnose and treat disease(1-4). For such applications, it is important that the nanomaterials be harmlessly eliminated from the body in a reasonable period of time after they carry out their diagnostic or therapeutic function. Despite efforts to improve their targeting efficiency, significant quantities of systemically administered nanomaterials are cleared by the mononuclear phagocytic system before finding their targets, increasing the likelihood of unintended acute or chronic toxicity. However, there has been little effort to engineer the self-destruction of errant nanoparticles into non-toxic, systemically eliminated products. Here, we present luminescent porous silicon nanoparticles (LPSiNPs) that can carry a drug payload and of which the intrinsic near-infrared photoluminescence enables monitoring of both accumulation and degradation in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to most optically active nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles and quantum dots), LPSiNPs self-destruct in a mouse model into renally cleared components in a relatively short period of time with no evidence of toxicity. As a preliminary in vivo application, we demonstrate tumour imaging using dextran-coated LPSiNPs (D-LPSiNPs). These results demonstrate a new type of multifunctional nanostructure with a low-toxicity degradation pathway for in vivo applications.

Films of 1 are more moisture resistant than films of 2 and devices containing 1 can be fabricated under ambient humidity levels. The larger bandgap of the 2Dstructure is also suitable as the higher bandgap absorber in a dual-absorber tandem device.

Furthermore, a nucleation-controlled strategy is established to systematically promote the formation of large-area, single-and few-layered films. Using high-resolution electron microscopy imaging, the atomic structure and morphology of the grains and their boundaries in the polycrystalline molybdenum disulphide atomic layers are examined, and the primary mechanisms for grain boundary formation are evaluated. Grain boundaries consisting of 5- and 7- member rings are directly observed with atomic resolution, and their energy landscape is investigated via first-principles calculations.

The Chemical and structural analysis of graphene oxide with different degrees of oxidation	CARBON												Graphene oxide (GO) with various degrees of oxidation was synthesized using a modified Hummers method. The formation of different types of oxygen containing functional groups in GO, and their influences on its structure were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), zeta potential analysis and Raman spectroscopy. XRD studies showed a disruption of the graphitic AS stacking order during the increase in oxidation levels. XPS analysis revealed the formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at lower oxidation levels and epoxide groups at higher oxidation levels. The influence of the oxidation degree on the properties of GO was evaluated by zeta potential analysis, which showed a linear increase in the zeta potential with increasing oxidation levels. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed that increasing oxidation levels results in a transition from a crystalline to an amorphous structure. The electrochemical properties of GO is highly influenced by the variation in degree of oxidation.

J	Qu, LH; Peng, XG				Qu, LH; Peng, XG			Control of photoluminescence properties of CdSe nanocrystals in growth	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												The photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of CdSe nanocrystals during their growth under a given set of initial conditions increases monotonically to a certain maximum value and then decreases gradually. Such a maximum is denoted as a PL "bright point", which does not always overlap with the minimum point of the PL peak width for the same reaction. The experimental results suggest that the existence of the PL bright point is a general phenomenon during the growth of semiconductor nanocrystals and likely is a signature of an optimal surface structure/reconstruction of the nanocrystals grown under a given set of initial conditions. The position of the bright point, the highest PL QY, the types of the bright points (sharp or flat), the sharpness of the PL peak, etc., were all strongly dependent on the initial Cd:Se ratio of the precursors in the solution. A large excess of the selenium precursor, with 5-10 times more selenium precursor than the amount of the cadmium precursor, was found necessary to achieve a high PL QY value and a narrow emission profile. The existence of the PL bright point and the sensitive temporal variation of the PL QY during the growth of semiconductor nanocrystals can explain the unpredictable nature and poor reproducibility of the PL properties of the as-prepared semiconductor nanocrystals observed previously. Furthermore, the knowledge gained in this study enabled us to reproducibly synthesize highly luminescent CdSe nanocrystals through a relatively simple and safe synthetic scheme. In a traditionally weak emission window for CdSe nanocrystals, the orange-red optical window, the PL QY of the as-prepared CdSe nanocrystals reached as high as 85% at room temperature, and the full width at half-maximum of the corresponding PL peak was as narrow as 23 nm, about 65-80 meV depending on the emitting position. The PL properties of the as-prepared CdSe nanocrystals are stable upon aging for at least several months. These as-prepared nanocrystals represent a series of best emitters that are highly efficient, highly pure in emission color, stable, and continuously tunable by simply varying the size of the nanocrystals.					peng, xiaogang/R-6184-2016	Peng, Xiaogang/0000-0002-5606-8472													0002-7863					MAR 6	2002	124	9					2049	2055		10.1021/ja017002j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja017002j								11866620					WOS:000174191400043

This association is characterized by tight, uniform association of the polymers with the sides of the nanotubes. A general thermodynamic drive for this wrapping is discussed, wherein the polymer disrupts both the hydrophobic interface with water and the smooth tube-tube interactions in aggregates. The nanotubes can be unwrapped by changing the solvent system. This solubilization process opens the door to solution chemistry on pristine nanotubes, as well as their introduction into biologically relevant systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Together, these two catalyst systems cover a broad spectrum of commonly encountered substrates for Suzuki couplings. Furthermore, they display novel reactivity patterns, such as the selective cross-coupling by Pd-2(dba)(3)/P(t-Bu)(3) of an aryl chloride in preference to an aryl triflate, and they can be used at low lending, even for reactions of aryl chlorides. Preliminary mechanistic work indicates that a palladium monophosphine complex is the active catalyst in the cross-coupling of aryl halides.																			0002-7863					MAY 3	2000	122	17					4020	4028		10.1021/ja0002058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja0002058													WOS:000086950500005
J	Dreuw, A; Head-Gordon, M				Dreuw, A; Head-Gordon, M			Failure of time-dependent density functional theory for long-range charge-transfer excited states: The zincbacteriochlorin-bacterlochlorin and bacteriochlorophyll-spheroidene complexes	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												It is well-known that time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) yields substantial errors for the excitation energies of charge-transfer (CT) excited states, when approximate standard exchange-correlation (xc) functionals are used, for example, SVWN, BLYP, or B3LYP. Also, the correct 1/R asymptotic behavior of CT states with respect to a distance coordinate R between the separated charges of the CT state is not reproduced by TDDFT employing these xc-functionals. Here, we demonstrate by analysis of the TDDFT equations that the first failure is due to the self-interaction error in the orbital energies from the ground-state DFT calculation, while the latter is a similar self-interaction error in TDDFT arising through the electron transfer in the CT state. Possible correction schemes, such as inclusion of exact Hartree-Fock or exact Kohn-Sham exchange, as well as aspects of the exact xc-functional are discussed in this context. Furthermore, a practical approach is proposed which combines the benefits of TDDFT and configuration interaction singles (CIS) and which does not suffer from electron-transfer self-interaction. The latter approach is applied to a (1,4)-phenylene-linked zincbacteriochlorin-bacteriochlorin complex and to a bacteriochlorophyll-spheroidene complex, in which CT states may play important roles in energy and electron-transfer processes. The errors of TDDFT alone for the CT states are demonstrated, and reasonable estimates for the true excitation energies of these states are given.

A Bismuth-Halide Double Perovskite with Long Carrier Recombination Lifetime for Photovoltaic Applications	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Despite the remarkable rise in efficiencies of solar cells containing the lead-halide perovskite absorbers RPbX3 (R = organic cation; X = Br- or I-) the toxicity of lead remains a concern for the large-scale implementation of this technology. This has spurred the search for lead-free materials with similar optoelectronic properties. Here, we use the double-perovskite structure to incorporate nontoxic Bi3+ into the perovskite lattice in Cs2AgBiBr6 (1). The solid shows a long room-temperature fundamental photoluminescence (PL) lifetime of ca. 660 ns, which is very encouraging for photovoltaic applications. Comparison between single-crystal and powder PL decay curves of 1 suggests inherently high defect tolerance. The material has an indirect bandgap of 1.95 eV, suited for a tandem solar cell. Furthermore, 1 is significantly more heat and moisture stable compared to (MA)PbI3. The extremely promising optical and physical properties of 1 shown here motivate further exploration of both inorganic and hybrid halide double perovskites for photovoltaics and other optoelectronics.

GO has been largely viewed as hydrophilic, presumably due to its excellent colloidal stability in water. Here we report that GO is an amphiphile with hydrophilic edges and a more hydrophobic basal plane. GO can act like a surfactant, as measured by its ability to adsorb on interfaces and lower the surface or interfacial tension. Since the degree of ionization of the edge COOH groups is affected by pH, GO's amphiphilicity can be tuned by pH. In addition, size-dependent amphiphilicity of GO sheets is observed. Since each GO sheet is a single molecule as well as a colloidal particle, the molecule colloid duality makes it behave like both a molecular and a colloidal surfactant. For example, GO is capable of creating highly stable Pickering emulsions of organic solvents like solid particles. It can also act as a molecular dispersing agent to process insoluble materials such as graphite and carbon nanotubes in water. The ease of its conversion to chemically modified graphene could enable new opportunities in solution processing of functional materials.

Accurate and efficient algorithm for Bader charge integration	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												We propose an efficient, accurate method to integrate the basins of attraction of a smooth function defined on a general discrete grid and apply it to the Bader charge partitioning for the electron charge density. Starting with the evolution of trajectories in space following the gradient of charge density, we derive an expression for the fraction of space neighboring each grid point that flows to its neighbors. This serves as the basis to compute the fraction of each grid volume that belongs to a basin (Bader volume) and as a weight for the discrete integration of functions over the Bader volume. Compared with other grid-based algorithms, our approach is robust, more computationally efficient with linear computational effort, accurate, and has quadratic convergence. Moreover, it is straightforward to extend to nonuniform grids, such as from a mesh-refinement approach, and can be used to both identify basins of attraction of fixed points and integrate functions over the basins.

In most cases, specialized applications require incorporation of functional chemical groups. This work is a systematic investigation of the effect that simple substituents attached to the aromatic linker have on the stability and property to the parent MOF. A family of isoreticular MOFs, based on the UiO-66 structure was obtained from the three different linker ligands H2N-H2BDC, O2N-H2BDC, and Br-H2BDC. The physicochemical and chemical investigation of these materials demonstrate that this class of MOFs retains high thermal and chemical stabilities, even with functional groups present at the linker units. The results demonstrate the possibility of incorporating active functional groups into the UiO-66 structure almost without losing its exceptionally high thermal and chemical stability. It has been established that the functional groups, at least in the amino functionalized UiO-66 sample, are chemically available as evidenced by the H/D exchange experiment, making the tagged UiO series MOFs very interesting for further studies within the field of catalysis.

Enzymatic hydrolysis combined with mechanical shearing and high-pressure homogenization for nanoscale cellulose fibrils and strong gels	BIOMACROMOLECULES												Toward exploiting the attractive mechanical properties of cellulose I nanoelements, a novel route is demonstrated, which combines enzymatic hydrolysis and mechanical shearing. Previously, an aggressive acid hydrolysis and sonication of cellulose I containing fibers was shown to lead to a network of weakly hydrogen-bonded rodlike cellulose elements typically with a low aspect ratio. On the other hand, high mechanical shearing resulted in longer and entangled nanoscale cellulose elements leading to stronger networks and gels. Nevertheless, a widespread use of the latter concept has been hindered because of lack of feasible methods of preparation, suggesting a combination of mild hydrolysis and shearing to disintegrate cellulose I containing fibers into high aspect ratio cellulose I nanoscale elements. In this work, mild enzymatic hydrolysis has been introduced and combined with mechanical shearing and a high-pressure homogenization, leading to a controlled fibrillation down to nanoscale and a network of long and highly entangled cellulose I elements. The resulting strong aqueous gels exhibit more than 5 orders of magnitude tunable storage modulus G' upon changing the concentration. Cryotransmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) C-13 NMR suggest that the cellulose I structural elements obtained are dominated by two fractions, one with lateral dimension of 5-6 nm and one with lateral dimensions of about 10-20 nm. The thicker diameter regions may act as the junction zones for the networks. The resulting material will herein be referred to as MFC (microfibrillated cellulose). Dynamical rheology showed that the aqueous suspensions behaved as gels in the whole investigated concentration range 0.125-5.9% w/w, G' ranging from 1.5 Pa to 10(5) Pa. The maximum G' was high, about 2 orders of magnitude larger than typically observed for the corresponding nonentangled low aspect ratio cellulose I gels, and G' scales with concentration with the power of approximately three.

Herein, we developed a new highly active Fe-N-C ORR catalyst containing Fe-N-x coordination sites and Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals (Fe@C-FeNC), and revealed the origin of its activity by intensively investigating the composition and the structure of the catalyst and their correlations with the electrochemical performance. The detailed analyses unambiguously confirmed the coexistence of Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals and Fe-N-x in the best catalyst. A series of designed experiments disclosed that (1) N-doped carbon substrate, Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals or Fe-N-x themselves did not deliver the high activity; (2) the catalysts with both Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals and Fe-N-x exhibited the high activity; (3) the higher content of Fe-N-x gave the higher activity; (4) the removal of Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals severely degraded the activity; (5) the blocking of Fe-N-x downgraded the activity and the recovery of the blocked Fe-N-x recovered the activity. These facts supported that the high ORR activity of the Fe@C-FeNC electrocatalysts should be ascribed to that Fe/Fe3C nanocrystals boost the activity of Fe-N-x. The coexistence of high content of Fe-N-x and sufficient metallic iron nanoparticles is essential for the high ORR activity. DFT calculation corroborated this conclusion by indicating that the interaction between metallic iron and Fe-N-4 coordination structure favored the adsorption of oxygen molecule. These new findings open an avenue for the rational design and bottom-up synthesis of low-cost highly active ORR electrocatalysts.

Structure-based computational methods for drug discovery mainly involve ligand-protein docking and rapid binding free energy estimation, both of which require force field parameterization for many drug candidates. Here, we present a fast force field generation tool, called SwissParam, able to generate, for arbitrary small organic molecule, topologies, and parameters based on the Merck molecular force field, but in a functional form that is compatible with the CHARMM force field. Output files can be used with CHARMM or GROMACS. The topologies and parameters generated by SwissParam are used by the docking software EADock2 and EADock DSS to describe the small molecules to be docked, whereas the protein is described by the CHARMM force field, and allow them to reach success rates ranging from 56 to 78%. We have also developed a rapid binding free energy estimation approach, using SwissParam for ligands and CHARMM22/27 for proteins, which requires only a short minimization to reproduce the experimental binding free energy of 214 ligand-protein complexes involving 62 different proteins, with a standard error of 2.0 kcal mol(-1), and a correlation coefficient of 0.74. Together, these results demonstrate the relevance of using SwissParam topologies and parameters to describe small organic molecules in computer-aided drug design applications, together with a CHARMM22/27 description of the target protein.

Both MIL-53(Cr) and MIL-53(Fe) solids adsorb around 20 wt% of lbuprofen (lbuprofen/dehydrated MIL-53 molar ratio = 0.22(1)), indicating that the amount of inserted drug does not depend on the metal (Cr, Fe) constitutive of the hybrid framework. Structural and spectroscopic characterizations are provided for the solid filled with lbuprofen. In each case, the very slow and complete delivery of lbuprofen was achieved under physiological conditions after 3 weeks with a predictable zero-order kinetics, which highlights the unique properties of flexible hybrid solids for adapting their pore opening to optimize the drug-matrix interactions.

An experimental method has been developed that begins with the detection and characterization of isolated nanoparticles in the optical far field. The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors. These multicolor colloids could be used as biological labels, surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, or near field optical microscopy sources covering the full range of wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

M.; Shao-Horn, Yang			Activating lattice oxygen redox reactions in metal oxides to catalyse oxygen evolution	NATURE CHEMISTRY												Understanding how materials that catalyse the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) function is essential for the development of efficient energy-storage technologies. The traditional understanding of the OER mechanism on metal oxides involves four concerted proton-electron transfer steps on metal-ion centres at their surface and product oxygen molecules derived from water. Here, using in situ O-18 isotope labelling mass spectrometry, we provide direct experimental evidence that the O-2 generated during the OER on some highly active oxides can come from lattice oxygen. The oxides capable of lattice-oxygen oxidation also exhibit pH-dependent OER activity on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale, indicating non-concerted proton-electron transfers in the OER mechanism. Based on our experimental data and density functional theory calculations, we discuss mechanisms that are fundamentally different from the conventional scheme and show that increasing the covalency of metal-oxygen bonds is critical to trigger lattice-oxygen oxidation and enable non-concerted proton-electron transfers during OER.

As-prepared MoS2/G was then fabricated into layered MoS2/G composites after annealing in a H-2/N-2 atmosphere at 800 degrees C for 2 h. The samples were systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical performances were evaluated In two-electrode cells versus metallic lithium. It Is demonstrated that the obtained MoS2/G composites show three-dimensional architecture and excellent electrochemical performances as anode materials for U-ion batteries. The MoS2/G composite with a Mo:C molar ratio of 1:2 exhibits the highest specific capacity of similar to 1100 mAh/g at a current of 100 mA/g, as well as excellent cycling stability and high-rate capability. The superior electrochemical performances of MoS2/G composites as U-Ion battery anodes are attributed to their robust composite structure and the synergistic effects between layered MoS2 and graphene.

J	Sevilla, M; Fuertes, AB				Sevilla, M.; Fuertes, A. B.			The production of carbon materials by hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose	CARBON												Highly functionalized carbonaceous materials were produced by means of the hydrothermal carbonization of cellulose at temperatures in the 220-250 degrees C range. The formation of this material follows essentially the path of a dehydration process, similar to that previously observed for the hydrothermal transformation of saccharides such as glucose, sucrose or starch. The materials so formed are composed of agglomerates of carbonaceous microspheres (size similar to 2-5 mu m), as evidenced by SEM. The combination of the results of the elemental analysis with that obtained by different spectroscopic techniques (infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and XPS) has allowed us to inferred that, from a chemical point of view, the solid product consists of small clusters of condensed benzene rings that form stable groups with oxygen in the core (i.e. ether, quinone, pyrone), whereas the shell possesses more reactive/hydrophilic oxygen functionalities (i.e. hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxylic, ester).

In large molecules and solids, however, calculating the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange is computationally expensive, especially for systems with metallic characteristics. In the present work, we develop a new hybrid density functional based on a screened Coulomb potential for the exchange interaction which circumvents this bottleneck. The results obtained for structural and thermodynamic properties of molecules are comparable in quality to the most widely used hybrid functionals. In addition, we present results of periodic boundary condition calculations for both semiconducting and metallic single wall carbon nanotubes. Using a screened Coulomb potential for Hartree-Fock exchange enables fast and accurate hybrid calculations, even of usually difficult metallic systems. The high accuracy of the new screened Coulomb potential hybrid, combined with its computational advantages, makes it widely applicable to large molecules and periodic systems.

New metallurgical processing might offer the possibility of overcoming this. Here we report that austenitic 316L stainless steels additively manufactured via a laser powder-bed-fusion technique exhibit a combination of yield strength and tensile ductility that surpasses that of conventional 316L steels. High strength is attributed to solidification-enabled cellular structures, low-angle grain boundaries, and dislocations formed during manufacturing, while high uniform elongation correlates to a steady and progressive work-hardening mechanism regulated by a hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure, with length scales spanning nearly six orders of magnitude. In addition, solute segregation along cellular walls and low-angle grain boundaries can enhance dislocation pinning and promote twinning. This work demonstrates the potential of additive manufacturing to create alloys with unique microstructures and high performance for structural applications.

The sensor responses are linear for concentrations of sub ppm to hundreds of ppm with detection limits of 44 ppb for NO2 and 262 ppb for nitrotoluene. The time is on the order of seconds for the detection response and minutes for the recovery. The variation of the sensitivity is less than 6% for all of the tested devices, comparable with commercial metal oxide or polymer microfilm sensors while retaining the room-temperature high sensitivity of the SWNT transistor sensors and manufacturability of the commercial sensors. The extended detection capability from gas to organic vapors is attributed to direct charge transfer on individual semiconducting SWNT conductivity with additional electron hopping effects on intertube conductivity through physically adsorbed molecules between SWNTs.					, M.MUTHUKUMAR/KXR-7435-2024	, M.MUTHUKUMAR/0000-0002-5249-2970													1530-6984					JUL	2003	3	7					929	933		10.1021/nl034220x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nl034220x													WOS:000184107300012

J	Burdick, JA; Prestwich, GD				Burdick, Jason A.; Prestwich, Glenn D.			Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogels for Biomedical Applications	ADVANCED MATERIALS												Hyaluronic acid (HA), an immunoneutral polysaccharide that is ubiquitous in the human body, is crucial for many cellular and tissue functions and has been in clinical use for over thirty years. When chemically modified, HA can be transformed into many physical forms-viscoelastic solutions, soft or stiff hydrogels, electrospun fibers, non-woven meshes, macroporous and fibrillar sponges, flexible sheets, and nanoparticulate fluids-for use in a range of preclinical and clinical settings. Many of these forms are derived from the chemical crosslinking of pendant reactive groups by addition/condensation chemistry or by radical polymerization. Clinical products for cell therapy and regenerative medicine require crosslinking chemistry that is compatible with the encapsulation of cells and injection into tissues. Moreover, an injectable clinical biomaterial must meet marketing, regulatory, and financial constraints to provide affordable products that can be approved, deployed to the clinic, and used by physicians.

Structural evolution during the reduction of chemically derived graphene oxide	NATURE CHEMISTRY												The excellent electrical, optical and mechanical properties of graphene have driven the search to find methods for its large-scale production, but established procedures (such as mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapour deposition) are not ideal for the manufacture of processable graphene sheets. An alternative method is the reduction of graphene oxide, a material that shares the same atomically thin structural framework as graphene, but bears oxygen-containing functional groups. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the atomistic structure of progressively reduced graphene oxide. The chemical changes of oxygen-containing functional groups on the annealing of graphene oxide are elucidated and the simulations reveal the formation of highly stable carbonyl and ether groups that hinder its complete reduction to graphene. The calculations are supported by infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Finally, more effective reduction treatments to improve the reduction of graphene oxide are proposed.

ACS NANO												The nanocomposites of TiO2-graphene (TiO2-GR) have been prepared via a facile hydrothermal reaction of graphene oxide and TiO2 in an ethanol-water solvent. We show that such a TiO2-GR nanocomposite exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity and stability than bare TiO2 toward the gas-phase degradation of benzene, a volatile aromatic pollutant in air. By investigating the effect of different addition ratios of graphene on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-GR systematically, we find that the higher weight ratio in TiO2-GR will decrease the photocatalytic activity. Analogous phenomenon is also observed for the liquid-phase degradation of dyes over TiO2-GR. In addition, the key features for TiO2-GR including enhancement of adsorptivity of pollutants, light absorption intensity, electron-hole pairs lifetime, and extended light absorption range have also been found in the composite of TiO2 and carbon nanotubes (TiO2-CNT). These strongly manifest that TiO2-GR is in essence the same as other TiO2-carbon (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and activated carbon) composite materials on enhancement of photocatalytic activity of TiO2, although graphene by itself has unique structural and electronic properties. Notably, this key fundamental question remains completely unaddressed in a recent report (ACS Nano 2010, 4, 380) regarding liquid-phase degradation of dyes over the TiO2-GR photocatalyst. Thus, we propose that TiO2-GR cannot provide truly new insights into the fabrication of TiO2-carbon composite as high-performance photocatalysts. It is hoped that our work could avert the misleading message to the readership, hence offering a valuable source of reference on fabricating TiO2-carbon composites for their application as a photocatalyst in the environment cleanup.

A remarkable and useful property of these materials is that they support unidirectional spin-polarized propagation at their surfaces. Unfortunately topological insulators are rare among solid-state materials. Using suitably designed electromagnetic media (metamaterials) we theoretically demonstrate a photonic analogue of a topological insulator. We show that metacrystals-superlattices of metamaterials with judiciously designed properties-provide a platform for designing topologically non-trivial photonic states, similar to those that have been identified for condensed-matter topological insulators. The interfaces of the metacrystals support helical edge states that exhibit spin-polarized one-way propagation of photons, robust against disorder. Our results demonstrate the possibility of attaining one-way photon transport without application of external magnetic fields or breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Such spin-polarized one-way transport enables exotic spin-cloaked photon sources that do not obscure each other.

Nanoparticle Size and Surface Chemistry Determine Serum Protein Adsorption and Macrophage Uptake	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Delivery and toxicity are critical issues facing nanomedicine research. Currently, there is limited understanding and connection between the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial and its interactions with a physiological system. As a result, it remains unclear how to optimally synthesize and chemically modify nanomaterials for in vivo applications. It has been suggested that the physicochemical properties of a nanomaterial after synthesis, known as its "synthetic identity", are not what a cell encounters in vivo. Adsorption of blood components and interactions with phagocytes can modify the size, aggregation state, and interfacial composition of a nanomaterial, giving it a distinct "biological identity". Here, we investigate the role of size and surface chemistry in mediating serum protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and their subsequent uptake by macrophages. Using label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we find that over 70 different serum proteins are heterogeneously adsorbed to the surface of gold nanoparticles. The relative density of each of these adsorbed proteins depends on nanoparticle size and poly(ethylene glycol) grafting density. Variations in serum protein adsorption correlate with differences in the mechanism and efficiency of nanoparticle uptake by a macrophage cell line. Macrophages contribute to the poor efficiency of nanomaterial delivery into diseased tissues, redistribution of nanomaterials within the body, and potential toxicity. This study establishes principles for the rational design of clinically useful nanomaterials.

Photodegradation of Rhodamine B and Methyl Orange over Boron-Doped g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> under Visible Light Irradiation	LANGMUIR												Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and boron-doped g-C3N4 Were prepared by heating melamine and the mixture of melamine and boron oxide, respectively. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-vis spectra were used to describe the properties of as-prepared samples, The electron paramagnetic resonance was used to detect the active species for the photodegradation reaction over g-C3N4. The photodegradation mechanisms for two typical dyes, rhodamine B (Rh B) and methyl orange (MO), are proposed based on our comparison experiments. In the g-C3N4 photocatalysis system, the photodegradation of Rh B and MO is attributed to the direct hole oxidation and overall reaction, respectively; however, for the MO photodegradation the reduction process initiated by photogenerated electrons is a major photocatalytic process compared with the oxidation process induced by photogenerated holes. Boron doping for g-C3N4 can promote photodegradation of Rh B because the boron doping improves the dye adsorption and light absorption of catalyst.					李, 朝升/J-4034-2016; zhang, jingxing/KCY-4726-2024; Zou, Zhigang/AFG-8475-2022	Yan, Shicheng/0000-0002-3432-9117													0743-7463					MAR 16	2010	26	6					3894	3901		10.1021/la904023j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la904023j								20175583					WOS:000275226700024

Rational design and synthesis of SACs are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report a general approach to a series of monodispersed atomic transition metals (for example, Fe, Co, Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene with a common MN4C4 moiety, identified by systematic X-ray absorption fine structure analyses and direct transmission electron microscopy imaging. The unambiguous structure determination allows density functional theoretical prediction of MN4C4 moieties as efficient oxygen evolution catalysts with activities following the trend Ni > Co > Fe, which is confirmed by electrochemical measurements. Determination of atomistic structure and its correlation with catalytic properties represents a critical step towards the rational design and synthesis of precious or nonprecious SACs with exceptional atom utilization efficiency and catalytic activities.

According to the TEM analysis, the graphene nanosheets are homogeneously distributed between the loosely packed SnO2 nanoparticles in such a way that the nanoporous structure with a large amount of void spaces could be prepared. The obtained SnO/GNS exhibits a reversible capacity of 810 mAh/g; furthermore, its cycling performance is drastically enhanced in comparison with that of the bare SnO2 nanoparticle. After 30 cycles, the charge capacity of SnO2/GNS still remained 570 mAh/g, that is, about 70% retention of the reversible capacity, while the specific capacity of the bare SnO2 nanoparticle on the first charge was 550 mAh/g, dropping rapidly to 60 mAh/g only after 15 cycles. The dimensional confinement of tin oxide nanoparticles by the surrounding GNS limits the volume expansion upon lithium insertion, and the developed pores between SnO2 and GNS could be used as buffered spaces during charge/discharge, resulting in the superior cyclic performances.

Variation of alkyl chain length in imidazolium cation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												The alkyl chain length of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide ([Rmim][(CF3-SO2)(2)N], R = methyl (m), ethyl (e), butyl (b), hexyl (C-6), and octyl (C-8)) was varied to prepare a series of room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), and the thermal behavior, density, viscosity, self-diffusion coefficients of the cation and anion, and ionic conductivity were measured over a wide temperature range. The self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, ionic conductivity, and molar conductivity change with temperature following the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation, and the density shows a linear decrease. The pulsed-field-gradient spin-echo NMR method reveals a higher self-diffusion coefficient for the cation compared to that for the anion over a wide temperature range, even if the cationic radius is larger than that of the anion. The summation of the cationic and anionic diffusion coefficients for the RTILs follows the order [emim][(CF3SO2)(2)N] > [mmim][(CF3SO2)(2)N] > [bmim][(CF3SO2)(2)N] > [C(6)mim][(CF3SO2)(2)N] > [C(8)mim][(CF3SO2)(2)N], which greatly contrasts to the viscosity data. The ratio of molar conductivity obtained from impedance measurements to that calculated by the ionic diffusivity using the Nernst-Einstein equation quantifies the active ions contributing to ionic conduction in the diffusion components, in other words, ionicity of the ionic liquids. The ratio decreases with increasing number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. Finally, a balance between the electrostatic and induction forces has been discussed in terms of the main contribution factor in determining the physicochemical properties.

We studied the stimuli-responsive release profiles of vancomycin- and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-loaded MSN delivery systems by using disulfide bond-reducing molecules, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and mercaptoethanol (ME), as release triggers. The biocompatibility and delivery efficiency of the MSN system with neuroglial cells (astrocytes) in vitro were demonstrated. In contrast to many current delivery systems, the molecules of interest were encapsulated inside the porous framework of the MSN not by adsorption or sol-gel types of entrapment but by capping the openings of the mesoporous channels with size-defined CdS nanoparticles to physically block the drugs/ neurotransmitters of certain sizes from leaching out. We envision that this new MSN system could play a significant role in developing new generations of site-selective, control led-release delivery nanodevices.

Routine Microsecond Molecular Dynamics Simulations with AMBER on GPUs. 1. Generalized Born	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION												We present an implementation of generalized Born implicit solvent all-atom classical molecular dynamics (MD) within the AMBER program package that runs entirely on CUDA enabled NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs). We discuss the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers.

However, a large hurdle is the manufacture of large-area highly stretchable electrical wirings with high conductivity. Here, we describe the manufacture of printable elastic conductors comprising single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) uniformly dispersed in a fluorinated rubber. Using an ionic liquid and jet-milling, we produce long and fine SWNT bundles that can form well-developed conducting networks in the rubber. Conductivity of more than 100 S cm(-1) and stretchability of more than 100% are obtained. Making full use of this extraordinary conductivity, we constructed a rubber-like stretchable active-matrix display comprising integrated printed elastic conductors, organic transistors and organic light-emitting diodes. The display could be stretched by 30-50% and spread over a hemisphere without any mechanical or electrical damage.

The photocatalytic activity of NiO-loaded NaTaO3 doped with lanthanum was 9 times higher than that of nondoped NiO-loaded NaTaO3. The maximum apparent quantum yield of the NiO/NaTaO3:La photocatalyst was 56% at 270 nm. The factors affecting the highly efficient photocatalytic water splitting were examined by using various characterization techniques. Electron microscope observations revealed that the particle sizes of NaTaO3:La crystals (0.1-0.7 mum) were smaller than that of the nondoped NaTaO3 crystal (2-3 mum) and that the ordered surface nanostructure with many characteristic steps was created by the lanthanum doping. The small particle size with a high crystallinity was advantageous to an increase in the probability of the reaction of photogenerated electrons and holes with water molecules toward the recombination. Transmission electron microscope observations and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses indicated that NO cocatalysts were loaded on the edge of the nanostep structure of NaTaO3:La photocatalysts as ultrafine particles. The H-2 evolution proceeded on the ultrafine NiO particles loaded on the edge while the O-2 evolution occurred at the groove of the nanostep structure. Thus, the reaction sites for H-2 evolution were separated from those of O-2 evolution over the ordered nanostep structure. The small particle size and the ordered surface nanostep structure of the NiO/NaTaO3:La photocatalyst powder contributed to the highly efficient water splitting into H-2 and O-2.

Dramatic tuning of carbon dioxide uptake via metal substitution in a coordination polymer with cylindrical pores	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												A series of four isostructural microporous coordination polymers (MCPs) differing in metal composition is demonstrated to exhibit exceptional uptake of CO(2) at low pressures and ambient temperature.

J	Dabrowski, A				Dabrowski, A			Adsorption - from theory to practice	ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE					AJ-SCP99 Conference	MAY 24-27, 1999	BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA					Adsorption at various interfaces has concerned scientists since the beginning of this century. This phenomenon underlies a number of extremely important processes of utilitarian significance. The technological, environmental and biological importance of adsorption can never be in doubt. Its practical applications in industry and environmental protection are of paramount importance. The adsorption of substrates is the first stage in many catalytic processes. The methods for separation of mixtures on a laboratory and on an industrial scale are increasingly based on utilising the change in concentration of components at the interface. Moreover, such vital problems as purification of water, sewages, air and soil are involved here too. On the other hand, many areas in which technological innovation has covered adsorption phenomena have been expanded more through art and craft than through science. A basic understanding of the scientific principles is far behind; in part because the study of interfaces requires extremely careful experimentation if meaningful and reproducible results are to be obtained. In recent years, however, considerable effort has been increasingly directed toward closing the gap between theory and practice. Crucial progress in theoretical description of the adsorption has been achieved, mainly through the development of new theoretical approaches formulated on a molecular level, by means of computer simulation methods and owing to new techniques which examine surface layers or interfacial regions. Moreover, during the last 15 years new classes of solid adsorbents have been developed, such as activated carbon fibres and carbon molecular sieves, fullerenes and heterofullerenes, microporous glasses and nanoporous - both carbonaceous and inorganic - materials. Nanostructured solids are very popular in science and technology and have gained extreme interest due to their sorption, catalytic, magnetic, optical and thermal properties. Although the development of adsorption up to the 1918s has been following rather a zig-zag path, this arm of surface science is now generally considered to have become a well-defined branch of physical science representing an intrinsically interdisciplinary area between chemistry, physics, biology and engineering. This review presents in brief the history of adsorption and, highlights the progress in theoretical description of the phenomenon under consideration. The paper deals with the above problems critically, showing the development of adsorption, presenting some of the latest important results and giving a source of up-to-date literature on it. Moreover, in this paper the most important aspects are overviewed referring to today's trends and visions in application of adsorption science in industry, environmental protection and in environmental analysis. The relationship between development of adsorption theory and adsorption practice is pointed out. Current understanding and perspectives pertaining to applications of adsorption phenomena on laboratory and on industrial scale as well as environmental protection are discussed and illustrated by means of a few spectacular examples.

Here we report the application of nonstoichiometric ZnMn2O4/carbon composite as a new Zn-insertion cathode material in aqueous Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. In 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)(2) solution that enables similar to 100% Zn plating/stripping efficiency with long-term stability and suppresses Mn dissolution, the spinel/carbon hybrid exhibits a reversible capacity of 150 mAh g(-1) and a capacity retention of 94% over 500 cycles at a high rate of 500 mA g(-1). The remarkable electrode performance results from the facile charge transfer and Zn insertion in the structurally robust spinel featuring small particle size and abundant cation vacancies, as evidenced by combined electrochemical measurements, XRD, Raman, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, FTIR, and NMR analysis. The results would enlighten and promote the use of cation-defective spinel compounds and trifluoromethanesulfonic electrolyte to develop high-performance rechargeable zinc batteries.

The residual oxygen content and structure of GO are monitored and these chemical and structural characteristics are correlated to electronic properties of the thin films at various stages of reduction. It is found that the electrical characteristics of reduced GO do not approach those of intrinsic graphene obtained by mechanical cleaving because the material remains significantly oxidized. The residual oxygen forms sp(3) bonds with carbon atoms in the basal plane such that the carbon sp(2) bonding fraction in fully reduced GO is similar to 0.80. The minority sp(3) bonds disrupt the transport of carriers delocalized in the sp(2) network, limiting the mobility, and conductivity of reduced GO thin films. Extrapolation of electric conductivity data as a function of oxygen content reveals that complete removal of oxygen should lead to properties that are comparable to graphene.

Here, we have investigated upconversion processes in a broad range of gadolinium-based nanoparticles of varying composition. We show that by rational design of a core-shell structure with a set of lanthanide ions incorporated into separated layers at precisely defined concentrations, efficient upconversion emission can be realized through gadolinium sublattice-mediated energy migration for a wide range of lanthanide activators without long-lived intermediary energy states. Furthermore, the use of the core-shell structure allows the elimination of deleterious cross-relaxation. This effect enables fine-tuning of upconversion emission through trapping of the migrating energy by the activators. Indeed, the findings described here suggest a general approach to constructing a new class of luminescent materials with tunable upconversion emissions by controlled manipulation of energy transfer within a nanoscopic region.

The semiconducting nature of MoS2 allows it to overcome the shortcomings of zero-bandgap graphene, while still sharing many of graphene's advantages for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Discrete electronic and optoelectronic components, such as field-effect transistors, sensors, and photodetectors made from few-layer MoS2 show promising performance as potential substitute of Si in conventional electronics and of organic and amorphous Si semiconductors in ubiquitous systems and display applications. An important next step is the fabrication of fully integrated multistage circuits and logic building blocks on MoS2 to demonstrate its capability for complex digital logic and high-frequency ac applications. This paper demonstrates an inverter, a NAND gate, a static random access memory, and a five-stage ring oscillator based on a direct-coupled transistor logic technology. The circuits comprise between 2 to 12 transistors seamlessly integrated side-by-side on a single sheet of bilayer MoS2. Both enhancement-mode and depletion-mode transistors were fabricated thanks to the use of gate metals with different work functions.

J	Stewart, JJP				Stewart, James J. P.			Optimization of parameters for semiempirical methods VI: more modifications to the NDDO approximations and re-optimization of parameters	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING												Modern semiempirical methods are of sufficient accuracy when used in the modeling of molecules of the same type as used as reference data in the parameterization. Outside that subset, however, there is an abundance of evidence that these methods are of very limited utility. In an attempt to expand the range of applicability, a new method called PM7 has been developed. PM7 was parameterized using experimental and high-level ab initio reference data, augmented by a new type of reference data intended to better define the structure of parameter space. The resulting method was tested by modeling crystal structures and heats of formation of solids. Two changes were made to the set of approximations: a modification was made to improve the description of noncovalent interactions, and two minor errors in the NDDO formalism were rectified. Average unsigned errors (AUEs) in geometry and Delta H (f) for PM7 were reduced relative to PM6; for simple gas-phase organic systems, the AUE in bond lengths decreased by about 5 % and the AUE in Delta H (f) decreased by about 10 %; for organic solids, the AUE in Delta H (f) dropped by 60 % and the reduction was 33.3 % for geometries. A two-step process (PM7-TS) for calculating the heights of activation barriers has been developed. Using PM7-TS, the AUE in the barrier heights for simple organic reactions was decreased from values of 12.6 kcal/mol(-1) in PM6 and 10.8 kcal/mol(-1) in PM7 to 3.8 kcal/mol(-1). The origins of the errors in NDDO methods have been examined, and were found to be attributable to inadequate and inaccurate reference data. This conclusion provides insight into how these methods can be improved.																			1610-2940	0948-5023				JAN	2013	19	1					1	32		10.1007/s00894-012-1667-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00894-012-1667-x								23187683					WOS:000313077100001

It is of both scientific curiosity and technical importance to know how these atomically thin sheets assemble. There are two fundamental geometries of interacting single layers: edge-to-edge and face-to-face. Such interactions were studied at the air-water interface by Langmuir-Blodgett assembly. Stable monolayers of graphite oxide single layers were obtained without the need for any surfactant or stabilizing agent, due to the strong electrostatic repulsion between the 2D confined layers. Such repulsion also prevented the single layers from overlapping during compression, leading to excellent reversibility of the monolayers. In contrast to molecular and hard colloidal particle monolayers, the single layers tend to fold and wrinkle at edges to resist collapsing into multilayers. The monolayers can be transferred to a substrate, readily creating a large area of flat graphite oxide single layers. The density of such films can be continuously tuned from dilute, close-packed to overpacked monolayers of interlocking single layers. For size-mismatched single layers, face-to-face interaction caused irreversible stacking, leading to double layers. The graphite oxide monolayers can be chemically reduced to graphene for electronic applications such as transparent conducting thin films.

The GQDs exhibits deep ultraviolet (DUV) emission of 4.1 eV, which is the shortest emission wavelength among all the solution-based QDs. The GQDs exhibit typical excitation wavelength-dependent properties as expected in carbon-based quantum dots. However, the emission wavelength is independent of the size of the GQDs. The unique optical properties of the GQDs are attributed to the self-passivated layer on the surface of the GQDs as revealed by electron energy loss spectroscopy. The photoluminescence quantum yields of the GQDs were determined to be 7-11%.

We compared the cellular effects of ambient ultrafine particles with manufactured titanium dioxide (TiO2), carbon black, fullerol, and polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs). The study was conducted in a phagocytic cell line ( RAW 264.7) that is representative of a lung target for NPs. Physicochemical characterization of the NPs showed a dramatic change in their state of aggregation, dispersibility, and charge during transfer from a buffered aqueous solution to cell culture medium. Particles differed with respect to cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under biotic and abiotic conditions. Spontaneous ROS production was compared by using an ROS quencher (furfuryl alcohol) as well as an NADPH peroxidase bioelectrode platform. Among the particles tested, ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) and cationic PS nanospheres were capable of inducing cellular ROS production, GSH depletion, and toxic oxidative stress. This toxicity involves mitochondrial injury through increased calcium uptake and structural organellar damage. Although active under abiotic conditions, TiO2 and fullerol did not induce toxic oxidative stress. While increased TNF-alpha production could be seen to accompany UFP-induced oxidant injury, cationic PS nanospheres induced mitochondrial damage and cell death without inflammation. In summary, we demonstrate that ROS generation and oxidative stress are a valid test paradigm to compare NP toxicity. Although not all materials have electronic configurations or surface properties to allow spontaneous ROS generation, particle interactions with cellular components are capable of generating oxidative stress.

Based on their established use in the laboratory and the chemical stability of Au, gold nanoparticles were expected to be safe. The recent literature, however, contains conflicting data regarding the cytotoxicity of gold nanoparticles. Against this background a systematic study of watersoluble gold nanoparticles stabilized by triphenylphosphine derivatives ranging in size from 0.8 to 15 nm is made. The cytotoxicity of these particles in four cell lines representing major functional cell types with barrier and phagocyte function are tested. Connective tissue fibroblasts, epithelial cells, macrophages, and melanoma cells prove most sensitive to gold particles 1.4 nm in size, which results in IC50 values ranging from 30 to 56,cm depending on the particular 1.4-nm Au compound-cell line combination. In contrast, gold particles 15 nm in size and Tauredon (gold thiomalate) are nontoxic at up to 60-fold and 100-fold higher concentrations, respectively. The cellular response is size dependent, in that 1.4-nm particles cause predominantly rapid cell death by necrosis within 12 h while closely related particles 1.2 nm in diameter effect predominantly programmed cell death by apoptosis.

J	Radisavljevic, B; Kis, A				Radisavljevic, Branimir; Kis, Andras			Mobility engineering and a metal-insulator transition in monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>	NATURE MATERIALS												Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a new class of materials with interesting physical properties and applications ranging from nanoelectronics to sensing and photonics. In addition to graphene, the most studied 2D material, monolayers of other layered materials such as semiconducting dichalcogenides MoS2 or WSe2 are gaining in importance as promising channel materials for field-effect transistors (FETs). The presence of a direct bandgap in monolayer MoS2 due to quantum-mechanical confinement allows room-temperature FETs with an on/off ratio exceeding 10(8). The presence of high-kappa dielectrics in these devices enhanced their mobility, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report on electrical transport measurements on MoS2 FETs in different dielectric configurations. The dependence of mobility on temperature shows clear evidence of the strong suppression of charged-impurity scattering in dual-gate devices with a top-gate dielectric. At the same time, phonon scattering shows a weaker than expected temperature dependence. High levels of doping achieved in dual-gate devices also allow the observation of a metal-insulator transition in monolayer MoS2 due to strong electron-electron interactions. Our work opens up the way to further improvements in 2D semiconductor performance and introduces MoS2 as an interesting system for studying correlation effects in mesoscopic systems.

J	Zhou, M; Zhai, YM; Dong, SJ				Zhou, Ming; Zhai, Yueming; Dong, Shaojun			Electrochemical Sensing and Biosensing Platform Based on Chemically Reduced Graphene Oxide	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												In this paper, the characterization and application of a chemically reduced graphene oxide modified glassy carbon (CR-GO/GC) electrode, a novel electrode system, for the preparation of electrochemical sensing and biosensing platform are proposed. Different kinds of important inorganic and organic electroactive compounds (i.e., probe molecule (potassium ferricyanide), free bases of DNA (guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T), and cytosine (C)), oxidase/dehydrogenase-related molecules (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2/beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)), neurotransmitters (dopamine (DA)), and other biological molecules (ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), and acetaminophen (APAP)) were employed to study their electrochemical responses at the CR-GO/GC electrode, which shows more favorable electron transfer kinetics than graphite modified glassy carbon (graphite/GC) and glassy carbon (GC) electrodes. The greatly enhanced electrochemical reactivity of the four free bases of DNA at the CR-GO/GC electrode compared with that at graphite/GC and GC electrodes makes the CR-GO/GC electrode a better choice for the electrochemical biosensing of four DNA bases in both the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at physiological pH without a prehydrolysis step. This allows us to detect a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site for short oligomers with a particular sequence at the CR-GO/GC electrode without any hybridization or labeling processes in this work, suggesting the potential applications of CR-GO in the label-free electrochemical detection of DNA hybridization or DNA damage for further research. Based on the greatly enhanced electrochemical reactivity of H2O2 and NADH at the CR-GO/GC electrode, CR-GO/GC electrode-based bioelectrodes (in connection with glucose oxidase (GOD) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)) show a better analytical performance for the detection of glucose and ethanol compared with graphite/GC- or GC-based bioelectrodes. By comparing the electrochemical performance of CR-GO with that of the conventional graphite and GC, we reveal that CR-GO with the nature of a single sheet showing favorable electrochemical activity should be a kind of more robust and advanced carbon electrode material which may hold great promise for electrochemical sensors and biosensors design.					, 董绍俊/P-5166-2019; Zhou, Ming/B-7451-2009	Zhou, Ming/0000-0003-2239-9342													0003-2700	1520-6882				JUL 15	2009	81	14					5603	5613		10.1021/ac900136z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac900136z								19522529					WOS:000268135000004

For such materials, quantum effects define their physical behaviour and open completely new (quantum) perspectives for applications. Carbon-based materials are particularly good examples, highlighted by the fascinating quantum properties of, for example, nanotubes(1) or graphene(2). Here, we demonstrate the synthesis and application of ultrapure isotopically controlled single-crystal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond with a remarkably low concentration of paramagnetic impurities. The content of nuclear spins associated with the C-13 isotope was depleted to 0.3% and the concentration of other paramagnetic defects was measured to be <10(13) cm(-3). Being placed in such a spin-free lattice, single electron spins show the longest room-temperature spin dephasing times ever observed in solid-state systems (T-2 = 1.8 ms). This benchmark will potentially allow observation of coherent coupling between spins separated by a few tens of nanometres, making it a versatile material for room-temperature quantum information processing devices. We also show that single electron spins in the same isotopically engineered CVD diamond can be used to detect external magnetic fields with a sensitivity reaching 4 nT Hz(-1/2) and subnanometre spatial resolution.

In addition, based on the new X functional of Xin and Goddard, again combined with B95 correlation functional, we developed two other new HMDFT methods, X1B95 and XB1K. MPW1B95 and X1B95 were optimized against a representative database of six atomization energies (AE6). MPWB1K and XB1K were optimized against a kinetics database of three forward barrier heights, three reverse barrier heights, and three energies of reaction for the reactions in the BH6 representative barrier height database. We compared the newly developed methods to other HMDFT and hybrid DFT methods for atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, barrier heights, saddle point geometries, hydrogen bonding, and weak van der Waals weak interactions. In addition, we optimized scaling factors for calculating zero-point energies from vibrational frequencies. The results show that the MPWB1K and XB1K methods give good results for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, hydrogen bonding, and weak interactions, and they give excellent saddle point geometries. MPW1B95 and X1B95 are suitable for general applications in thermochemistry, and they give good performance for hydrogen bonding and weak interaction calculations.

Paul			Localized surface plasmon resonances arising from free carriers in doped quantum dots	NATURE MATERIALS												Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) typically arise in nanostructures of noble metals(1,2) resulting in enhanced and geometrically tunable absorption and scattering resonances. LSPRs, however, are not limited to nanostructures of metals and can also be achieved in semiconductor nanocrystals with appreciable free carrier concentrations. Here, we describe well-defined LSPRs arising from p-type carriers in vacancy-doped semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Achievement of LSPRs by free carrier doping of a semiconductor nanocrystal would allow active on-chip control of LSPR responses. Plasmonic sensing and manipulation of solid-state processes in single nanocrystals constitutes another interesting possibility. We also demonstrate that doped semiconductor QDs allow realization of LSPRs and quantum-confined excitons within the same nanostructure, opening up the possibility of strong coupling of photonic and electronic modes, with implications for light harvesting, nonlinear optics, and quantum information processing.

The NGO is functionalized with sulfonic acid groups, which render it stable in physiological solution, followed by covalent binding of folic acid (FA) molecules to the NGO, thus allowing it to specifically target MCF-7 cells, human breast cancer cells with FA receptors. Furthermore, controlled loading of two anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CPT), onto the FA-conjugated NGO (FA-NGO) via pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions is investigated. It is demonstrated that FA-NGO loaded with the two anticancer drugs shows specific targeting to MCF-7 cells, and remarkably high cytotoxicity compared to NGO loaded with either DOX or CPT only. Considering that the combined use of two or more drugs, a widely adopted clinical practice, often displays much better therapeutic efficacy than that of a single drug, the controlled loading and targeted delivery of mixed anticancer drugs using these graphene-based nanocarriers may find widespread application in biomedicine.

Herein, using nitrogen-doped graphene produced by a simple plasma process, we developed ultracapacitors whose capacitances (similar to 280 F/g(electrode)) are about 4 times larger than those of pristine graphene based counterparts without sacrificing other essential and useful properties for ultracapacitor operations including excellent cycle life (>200000), high power capability, and compatibility with flexible substrates. While we were trying to understand the improved capacitance using scanning photoemission microscopy with a capability of probing local nitrogen-carbon bonding configurations within a single sheet of graphene, we observed interesting microscopic features of N-configurations: N-doped sites even at basal planes, distinctive distributions of N-configurations between edges and basal planes, and their distinctive evolutions with plasma duration. The local N-configuration mappings during plasma treatment, alongside binding energy calculated by density functional theory, revealed that the origin of the improved capacitance is a certain N-configuration at basal planes.

Control of the BHJ morphology by selective solubility of the fullerene component is demonstrated using these high boiling point processing additives. The best results are obtained with R = Iodine (1). Using 1,8-diiodooctane as the processing additive, the efficiency of the BHJ solar cells was improved from 3.4% (for the reference device) to 5.1 %.

J.; Castellanos-Gomez, Andres			Fast and Broadband Photoresponse of Few-Layer Black Phosphorus Field-Effect Transistors	NANO LETTERS												Few-layer black phosphorus, a new elemental two-dimensional (2D) material recently isolated by mechanical exfoliation, is a high-mobility layered semiconductor with a direct bandgap that is predicted to strongly depend on the number of layers, from 0.35 eV (bulk) to 2.0 eV (single layer). Therefore, black phosphorus is an appealing candidate for tunable photodetection from the visible to the infrared part of the spectrum. We study the photoresponse of field-effect transistors (FETs) made of few-layer black phosphorus (3-8 nm thick), as a function of excitation wavelength, power, and frequency. In the dark state, the black phosphorus FETs can be tuned both in hole and electron doping regimes allowing for ambipolar operation. We measure mobilities in the order of 100 cm(2)/V s and a current ON/OFF ratio larger than 10(3). Upon illumination, the black phosphorus transistors show a response to excitation wavelengths from the visible region up to 940 nm and a rise time of about 1 ms, demonstrating broadband and fast detection. The responsivity reaches 4.8 mA/W, and it could be drastically enhanced by engineering a detector based on a PN junction. The ambipolar behavior coupled to the fast and broadband photodetection make few-layer black phosphorus a promising 2D material for photodetection across the visible and near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

However, all 2D semiconductors reported thus far feature band gaps that are smaller than 2.0eV, which has greatly restricted their applications, especially in optoelectronic devices with photoresponse in the blue and UV range. Novel 2D mono-elemental semiconductors, namely monolayered arsenene and antimonene, with wide band gaps and high stability were now developed based on first-principles calculations. Interestingly, although As and Sb are typically semimetals in the bulk, they are transformed into indirect semiconductors with band gaps of 2.49 and 2.28eV when thinned to one atomic layer. Significantly, under small biaxial strain, these materials were transformed from indirect into direct band-gap semiconductors. Such dramatic changes in the electronic structure could pave the way for transistors with high on/off ratios, optoelectronic devices working under blue or UV light, and mechanical sensors based on new 2D crystals.

J	Starink, MJ				Starink, MJ			The determination of activation energy from linear heating rate experiments: a comparison of the accuracy of isoconversion methods	THERMOCHIMICA ACTA												Model-free isoconversion methods are the most reliable methods for the calculation of activation energies of thermally activated reactions. A large number of these isoconversion methods have been proposed in the literature. A classification of these methods is proposed. Type A methods such as Friedman methods make no mathematical approximations, and Type B methods, such as the generalised Kissinger equation, apply a range of approximations for the temperature integral. The accuracy of these methods is investigated, by deriving expressions for the main sources of error which includes the inaccuracy in reaction rate measurement, approximations for the temperature integral and inaccuracies in determination of temperature for equivalent fraction transformed. Both highly inaccurate and highly accurate Type B methods are identified. In cases where some uncertainty over baselines of the thermal analysis data exists or where accuracy of determination of transformation rates is limited, type B methods will often be more accurate than type A methods.

The antioxidant (AO) activity of polyphenols (PPs), as ferric-reducing power, was determined for the first time using a modified FRAP (ferric reducing/antioxidant power) assay. Reaction was followed for 30 min, and both Fe(II) standards and samples were dissolved in the same solvent to allow comparison. Selected representative PPs included flavonoids (quercetin, rutin, and catechin), resveratrol, tannic acid, and phenolic acids (gallic, caffeic, and ferulic). Carotenoids (beta-carotene and zeaxanthine), ascorbic acid, Trolox, and BHA were included for comparison. Equivalent concentration 1 (EC1), as the concentration of AO with a reducing effect equivalent to 1 mmol/L Fe(II), was used to compare AO efficiency. PPs had lower EC1 values, and therefore higher reducing power, than ascorbic acid and Trolox. Tannic acid and quercetin had the highest AO capacity followed by gallic and caffeic acids. Resveratrol showed the lowest reducing effect. Carotenoids had no ferric reducing ability. Polyphenol's AO efficiency seemed to depend on the extent of hydroxylation and conjugation.

Physical-Chemical Aspects of Protein Corona: Relevance to <i>in Vitro</i> and <i>in Vivo</i> Biological Impacts of Nanoparticles	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												It is now clearly emerging that besides size and shape, the other primary defining element of nanoscale objects in biological media is their long-lived protein ("hard") corona. This corona may be expressed as a durable, stabilizing coating of the bare surface of nanoparticle (NP) monomers, or it may be reflected in different subpopulations of particle assemblies, each presenting a durable protein coating. Using the approach and concepts of physical chemistry, we relate studies on the composition of the protein corona at different plasma concentrations with structural data on the complexes both in situ and free from excess plasma. This enables a high degree of confidence in the meaning of the hard protein corona in a biological context. Here, we present the protein adsorption for two compositionally different NPs, namely sulfonated polystyrene and silica NPs. NP-protein complexes are characterized by differential centrifugal sedimentation, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential both in situ and once isolated from plasma as a function of the protein/NP surface area ratio. We then introduce a semiquantitative determination of their hard corona composition using one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which allows us to follow the total binding isotherms for the particles, identifying simultaneously the nature and amount of the most relevant proteins as a function of the plasma concentration. We find that the hard corona can evolve quite significantly as one passes from protein concentrations appropriate to in vitro cell studies to those present in in vivo studies, which has deep implications for in vitro in vivo extrapolations and will require some consideration in the future.

It was found that even in cases where the surface films formed on lithium contain elastomers, or where the lithium metal reactivity is reduced by doping with elements such as N, As, Al, Mg, Ca, etc., it is impossible to achieve sufficient passivation with lithium electrodes and liquid solutions. Passivation is considerably worsened when Li electrodes are operated at high rates (especially at high charging, Li deposition rates). Thus, there is no way that rechargeable Li batteries can compete with Li-ion batteries in any application that requires high charging rates (e.g., in powering portable electronic devices). The electrochemical behavior of lithiated graphite electrodes also depends on passivation phenomena. The surface films formed on lithiated graphite are similar to those formed on Li metal in the same solutions. The volume changes of graphite electrodes during Li insertion-deinsertion are small enough to enable their reasonable passivation in a variety of electrolyte solutions. A critical factor that determines the stability of graphite electrodes is their morphology. It was found that the shape of graphite particles plays a key role in their application as active mass in anodes for Li-ion batteries. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The conventional refinement approach yielded accurate values of the Flack parameter, but with standard uncertainties ranging from 0.15 to 0.77. The other methods also yielded accurate values of the Flack parameter, but with much higher precision. Absolute structure was established in all cases, even for a hydrocarbon. The procedures in which restraints are coded explicitly in terms of other structural parameters enable the Flack parameter to correlate with these other parameters, so that it is determined along with those parameters during refinement.																				2052-5206				JUN	2013	69		3				249	259		10.1107/S2052519213010014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S2052519213010014								23719469					WOS:000319217700003

Demonstrating oxygen loss and associated structural reorganization in the lithium battery cathode Li[Ni<sub>0.2</sub>Li<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.6</sub>]O<sub>2</sub>	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												The cathode in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries operates by conventional intercalation; Li+ is extracted from LiCoO2 on charging accompanied by oxidation of Co3+ to Co4+; the process is reversed on discharge. In contrast, Li+ may be extracted from Mn4+-based solids, e. g., Li2MnO3, without oxidation of Mn4+. A mechanism involving simultaneous Li and O removal is often proposed. Here, we demonstrate directly, by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), that O-2 is evolved from such Mn4+-containing compounds, Li[Ni0.2Li0.2Mn0.6]O-2, on charging and using powder neutron diffraction show that O loss from the surface is accompanied by diffusion of transition metal ions from surface to bulk where they occupy vacancies created by Li removal. The composition of the compound moves toward MO2. Understanding such unconventional Li extraction is important because Li-Mn-Ni-O compounds, irrespective of whether they contain Co, can, after O loss, store 200 mAhg(-1) of charge compared with 140 mAhg(-1) for LiCoO2.

High Photoluminescence Efficiency and Optically Pumped Lasing in Solution-Processed Mixed Halide Perovskite Semiconductors	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS												The study of the photophysical properties of organic-metallic lead halide perovskites, which demonstrate excellent photovoltaic performance in devices with electron- and hole-accepting layers, helps to understand their charge photogeneration and recombination mechanism and unravels their potential for other optoelectronic applications. We report surprisingly high photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiencies, up to 70%, in these solution-processed crystalline films. We find that photoexcitation in the pristine CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite results in free charge carrier formation within 1 ps and that these free charge carriers undergo bimolecular recombination on time scales of 10s to 100s of ns. To exemplify the high luminescence yield of the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite, we construct and demonstrate the operation of an optically pumped vertical cavity laser comprising a layer of perovskite between a dielectric mirror and evaporated gold top mirrors. These long carrier lifetimes together with exceptionally high luminescence yield are unprecedented in such simply prepared inorganic semiconductors, and we note that these properties are ideally suited for photovoltaic diode operation.

Plasmonic nanorod metamaterials for biosensing	NATURE MATERIALS												Label-free plasmonic biosensors rely either on surface plasmon polaritons or on localized surface plasmons on continuous or nanostructured noble-metal surfaces to detect molecular-binding events(1-4). Despite undisputed advantages, including spectral tunability(3), strong enhancement of the local electric field(5,6) and much better adaptability to modern nanobiotechnology architectures(7), localized plasmons demonstrate orders of magnitude lower sensitivity compared with their guided counterparts(3). Here, we demonstrate an improvement in biosensing technology using a plasmonic metamaterial that is capable of supporting a guided mode in a porous nanorod layer. Benefiting from a substantial overlap between the probing field and the active biological substance incorporated between the nanorods and a strong plasmon-mediated energy confinement inside the layer, this metamaterial provides an enhanced sensitivity to refractive-index variations of the medium between the rods (more than 30,000nm per refractive-index unit).

J	Song, CS				Song, Chunshan			Global challenges and strategies for control, conversion and utilization of CO<sub>2</sub> for sustainable development involving energy, catalysis, adsorption and chemical processing	CATALYSIS TODAY					8th International Conference on Carbon Dioxide Utilization	JUN 20-23, 2005	Univ Oslo, Oslo, NORWAY		Univ Oslo			Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) has become an important global issue due to the significant and continuous rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, accelerated growth in the consumption of carbon-based energy worldwide, depletion of carbon-based energy resources, and low efficiency in current energy systems. The barriers for CO2 utilization include: (1) Costs Of CO2 capture, separation, purification, and transportation to user site; (2) energy requirements of CO2 chemical conversion (plus source and cost of co-reactants); (3) market size limitations, little investment-incentives and lack of industrial commitments for enhancing CO2-based chemicals; and (4) the lack of socio-economical driving forces. The strategic objectives may include: (1) use CO2 for environmentally-benign physical and chemical processing that adds value to the process; (2) use CO2 to produce industrially useful chemicals and materials that adds value to the products; (3) use CO2 as a beneficial fluid for processing or as a medium for energy recovery and emission reduction; and (4) use CO2 recycling involving renewable sources of energy to conserve carbon resources for sustainable development. The approaches for enhancing CO2 utilization may include one or more of the following: (1) for applications that do not require pure CO2, develop effective processes for using the CO2-Concentrated flue gas from industrial plants or CO2-rich resources without CO2 separation; (2) for applications that need pure CO2, develop more efficient and less-energy intensive processes for separation of CO2 selectively without the negative impacts of co-existing gases such as H2O, 02, and N-2; (3) replace a hazardous or less-effective substance in existing processes with CO2 as an alternate medium or solvent or co-reactant or a combination of them; (4) make use of CO2 based on the unique physical properties as supercritical fluid or as either solvent or anti-solvent; (5) use CO2 based on the unique chemical properties for CO2 to be incorporated with high 'atom efficiency' such as carboxylation and carbonate synthesis; (6) produce useful chemicals and materials using CO2 as a reactant or feedstock; (7) use CO2 for energy recovery while reducing its emissions to the atmosphere by sequestration; (8) recycle CO2 as C-source for chemicals and fuels using renewable sources of energy; and (9) convert CO2 under either bio-chemical or geologic-formation conditions into "new fossil" energies. Several cases are discussed in more detail. The first example is tri-reforming of methane versus the well-known CO2 reforming over transition metal catalysts such as supported Ni catalysts. Using CO2 along with H2O and 02 in flue gases of power plants without separation, tri-reforming is a synergetic combination of CO2 reforming, steam reforming and partial oxidation and it can eliminate carbon deposition problem and produces syngas with desired H-2/CO ratios for industrial applications. The second example is a CO2 "molecular basket" as CO2-selective high-capacity adsorbent which was developed using mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 and polyethylenimine (PEI). The MCM41-PEI adsorbent has higher adsorption capacity than either PEI or MCM-41 alon and can be used as highly CO2-selective adsorbent for gas mixtures without the pre-removal of moisture because it even enhances CO2 adsorption capacity. The third example is synthesis of dimethyl carbonate using CO2 and methanol, which demonstrates the environmental benefit of avoiding toxic phosgene and a processing advantage. The fourth example is the application of supercritical CO2 for extraction and for chemical processing where CO2 is either a solvent or a co-reactant, or both. The CO2 utilization contributes to enhancing sustainability, since various chemicals, materials, and fuels can be synthesized using CO2, which should be a sustainable way in the long term when renewable sources of energy are used as energy input.

J	Van Gerpen, J				Van Gerpen, J			Biodiesel processing and production	FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY												Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel that is produced from vegetable oils and animal fats. It consists of the monoalkyl esters formed by a catalyzed reaction of the triglycerides in the oil or fat with a simple monohydric alcohol. The reaction conditions generally involve a trade-off between reaction time and temperature as reaction completeness is the most critical fuel quality parameter. Much of the process complexity originates from contaminants in the feedstock, such as water and free fatty acids, or impurities in the final product, such as methanol, free glycerol, and soap. Processes have been developed to produce biodiesel from high free fatty acid feedstocks, such as recycled restaurant grease, animal fats, and soapstock. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Barone, V; Hod, O; Scuseria, GE				Barone, Veronica; Hod, Oded; Scuseria, Gustavo E.			Electronic structure and stability of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons	NANO LETTERS												We present a systematic density functional theory study of the electronic properties, optical spectra, and relative thermodynamic stability of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons. We consider ribbons with different edge nature including bare and hydrogen-terminated ribbons, several crystallographic orientations, and widths up to 3 nm. Our results can be extrapolated to wider ribbons providing a qualitative way of determining the electronic properties of ribbons with widths of practical significance. We predict that in order to produce materials with band gaps similar to Ge or InN, the width of the ribbons must be between 2 and 3 nm. If larger bang gap ribbons are needed (like Si, InP, or GaAs), their width must be reduced to 1-2 nm. According to the extrapolated inverse power law obtained in this work, armchair carbon nanoribbons of widths larger than 8 nm will present a maximum band gap of 0.3 eV, while for ribbons with a width of 80 nm the maximum possible band gap is 0.05 eV. For chiral nanoribbons the band gap oscillations rapidly vanish as a function of the chiral angle indicating that a careful design of their crystallographic nature is an essential ingredient for controlling their electronic properties. Optical excitations show important differences between ribbons with and without hydrogen termination and are found to be sensitive to the carbon nanoribbon width. This should provide a practical way of revealing information on their size and the nature of their edges.

J	Chong, IG; Jun, CH				Chong, IG; Jun, CH			Performance of some variable selection methods when multicollinearity is present	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS												Variable selection is one of the important practical issues for many scientific engineers. Although the PLS (partial least squares) regression combined with the VIP (variable importance in the projection) scores is often used when the multicollinearity, is present among variables, there are few guidelines about its uses as well as its performance. The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the VIP method and to compare with other methods through computer simulation experiments. We design 108 experiments where observations are generated from true models considering four factors-the proportion of the number of relevant predictors, the magnitude of correlations between predictors, the structure of regression coefficients, and the magnitude of signal to noise. Confusion matrix is adopted to evaluate the performance of PLS, the Lasso, and stepwise method. We also discuss the proper cutoff value of the VIP method to increase its performance. Some practical hints for the use of the VIP method are given as simulation results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we demonstrate that efficient fixation of N-2 to NH3 can proceed under room temperature and atmospheric pressure in water using visible light illuminated BiOBr nanosheets of oxygen vacancies in the absence of any organic scavengers and precious-metal cocatalysts. The designed catalytic oxygen vacancies of BiOBr nanosheets on the exposed {001} facets, with the availability of localized electrons for pi-back-donation, have the ability to activate the adsorbed N-2, which can thus be efficiently reduced to NH3 by the interfacial electrons transferred from the excited BiOBr nanosheets. This study might open up a new vista to fix atmospheric N-2 to NH3 through the less energy-demanding photochemical process.

After electrostatic assembly, rGO nanosheets are inserted in-between MXene layers. As a result, the self-restacking of MXene nanosheets is effectively prevented, leading to a considerably increased interlayer spacing. Accelerated diffusion of electrolyte ions enables more electroactive sites to become accessible. The freestanding MXene/rGO-5 wt% electrode displays a volumetric capacitance of 1040 F cm(-3) at a scan rate of 2 mV s(-1), an impressive rate capability with 61% capacitance retention at 1 V s(-1) and long cycle life. Moreover, the fabricated binder-free symmetric supercapacitor shows an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 32.6 Wh L-1, which is among the highest values reported for carbon and MXene based materials in aqueous electrolytes. This work provides fundamental insight into the effect of interlayer spacing on the electrochemical performance of 2D hybrid materials and sheds light on the design of next-generation flexible, portable and highly integrated supercapacitors with high volumetric and rate performances.

Current-driven dynamics of chiral ferromagnetic domain walls	NATURE MATERIALS												In most ferromagnets the magnetization rotates from one domain to the next with no preferred handedness. However, broken inversion symmetry can lift the chiral degeneracy, leading to topologically rich spin textures such as spin spirals(1,2) and skyrmions(3-5) through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction(6) (DMI). Here we show that in ultrathin metallic ferromagnets sandwiched between a heavy metal and an oxide, the DMI stabilizes chiral domain walls(2,7) (DWs) whose spin texture enables extremely efficient current-driven motion(8-11). We show that spin torque from the spin Hall effect(12-15) drives DWs in opposite directions in Pt/CoFe/MgO and Ta/CoFe/MgO, which can be explained only if the DWs assume a Neel configuration(7,16) with left-handed chirality. We directly confirm the DW chirality and rigidity by examining current-driven DW dynamics with magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the spin spiral. This work resolves the origin of controversial experimental results(10,17,18) and highlights a new path towards interfacial design of spintronic devices.

Intrinsic ripples in graphene	NATURE MATERIALS												The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is the subject of a long-standing theoretical debate. According to the so-called Mermin-Wagner theorem(1), long-wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order of 2D crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be crumpled(2). These fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes meaning that a 2D membrane can exist but will exhibit strong height fluctuations(2-4). The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal(5,6), and the recent experimental observation of ripples in suspended graphene(7) make these issues especially important. Besides the academic interest, understanding the mechanisms of the stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic transport in this material that is attracting so much interest owing to its unusual Dirac spectrum and electronic properties(8-11). We address the nature of these height fluctuations by means of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for carbon(12). We find that ripples spontaneously appear owing to thermal fluctuations with a size distribution peaked around 80 A which is compatible with experimental findings(7) (50-100 angstrom ). This unexpected result might be due to the multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.

Inorganic caesium lead iodide perovskite solar cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A												The vast majority of perovskite solar cell research has focused on organic-inorganic lead trihalide perovskites. Herein, we present working inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells for the first time. CsPbI3 normally resides in a yellow non-perovskite phase at room temperature, but by careful processing control and development of a low-temperature phase transition route we have stabilised the material in the black perovskite phase at room temperature. As such, we have fabricated solar cell devices in a variety of architectures, with current-voltage curve measured efficiency up to 2.9% for a planar heterojunction architecture, and stabilised power conversion efficiency of 1.7%. The well-functioning planar junction devices demonstrate long-range electron and hole transport in this material. Importantly, this work identifies that the organic cation is not essential, but simply a convenience for forming lead triiodide perovskites with good photovoltaic properties. We additionally observe significant rate-dependent current-voltage hysteresis in CsPbI3 devices, despite the absence of the organic polar molecule previously thought to be a candidate for inducing hysteresis via ferroelectric polarisation. Due to its space group, CsPbI3 cannot be a ferroelectric material, and thus we can conclude that ferroelectricity is not required to explain current-voltage hysteresis in perovskite solar cells. Our report of working inorganic perovskite solar cells paves the way for further developments likely to lead to much more thermally stable perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

We employ transient absorption spectroscopy and present measurement data acquired for both intraband as well as interband probe energies. Quantum yields of 300% indicate the creation, on average, of three excitons per absorbed photon for PbSe QDs at photon energies that are four times the QD energy gap. Results indicate that the threshold photon energy for MEG in QDs is twice the lowest exciton absorption energy. We find that the biexciton effect, which shifts the transition energy for absorption of a second photon, influences the early time transient absorption data and may contribute to a modulation observed when probing near the lowest interband transition. We present experimental and theoretical values of the size-dependent interband transition energies for PbSe QDs.

By carefully comparing the convergence behavior of D-e(O-2) and D-e(SO), we show that the cause of these errors is a result of two inter-related problems: near duplication of the exponents in two of the d sets and a lack of high-exponent functions in the early members of the sets. Similar problems exist for the f sets (and probably in higher angular momentum sets), but have only a minor effect on the calculated dissociation energies. A number of approaches to address the problems in the d sets were investigated. Well behaved convergence was obtained by augmenting the (1d) and (2d) sets with a high-exponent function and by replacing the (3d) set by the (4d) set and the (4d) set by the (5d) set and so on. To ensure satisfactory coverage of both the L and M shell regions, the exponents of the new d sets were re-optimized. Benchmark calculations on Si-2, PN, SO, and AlCl with the new cc-pV(n+d)Z sets show greatly improved convergence behavior not only for D-e but for many other properties as well.

The synthesis procedure involves infiltration of the pores of the template with appropriate carbon precursor, its carbonization, and subsequent template removal. The template needs to exhibit three-dimensional pore structure in order to be suitable for the ordered mesoporous carbon synthesis, otherwise disordered microporous carbon is formed. MCM-48, SBA-1, and SBA-15 silicas were successfully used to synthesize carbons with cubic or hexagonal frameworks, narrow mesopore size distributions, high nitrogen Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas (up to 1800 m(2) g(-1)), and large pore volumes. Ordered mesoporous carbons are promising in many applications, including adsorption of large molecules, chromatography, and manufacturing of electrochemical double-layer capacitors.

The large choice of building blocks means that the structures and pore characteristics of the metal-organic frameworks can be tuned relatively easily. However, despite much research, it remains challenging to prepare frameworks specifically tailored for particular applications. Here, we have used computational modelling to design and predictively characterize a metal-organic framework (NU-100) with a particularly high surface area. Subsequent experimental synthesis yielded a material, matching the calculated structure, with a high BET surface area (6,143 m(2) g(-1)). Furthermore, sorption measurements revealed that the material had high storage capacities for hydrogen (164 mg g(-1)) and carbon dioxide (2,315 mg g(-1))-gases of high importance in the contexts of clean energy and climate alteration, respectively-in excellent agreement with predictions from modelling.

Despite numerous efforts concerning this issue, combatting sulfur loss remains one of the greatest challenges. Here we show that this problem can be effectively diminished by controlling the sulfur as smaller allotropes. Metastable small sulfur molecules of S2-4 were synthesized in the confined space of a conductive microporous carbon matrix. The confined S2-4 as a new cathode material can totally avoid the unfavorable transition between the commonly used large S-8 and S-4(2-). Li-S batteries based on this concept exhibit unprecedented electrochemical behavior with high specific capacity, good cycling stability, and superior rate capability, which promise a practicable battery with high energy density for applications in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage systems.

J	Sun, YG; Mayers, B; Herricks, T; Xia, YN				Sun, YG; Mayers, B; Herricks, T; Xia, YN			Polyol synthesis of uniform silver nanowires: A plausible growth mechanism and the supporting evidence	NANO LETTERS												We have recently demonstrated an approach based on the polyol process for the large-scale synthesis of silver nanowires with uniform diameters (see Sun, Y.; Gates, B.; Mayers, B.; Xia, Y. Nano Leff. 2002, 2,165. Sun, Y.; Xia, Y. Adv. Mater. 2002, 14,833. Sun, Y.; Yin, Y.; Mayers, B. T.; Herricks, T.; Xia, Y. Chem. Mater. 2002, 149 4736). Although the capability and feasibility of this method have been successfully illustrated with the production of silver nanowires 30-60 nm in diameter and 1-50 mum in length, the growth mechanism of this process is yet to be elucidated. Here we report some progress on this matter: First, electron microscopy studies on microtomed samples indicated that the cross sections of such silver nanowires had a pentagonal shape, together with a 5-fold twinned crystal structure. Second, the side surfaces (bounded by {100} facets) and the ends (bounded by {111} facets) of each nanowire were shown to have significant difference in reactivity toward dithoil molecules, with the side surfaces being completely passivated by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and the ends being partially passivated (or essentially uncovered) by PVP. This result implied that the PVP macromolecules interacted more strongly with the {100} planes than with the {111} planes of silver. On the basis of these new results, we proposed that each silver nanowire evolved from a multiply twinned nanoparticle (MTP) of silver with the assistance of PVP at the initial stage of the Ostwald ripening process. The anisotropic growth was maintained by selectively covering the {100} facets with PVP while leaving the {111} facets largely uncovered by PVP and thus highly reactive.

J	Jakalian, A; Bush, BL; Jack, DB; Bayly, CI				Jakalian, A; Bush, BL; Jack, DB; Bayly, CI			Fast, efficient generation of high-quality atomic Charges. AM1-BCC model: I. Method	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												The AM1-BCC method quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for use in condensed-phase simulations. The underlying features of the electron distribution including formal charge and delocalization are first captured by AM1 atomic charges for the individual molecule. Bond charge corrections (BCCs), which have been parameterized against the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a training set of compounds containing relevant functional groups, are then added using a formalism identical to the consensus BCI (bond charge increment) approach. As a proof of the concept, we fit BCCs simultaneously to 45 compounds including O-, N-, and S-containing functionalities, aromatics, and hetoroaromatics, using only 41 BCC parameters. AM1-BCC yields charge sets of comparable quality to HF/6-31G* ESP-derived charges in a fraction of the time while reducing instabilities in the atomic charges compared to direct ESP-fit methods. We then apply the BCC parameters to a small "test set" consisting of aspirin, D-glucose, and eryodictyol; the AM1-BCC model again provides atomic charges of quality comparable with HF/6-31G* RESP charges, as judged by an increase of only 0.01 to 0.02 atomic units in the root-mean-square (RMS) error in ESP. Based on these encouraging results, we intend to parameterize the AM1-BCC model to provide a consistent charge model for any organic or biological molecule.

Thermoelectric materials are being investigated for electricity production from waste heat (co-generation) and natural heat sources. For temperatures below 200 degrees C, the best commercially available inorganic semiconductors are bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3)-based alloys, which possess a figure of merit ZT close to one(1). Most of the recently discovered thermoelectric materials with ZT > 2 exhibit one common property, namely their low lattice thermal conductivities(2,3). Nevertheless, a high ZT value is not enough to create a viable technology platform for energy harvesting. To generate electricity from large volumes of warm fluids, heat exchangers must be functionalized with TEGs. This requires thermoelectric materials that are readily synthesized, air stable, environmentally friendly and solution processable to create patterns on large areas. Here we show that conducting polymers might be capable of meeting these demands. The accurate control of the oxidation level in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) combined with its low intrinsic thermal conductivity (lambda = D 0.37W m(-1) K-1) yields a ZT = 0.25 at room temperature that approaches the values required for efficient devices.

Combined Effect of Nitrogen- and Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups of Microporous Activated Carbon on its Electrochemical Performance in Supercapacitors	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS												Microporous activated carbon originating from coconut shell, as received or oxidized with nitric acid, is treated with melamine and urea and heated to 950 degrees C in an inert atmosphere to modify the carbon surface with nitrogen- and oxygen-containing groups for a systematic investigation of their combined effect on electrochemical performance in 1 m H2SO4 supercapacitors. The chemistry of the samples is characterized using elemental analysis, Boehm titration, potentiometric titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Sorption of nitrogen and carbon dioxide is used to determine the textural properties. The results show that the surface chemistry is affected by the type of nitrogen precursor and the specific groups present on the surface before the treatment leading to the incorporation of nitrogen. Analysis of the electrochemical behavior of urea- and melamine-treated samples reveal pseudocapacitance from both the oxygen and the nitrogen containing functional groups located in the pores larger than 10 angstrom. On the other hand, pores between 5 angstrom and 6 angstrom are most effective in a double-layer formation, which correlates well with the size of hydrated ions. Although the quaternary and pyridinic-N-oxides nitrogen groups have enhancing effects on capacitance due to the positive charge, and thus an improved electron transfer at high current loads, the most important functional groups affecting energy storage performance are pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen along with quinone oxygen.

J	Peng, ZA; Peng, XG				Peng, ZA; Peng, XG			Nearly monodisperse and shape-controlled CdSe nanocrystals via alternative routes: Nucleation and growth	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												The nucleation and growth of colloidal CdSe nanocrystals with a variety of elongated shapes were explored in detail. The critical size nuclei for the system were magic sized nonoclusters, which possessed a sharp and dominated absorption peak at 349 nm. The formation of the unique magic sized nuclei in a broad monomer concentration range was not expected by the classic nucleation theory. We propose that this was a result of the extremely high chemical potential environment, that is, very high monomer concentrations in the solution, required for the growth of those elongated nanocrystals. The shape, size, and size/shape distributions of the resulting nanocrystals were all determined by two related factors, the magic sized nuclei and the concentration of the remaining monomers after the initial nucleation stage. Without any size sorting, nearly monodisperse CdSe quantum structures with different shapes were reproducibly synthesized by using the alternative cadmium precursors, cadmium-phosphonic acid complexes. A reasonably large excess of the cadmium precursor, which is less reactive than the Se precursor, was found beneficial for the system to reach the desired balance between nucleation and growth. The shape evolution and growth kinetics of these elongated nanocrystals were consistent with the diffusion-controlled model proposed previously. The branched nanocrystals had to grow at very high monomer concentrations because the multiple growth centers at the end of each branch must be fed with a very high diffusion flux to keep all branches in the 1 D-growth mode. The rice-shaped nanocrystals were found as special products of the 3D-growth stage. The growth of the nanocrystals in the 1 D-growth stage was proven to be not unidirectional after the length of the nanocrystals reached a certain threshold. Experimental results indicate that coordinating solvents arid two ligands with distinguishable coordinating abilities are both not intrinsic requirements for the growth of elongated CdSe nanocrystals.					peng, xiaogang/R-6184-2016	Peng, Xiaogang/0000-0002-5606-8472													0002-7863					APR 3	2002	124	13					3343	3353		10.1021/ja0173167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja0173167								11916419					WOS:000174793400033

Giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductor	NATURE MATERIALS												Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a new platform for exploring 2D semiconductor physics(1-9). Reduced screening in two dimensions results in markedly enhanced electron-electron interactions, which have been predicted to generate giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects(10-13). Here we present a rigorous experimental observation of extraordinarily large exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconducting TMD. We determine the single-particle electronic bandgap of single-layer MoSe2 by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS), as well as the two-particle exciton transition energy using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. These yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 eV for monolayer MoSe2 on graphene-orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in conventional 3D semiconductors and significantly higher than what we see for MoSe2 monolayers in more highly screening environments. This finding is corroborated by our ab initio GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations(14,15) which include electron correlation effects. The renormalized bandgap and large exciton binding observed here will have a profound impact on electronic and optoelectronic device technologies based on single-layer semiconducting TMDs.					da Jornada, Felipe/AAF-5728-2020; Tongay, Seth Ariel/ACQ-5306-2022; Crommie, Michael/J-4824-2015; Hussain, Zahid/HGU-8912-2022; Ugeda, Miguel/ABG-8106-2020; Mo, Sung-Kwan/F-3489-2013; Wang, feng/I-5727-2015; Zhang, Yi/J-9025-2013	Mo, Sung-Kwan/0000-0003-0711-8514; shi, sufei/0000-0001-5158-805X; Moreno Ugeda, Miguel/0000-0001-7913-1617; Wang, feng/0000-0001-8369-6194; Tongay, Seth Ariel/0000-0001-8294-984X; Zhang, Yi/0000-0003-1204-8717													1476-1122	1476-4660				DEC	2014	13	12					1091	1095		10.1038/NMAT4061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT4061								25173579					WOS:000345432200009

A particularly promising aspect seems to be the ability of perovskites to provide bistable switching of the conductance between non-metallic andmetallic behaviour by the application of an appropriate electric field. Here we demonstrate that the switching behaviour is an intrinsic feature of naturally occurring dislocations in single crystals of a prototypical ternary oxide, SrTiO3. The phenomenon is shown to originate from local modulations of the oxygen content and to be related to the self-doping capability of the early transition metal oxides. Our results show that extended defects, such as dislocations, can act as bistable nanowires and hold technological promise for terabit memory devices.

The thermal conductance is approximately 2.4 nW/K, and the thermal-conductivity is nearly 3500 Wm(-1)K(-1) at room temperature for a SWNT of length 2.6 mu m and diameter 1.7 nm. A subtle decrease in thermal conductivity steeper than 1/T is observed at the upper end of the temperature range, which is attributed to second-order three-phonon scattering between two acoustic modes and one optical mode. We discuss sources of uncertainty and propose a simple analytical model for the SWNT thermal conductivity including length and temperature dependence.

Colloidal Suspensions of Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide in a Wide Variety of Organic Solvents	NANO LETTERS												We report that homogeneous colloidal suspensions of chemically modified graphene sheets were readily produced in a wide variety of organic solvent systems. Two different sets of solubility parameters are used to rationalize when stable colloidal suspensions of graphene oxide sheets and, separately, of reduced graphene oxide sheets in a given solvent type are possible and when they are not. As an example of the utility of such colloidal suspensions, "paperlike" materials generated by very simple filtration of the reduced graphene oxide sheets had electrical conductivity values as high as 16 000 S/m.

However, metals deposited on the semiconducting 2H phase usually form high-resistance (0.7 k Omega mu m-10 k Omega mu m) contacts, leading to Schottky-limited transport. In this study, we demonstrate that the metallic 1T phase of MoS2 can be locally induced on semiconducting 2H phase nanosheets, thus decreasing contact resistances to 200-300 Omega mu m at zero gate bias. Field-effect transistors (FETs) with 1T phase electrodes fabricated and tested in air exhibit mobility values of similar to 50 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), subthreshold swing values below 100mV per decade, on/of ratios of >10(7), drive currents approaching similar to 100 mu A mu m(-1), and excellent current saturation. The deposition of different metals has limited influence on the FET performance, suggesting that the 1T/2H interface controls carrier injection into the channel. An increased reproducibility of the electrical characteristics is also obtained with our strategy based on phase engineering of MoS2.

Enhanced Photoluminescence and Solar Cell Performance <i>via</i> Lewis Base Passivation of Organic Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskites	ACS NANO												Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a top contender to be used as an absorber material in highly efficient, low-cost photovoltaic devices. Solution-processed semiconductors tend to have a high density of defect states and exhibit a large degree of electronic disorder. Perovskites appear to go against this trend, and despite relatively little knowledge of the impact of electronic defects, certified solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of up to 17.9% have been achieved. Here, through treatment of the crystal surfaces with the Lewis bases thiophene and pyridine, we demonstrate significantly reduced nonradiative electron-hole recombination within the CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite, achieving photoluminescence lifetimes which are enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude, up to 2 mu s. We propose that this is due to the electronic passivation of under-coordinated Pb atoms within the crystal. Through this method of Lewis base passivation, we achieve power conversion efficiencies for solution-processed planar heterojunction solar cells enhanced from 13% for the untreated solar cells to 15.3% and 16.5% for the thiophene and pyridine-treated solar cells, respectively.

Several recent reports have demonstrated that the MSNs can be efficiently internalized by animal and plant cells. The functionalization of MSNs with organic moieties or other nanostructures brings controlled release and molecular recognition capabilities to these mesoporous materials for drug/gene delivery and sensing applications, respectively.

Magnetic effects at the interface between non-magnetic oxides	NATURE MATERIALS												The electronic reconstruction at the interface between two insulating oxides can give rise to a highly conductive interface. Here we show how, in analogy to this remarkable interface-induced conductivity, magnetism can be induced at the interface between the otherwise non-magnetic insulating perovskites SrTiO3 and LaAlO3. A large negative magnetoresistance of the interface is found, together with a logarithmic temperature dependence of the sheet resistance. At low temperatures, the sheet resistance reveals magnetic hysteresis. Magnetic ordering is a key issue in solid-state science and its underlying mechanisms are still the subject of intense research. In particular, the interplay between localized magnetic moments and the spin of itinerant conduction electrons in a solid gives rise to intriguing many-body effects such as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions, the Kondo effect and carrier-induced ferromagnetismin diluted magnetic semiconductors. The conducting oxide interface now provides a versatile system to induce and manipulate magnetic moments in otherwise non-magnetic materials.

Collodial nanocrystals (NCs) of cesium lead halides (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) exhibit bright photoluminescence, with emission tunable over the entire visible spectral region. However, previous studies on CsPbX3 NCs did not address key aspects of their chemistry and photophysics such as surface chemistry and quantitative light absorption. Here, we elaborate on the synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs and their surface chemistry. In addition, the intrinsic absorption coefficient was determined experimentally by combining elemental analysis with accurate optical absorption measurements. H-1 solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterize sample purity, elucidate the surface chemistry, and evaluate the influence of purification methods on the surface composition. We find that ligand binding to the NC surface is highly dynamic, and therefore, ligands are easily lost during the isolation and purification procedures. However, when a small amount of both oleic acid and oleylamine is added, the NCs can be purified, maintaining optical, colloidal, and material integrity. In addition, we find that a high amine content in the ligand shell increases the quantum yield due to the improved binding of the carboxylic acid.

The growth of the shell was designed to grow one monolayer at a time by alternating injections of air-stable and inexpensive cationic and anionic precursors into the reaction mixture with core nanocrystals. The principles of SILAR were demonstrated by the CdSe/CdS core/shell model system using its shell-thickness-dependent optical spectra as the probes with CdO and elemental S as the precursors. For this reaction system, a relatively high temperature, about 220-240 degreesC, was found to be essential for SILAR to fully occur. The synthesis can be readily performed on a multigram scale. The size distribution of the core/shell nanocrystals was maintained even after five monolayers of CdS shell (equivalent to about 10 times volume increase for a 3.5 nm CdSe nanocrystal) were grown onto the core nanocrystals. The epitaxial growth of the core/shell structures was verified by optical spectroscopy, TEM, XRD, and XPS. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) of the as-prepared CdSe/CdS core/shell nanocrystals ranged from 20% to 40%, and the PL full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) was maintained between 23 and 26 nm, even for those nanocrystals for which the UV-vis and PL peaks red-shifted by about 50 nm from that of the core nanocrystals. Several types of brightening phenomena were observed, some of which can further boost the PL QY of the core/shell nanocrystals. The CdSe/CdS core/shell nanocrystals were found to be superior in comparison to the highly luminescent CdSe plain core nanocrystals. The SILAR technique reported here can also be used for the growth of complex colloidal semiconductor nanostructures, such as quantum shells and colloidal quantum wells.					peng, xiaogang/R-6184-2016	Peng, Xiaogang/0000-0002-5606-8472													0002-7863					OCT 15	2003	125	41					12567	12575		10.1021/ja0363563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja0363563								14531702					WOS:000185857200050
J	Wolters, DA; Washburn, MP; Yates, JR				Wolters, DA; Washburn, MP; Yates, JR			An automated multidimensional protein identification technology for shotgun proteomics	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												We describe an automated method for shotgun proteomics named multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT, which combines multidimensional liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The multidimensional liquid chromatography method integrates a strong cation-exchange (SCX) resin and reversed-phase resin in a biphasic column. We detail the improvements over a system described by Link et al. (Link, A. J.; Eng, J.; Schieltz, D. M.; Carmack, E.; Mize, G. J.; Morris, D. R.; Garvik, B. M.; Yates, J. R., III. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999, 17, 676-682) that separates and acquires tandem mass spectra for thousands of peptides. Peptides elute off the SCX phase by increasing pI, and elution off the SCX material is evenly distributed across an analysis. In addition, we describe the chromatographic benchmarks of MudPIT. MudPIT was reproducible within 0.5% between two analyses. Furthermore, a dynamic range of 10 000 to 1 between the most abundant and least abundant proteins/peptides in a complex peptide mixture has been demonstrated. By improving sample preparation along with separations, the method improves the overall analysis of proteomes by identifying proteins of all functional and physical classes.

J	Capello, C; Fischer, U; Hungerbühler, K				Capello, Christian; Fischer, Ulrich; Hungerbuehler, Konrad			What is a green solvent?: A comprehensive framework for the environmental assessment of solvents	GREEN CHEMISTRY												Solvents define a major part of the environmental performance of processes in chemical industry and also impact on cost, safety and health issues. The idea of "green'' solvents expresses the goal to minimize the environmental impact resulting from the use of solvents in chemical production. Here the question is raised of how to measure how "green'' a solvent is. We propose a comprehensive framework for the environmental assessment of solvents that covers major aspects of the environmental performance of solvents in chemical production, as well as important health and safety issues. The framework combines the assessment of substance-specific hazards with the quantification of emissions and resource use over the full life-cycle of a solvent. The proposed framework is demonstrated on 26 organic solvents. Results show that simple alcohols (methanol, ethanol) or alkanes (heptane, hexane) are environmentally preferable solvents, whereas the use of dioxane, acetonitrile, acids, formaldehyde, and tetrahydrofuran is not recommendable from an environmental perspective. Additionally, a case study is presented in which the framework is applied for the assessment of various alcohol -water or pure alcohol mixtures used for solvolysis of p-methoxybenzoyl chloride. The results of this case study indicate that methanol -water or ethanol -water mixtures are environmentally favourable compared to pure alcohol or propanol water mixtures. The two applications demonstrate that the presented framework is a useful instrument to select green solvents or environmentally sound solvent mixtures for processes in chemical industry. The same framework can also be used for a comprehensive assessment of new solvent technologies as soon as the present lack of data can be overcome.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of select multi-layered transition metal carbides (MXenes)	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												In this work, a detailed high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is presented for select MXenes a recently discovered family of two-dimensional (2D) carbides and carbonitrides. Given their 2D nature, understanding their surface chemistry is paramount. Herein we identify and quantify the surface groups present before, and after, sputter-cleaning as well as freshly prepared vs. aged multi layered cold pressed discs. The nominal compositions of the MXenes studied here are Ti-3 C2Tx,Ti3CNTx, Nb2CTx and Nb4C3Tx where T represents surface groups that this work attempts to quantify. In all the cases, the presence of three surface terminations, O, OH and F, in addition to OH-terminations relatively strongly bonded to H2O molecules, was confirmed. From XPS peak fits, it was possible to establish the average sum of the negative charges of the terminations for the aforementioned MXenes. Based on this work, it is now possible to quantify the nature of the surface terminations. This information can, in turn, be used to better design and tailor these novel 2D materials for various applications. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Syntheses of these COFs were done by the Schiff base reactions of 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp) with p-phenylenediamine (Pa-1) and 2,5-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (Pa-2), respectively, in 1:1 mesitylene/dioxane. The expected enol-imine (OH) form underwent irreversible proton tautomerism, and only the keto-enamine form was observed. Because of the irreversible nature of the total reaction and the absence of an imine bond in the system, TpPa-1 and TpPa-2 showed strong resistance toward acid (9 N HCl) and boiling water. Moreover, TpPa-2 showed exceptional stability in base (9 N NaOH) as well.

They differ by the degree of contraction of the outer-space perturbers. Two types of zero-order Hamiltonians are proposed, both are bielectronic, incorporating the interactions between electrons in the active orbitals, therefore introducing a rational balance between the zero-order wave function and the outer-space. The use of Dyall's Hamiltonian, which puts the active electrons in a fixed core field, and of a partially contracted formalism seems a promising compromise. The formalism is generalizable to multireference spaces which are parts of a GAS. A few test applications of the simplest variant developed in this paper illustrate its potentialities.

J	Rappoport, D; Furche, F				Rappoport, Dmitrij; Furche, Filipp			Property-optimized Gaussian basis sets for molecular response calculations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												With recent advances in electronic structure methods, first-principles calculations of electronic response properties, such as linear and nonlinear polarizabilities, have become possible for molecules with more than 100 atoms. Basis set incompleteness is typically the main source of error in such calculations since traditional diffuse augmented basis sets are too costly to use or suffer from near linear dependence. To address this problem, we construct the first comprehensive set of property-optimized augmented basis sets for elements H-Rn except lanthanides. The new basis sets build on the Karlsruhe segmented contracted basis sets of split-valence to quadruple-zeta valence quality and add a small number of moderately diffuse basis functions. The exponents are determined variationally by maximization of atomic Hartree-Fock polarizabilities using analytical derivative methods. The performance of the resulting basis sets is assessed using a set of 313 molecular static Hartree-Fock polarizabilities. The mean absolute basis set errors are 3.6%, 1.1%, and 0.3% for property-optimized basis sets of split-valence, triple-zeta, and quadruple-zeta valence quality, respectively. Density functional and second-order Moller-Plesset polarizabilities show similar basis set convergence. We demonstrate the efficiency of our basis sets by computing static polarizabilities of icosahedral fullerenes up to C-720 using hybrid density functional theory.

One of the main factors that has hampered widespread practical use of DSC is the poor thermostability encountered so far with these devices. Here we show a DSC with unprecedented stable performance under both thermal stress and soaking with light, matching the durability criteria applied to silicon solar cells for outdoor applications. The cell uses the amphiphilic ruthenium sensitizer cis-RuLL'(SCN)(2) (L = 4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2'-bipyridine, L' = 4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine) in conjunction with a quasi-solid-state polymer gel electrolyte, reaching an efficiency of >6% in full sunlight (air mass 1.5, 100 mW cm(-2)). A convenient and versatile new route is reported for the synthesis of the heteroleptic ruthenium complex, which plays a key role in achieving the high-temperature stability. Ultramicroelectrode voltammetric measurements show that the triiodide/iodide couple can perform charge transport freely in the polymer gel. The cell sustained heating for 1,000 h at 80 degreesC, maintaining 94% of its initial performance. The device also showed excellent stability under light soaking at 55 degreesC for 1,000 h in a solar simulator (100 mW cm(-2)) equipped with a ultraviolet filter. The present findings should foster widespread practical application of dye-sensitized solar cells.

J	Sheldon, RA				Sheldon, RA			Green solvents for sustainable organic synthesis: state of the art	GREEN CHEMISTRY					Green Solvents for Synthesis Meeting	OCT 03-06, 2004	Bruchsal, GERMANY					The growing awareness of the pressing need for greener, more sustainable technologies has focused attention on the use of atom efficient catalytic methodologies for the manufacture of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Another aspect which is receiving increasing attention is the use of alternative reaction media that circumvent the problems associated with many of the traditional volatile organic solvents. The use of nonconventional reaction media also provides opportunities for facilitating the recovery and recycling of the catalyst. The state of the art in the use of alternative reaction media for green, sustainable organic synthesis is reviewed. Liquid-liquid biphasic catalysis provides an industrially attractive method for the recovery and recycling of catalysts as an alternative to the more traditional solid heterogeneous catalysts. Various approaches to liquid-liquid biphasic catalysis aqueous biphasic, fluorous biphasic, supercritical carbon dioxide, ionic liquids and various combinations thereof-are reviewed and compared. "The best solvent is no solvent'' but if a solvent is needed then water has a lot to recommend it and catalysis in aqueous biphasic systems is an industrially attractive methodology which has found broad application. Similarly, supercritical carbon dioxide is an interesting reaction medium in the context of green chemistry and catalysis in various mono- and biphasic systems involving this solvent are reviewed. Fluorous biphasic systems and ionic liquids also have advantages in certain situations and the advantages and limitations of these media are compared. The ultimate in clean catalytic technologies is to telescope multistep syntheses into one-pot in the form of catalytic cascade processes. Examples of such catalytic cascades involving both chemo- and biocatalytic conversions are presented. Biocatalysis has a distinct advantage in this context in that the reactions all take place at or close to ambient temperature and pressure. In emulation of natural processes, where several different enzymes are compartmentalised in the cell, it can be advantageous to immobilise the various catalysts in such a cascade process. In this context, a novel and effective method for the immobilisation of enzymes as cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) is discussed and the use of a combi CLEA, containing two enzymes, for the one-pot conversion of benzaldehyde to S-mandelic acid is reported.

Bacteriological test data, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, and electron microscopy (TEM) images are provided, which yield insight into the biocidal action of these nanoscale materials. The tests show that these materials are very effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as spores. zeta-Potential measurements show an attractive interaction between the MgO nanoparticles and bacteria and spore cells, which is confirmed by confocal microscopy images. The AFM studies illustrate considerable changes in the cell membranes upon treatment, resulting in the death of the cells. TEM micrographs confirm these results and supply additional information about the processes inside the cells. Overall, the results presented illustrate that dry powder nanoparticulate formulations as well as water slurries are effective.

J	Handy, NC; Cohen, AJ				Handy, NC; Cohen, AJ			Left-right correlation energy	MOLECULAR PHYSICS												We first attempt to determine a local exchange functional E-x[rho] which accurately reproduces the Hartree-Fock (HF) energies of the 18 first and second row atoms. E-x[rho] is determined from rho and \del rho\, and we rnd that we can improve significantly upon Becke's original generalized gradient approximation functional (commonly called B88X) by allowing the coefficient of the Dirac exchange term to be optimized (it is argued that molecules do not behave like the uniform electron gas). We call this new two parameter exchange functional OPTX. We rnd that neither del (2) rho or tau = Sigma\del phi (i)\(2) improve the fit to these atomic energies. These exchange functionals include not only exchange, but also left-right correlation. It is therefore proposed that this functional provides a definition for exchange energy plus left-right correlation energy when used in Kohn-Sham (KS) calculations. We call this energy the Kohn-Sham exchange (or KSX) energy. It is shown that for nearly all molecules studied these KSX energies are lower than the corresponding HF energies, thus giving values for the non-dynamic correlation energy. At stretched geometries, the KSX energies are always lower than the HF energies, and often substantially so. Furthermore all bond lengths from the KSX calculations are longer than HF bond lengths and experimental bond lengths, which again demonstrates the inclusion of left-right correlation effects in the functional. For these reasons we prefer to split the correlation energy into two parts: left-right correlation energy and dynamic correlation energy, arguing that the usage of the words 'non-dynamic' or 'static' or 'near-degeneracy' is less meaningful. We recognize that this definition of KSX is not precise, because the definition of a local E-x[rho] can never be precise. We also recognize that these ideas are not new, but we think that their importance has been insufficiently recognized in functional determination. When we include third row atoms in our analysis, we are unable to rnd a local exchange functional which is a substantial improvement over B88X for the reproduction of HF energies. This must arise from the effects of the core orbitals, and therefore we do not consider that this detracts from the improved accuracy of OPTX. We report some MCSCF calculations constructed from bonding-antibonding configurations, from which we attempt to calculate ab initio left-right correlation. There is only moderate agreement between the two approaches. Finally we combine the OPTX functional with established correlation functionals (LYP, P86, P91) to form OLYP, OP86 and OP91; OLYP is a great improvement on BLYP for both energy and structure, and OP86, OP91 are an improvement over BP86, BP91 for structure. The importance of the exchange functional for molecular structure is therefore underlined.

Considering the importance of protein interactions with injected colloidal dug carriers with regard to their in vivo fate, we analysed plasma protein adsorption onto biodegradable PEG-coated poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). A series of corona/core nanoparticles of sizes 160-270 nm were prepared from diblock PEG-PLA, PEG-PLGA and PEG-PCL and from PEG-PLA:PLA blends. The PEG Mw was varied from 2000-20 000 g/mole and the particles were prepared using different PEG contents. It was thus possible to study the influence of the PEG corona thickness and density, as well as the influence of the nature of the core (PLA, PLGA or PCL), on the competitive plasma protein adsorption, zeta potential and particle uptake by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. 2-D PAGE studies showed that plasma protein adsorption on PEG-coated PLA nanospheres strongly depends on the PEG molecular weight (Mw) (i.e. PEG chain length at the particle surface) as well as on the PEG content in the particles (i.e. PEG chain density at the surface of the particles). Whatever the thickness or the density of the corona, the qualitative composition of the plasma protein adsorption patterns was very similar, showing that adsorption was governed by interaction with a PLA surface protected more or less by PEG chains. The main spots on the gels were albumin, fibrinogen, IgG, Ig light chains, and the apolipoproteins apoA-I and apoE. For particles made of PEG-PLA45K with different PEG Mw, a maximal reduction in protein adsorption was found for a PEG Mw of 5000 g/mole. For nanospheres differing in their PEG content from 0.5 to 20 wt %, a PEG content between 2 and 5 wt % was determined as a threshold value for optimal protein resistance. When increasing the PEG content in the nanoparticles above 5 wt % no further reduction in protein adsorption was achieved. Phagocytosis by PMN studied using chemiluminescence and zeta potential data agreed well with these findings: the same PEG surface density threshold was found to ensure simultaneously efficient steric stabilization and to avoid the uptake by PMN cells. Supposing all the PEG chains migrate to the surface, this would correspond to a distance of about 1.5 nm between two terminally attached PEG chains in the covering 'brush'. Particles from PEG5K-PLA45K, PEG5K-PLGA45K; and PEG5K-PCL45K copolymers enabled to study the influence of the core on plasma protein adsorption, all other parameters (corona thickness and density) being kept constant. Adsorption patterns were in good qualitative agreement with each other. Only a few protein species were exclusively present just on one type of nanoparticle. However, the extent of proteins adsorbed differed in a large extent from one particle to another. In vivo studies could help elucidating the role of the type and amount of proteins adsorbed on the fate of the nanoparticles after intraveinous administration, as a function of the nature of their core. These results could be useful in the design of long circulating intravenously injectable biodegradable drug carriers endowed with protein resistant properties and low phagocytic uptake.

The method is based on the isotopic analysis of nitrous oxide (N2O) generated from nitrate by denitrifying bacteria that lack N2O-reductase activity. The isotopic composition of both nitrogen and oxygen from nitrate are accessible in this way. In this first of two companion manuscripts, we describe the basic protocol and results for the nitrogen isotopes. The precision of the method is better than 0.2 parts per thousand (1 SD) at concentrations of nitrate down to 1 muM, and the nitrogen isotopic differences among various standards and samples are accurately reproduced. For samples with 1 muM nitrate or more, the blank of the method is less than 10% of the signal size, and various approaches may reduce it further.

Rapid casting of patterned vascular networks for perfusable engineered three-dimensional tissues	NATURE MATERIALS												In the absence of perfusable vascular networks, three-dimensional (3D) engineered tissues densely populated with cells quickly develop a necrotic core(1). Yet the lack of a general approach to rapidly construct such networks remains a major challenge for 3D tissue culture(2-4). Here, we printed rigid 3D filament networks of carbohydrate glass, and used them as a cytocompatible sacrificial template in engineered tissues containing living cells to generate cylindrical networks that could be lined with endothelial cells and perfused with blood under high-pressure pulsatile flow. Because this simple vascular casting approach allows independent control of network geometry, endothelialization and extravascular tissue, it is compatible with a wide variety of cell types, synthetic and natural extracellular matrices, and crosslinking strategies. We also demonstrated that the perfused vascular channels sustained the metabolic function of primary rat hepatocytes in engineered tissue constructs that otherwise exhibited suppressed function in their core.					yu, xiang/B-1653-2010; Yang, Michael/LFS-4670-2024; Chen, Christopher/ABD-8499-2021; Miller, Jordan/P-8755-2014	Chaturvedi, Ritika/0000-0002-0416-6134; Baker, Brendon/0000-0002-2785-1070; Chen, Christopher/0000-0003-2445-8449; Miller, Jordan/0000-0002-7931-551X; Nguyen, Duc-Huy/0000-0003-0805-8103; Cohen, Daniel/0000-0002-7963-668X; Galie, Peter/0000-0001-5161-4924													1476-1122					SEP	2012	11	9					768	774		10.1038/NMAT3357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NMAT3357								22751181					WOS:000308191700015

Boron analogues have been predicted, as boron atoms possess a short covalent radius and the flexibility to adopt sp(2) hybridization, features that favour the formation of two-dimensional allotropes, and one example of such a borophene material has been reported recently. Here, we present a parallel experimental work showing that two-dimensional boron sheets can be grown epitaxially on a Ag(111) substrate. Two types of boron sheet, a beta(12) sheet and a chi(3) sheet, both exhibiting a triangular lattice but with different arrangements of periodic holes, are observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Density functional theory simulations agree well with experiments, and indicate that both sheets are planar without obvious vertical undulations. The boron sheets are quite inert to oxidization and interact only weakly with their substrate. We envisage that such boron sheets may find applications in electronic devices in the future.					zhong, qingyang/HTP-7486-2023; Zhang, Jin/X-4002-2019; CHENG, PENG/HNP-4206-2023; WU, Kehui/HNJ-1840-2023; Feng, Baojie/P-7357-2016; Meng, Sheng/A-7171-2010; Chen, Lan/D-3622-2013	Zhang, Jin/0000-0001-7830-3464; Feng, Baojie/0000-0003-2332-7949; Meng, Sheng/0000-0002-1553-1432; Wu, Kehui/0000-0002-7698-5673; Chen, Lan/0000-0003-4426-9944; Li, Wenbin/0000-0002-3147-3893													1755-4330	1755-4349				JUN	2016	8	6					564	569		10.1038/NCHEM.2491	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NCHEM.2491								27219700					WOS:000376529000012

When oxidized with 3.6 mmol of NaClO per gram of cellulose, almost the totality of sulfite wood pulp and cotton were readily disintegrated into long individual microfibrils by a treatment with a Waring Blendor, yielding transparent and highly viscous suspensions. When observed by transmission electron microscopy, the wood pulp and cotton microfibrils exhibited a regular width of 3-5 nm. Tunicin and bacterial cellulose could be disintegrated by sonication. A bulk degree of oxidation of about 0.2 per one anhydroglucose unit of cellulose was necessary for a smooth disintegration of sulfite wood pulp, whereas only small amounts of independent microfibrils were obtained at lower oxidation levels. This limiting degree of oxidation decreased in the following order: sulfite wood pulp > cotton > bacterial cellulose, tunicin.

GO films reduced for 1 h at 100 degrees C in 55% hydroiodic (HI) acid have an electrical conductivity as high as 298 S/cm and a C/O ratio above 12, both of which are much higher than films reduced by other chemical methods. The reduction maintains good integrity and flexibility, and even improves the strength and ductility, of the original GO films. Based on this reducing method, a flexible graphene-based transparent conductive film with a sheet resistance of 1.6 k Omega/sq and 85% transparency was obtained, further verifying the advantage of HI acid reduction.

Silver Nanowire Networks as Flexible, Transparent, Conducting Films: Extremely High DC to Optical Conductivity Ratios	ACS NANO												We have used aqueous dispersions of silver nanowires to prepare thin, flexible, transparent, conducting films. The nanowires are of length and diameter close to 6.5 mu m and 85 nm, respectively. At low thickness, the films consist of networks but appear to become bulk-like for mean film thicknesses above similar to 160 nm. These films can be very transparent with optical transmittance reaching as high as 92% for low thickness. The transmittance (550 nm) decreases with increasing thickness, consistent with an optical conductivity of 6472 S/m. The films are also very uniform; the transmittance varies spatially by typically <2%. The sheet resistance decreases with increasing thickness, falling below 1 Omega/square for thicknesses above 300 nm. The DC conductivity increases from 2 x 101 S/m for very thin films before saturating at 5 X 106 S/m for thicker films. Similarly, the ratio of DC to optical conductivity increases with increasing thickness from 25 for the thinnest films, saturating at similar to 500 for thicknesses above similar to 160 nm. We believe this Is the highest conductivity ratio ever observed for nanostructured films and is matched only by doped metal oxide films. These nanowire films are electromechanically very robust, with all but the thinnest films showing no change in sheet resistance when flexed over >1000 cycles. Such results make these films ideal as replacements for indium tin oxide as transparent electrodes. We have prepared films with optical transmittance and sheet resistance of 85% and 13 Omega/square, respectively. This is very close to that displayed by commercially available indium tin oxide.

J	Kay, A; Cesar, I; Grätzel, M				Kay, Andreas; Cesar, Ilkay; Graetzel, Michael			New benchmark for water photooxidation by nanostructured α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> films	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Thin films of silicon-doped Fe2O3 were deposited by APCVD (atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition) from Fe(CO)(5) and TEOS (tetraethoxysilane) on SnO2-coated glass at 415 degrees C. HRSEM reveals a highly developed dendritic nanostructure of 500 nm thickness having a feature size of only 1020 nm at the surface. Real surface area determination by dye adsorption yields a roughness factor of 21. XRD shows the films to be pure hematite with strong preferential orientation of the [110] axis vertical to the substrate, induced by silicon doping. Under illumination in 1 M NaOH, water is oxidized at the Fe2O3 electrode with higher efficiency (IPCE = 42% at 370 nm and 2.2 mA/cm(2) in AM 1.5 G sunlight of 1000 W/m(2) at 1.23 V-RHE) than at the best reported single crystalline Fe2O3 electrodes. This unprecedented efficiency is in part attributed to the dendritic nanostructure which minimizes the distance photogenerated holes have to diffuse to reach the Fe2O3/electrolyte interface while still allowing efficient light absorption. Part of the gain in efficiency is obtained by depositing a thin insulating SiO2 interfacial layer between the SnO2 substrate and the Fe2O3 film and a catalytic cobalt monolayer on the Fe2O3 surface. A mechanistic model for water photooxidation is presented, involving stepwise accumulation of four holes by two vicinal iron or cobalt surface sites.

Herein, a "brightener-inspired'' polyamide coating layer which elevates the nucleation barrier and restricts Zn2+ 2D diffusion is constructed to effectively regulate the aqueous Zn deposition behavior. Importantly, serving as a buffer layer that isolates active Zn from bulk electrolytes, this interphase also suppresses free water/O2-induced corrosion and passivation. With this synergy effect, the polymermodified Zn anode produces reversible, dendrite-free plating/stripping with a 60-fold enhancement in running lifetime (over 8000 hours) compared to the bare Zn, and even at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10 mA h cm(-2) (10 mA cm(-2) for 1 h, 85% depth of discharge).

In neuromorphic engineering(5,6), emulation of known neural behaviour has proven to be difficult to implement in software because of the highly complex interconnected nature of thought processes. Here we report the discovery of a Ag2S inorganic synapse, which emulates the synaptic functions of both STP and LTP characteristics through the use of input pulse repetition time. The structure known as an atomic switch(7,8), operating at critical voltages, stores information as STP with a spontaneous decay of conductance level in response to intermittent input stimuli, whereas frequent stimulation results in a transition to LTP. The Ag2S inorganic synapse has interesting characteristics with analogies to an individual biological synapse, and achieves dynamic memorization in a single device without the need of external preprogramming. A psychological model related to the process of memorizing and forgetting is also demonstrated using the inorganic synapses. Our Ag2S element indicates a breakthrough in mimicking synaptic behaviour essential for the further creation of artificial neural systems that emulate characteristics of human memory.

The stability of the materials with respect to the most common solvents, acids, and bases is determined by combining XRPD and TGA/MS techniques. The structures of the two forms of UiO-66 are refined through an interactive XRPD/EXAFS approach and validated by ab initio calculations. Experimental and calculated IR spectra are reported and compared to enlighten the nature of vibrational modes upon dehydroxylation and to show the complete reversibility of the dehydration/hydration phenomenon. Experimental and calculated band gaps are also reported and compared. In this work, we show the necessity to combine, in a synergic way, different experimental techniques and periodic ab initio approaches to disclose and fully understand the nature of complex novel materials such as UiO-66 on structural, vibrational, and electronic grounds. The correct structure refinement could not be possible using one of these three approaches alone, in particular, XRPD data were unable to detect an important distortion of the Zr6O6 units of the dehydrated material that was, however, foreseen in the ab initio calculations and measured in the EXAFS spectra.

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												We have synthesized, characterized, and computationally simulated/validated the behavior of two new metal organic framework (MOF) materials displaying the highest experimental Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of any porous materials reported to date (similar to 7000 m(2)/g). Key to evacuating the initially solvent-filled materials without pore collapse, and thereby accessing the ultrahigh areas, is the use of a supercritical CO2 activation technique. Additionally, we demonstrate computationally that by shifting from phenyl groups to "space efficient" acetylene moieties as linker expansion units, the hypothetical maximum surface area for a MOF material is substantially greater than previously envisioned (similar to 14600 m(2)/g (or greater) versus similar to 10500 m(2)/g).

Impact of preparation and handling on the hydrogen storage properties of Zn<sub>4</sub>O(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)<sub>3</sub> (MOF-5)	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												The prototypical metal-organic framework Zn4O(BDC)(3) (MOF-5, BDC2- = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) decomposes gradually in humid air to form a nonporous solid. Recognizing this, improved procedures for its synthesis and handling were developed, leading to significant increases in N-2 and H-2 gas adsorption capacities. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured at 77 K reveal an enhanced maximum N-2 uptake of 44.5 mmol/g and a BET surface area of 3800 m(2)/g, compared to the 35.8 mmol/g and 3100 m(2)/g obtained for a sample prepared using previous methods. High-pressure H-2 adsorption isotherms show improvements from 5.0 to 7.1 excess wt % at 77 K and 40 bar. The total H-2 uptake was further observed to climb to 11.5 wt % at 170 bar, corresponding to a volumetric storage density of 77 g/L. Thus, the air-free compound exhibits the highest gravimetric and volumetric H-2 uptake capacities yet demonstrated for a cryogenic hydrogen storage material. Moreover, no loss of capacity was apparent during 24 complete adsorption-desorption cycles, while kinetics measurements showed a loading time of 2 min with application of just 45 bar of pressure.

The development of efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting has drawn much attention. However, catalysts that are active for both the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are rare. Herein, we show for the first time that nickel phosphide (Ni2P), an excellent hydrogen evolving catalyst, is also highly active for oxygen evolution. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is generated at an overpotential of only 290mV in 1M KOH. The high activity is attributed to the core-shell (Ni2P/NiOx) structure that the material adopts under catalytic conditions. The Ni2P nanoparticles can serve as both cathode and anode catalysts for an alkaline electrolyzer, which generates 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.63 V.

Here we report a low-temperature, environmentally benign, solution-based approach for the preparation of complex and oriented ZnO nanostructures, and the systematic modification of their crystal morphology. Using controlled seeded growth and citrate anions that selectively adsorb on ZnO basal planes as the structure-directing agent, we prepared large arrays of oriented ZnO nanorods with controlled aspect ratios, complex film morphologies made of oriented nanocolumns and nanoplates (remarkably similar to biomineral structures in red abalone shells) and complex bilayers showing in situ column-to-rod morphological transitions. The advantages of some of these ZnO structures for photocatalytic decompositions of volatile organic compounds were demonstrated. The novel ZnO nanostructures are expected to have great potential for sensing, catalysis, optical emission, piezoelectric transduction, and actuations.					Xu, HF/KOD-6035-2024; Tian, Z.

In general, such sensors contain a number of circuits or complex layered matrix arrays. Here, we present a simple architecture for a flexible and highly sensitive strain sensor that enables the detection of pressure, shear and torsion. The device is based on two interlocked arrays of high-aspect-ratio Pt-coated polymeric nanofibres that are supported on thin polydimethylsiloxane layers. When different sensing stimuli are applied, the degree of interconnection and the electrical resistance of the sensor changes in a reversible, directional manner with specific, discernible strain-gauge factors. The sensor response is highly repeatable and reproducible up to 10,000 cycles with excellent on/off switching behaviour. We show that the sensor can be used to monitor signals ranging from human heartbeats to the impact of a bouncing water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface.

Anomalous Zero-Bias Conductance Peak in a Nb-InSb Nanowire-Nb Hybrid Device	NANO LETTERS												Semiconductor InSb nanowires are expected to provide an excellent material platform for the study of Majorana fermions in solid state systems. Here, we report on the realization of a Nb-InSb nanowire-Nb hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap Delta(InSb) similar to 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value, at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is E-z similar to Delta(Insb), is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the InSb nanowire.

Further development of large, flexible displays requires a cost-effective manufacturing process for the active-matrix backplane, which contains one transistor per pixel. One way to further reduce costs is to integrate (part of) the display drive circuitry, such as row shift registers, directly on the display substrate. Here, we demonstrate flexible active-matrix monochrome electrophoretic displays based on solution-processed organic transistors on 25-mum-thick polyimide substrates. The displays can be bent to a radius of 1 cm without significant loss in performance. Using the same process flow we prepared row shift registers. With 1,888 transistors, these are the largest organic integrated circuits reported to date. More importantly, the operating frequency of 5 kHz is sufficiently high to allow integration with the display operating at video speed. This work therefore represents a major step towards 'system-on-plastic'.

Experimental parameters, such as the concentration of AgNO3 (the precursor to silver), the molar ratio between poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, the capping agent) and AgNO3, and the strength of chemical interaction between PVP and various crystallographic planes of silver, were found to determine the crystallinity of seeds (e.g., single crystal versus decahedral multiply twinned particles). In turn, the crystallinity of a seed and the extent of the PVP coverage on the seed were both instrumental in controlling the morphology of final product. The ability to generate silver nanostructures with well-defined morphologies provides a great opportunity to experimentally and systematically study the relationship between their properties and geometric shapes.

J	Hu, XS; Li, SB; Peng, H				Hu, Xiaosong; Li, Shengbo; Peng, Huei			A comparative study of equivalent circuit models for Li-ion batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES												This paper presents a comparative study of twelve equivalent circuit models for Li-ion batteries. These twelve models were selected from state-of-the-art lumped models reported in the literature. The test data used is obtained from a battery test system with a climate chamber. The test schedule is designed to measure key cell attributes under highly dynamical excitations. The datasets were collected from two types of Li-ion cells under three different temperatures. The multi-swarm particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to identify the optimal model parameters for the two types of Li-ion cells. The usefulness of these models is then studied through a comprehensive evaluation by examining model complexity, model accuracy, and robustness of the model by applying the model to datasets obtained from other cells of the same chemistry type.

J	Kempton, W; Tomic, J				Kempton, W; Tomic, J			Vehicle-to-grid power fundamentals: Calculating capacity and net revenue	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES												As the light vehicle fleet moves to electric drive (hybrid, battery, and fuel cell vehicles), an opportunity opens for "vehicle-to-grid" (V2G) power. This article defines the three vehicle types that can produce V2G power, and the power markets they can sell into. V2G only makes sense if the vehicle and power market are matched. For example, V2G appears to be unsuitable for baseload power-the constant round-the-clock electricity supply-because baseload power can be provided more cheaply by large generators, as it is today. Rather, V2G's greatest near-term promise is for quick-response, high-value electric services. These quick-response electric services are purchased to balance constant fluctuations in load and to adapt to unexpected equipment failures; they account for 5-10% of electric cost-$12 billion per year in the US. This article develops equations to calculate the capacity for grid power from three types of electric drive vehicles. These equations are applied to evaluate revenue and costs for these vehicles to supply electricity to three electric markets (peak power, spinning reserves, and regulation). The results suggest that the engineering rationale and economic motivation for V2G power are compelling. The societal advantages of developing V2G include an additional revenue stream for cleaner vehicles, increased stability and reliability of the electric grid, lower electric system costs, and eventually, inexpensive storage and backup for renewable electricity.

We report the design, formation and testing of QD-protein assemblies that function as chemical sensors. In these assemblies, multiple copies of Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) coordinate to each QD by a C-terminal oligohistidine segment and function as sugar receptors. Sensors are self-assembled in solution in a controllable manner. In one configuration, a beta-cyclodextrin-QSY9 dark quencher conjugate bound in the MBP saccharide binding site results in fluorescence resonance energy-transfer (FRET) quenching of QD photoluminescence. Added maltose displaces the beta-cyclodextrin-QSY9, and QD photoluminescence increases in a systematic manner. A second maltose sensor assembly consists of QDs coupled with Cy3-labelled MBP bound to beta-cyclodextrin-Cy3.5. In this case, the QD donor drives sensor function through a two-step FRET mechanism that overcomes inherent QD donor-acceptor distance limitations. Quantum dot-biomolecule assemblies constructed using these methods may facilitate development of new hybrid sensing materials.

Size-Dependent Bacterial Growth Inhibition and Mechanism of Antibacterial Activity of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles	LANGMUIR												The antibacterial properties of zinc oxide nanoparticles were investigated using both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. These studies demonstrate that ZnO nanoparticles have a wide range of antibacterial activities toward various microorganisms that are commonly found in environmental settings. The antibacterial activity of the ZnO nanoparticles was inversely proportional to the size of the nanoparticles in S. aureus. Surprisingly, the antibacterial activity did not require specific UV activation using artificial lamps, rather activation was achieved under ambient lighting conditions. Northern analyses of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) specific genes and confocal microscopy suggest that the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles might involve both the production of reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of nanoparticles in the cytoplasm or on the outer membranes. Overall, the experimental results suggest that ZnO nanoparticles could be developed as antibacterial agents against a wide range of microorganisms to control and prevent the spreading and persistence of bacterial infections.

However, the hydrophilicity of MXene films may affect their stability and reliability when applied in moist or wet environments. Herein, for the first time, an efficient and facile approach is reported to fabricate freestanding, flexible, and hydrophobic MXene foam with reasonable strength by assembling MXene sheets into films followed by a hydrazine-induced foaming process. In striking contrast to well-known hydrophilic MXene materials, the MXene foams surprisingly exhibit hydrophobic surfaces and outstanding water resistance and durability. More interestingly, a much enhanced EMI-shielding effectiveness of approximate to 70 dB is achieved for the lightweight MXene foam as compared to its unfoamed film counterpart (53 dB) due to the highly efficient wave attenuation in the favorable porous structure. Therefore, the hydrophobic, flexible, and lightweight MXene foam with an excellent EMI-shielding performance is highly promising for applications in aerospace and portable and wearable smart electronics.					zhang, hao-bin/Y-9093-2018; Liu, Ji/JOZ-2064-2023; Zhou, Aiguo/B-3560-2008; Yu, Zhong-Zhen/M-2252-2018	Zhou, Aiguo/0000-0002-0029-9060; Yu, Zhong-Zhen/0000-0001-8357-3362													0935-9648	1521-4095				OCT 11	2017	29	38							1702367	10.1002/adma.201702367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adma.201702367								28799671					WOS:000412452500011

This work focuses on the design of two medium band gap (similar to 2.0 eV) copolymers for use in photovoltaic cells which are designed to possess a high hole mobility and low highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels. The resulting fluorinated polymer PBnDT-FTAZ exhibits efficiencies above 7% when blended with [6,6]-phenyl C-61-butyric acid methyl ester in a typical bulk heterojunction, and efficiencies above 6% are still maintained at an active layer thicknesses of 1 mu m. PBnDT-FTAZ outperforms poly(3-hexylthiophene), the current medium band gap polymer of choice, and thus is a viable candidate for use in highly efficient tandem cells. PBnDT-FTAZ also highlights other performance criteria which contribute to high photovoltaic efficiency, besides a low band gap.

J	Yeh, JW				Yeh, Jien-Wei			Recent progress in high-entropy alloys	ANNALES DE CHIMIE-SCIENCE DES MATERIAUX												The thirty or so presently used common alloy systems are typically based on one or, at most, two elements. It has been considered that alloys consisting of a greater number of principal elements will form complicated and brittle microstructures, and hence research regarding such multi-principal-element alloys has received very limited attention. It was suggested by Yeh in 1995, however, that alloy systems with five or more metallic elements will in fact possess higher mixing entropies, and therefore favour the formation of multielement solid-solution phases, as opposed to the inferred complex structures consisting of many intermetallic compounds. Indeed, work over the past decade into such multi-principal-element alloys, which have fittingly been coined as "high-entropy alloys" (HE alloys), has found them to form simple phases with nanocrystalline and even amorphous structures. In addition to the high-entropy effect, these structural characteristics are ascribed to the large lattice distortion and sluggish diffusion of such multielemental mixtures. Dependant upon the composition and/or processing route, HE alloys have been found to possess a wide spectrum of microstructures and properties. The superior properties exhibited by HE alloys over conventional alloys, along with the huge number of possible compositions that may give new phenomena and functional uses, makes these proposed HE alloys of great interest not only from a research perspective but also in numerous industrial applications. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress made on HE alloys, and possible future directions.																			0151-9107	1958-5934				NOV-DEC	2006	31	6					633	648		10.3166/acsm.31.633-648	http://dx.doi.org/10.3166/acsm.31.633-648													WOS:000242739500001

We investigate the coupling between pairs of elliptical metal particles by simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that the resonant wavelength peak of two interacting particles is red-shifted from that of a single particle because of near-field coupling. It is also found that the shift decays approximately exponentially with increasing particle spacing and become negligible when the gap between the two particles exceeds about 2.5 times the particle short-axis length.

Chemical compositions of the fractionated clusters determined previously by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (Negishi, Y. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 6518) were reassessed by taking advantage of freshly prepared samples, higher mass resolution, and more accurate mass calibration; the nine smallest components are reassigned to Au-10(SG)(10), Au-15(SG)(13), Au-18(SG)(14), Au-22(SG)(16), Au-22(SG)(17), Au-25(SG)(18), Au-29(SG)(20), Au-33(SG)(22), and Au-39(SG)(24). These assignments were further confirmed by measuring the mass spectra of the isolated Au:S(h-G) clusters, where h-GSH is a homoglutathione. It is proposed that a series of the isolated Au:SG clusters corresponds to kinetically trapped intermediates of the growing Au cores. The relative abundance of the isolated clusters was correlated well with the thermodynamic stabilities against unimolecular decomposition. The electronic structures of the isolated Au:SG clusters were probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optical spectroscopy. The Au(4f) XPS spectra illustrate substantial electron donation from the gold cores to the GS ligands in the Au:SG clusters. The optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra indicate that the electronic structures of the Au:SG clusters are well quantized; embryos of the sp band of the bulk gold evolve remarkably depending on the number of the gold atoms and GS ligands. The comparison of these spectral data with those of sodium Au(I) thiomalate and 1.8 nm Au:SG nanocrystals (NCs) reveals that the subnanometer-sized Au clusters thiolated constitute a distinct class of binary system which lies between the Au(I)-thiolate complexes and thiolate-protected Au NCs.

The program adopts atom-centered Gaussian-type functions as a basis set, which makes it possible to perform all-electron as well as pseudopotential calculations. Systems of any periodicity can be treated at the same level of accuracy (from 0D molecules, clusters and nanocrystals, to 1D polymers, helices, nanorods, and nanotubes, to 2D monolayers and slab models for surfaces, to actual 3D bulk crystals), without any artificial repetition along nonperiodic directions for 0-2D systems. Density functional theory calculations can be performed with a variety of functionals belonging to several classes: local-density (LDA), generalized-gradient (GGA), meta-GGA, global hybrid, range-separated hybrid, and self-consistent system-specific hybrid. In particular, hybrid functionals can be used at a modest computational cost, comparable to that of pure LDA and GGA formulations, because of the efficient implementation of exact nonlocal Fock exchange. Both translational and point-symmetry features are fully exploited at all steps of the calculation, thus drastically reducing the corresponding computational cost. The various properties computed encompass electronic structure (including magnetic spin-polarized open-shell systems, electron density analysis), geometry (including full or constrained optimization, transition-state search), vibrational properties (frequencies, infrared and Raman intensities, phonon density of states), thermal properties (quasi-harmonic approximation), linear and nonlinear optical properties (static and dynamic [hyper]polarizabilities), strain properties (elasticity, piezoelectricity, photoelasticity), electron transport properties (Boltzmann, transport across nanojunctions), as well as X-ray and inelastic neutron spectra. The program is distributed in serial, parallel, and massively parallel versions.

Aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction at Very Low Overpotential on Oxide-Derived Au Nanoparticles	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												Carbon dioxide reduction is an essential component of many prospective technologies for the renewable synthesis of carbon-containing fuels. Known catalysts for this reaction generally suffer from low energetic efficiency, poor product selectivity, and rapid deactivation. We show that the reduction of thick Au oxide films results in the formation of Au nanoparticles ("oxide-derived Au") that exhibit highly selective CO2 reduction to CO in water at overpotentials as low as 140 mV and retain their activity for at least 8 h. Under identical conditions, polycrystalline Au electrodes and several other nano-structured Au electrodes prepared via alternative methods require at least 200 mV of additional overpotential to attain comparable CO2 reduction activity and rapidly lose their activity. Electrokinetic studies indicate that the improved catalysis is linked to dramatically increased stabilization of the CO2 center dot- intermediate on the surfaces of the oxide-derived Au electrodes.

These values are correlated with microscope images in which the uptake of the particles by the cells has been investigated. Our data suggest that in addition to the release of toxic Cd2+ ions from the particles also their surface chemistry, in particular their stability toward aggregation, plays an important role for cytotoxic effects. Additional patch clamp experiments investigate effects of the particles on currents through ion channels.

J	Zhang, HZ; Banfield, JF				Zhang, HZ; Banfield, JF			Understanding polymorphic phase transformation behavior during growth of nanocrystalline aggregates:: Insights from TiO<sub>2</sub>	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												To understand the impact of particle size on phase stability and phase transformation during growth of nanocrystalline aggregates we conducted experiments using titania (TiO2) samples consisting of nanocrystalline anatase (46.7 wt %, 5.1 nm) and brookite (53.3 wt %, 8.1 nm). Reactions were studied isochronally at reaction times of 2 h in the temperature range 598-1023 K and isothermally at 723, 853, and 973 K by X-ray diffraction (XRD). A numerical deconvolution method was developed to separate overlapping XRD peaks, and an analytical method for determining phase contents of anatase, brookite, and rutile from XRD data was established. Results show that, in contrast to previous studies, anatase in our samples transforms to brookite and/or rutile before brookite transforms to rutile. Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses further support this conclusion. For general titania samples, the transformation sequence among anatase and brookite depends on the initial particle sizes of anatase and brookite, since particle sizes determine the thermodynamic phase stability at ultrafine sizes. These results highlight extremely important size-dependent behavior that may be expected in other nanocrystalline systems where multiple polymorphs are possible.

Voxel-based 3D convolutional networks have been used for some time to enhance the retention of information when processing point cloud LiDAR data. However, problems remain, including a slow inference speed and low orientation estimation performance. We therefore investigate an improved sparse convolution method for such networks, which significantly increases the speed of both training and inference. We also introduce a new form of angle loss regression to improve the orientation estimation performance and a new data augmentation approach that can enhance the convergence speed and performance. The proposed network produces state-of-the-art results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmarks while maintaining a fast inference speed.																				1424-8220				OCT	2018	18	10							3337	10.3390/s18103337	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18103337								30301196					WOS:000448661500165

However, the task of generating excited states with long lifetimes has been met with limited success, owing to the ultrafast deactivation of the highly active excited states(5). Here, we present a design rule that can be used to tune the emission lifetime of a wide range of luminescent organic molecules, based on effective stabilization of triplet excited states through strong coupling in H-aggregated molecules. Our experimental data revealed that luminescence lifetimes up to 1.35 s, which are several orders of magnitude longer than those of conventional organic fluorophores(6,7), can be realized under ambient conditions. These results outline a fundamental principle to design organic molecules with extended lifetimes of excited states, providing a major step forward in expanding the scope of organic phosphorescence applications.

An Automated Force Field Topology Builder (ATB) and Repository: Version 1.0	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION												The Automated force field Topology Builder (ATB, http://compbio.biosci.uq.edu.au/atb) is a Web-accessible server that can provide topologies and parameters for a wide range of molecules appropriate for use in molecular simulations, computational drug design, and X-ray refinement. The ATB has three primary functions: (1) to act as a repository for molecules that have been parametrized as part of the GROMOS family of force fields, (2) to act as a repository for pre-equilibrated systems for use as starting configurations in molecular dynamics simulations (solvent mixtures, lipid systems pre-equilibrated to adopt a specific phase, etc.), and (3) to generate force field descriptions of novel molecules compatible with the GROMOS family of force fields in a variety of formats (GROMOS, GROMACS, and CNS). Force field descriptions of novel molecules are derived using a multistep process in which results from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are combined with a knowledge-based approach to ensure compatibility (as far as possible) with a specific parameter set of the GROM:OS force field. The ATB has several unique features: (1) It requires that the user stipulate the protonation and tautomeric states of the molecule. (2) The symmetry of the molecule is analyzed to ensure that equivalent atoms are assigned identical parameters. (3) Charge groups are assigned automatically. (4) Where the assignment of a given parameter is ambiguous, a range of possible alternatives is provided. The ATB also provides several validation tools to assist the user to assess the degree to which the topology generated may be appropriate for a given task. In addition to detailing the steps involved in generating a force field topology compatible with a specific GROMOS parameter set (GROMOS 53A6), the challenges involved in the automatic generation of force field parameters for atomic simulations in general are discussed.

Solution-processed small-molecule solar cells with 6.7% efficiency	NATURE MATERIALS												Organic photovoltaic devices that can be fabricated by simple processing techniques are under intense investigation in academic and industrial laboratories because of their potential to enable mass production of flexible and coste-ffective devices(1,2). Most of the attention has been focused on solution-processed polymer bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells3-7. A combination of polymer design, morphology control, structural insight and device engineering has led to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching the 6-8% range for conjugated polymer/fullerene blends(8,9). Solution-processed small-molecule BHJ (SM BHJ) solar cells have received less attention, and their efficiencies have remained below those of their polymeric counterparts(10). Here, we report efficient solution-processed SM BHJ solar cells based on a new molecular donor, DTS(PTTh2)(2). A record PCE of 6.7% under AM 1.5G irradiation (100mWcm(-2)) is achieved for small-molecule BHJ devices from DTS(PTTh2)(2) V PC70BM (donor to acceptor ratio of 7: 3). This high efficiency was obtained by using remarkably small percentages of solvent additive (0.25% v/v of 1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) during the film-forming process, which leads to reduced domain sizes in the BHJ layer. These results provide important progress for solution-processed organic photovoltaics and demonstrate that solar cells fabricated from small donor molecules can compete with their polymeric counterparts.

Nucleation and growth kinetics during the synthesis process was precisely controlled and AgNPs of average size 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 63, 85, and 100 nm were synthesized with good yield and monodispersity. We found the bacteriostatic/bactericidal effect of AgNPs to be size and dose-dependent as determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of silver nanoparticles against four bacterial strains. Out of the tested strains, Escherichia coli MTCC 443 and Staphylococcus aureus NCIM 5201 were found to be the most and least sensitive strains regardless of AgNP size. For AgNPs with less than 10 nm size, the antibacterial efficacy was significantly enhanced as revealed through delayed bacterial growth kinetics, corresponding MIC/MBC values and disk diffusion tests. AgNPs of the smallest size, i.e., 5 nm demonstrated the best results and mediated the fastest bactericidal activity against all the tested strains compared to AgNPs having 7 nm and 10 nm sizes at similar bacterial concentrations. TEM analysis of AgNP treated bacterial cells showed the presence of AgNPs on the cell membrane, and AgNPs internalized within the cells.

Engineered doping of organic semiconductors for enhanced thermoelectric efficiency	NATURE MATERIALS												Significant improvements to the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT have emerged in recent years, primarily due to the engineering of material composition and nanostructure in inorganic semiconductors(1) (ISCs). However, many present high-ZT materials are based on low-abundance elements that pose challenges for scale-up, as they entail high material costs in addition to brittleness and difficulty in large-area deposition. Here we demonstrate a strategy to improve ZT in conductive polymers and other organic semiconductors (OSCs) for which the base elements are earth-abundant. By minimizing total dopant volume, we show that all three parameters constituting ZT vary in a manner so that ZT increases; this stands in sharp contrast to ISCs, for which these parameters have trade-offs. Reducing dopant volume is found to be as important as optimizing carrier concentration when maximizing ZT in OSCs. Implementing this strategy with the dopant poly(styrenesulphonate) in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), we achieve ZT = 0.42 at room temperature.

The first step of this procedure involved the formation of platinum nanoparticles by reducing PtCl2 With ethylene glycol heated to similar to160 degreesC. Due to their close match in crystal structure and lattice constants, these platinum nanoparticles could serve as seeds for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of silver that was produced in the solution via the reduction of AgNO3 with ethylene glycol. When surfactants such as poly(vinyl pyrrolldone) (PVP) were present in this solution, the silver could be directed to grow into uniform nanowires with aspect ratios as high as similar to1000. Measurements of transport property at room temperature indicated that these nanowires were electrically continuous with a conductivity of approximately 0.8 X 10(5) S/CM.

We develop a method for obtaining the thermochemistry of the electrochemical water splitting process as a function of the bias directly from the electronic structure calculations. We consider electrodes of Pt(111) and Au(111) in detail and then discuss trends for a series of different metals. We show that the difficult step in the water splitting process is the formation of superoxy-type (OOH) species on the surface by the splitting of a water molecule on top an adsorbed oxygen atom. One conclusion is that this is only possible on metal surfaces that are (partly) oxidized. We show that the binding energies of the different intermediates are linearly correlated for a number of metals. In a simple analysis, where the linear relations are assumed to be obeyed exactly, this leads to a universal relationship between the catalytic rate and the oxygen binding energy. Finally, we conclude that for systems obeying these relations, there is a limit to how good a water splitting catalyst an oxidized metal surface can become. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Rozas, I; Alkorta, I; Elguero, J				Rozas, I; Alkorta, I; Elguero, J			Behavior of ylides containing N, O, and C atoms as hydrogen bond accepters	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												The hydrogen bond (HB) basicity of a series of ylides containing nitrogen, oxygen, or carbon as heavy atoms, as well as the influence of the formation of the HE complexes on their structure, has been studied. In addition, in this paper we propose the formation of some rather strong HBs (that could be considered low-barrier hydrogen bonds, LBHBs) between ylides and different neutral molecules. The ylides chosen for the study were H3N+-N-H. Me3N+-N-H. H2O+-N-H, Me2O+-N-H, H2O+-O-, Me2O+-O-, and Me3N-C-H-2 As HE donors, classical donors such as HF, HCN, and HCCH were used. The analysis of the protonation energies of the ylides and the optimized geometries, interaction energies, and characteristics of the electron density of the complexes shows that these ylides are very good HE accepters, forming stable complexes even with weak HE donors. With strong donors, when the proton transfer did not take place, very strong HBs were formed with quite large interaction energies and very short HB distances which could be considered as LBHBs. Moreover, we have found that the sign of the Laplacian of the electron density at the bond critical point ((V) over bar rho (BCP)) and that of the energy density (H-BCP) could characterize the strength of HBs. Thus, weak HBs (E-1 < 12.0 kcal/mol) show both (V) over bar rho (BCP) and H-BCP > 0, and medium HBs (12.0 <E-1 < 24.0 kcal/mol) slow <(V)over bar>(2)rho (BCP) > 0 and H-BCP < 0. while strong HBs land therefore LBHBs: E-1 > 24.0 kcal/mol) show both (V) over bar rho (BCP) and H-BCP < 0.

In another scientific field, it is well understood that the excitation of localized plasmon polaritons on the surface of silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) causes a tremendous increase of the near-field amplitude at well-defined wavelengths in the near UV. The exact resonance wavelength depends on the shape and the dielectric environment of the NIPS. We expected that the photocatalytic behavior of TiO2 would be greatly boosted if it gets assisted by the enhanced near-field amplitudes of localized surface plasmon (LSP). Here we show that this is true indeed. We named this new phenomenon "plasmonic photocatalysis". The key to enable plasmonic photocatalysis is to deposit TiO2 on a NP comprising an Ag core covered with a silica (SiO2) shell to prevent oxidation of Ag by direct contact with TiO2. The most appropriate diameter for Ag NIPS and thickness for the SiO2 shell giving rise to LSP in the near UV were estimated from Mie scattering theory. Upon implementing a device that took these design considerations into account, the measured photocatalytic activity under near UV illumination of such a plasmonic photocatalyst, monitored by decomposition of methylene blue, was enhanced by a factor of 7. The enhancement of the photocatalytic activity increases with a decreased thickness of the SiO2 shell. The plasmonic photocatalysis will be of use as a high performance photocatalyst in nearly all current applications but will be of particular importance for applications in locations of minimal light exposure.

The first step of this process involved the formation of Pt (or Ag) nanoparticles by reducing PtCl2 (or AgNO3) with ethylene glycol (EG) heated to similar to160 degreesC. These Pt (or Ag) nanoparticles could serve as seeds for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of silver (formed by reducing AgNO3 with EG) because of their close match in crystal structure and lattice constants. In the presence of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), the growth of silver could be directed into a highly anisotropic mode to form uniform nanowires with aspect ratios as high as similar to1000. UV-visible spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, XRD, and electron diffraction were used to characterize these silver nanowires, indicating the formation of a highly pure phase, as well as a uniform diameter and bicrystalline structure. Both morphology and aspect ratios of these silver nanostructures could be varied from nanoparticles and nanorods to long nanowires by adjusting the reaction conditions, including the ratio of PVP to silver nitrate, reaction temperature, and seeding conditions. Measurements of the transport properties at room temperature indicated that these silver nanowires were electrically continuous with a conductivity (similar to0.8 x 10(5) S/cm) approaching that of bulk silver.

J	Soldano, C; Mahmood, A; Dujardin, E				Soldano, Caterina; Mahmood, Ather; Dujardin, Erik			Production, properties and potential of graphene	CARBON												This review on graphene, a one-atom thick, two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, starts with a general description of the graphene electronic structure as well as a basic experimental toolkit for identifying and handling this material. Owing to the versatility of graphene properties and projected applications, several production techniques are summarized, ranging from the mechanical exfoliation of high-quality graphene to the direct growth on carbides or metal substrates and from the chemical routes using graphene oxide to the newly developed approach at the molecular level. The most promising and appealing properties of graphene are summarized from an exponentially growing literature, with a particular attention to matching production methods to characteristics and to applications. In particular, we report on the high carrier mobility value in suspended and annealed samples for electronic devices, on the thickness-dependent optical transparency and, in the mechanical section, on the high robustness and full integration of graphene in sensing device applications. Finally, we emphasize on the high potential of graphene not only as a post-silicon materials for CMOS device application but more ambitiously as a platform for post-CMOS molecular architecture in electronic information processing.

J	Plett, GL				Plett, GL			Extended Kalman filtering for battery management systems of LiPB-based HEV battery packs - Part 3. State and parameter estimation	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES												Battery management systems in hybrid-electric-vehicle battery packs must estimate values descriptive of the pack's present operating condition. These include: battery state-of-charge, power fade, capacity fade, and instantaneous available power. The estimation mechanism must adapt to changing cell characteristics as cells age and therefore provide accurate estimates over the lifetime of the pack. In a series of three papers, we propose methods, based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF), that are able to accomplish these goals for a lithium ion polymer battery pack. We expect that they will also work well on other battery chemistries. These papers cover the required mathematical background, cell modeling and system identification requirements, and the final solution, together with results. This third paper concludes the series by presenting five additional applications where either an EKF or results from EKF may be used in typical BMS algorithms: initializing state estimates after the vehicle has been idle for some time; estimating state-of-charge with dynamic error bounds on the estimate; estimating pack available dis/charge power; tracking changing pack parameters (including power fade and capacity fade) as the pack ages, and therefore providing a quantitative estimate of state-of-health; and determining which cells must be equalized. Results from pack tests are presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Jaguar: A high-performance quantum chemistry software program with strengths in life and materials sciences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY												Jaguar is an ab initio quantum chemical program that specializes in fast electronic structure predictions for molecular systems of medium and large size. Jaguar focuses on computational methods with reasonable computational scaling with the size of the system, such as density functional theory (DFT) and local second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory. The favorable scaling of the methods and the high efficiency of the program make it possible to conduct routine computations involving several thousand molecular orbitals. This performance is achieved through a utilization of the pseudospectral approximation and several levels of parallelization. The speed advantages are beneficial for applying Jaguar in biomolecular computational modeling. Additionally, owing to its superior wave function guess for transition-metal-containing systems, Jaguar finds applications in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry. The emphasis on larger systems and transition metal elements paves the way toward developing Jaguar for its use in materials science modeling. The article describes the historical and new features of Jaguar, such as improved parallelization of many modules, innovations in ab initio pKa prediction, and new semiempirical corrections for nondynamic correlation errors in DFT. Jaguar applications in drug discovery, materials science, force field parameterization, and other areas of computational research are reviewed. Timing benchmarks and other results obtained from the most recent Jaguar code are provided. The article concludes with a discussion of challenges and directions for future development of the program.

J	Hyeon, T				Hyeon, T			Chemical synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles	CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS												Recent advances in the synthesis of various magnetic nanoparticles using colloidal chemical approaches are reviewed. Typically, these approaches involve either rapid injection of reagents into hot surfactant solution followed by aging at high temperature, or the mixing of reagents at a low temperature and slow heating under controlled conditions. Spherical cobalt nanoparticles with various crystal structures have been synthesized by thermally decomposing dicobalt octacarbonyl or by reducing cobalt salts. Nanoparticles of Fe-Pt and other related iron or cobalt containing alloys have been made by simultaneously reacting their constituent precursors. Many different ferrite nanoparticles have been synthesized by the thermal decomposition of organometallic precursors followed by oxidation or by low-temperature reactions inside reverse micelles. Rod-shaped iron nanoparticles have been synthesized from the oriented growth of spherical nanoparticles, and cobalt nanodisks were synthesized from the thermal decomposition of dicobalt octacarbonyl in the presence of a mixture of two surfactants.

Austen			Energy applications of ionic liquids	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Ionic liquids offer a unique suite of properties that make them important candidates for a number of energy related applications. Cation-anion combinations that exhibit low volatility coupled with high electrochemical and thermal stability, as well as ionic conductivity, create the possibility of designing ideal electrolytes for batteries, super-capacitors, actuators, dye sensitised solar cells and thermo-electrochemical cells. In the field of water splitting to produce hydrogen they have been used to synthesize some of the best performing water oxidation catalysts and some members of the protic ionic liquid family co-catalyse an unusual, very high energy efficiency water oxidation process. As fuel cell electrolytes, the high proton conductivity of some of the protic ionic liquid family offers the potential of fuel cells operating in the optimum temperature region above 100 degrees C. Beyond electrochemical applications, the low vapour pressure of these liquids, along with their ability to offer tuneable functionality, also makes them ideal as CO2 absorbents for post-combustion CO2 capture. Similarly, the tuneable phase properties of the many members of this large family of salts are also allowing the creation of phase-change thermal energy storage materials having melting points tuned to the application. This perspective article provides an overview of these developing energy related applications of ionic liquids and offers some thoughts on the emerging challenges and opportunities.

J	Grimme, S				Grimme, Stefan			Supramolecular Binding Thermodynamics by Dispersion-Corrected Density Functional Theory	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL												The equilibrium association free enthalpies ?Ga for typical supramolecular complexes in solution are calculated by ab initio quantum chemical methods. Ten neutral and three positively charged complexes with experimental ?Ga values in the range 0 to -21 kcal?mol-1 (on average -6 kcal?mol-1) are investigated. The theoretical approach employs a (nondynamic) single-structure model, but computes the various energy terms accurately without any special empirical adjustments. Dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) with extended basis sets (triple-? and quadruple-? quality) is used to determine structures and gas-phase interaction energies (?E), the COSMO-RS continuum solvation model (based on DFT data) provides solvation free enthalpies and the remaining ro-vibrational enthalpic/entropic contributions are obtained from harmonic frequency calculations. Low-lying vibrational modes are treated by a free-rotor approximation. The accurate account of London dispersion interactions is mandatory with contributions in the range -5 to -60 kcal?mol-1 (up to 200?% of ?E). Inclusion of three-body dispersion effects improves the results considerably. A semilocal (TPSS) and a hybrid density functional (PW6B95) have been tested. Although the ?Ga values result as a sum of individually large terms with opposite sign (?E vs. solvation and entropy change), the approach provides unprecedented accuracy for ?Ga values with errors of only 2 kcal?mol-1 on average. Relative affinities for different guests inside the same host are always obtained correctly. The procedure is suggested as a predictive tool in supramolecular chemistry and can be applied routinely to semirigid systems with 300400 atoms. The various contributions to binding and enthalpyentropy compensations are discussed.

The inhibition of any secondary nucleation during homogeneous growth was controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions: temperature, gold precursor to seed particle concentration, and pH. This method presents improved results regarding the traditional Frens method in several aspects: (i) it produces particles of higher monodispersity; (ii) it allows better control of the gold nanoparticle size and size distribution; and (iii) it leads to higher concentrations. Gold nanoparticles synthesized following this method can be further functionalized with a wide variety of molecules, hence this method appears to be a promising candidate for application in the fields of biomedicine, photonics, and electronics, among others.

Exosomes as drug delivery vehicles for Parkinson's disease therapy	JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE												Exosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles that have attracted considerable attention as drug delivery vehicles in the past few years. Exosomes are comprised of natural lipid bilayers with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes. We posit that exosomes secreted by monocytes and macrophages can provide an unprecedented opportunity to avoid entrapment in mononuclear phagocytes (as a part of the host immune system), and at the same time enhance delivery of incorporated drugs to target cells ultimately increasing drug therapeutic efficacy. In light of this, we developed a new exosomal-based delivery system for a potent antioxidant, catalase, to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). Catalase was loaded into exosomes ex vivo using different methods: the incubation at room temperature, permeabilization with saponin, freeze-thaw cycles, sonication, or extrusion. The size of the obtained catalase-loaded exosomes (exoCAT) was in the range of 100-200 nm. A reformation of exosomes upon sonication and extrusion, or permeabilization with saponin resulted in high loading efficiency, sustained release, and catalase preservation against proteases degradation. Exosomes were readily taken up by neuronal cells in vitro. A considerable amount of exosomes was detected in PD mouse brain following intranasal administration. ExoCAT provided significant neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo models of PD. Overall, exosome-based catalase formulations have a potential to be a versatile strategy to treat inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhao, Y; Truhlar, DG				Zhao, Y; Truhlar, DG			Design of density functionals that are broadly accurate for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and nonbonded interactions	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A												This paper develops two new hybrid meta exchange-correlation functionals for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and nonbonded interactions. The new functionals are called PW6B95 (6-parameter functional based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation) and PWB6K (6-parameter functional for kinetics based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation). The resulting methods were comparatively assessed against the MGAE109/3 main group atomization energy database, against the IP13/3 ionization potential database, against the EA13/3 electron affinity database, against the HTBH38/4 and NHTBH38/04 hydrogen-transfer and non-hydrogen-transfer barrier height databases, against the HB6/04 hydrogen bonding database, against the CT7/04 charge-transfer complex database, against the DI6/04 dipole interaction database, against the WI7/05 weak interaction database, and against the new PPS5/05 pi-pi stacking interaction database. From the assessment and comparison of methods, we draw the following conclusions, based on an analysis of mean unsigned errors: (i) The PW6B95, MPW1B95, B98, B97-1, and TPSS1KCIS methods give the best results for a combination of thermochemistry and nonbonded interactions. (ii) PWB6K, MPWB1K, BB1K, MPW1K, and MPW1B95 give the best results for a combination of thermochemical kinetics and nonbonded interactions. (iii) PWB6K outperforms the MP2 method for nonbonded interactions. (iv) PW6B95 gives errors for main group covalent bond energies that are only 0.41 kcal (as measured by mean unsigned error per bond (MUEPB) for the MGAE109 database), as compared to 0.56 kcal/mol for the second best method and 0.92 kcal/mol for B3LYP.

J	Chatterjee, AK; Choi, TL; Sanders, DP; Grubbs, RH				Chatterjee, AK; Choi, TL; Sanders, DP; Grubbs, RH			A general model for selectivity in olefin cross metathesis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												In recent years, olefin cross metathesis (CM) has emerged as a powerful and convenient synthetic technique in organic chemistry; however, as a general synthetic method, CM has been limited by the lack of predictability in product selectivity and stereoselectivity. Investigations into olefin cross metathesis with several classes of olefins, including substituted and functionalized styrenes, secondary allylic alcohols, tertiary allylic alcohols, and olefins with alpha-quaternary centers, have led to a general model useful for the prediction of product selectivity and stereoselectivity in cross metathesis. As a general ranking of olefin reactivity in CM, olefins can be categorized by their relative abilities to undergo homodinnerization via cross metathesis and the susceptibility of their homodimers toward secondary metathesis reactions. When an olefin of high reactivity is reacted with an olefin of lower reactivity (sterically bulky, electron-deficient, etc.), selective cross metathesis can be achieved using feedstock stoichiometries as low as 1:1. By employing a metathesis catalyst with the appropriate activity, selective cross metathesis reactions can be achieved with a wide variety of electron-rich, electron-deficient, and sterically bulky olefins. Application of this model has allowed for the prediction and development of selective cross metathesis reactions, culminating in unprecedented three-component intermolecular cross metathesis reactions.

J	Sheppard, D; Terrell, R; Henkelman, G				Sheppard, Daniel; Terrell, Rye; Henkelman, Graeme			Optimization methods for finding minimum energy paths	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum energy pathways (MEPs) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).

Unique Cellular Interaction of Silver Nanoparticles: Size-Dependent Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B												The rapid advancement of nanotechnology has created a vast array of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) which have unique physical (size, shape, crystallinity, surface charge) and chemical (surface coating, elemental composition and solubility) attributes. These physicochemical properties of ENMs can produce chemical conditions to induce a pro-oxidant environment in the cells, causing an imbalanced cellular energy system dependent on redox potential and thereby leading to adverse biological consequences, ranging from the initiation of inflammatory pathways through to cell death. The present study was designed to evaluate size-dependent cellular interactions of known biologically active silver nanoparticles (NPs, Ag-15nm, Ag-30nm, and A-55nm). Alveolar macrophages provide the first defense and were studied for their potential role in initiating oxidative stress. Cell exposure produced morphologically abnormal sizes and adherence characteristics with significant NP uptake at high doses after 24 h. Toxicity evaluations using mitochondrial and cell membrane viability along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) were performed. After 24 h of exposure, viability metrics significantly decreased with increasing dose (10-75 mu g/mL-) of Ag-15nm and Ag-30nm NPs. A more than 10-fold increase of ROS levels in cells exposed to 50 mu g/mL A-15nm suggests that the cytotoxicity of Ag-15nm is likely to be mediated through oxidative stress. In addition, activation of the release of traditional inflammatory mediators were examined by measuring levels of cytokines/chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), released into the culture media. After 24 h of exposure to Ag-15nm nanoparticles, a significant inflammatory response was observed by the release of TNF-alpha, MIP-2, and IL- 1 beta. However, there was no detectable level of IL-6 upon exposure to silver nanoparticles. In Summary, a size-dependent toxicity was produced by silver nanoparticles, and one predominant mechanism of toxicity was found to be largely mediated through oxidative stress.																			1520-6106	1520-5207				OCT 30	2008	112	43					13608	13619		10.1021/jp712087m	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp712087m								18831567					WOS:000260357700019

Unfortunately its continued use is greatly limited by severe dose limiting side effects and intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Over the last 30 years, 23 other platinum-based drugs have entered clinical trials with only two (carboplatin and oxaliplatin) of these gaining international marketing approval, and another three (nedaplatin, lobaplatin and heptaplatin) gaining approval in individual nations. During this time there have been more failures than successes with the development of 14 drugs being halted during clinical trials. Currently there are four drugs in the various phases of clinical trial (satraplatin, picoplatin, Lipoplatin (TM) and ProLindac (TM)). No new small molecule platinum drug has entered clinical trials since 1999 which is representative of a shift in focus away from drug design and towards drug delivery in the last decade. In this perspective article we update the status of platinum anticancer drugs currently approved for use, those undergoing clinical trials and those discontinued during clinical trials, and discuss the results in the context of where we believe the field will develop over the next decade.

Parameter optimization based on small molecule and condensed phase macromolecular target data	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY												Empirical force-field calculations on biological molecules represent an effective method to obtain atomic detail information on the relationship of their structure to their function. Results from those calculations depend on the quality of the force field. In this manuscript, optimization of the CHARMM27 all-atom empirical force field for nucleic acids is presented together with the resulting parameters. The optimization procedure is based on the reproduction of small molecule target data from both experimental and quantum mechanical studies and condensed phase structural properties of DNA and RNA. Via an iterative approach, the parameters were primarily optimized to reproduce macromolecular target data while maximizing agreement with small molecule target data. This approach is expected to ensure that the different contributions from the individual moieties in the nucleic acids are properly balanced to yield condensed phase properties of DNA and RNA, which are consistent with experiment. The quality of the presented force field in reproducing both crystal and solution properties are detailed in the present and an accompanying manuscript (MacKerell and Banavali, J Comput Chem, this issue). The resultant parameters represent the latest step in the continued development of the CHARMM all-atom biomolecular force field for proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.

J	Vadivelan, V; Kumar, KV				Vadivelan, V; Kumar, KV			Equilibrium, kinetics, mechanism, and process design for the sorption of methylene blue onto rice husk	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												Batch experiments were carried out for the sorption of methylene blue onto rice husk particles. The operating variables studied were initial solution pH, initial dye concentration, adsorbent concentration, and contact time. Equilibrium data were fitted to the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm equations and the equilibrium data were found to be well represented by the Langmuir isotherm equation. The monolayer sorption capacity of rice husks for methylene blue sorption was found to be 40.5833 mg/g at room temperature (32 degrees C). The sorption was analyzed using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models and the sorption kinetics was found to follow a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Also the applicability of pseudo second order in modeling the kinetic data was also discussed. The sorption process was found to be controlled by both surface and pore diffusion with surface diffusion at the earlier stages followed by pore diffusion at the later stages. The average external mass transfer coefficient and intraparticle diffusion coefficient was found to be 0.01133 min(-1) and 0.695358 mg/g min(0.5). Analysis of sorption data using a Boyd plot confirms that external mass transfer is the rate limiting step in the sorption process. The effective diffusion coefficient, D-i was calculated using the Boyd constant and was found to be 5.05 x 10(-04) cm(2)/s for an initial dye concentration of 50 mg/L. A single-stage batch-adsorber design of the adsorption of methylene blue onto rice husk has been studied based on the Langmuir isotherm equation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096 eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082 eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of similar to 3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.

Gate-induced insulating state in bilayer graphene devices	NATURE MATERIALS												The potential of graphene-based materials consisting of one or a few layers of graphite for integrated electronics originates from the large room-temperature carrier mobility in these systems (similar to 10,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). However, the realization of electronic devices such as field-effect transistors will require controlling and even switching offthe electrical conductivity by means of gate electrodes, which is made difficult by the absence of a bandgap in the intrinsic material. Here, we demonstrate the controlled induction of an insulating state-with large suppression of the conductivity-in bilayer graphene, by using a double-gate device configuration that enables an electric field to be applied perpendicular to the plane. The dependence of the resistance on temperature and electric field, and the absence of any effect in a single-layer device, strongly suggest that the gate-induced insulating state originates from the recently predicted opening of a bandgap between valence and conduction bands.

The mechanisms by which quinones cause these effects can be quite complex. Quinones are Michael accepters, and cellular damage can occur through alkylation of crucial cellular proteins and/or DNA. Alternatively; quinones are highly redox active molecules which can redox cycle with their semiquinone radicals, leading to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and ultimately the hydroxyl radical. Production of ROS can cause severe oxidative stress within cells through the formation of oxidized cellular macromolecules, including lipids, proteins, and DNA. Formation of oxidatively damaged bases such as 8-oxodeoxyguanosine has been associated with aging and carcinogenesis. Furthermore, ROS can activate a number of signaling pathways, including protein kinase C and RAS. This review explores the varied cytotoxic effects of quinones using specific examples, including quinones produced from benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, estrogens, and catecholamines. The evidence strongly suggests that the numerous mechanisms of quinone toxicity (i.e., alkylation vs oxidative stress) can be correlated with the known pathology of the parent compound(s).

It has been shown that in these RTILs water molecules absorbed from the air are present mostly in the "free" (not self-associated) state, bound via H-bonding with [PF6](-), [BF4](-), [SbF6](-), [ClO4](-), [CF3SO3](-), [(CF3SO2)(2)N](-) with the concentrations of dissolved water in the range 0.2-1.0 mol dm(-3). It has been concluded that most of the water molecules at these concentrations exist in symmetric 1:2 type H-bonded complexes: anion . . . HOH . . . anion. Additional evidence that the preferred sites of interaction with water molecules are the anions has been obtained from the experiments with RTILs of the 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium and 1-butyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazolium cations. Water molecules can also form associated liquid-like formations in RTILs with anions of stronger basicity such as [NO3](-) and [CF3CO2](-). When these RTILs are exposed to air the water concentrations exceed 1.0 mol dm(-3). The strength of H-bonding between water molecules and anions increases in the order [PF6](-) <[SbF6](-) <[BF4](-) <[(CF3SO2)(2)N](-) <[ClO4](-) <[CF3SO3](-) <[NO3](-) <[CF3CO2](-).

The goal of this work is to develop active bifunctional catalyst materials for water oxidation and oxygen reduction. Drawing inspiration from a cubane-like CaMn4Ox, the biological catalyst found in the oxygen evolving center (OEC) in photosystem II, nanostructured manganese oxide surfaces were investigated for these reactions. Thin films of nanostructured manganese oxide were found to be active for both oxygen reduction and water oxidation, with similar overall oxygen electrode activity to the best known precious metal nanoparticle catalysts: platinum, ruthenium, and iridium. Physical and chemical characterization of the nanostructured Mn oxide bifunctional catalyst reveals an oxidation state of Mn(III), akin to one of the most commonly observed Mn oxidation states found in the OEC.

It has long been known that liquid molecules close to a solid surface form layered solid-like structures, but little is known about the connection between this nanolayer and the thermal properties of the suspensions. Here, we have modified the Maxwell equation for the effective thermal conductivity of solid/liquid suspensions to include the effect of this ordered nanolayer. Because this ordered nanolayer has a major impact on nanofluid thermal conductivity when the particle diameter is less than 10 nm, a new direction is indicated for development of next-generation coolants.																			1388-0764	1572-896X				APR	2003	5	1-2					167	171		10.1023/A:1024438603801	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024438603801													WOS:000183704000020

It was attempted to determine the feasibility of such a degradation by varying the chemical structures, either anthraquinonic (Alizarin S (AS)), or azoic (Crocein Orange G (OG), Methyl Red (MR), Congo Red (CR)) or heteropolyaromatic (Methylene Blue (MB)). In addition to a prompt removal of the colors, TiO2/UV-based photocatalysis was simultaneously able to fully oxidize the dyes, with a complete mineralization of carbon into CO2. Sulfur heteroatoms were converted into innocuous SO(4)(2-)ions. The mineralization of nitrogen was more complex. Nitrogen atoms in the -3 oxidation state, such as in amino-groups, remain at this reduction degree and produced NH4+ cations, subsequently and very slowly converted into NO3- ions. For azo-dye (OG, MR, CR) degradation, the complete mass balance in nitrogen indicated that the central -N=N- azo-group was converted in gaseous dinitrogen, which is the ideal issue for the elimination of nitrogen-containing pollutants, not only for environmental photocatalysis but also for any physicochemical method. The aromatic rings were submitted to successive attacks by photogenerated OH. radicals leading to hydroxylated metabolites before the ring opening and the final evolution of CO2 induced by repeated subsequent "photo-Kolbe" reactions with carboxylic intermediates.

We show that use of locally dense basis sets (LDBS) vs full basis sets gives very similar results for monosubstituted phenols, and that the: LDBS procedure gives good agreement with the change in experimental BDE values for highly substituted phenols in benzene solvent. Procedures for estimating the O-H BDE based on group additivity rules are given and tested. Several interesting classes of phenolic antioxidants are studied with these methods, including commercial antioxidants used as food additives, compounds related to Vitamin E, flavonoids in tea, aminophenols, stilbenes related to resveratrol, and sterically hindered phenols. On the basis of these results we are able to interpret relative rates for the reaction of antioxidants with free radicals, including a comparison of both H-atom-transfer and single-electron-transfer mechanisms, and conclude that in most cases H-atom transfer will be dominant.

It is based on assigning penalty points to parameters of an analytical process that are not in agreement with the ideal green analysis. This approach compares different parameters and different steps of the analytical process. Traditional green chemistry metrics (e.g., Atom Economy, E-factor and Reaction Mass Efficiency), which were introduced for organic preparations, do not usually fit the purposes of green analytical chemistry. Existing databases for evaluation of green analytical methods refer to known procedures and instruments, and do not encourage new, more environmentally-friendly equivalents. As an alternative to traditional green chemistry metrics, the analytical Eco-Scale can be a good, semi-quantitative tool. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using the new scaling factor, the vibrational frequencies calculated with the triple-zeta basis set 6-311+G(d,p) give significantly better accuracy than those calculated with the double-zeta 6-31G(d) basis set. Scale factors were also determined for low-frequency vibrations using the molecular set of 125 molecules and for zero-point energies using a smaller set of 40 molecules. We have studied the effect on the calculated vibrational frequencies for various combinations of diffuse and polarization functions added to the triple-zeta 6-311G basis set. The 6-311+G(d,p) basis set is found to give almost converged frequencies for most molecules, and we conclude that our optimum scaling factors are valid for the basis sets 6-311 G(d,p) to 6-311++G(3df,3pd). The new scale factors are 0.9679 for vibrational frequencies, 1.0100 for low-frequency vibrations, and 0.9877 for zero-point vibrational energies.

However, the dependence on expensive Pt-based electrocatalysts in such fuel cells remains a major obstacle for a widespread deployment of this technology. One solution to overcome this predicament is to reduce the Pt content by a factor of ten by replacing the Pt-based catalysts with non-precious metal catalysts at the oxygen-reducing cathode. Fe-and Co-based electrocatalysts for this reaction have been studied for over 50 years, but they were insufficiently active for the high efficiency and power density needed for transportation fuel cells. Recently, several breakthroughs occurred that have increased the activity and durability of non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs), which can now be regarded as potential competitors to Pt-based catalysts. This review focuses on the new synthesis methods that have led to these breakthroughs. A modeling analysis is also conducted to analyze the improvements required from NPMC-based cathodes to match the performance of Pt-based cathodes, even at high current density. While no further breakthrough in volume-specific activity of NPMCs is required, incremental improvements of the volume-specific activity and effective protonic conductivity within the fuel-cell cathode are necessary. Regarding durability, NPMCs with the best combination of durability and activity result in ca. 3 times lower fuel cell performance than the most active NPMCs at 0.80 V. Thus, major tasks will be to combine durability with higher activity, and also improve durability at cell voltages greater than 0.60 V.

J	Politzer, P; Murray, JS; Clark, T				Politzer, Peter; Murray, Jane S.; Clark, Timothy			Halogen bonding and other σ-hole interactions: a perspective	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												A sigma-hole bond is a noncovalent interaction between a covalently-bonded atom of Groups IV-VII and a negative site, e.g. a lone pair of a Lewis base or an anion. It involves a region of positive electrostatic potential, labeled a sigma-hole, on the extension of one of the covalent bonds to the atom. The sigma-hole is due to the anisotropy of the atom's charge distribution. Halogen bonding is a subset of sigma-hole interactions. Their features and properties can be fully explained in terms of electrostatics and polarization plus dispersion. The strengths of the interactions generally correlate well with the magnitudes of the positive and negative electrostatic potentials of the sigma-hole and the negative site. In certain instances, however, polarizabilities must be taken into account explicitly, as the polarization of the negative site reaches a level that can be viewed as a degree of dative sharing (coordinate covalence). In the gas phase, sigma-hole interactions with neutral bases are often thermodynamically unfavorable due to the relatively large entropy loss upon complex formation.

Evolution of Graphene Growth on Ni and Cu by Carbon Isotope Labeling	NANO LETTERS												Large-area graphene growth is required for the development and production of electronic devices. Recently, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbons has shown some promise in growing large-area graphene or few-layer graphene films on metal substrates such as Ni and Cu. It has been proposed that CVD growth of graphene on Ni occurs by a C segregation or precipitation process whereas graphene on Cu grows by a surface adsorption process. Here we used carbon isotope labeling in conjunction with Raman spectroscopic mapping to track carbon during the growth process. The data clearly show that at high temperatures sequentially introduced isotopic carbon diffuses into the Ni first, mixes, and then segregates and precipitates at the surface of Ni forming graphene and/or graphite with a uniform mixture of C-12 and C-13 as determined by the peak position of the Raman G-band peak. On the other hand, graphene growth on Cu is clearly by surface adsorption where the spatial distribution of C-12 and C-13 follows the precursor time sequence and the linear growth rate ranges from about 1 to as high as 6 mu m/min depending upon Cu grain orientation. This data is critical in guiding the graphene growth process as we try to achieve the highest quality graphene for electronic devices.

Consistent van der Waals Radii for the Whole Main Group	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A												Atomic radii are not precisely defined but are nevertheless widely used parameters in modeling and understanding molecular structure and interactions. The van der Waals radii determined by Bondi from molecular crystals and data for gases are the most widely used values, but Bondi recommended radius values for only 28 of the 44 main-group elements in the periodic table. In the present Article, we present atomic radii for the other 16; these new radii were determined in a way designed to be compatible with Bondi's scale.

Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.

Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of H-1 NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.

Two-Dimensional, Ordered, Double Transition Metals Carbides (MXenes)	ACS NANO												The higher the chemical diversity and structural complexity of two-dimensional (2D) materials, the higher the likelihood they possess unique and useful properties. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) is used to predict the existence of two new families of 2D ordered, carbides (MXenes), M'M-2 '' C-2 and M'M-2 '' C-2(3), where M' and M '' are two different early transition metals. In these solids, M' layers sandwich M" carbide layers. By synthesizing Mo2TiC2Tx, Mo2Ti2C3Tx, and Cr2TiC2Tx (where T is a surface termination), we validated the DFT predictions. Since the Mo and Cr atoms are on the outside, they control the 2D flakes' chemical and electrochemical properties. The latter was proven by showing quite different electrochemical behavior of Mo2TiC2Tx and Ti3C2Tx. This work further expands the family of 2D materials, offering additional choices of structures, chemistries, and ultimately useful properties.

In the case of bulk heterojunctions of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a soluble fullerene derivative ([6,6]-phenyl C-61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM), both blend morphology and photovoltaic device performance are influenced by various treatments, including choice of solvent, rate of drying, thermal annealing and vapour annealing. Although the protocols differ significantly, the maximum power conversion efficiency values reported for the various techniques are comparable (4-5%). In this paper, we demonstrate that these techniques all lead to a common arrangement of the components, which consists of a vertically and laterally phase-separated blend of crystalline P3HT and PCBM. We propose a morphology evolution that consists of an initial crystallization of P3HT chains, followed by diffusion of PCBM molecules to nucleation sites, at which aggregates of PCBM then grow.

The solvation free energy of a small molecule provides a surrogate to the desolvation of the ligand in the thermodynamic process of protein ligand binding. Here, we use explicit solvent molecular dynamics free energy perturbation to predict the absolute solvation free energies of a set of 239 small molecules, spanning diverse chemical functional groups commonly found in drugs and drug-like molecules. We also compare the performance of absolute solvation free energies obtained using the OPLS_2005 force field with two other commonly used small molecule force fields general AMBER force field (GAFF) with AM1-BCC charges and CHARMm-MSI with CHelpG charges. Using the OPLS_2005 force field, we obtain high correlation with experimental solvation free energies (R-2 = 0.94) and low average unsigned errors for a majority of the functional groups compared to AM1-BCC/GAFF or CHelpG/CHARMm-MS1. However, OPLS_2005 has errors of over 1.3 kcal/mol for certain classes of polar compounds. We show that predictions on these compound classes can be improved by using a semiempirical charge assignment method with an implicit bond charge correction.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic chemical state quantification of mixed nickel metal, oxide and hydroxide systems	SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS												Quantitative chemical state X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis of mixed nickel metal, oxide, hydroxide and oxyhydroxide systems is challenging due to the complexity of the Ni 2p peak shapes resulting from multiplet splitting, shake-up and plasmon loss structures. Quantification of mixed nickel chemical states and the qualitative determination of low concentrations of Ni(III) species are demonstrated via an approach based on standard spectra from quality reference samples (Ni, NiO, Ni(OH)(2), NiOOH), subtraction of these spectra, and data analysis that integrates information from the Ni 2p spectrum and the 0 1s spectra. Quantification of a commercial nickel powder and a thin nickel oxide film grown at 1 -Torr O-2 and 300 degrees C for 20 min is demonstrated. The effect of uncertain relative sensitivity factors (e.g. Ni 2.67 +/- 0.54) is discussed, as is the depth of measurement for thin film analysis based on calculated inelastic mean free paths.

In this study, we address the issue of cytotoxicity and immunogenic effects of gold nanoparticles on RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The cytotoxicity of gold nanoparticles has been correlated with a detailed study of their endocytotic uptake using various microscopy tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal-laser-scanning microscopy (CFLSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our findings suggest that Au(0) nanoparticles are not cytotoxic, reduce the production of reactive oxygen and nitrite species, and do not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL1-, making them suitable candidates for nanomedicine. AFM measurements suggest that gold nanoparticles are internalized inside the cell via a mechanism involving pinocytosis, while CFLSM and TEM studies indicate their internalization in lysosomal bodies arranged in perinuclear fashion. Our studies thus underline the noncytotoxic, nonimmunogenic, and biocompatible properties ofgold nanoparticles with the potential for application in nanoimmunology, nanomedicine, and nanobiotechnology.

Micrometer-Scale Ballistic Transport in Encapsulated Graphene at Room Temperature	NANO LETTERS												Devices made from graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron-nitride exhibit pronounced negative bend resistance and an anomalous Hall effect, which are a direct consequence of room-temperature ballistic transport at a micrometer scale for a wide range of carrier concentrations.

Hydrazine-reduction of graphite- and graphene oxide	CARBON												We prepared hydrazine-reduced materials from both graphite oxide (GO) particles, which were not exfoliated, and completely exfoliated individual graphene oxide platelets, and then analyzed their chemical and structural properties by elemental analysis, XPS, TGA, XRD, and SEM. Both reduced materials showed distinctly different chemical and structural properties from one another. While hydrazine reduction of graphene oxide platelets produced agglomerates of exfoliated platelets, the reduction of GO particles produced particles that were not exfoliated. The degree of chemical reduction of reduced GO particles was lower than that of reduced graphene oxide and the BET surface area of reduced GO was much lower than that of reduced graphene oxide.

MGC was prepared by solution-phase assembly of graphene sheets and alpha-MnO2 nanowires. Such aqueous electrolyte-based asymmetric ECs can be cycled reversibly in the high-voltage region of 0-2.0 V and exhibit a superior energy density of 30.4 Wh kg(-1), which is much higher than those of symmetric ECs based on graphene//graphene (2.8 Wh kg(-1)) and MGC//MGC (5.2 Wh kg(-1)). Moreover, they present a high power density (5000 W kg(-1) at 7.0 Wh kg(-1)) and acceptable cycling performance of similar to 79% retention after 1000 cycles.

As one of the most promising candidates among current thin film photovoltaic techniques, the organic/nature and exhibit compositional/structural dependence in inorganic hybrid perovskites generally inherit polycrystalline regard to their optoelectronic properties. Here, we demonstrate a controllable passivation technique for perovskite films, which enables their compositional change, and allows substantial enhancement in corresponding device performance. By releasing the organic species during annealing, PbI2 phase is presented in perovskite grain boundaries and at the relevant interfaces. The consequent passivation effects and underlying mechanisms are investigated with complementary characterizations, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), time-resolved photoluminescence decay (TRPL), scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM), and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS). This controllable self-induced passivation technique represents an important step to understand the polycrystalline nature of hybrid perovskite thin films and contributes to the development of perovskite solar cells judiciously.

However, their development is limited by difficulties such as the lack of proper cathode/anode materials for reversible Ca2+ intercalation/de-intercalation, low working voltages (<2 V), low cycling stability, and especially poor room-temperature performance. Here, we report a CIB that can work stably at room temperature in a new cell configuration using graphite as the cathode and tin foils as the anode as well as the current collector. This CIB operates on a highly reversible electrochemical reaction that combines hexafluorophosphate intercalation/de-intercalation at the cathode and a Ca-involved alloying/de-alloying reaction at the anode. An optimized CIB exhibits a working voltage of up to 4.45 V with capacity retention of 95% after 350 cycles.

D., Jr.			Automation of the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) I: Bond Perception and Atom Typing	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING												Molecular mechanics force fields are widely used in computer-aided drug design for the study of drug-like molecules alone or interacting with biological systems. In simulations involving biological macromolecules, the biological part is typically represented by a specialized biomolecular force field, while the drug is represented by a matching general (organic) force field. In order to apply these general force fields to an arbitrary drug-like molecule, functionality for assignment of atom types, parameters, and charges is required. In the present article, which is part I of a series of two, we present the algorithms for bond perception and atom typing for the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF). The CGenFF atom typer first associates attributes to the atoms and bonds in a molecule, such as valence, bond order, and ring membership among others. Of note are a number of features that are specifically required for CGenFF. This information is then used by the atom typing routine to assign CGenFF atom types based on a programmable decision tree. This allows for straightforward implementation of CGenFF's complicated atom typing rules and for equally straightforward updating of the atom typing scheme as the force field grows. The presented atom typer was validated by assigning correct atom types on 477 model compounds including in the training set as well as 126 test-set molecules that were constructed to specifically verify its different components. The program may be utilized via an online implementation at https://www.paramchem.org/.

Stable lithium electrodeposition in liquid and nanoporous solid electrolytes	NATURE MATERIALS												Rechargeable lithium, sodium and aluminium metal-based batteries are among the most versatile platforms for high-energy, cost-effective electrochemical energy storage. Non-uniform metal deposition and dendrite formation on the negative electrode during repeated cycles of charge and discharge are major hurdles to commercialization of energy-storage devices based on each of these chemistries. A long-held view is that unstable electrodeposition is a consequence of inherent characteristics of these metals and their inability to form uniform electrodeposits on surfaces with inevitable defects. We report on electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolytes. We find that simple liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends exhibit stable long-term cycling at room temperature, often with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge and thousands of operating hours. We rationalize these observations with the help of surface energy data for the electrolyte/lithium interface and impedance analysis of the interface during different stages of cell operation. Our findings provide support for an important recent theoretical prediction that the surface mobility of lithium is significantly enhanced in the presence of lithium halide salts. Our results also show that a high electrolyte modulus is unnecessary for stable electrodeposition of lithium.

Catalyzing the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) with Molybdenum Sulfide Nanomaterials	ACS CATALYSIS												We discuss recent developments in nanostructured molybdenum sulfide catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction. To develop a framework for performing consistent and meaningful comparisons between catalysts, we review standard experimental methodologies for measuring catalyst performance and define two metrics used in this perspective for comparing catalyst activity: the turnover frequency, an intrinsic activity metric, and the total electrode activity, a device-oriented activity metric. We discuss general strategies for synthesizing catalysts with improved activity, namely, increasing the number of electrically accessible active sites or increasing the turnover frequency of each site. Then we consider a number of state-of-the-art molybdenum sulfide catalysts, including crystalline MoS2, amorphous MoSx, and molecular cluster materials, to highlight these strategies in practice. Comparing these catalysts reveals that most of the molybdenum sulfide catalysts have similar active site turnover frequencies, so the total electrode activity is primarily determined by the number of accessible active sites per geometric electrode area. Emerging strategies to overcome current catalyst limitations and potential applications for molybdenum sulfide catalysts including photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and electrolyzers are also considered.

This paper reports an interesting finding of Au(I)-thiolate complexes: strong luminescence emission by the mechanism of aggregation-induced emission (ME). The AIE property of the complexes was then used to develop a simple one-pot synthesis of highly luminescent Au-thiolate NCs with a quantum yield of similar to 15%. Our key strategy was to induce the controlled aggregation of Au(I)-thiolate complexes on in situ generated Au(0) cores to form Au(0)@Au(I)-thiolate core-shell NCs where strong luminescence was generated by the ATE of Au(I)-thiolate complexes on the NC surface. We were able to extend the synthetic strategy to other thiolate ligands with added functionalities (in the form of custom-designed peptides). The discovery (e.g., identifying the source of emission and the size effect in luminescence) and the synthesis protocols in this study can contribute significantly to better understanding of these new luminescence probes and the development of new synthetic routes.

This allows the determination of kinetic data, such as reaction orders or apparent activation energies, for the orr directly without mathematical modeling. Collection experiments reveal a potential and rotation rate independent collection efficiency. RRDE measurements allow. for the first time, the direct determination of the fraction of peroxide production juring oxygen reduction on supported catalysts. Finally, comparison of measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M HClO4, respectively, reveals a significant effect of (bi)sulfate adsorption on the orr activity. On the basis of the present results, predictions are made on the kinetic limit of the orr in polymer electrolyte fuel tells, in the absence of ohmic and mass transport resistances at 100% utilization.

J	Riplinger, C; Neese, F				Riplinger, Christoph; Neese, Frank			An efficient and near linear scaling pair natural orbital based local coupled cluster method	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS												In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 10(5)-10(6) relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e. g., >100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below <0.05%, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD ("domain based LPNO-CCSD"). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured >8800 basis functions and >450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

J	Politzer, P; Murray, JS; Clark, T				Politzer, Peter; Murray, Jane S.; Clark, Timothy			Halogen bonding: an electrostatically-driven highly directional noncovalent interaction	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												A halogen bond is a highly directional, electrostatically-driven noncovalent interaction between a region of positive electrostatic potential on the outer side of the halogen X in a molecule R-X and a negative site B, such as a lone pair of a Lewis base or the pi-electrons of an unsaturated system. The positive region on X corresponds to the electronically-depleted outer lobe of the half-filled p-type orbital of X that is involved in forming the covalent bond to R. This depletion is labeled a sigma-hole. The resulting positive electrostatic potential is along the extension of the R-X bond, which accounts for the directionality of halogen bonding. Positive sigma-holes can also be found on covalently-bonded Group IV-VI atoms, which can similarly interact electrostatically with negative sites. Since positive sigma-holes often exist in conjunction with negative potentials on other portions of the atom's surface, such atoms can interact electrostatically with both nucleophiles and electrophiles, as has been observed in surveys of crystallographic structures. Experimental as well as computational studies indicate that halogen and other sigma-hole interactions can be competitive with hydrogen bonding, which itself can be viewed as a subset of sigma-hole bonding.

On the universal scaling behavior of the distance decay of plasmon coupling in metal nanoparticle pairs: A plasmon ruler equation	NANO LETTERS												Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in lithographically fabricated gold (Au) nanodisc pairs are investigated using microabsorption spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting "universal" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a "plasmon ruler equation" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band. We find good agreement of the interparticle separations estimated using this equation with the experimental observations of Reinhard et al.

Raman scattering from high-frequency phonons in supported <i>n</i>-graphene layer films	NANO LETTERS												Results of room-temperature Raman scattering studies of ultrathin graphitic films supported on Si(100)/SiO2 substrates are reported. The results are significantly different from those known for graphite. Spectra were collected using 514.5 nm radiation on films containing from n = 1 to 20 graphene layers, as determined by atomic force microscopy. Both the first- and second-order Raman spectra show unique signatures of the number of layers in the film. The nGL film analogue of the Raman G-band in graphite exhibits a Lorentzian line shape whose center frequency shifts linearly relative to graphite as similar to 1/n (for n = 1 omega(G) approximate to 1587 cm(-1)). Three weak bands, identified with disorder-induced first-order scattering, are observed at similar to 1350, 1450, and 1500 cm(-1). The similar to 1500 cm(-1) band is weak but relatively sharp and exhibits an interesting n-dependence. In general, the intensity of these D-bands decreases dramatically with increasing n. Three second-order bands are also observed (similar to 2450, similar to 2700, and 3248 cm(-1)). They are analogues to those observed in graphite. However, the similar to 2700 cm(-1) band exhibits an interesting and dramatic change of shape with n. Interestingly, for n < 5 this second-order band is more intense than the G-band.

Light-emitting diodes by band-structure engineering in van der Waals heterostructures	NATURE MATERIALS												The advent of graphene and related 2D materials1,2 has recently led to a new technology: heterostructures based on these atomically thin crystals(3). The paradigm proved itself extremely versatile and led to rapid demonstration of tunnelling diodes with negative differential resistance(4), tunnelling transistors(5), photovoltaic devices(6,7) and so on. Here, we take the complexity and functionality of such van der Waals heterostructures to the next level by introducing quantum wells (QWs) engineered with one atomic plane precision. We describe light-emitting diodes (LEDs) made by stacking metallic graphene, insulating hexagonal boron nitride and various semiconducting monolayers into complex but carefully designed sequences. Our first devices already exhibit an extrinsic quantum efficiency of nearly 10% and the emission can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies by appropriately choosing and combining 2D semiconductors (monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides). By preparing the heterostructures on elastic and transparent substrates, we show that they can also provide the basis for flexible and semi-transparent electronics. The range of functionalities for the demonstrated heterostructures is expected to grow further on increasing the number of available 2D crystals and improving their electronic quality.

Here we describe the direct synthesis of WS2 monolayers with triangular morphologies and strong room-temperature photoluminescence (PL). The Raman response as well as the luminescence as a function of the number of S-W-S layers is also reported. The PL weakens with increasing number of layers due to a transition from direct band gap in a monolayer to indirect gap in multilayers. The edges of WS2 monolayers exhibit PL signals with extraordinary intensity, around 25 times stronger than that at the platelet's center. The structure and chemical composition of the platelet edges appear to be critical for PL enhancement.

Using a printable aqueous gel electrolyte as well as an organic liquid electrolyte, the performances of the devices show very high energy and power densities (6 W h/kg for both electrolytes and 23 and 70 kW/kg for aqueous gel electrolyte and organic electrolyte, respectively) which is comparable to performance in other SWCNT-based supercapacitor devices fabricated using different methods.

According to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, they have different exposed crystal planes: {111} and {100} for polyhedra, {110} and {100} for rods, and {100} for cubes. During the synthesis, the formation of hexagonal Ce(OH)(3) intermediate species and their transformation into CeO2 at elevated temperature, together with the base concentration, have been demonstrated as the key factors responsible for the shape evolution. Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements at. 400 degrees C revealed that the oxygen storage takes place both at the surface and in the bulk for the as-obtained CeO2 nanorods and nanocubes, but is restricted at the surface for the nanopolyhedra just like the bulk one, because the {100}/{110}-dominated surface structures are more reactive for CO oxidation than the {111}-dominated one.

The solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the most exciting of these energy technologies; it is an all-ceramic device that operates at temperatures in the range 500-1,000degreesC. The SOFC offers certain advantages over lower temperature fuel cells, notably its ability to use carbon monoxide as a fuel rather than being poisoned by it, and the availability of high-grade exhaust heat for combined heat and power, or combined cycle gas-turbine applications. Although cost is clearly the most important barrier to widespread SOFC implementation, perhaps the most important technical barriers currently being addressed relate to the electrodes, particularly the fuel electrode or anode. In terms of mitigating global warming, the ability of the SOFC to use commonly available fuels at high efficiency, promises an effective and early reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and hence is one of the lead new technologies for improving the environment. Here, we discuss recent developments of SOFC fuel electrodes that will enable the better use of readily available fuels.

J	Fredlake, CP; Crosthwaite, JM; Hert, DG; Aki, SNVK; Brennecke, JF				Fredlake, CP; Crosthwaite, JM; Hert, DG; Aki, SNVK; Brennecke, JF			Thermophysical properties of imidazolium-based ionic liquids	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA												Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts that are liquid at low temperatures, usually including the region around room temperature. They are under intense investigation, especially as replacement solvents for reactions and separations, since they exhibit negligible vapor pressure and would not, therefore, contribute to air pollution. Clearly, basic thermophysical properties are vital for design and evaluation for these applications. We present density as a function of temperature, melting temperatures, glass-transition temperatures, decomposition temperatures, and heat capacities as a function of temperature for a series of 13 of the popular imidazolium-based ILs. The ionic liquids investigated here are 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)methide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium his(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, 2,3-dimethyl-1-ethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, 2,3-dimethyl-1-propylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, and 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate. The properties follow quite reasonable trends. For instance, density decreases as the length of the alkyl chain on the cation increases. For a given cation, the density increases as the molecular weight of the anion increases for the anions studied here. Many of the ILs tend to subcool easily, forming glasses at very low temperatures rather than exhibiting crystallization or melting transitions. The thermal stability increases with increasing anion size, and heat capacities increase with temperature and increasing number of atoms in the IL.																			0021-9568	1520-5134				JUL-AUG	2004	49	4					954	964		10.1021/je034261a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/je034261a													WOS:000222535100042

The as-obtained HPNC-NS show favorable features for electrochemical energy storage such as high specific surface area (S-BET: 2494 m(2)/g), high volume of hierarchical pores (2.28 cm(3)/g), nanosheet structures, rich N-doping (4.7%), and defects. With respect to the multiple synergistic effects of these features, a lithium-ion battery anode and a two-electrode-based supercapacitor have been prepared. A reversible lithium storage capacity of 1865 mA h/g has been reported, which is the highest for N-doped carbon anode materials to the best of our knowledge. The HPNC-NS supercapacitor's electrode in ionic liquid,electrolytes exhibit a capacitane of 242 F/g and energy density of 102 W h/kg (48W h/L), with high cycling life stability (9% loss after 10 000 cycles). Thus, a high-performance Li-ion battery and supercapacitors were successfully assembled for the same electrode material, which was obtained through a one-step and facile large-scale synthesis route. It is promising for next-generation hybrid energy storage and renewable delivery devices.

These samples consisted of 18 multifloral, 2 honeydew and 7 unifloral honeys, derived in the latter cases from flowers of Combretaceae, Vitellaria, Acacia and Lannea plant species. The total phenolic contents varied considerably with the highest values obtained for honeydew honey. Similarly, much variation was seen in total flavonoid and proline content, with Vitellaria honey having the highest proline content. Vitellaria honey was also found to have the highest antioxidant activity and content. The correlation between radical scavenging activity and proline content was higher than that for total phenolic compounds. This suggests that the amino acid content of honey should be considered more frequently when determining its antioxidant activity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As potent agonists, they act selectively on insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), their molecular target site. The discovery of neonicotinoids can be considered as a milestone in insecticide research and greatly facilitates the understanding of functional properties of the insect nAChRs. In this context, the crystal structure of the acetylcholine-binding proteins provides the theoretical foundation for designing homology models of the corresponding receptor ligand binding domains within the nAChRs, a useful basis for virtual screening of chemical libraries and rational design of novel insecticides acting on these practically relevant channels. Because of the relatively low risk for nontarget organisms and the environment, the high target specificity of neonicotinoid insecticides, and their versatility in application methods, this important class has to be maintained globally for integrated pest management strategies and insect resistance management programs. Innovative concepts for life-cycle management, jointly with the introduction of generic products, have made neonicotinoids the most important chemical class for the insecticide market.

J	Nakagawa, N; Hwang, HY; Muller, DA				Nakagawa, N; Hwang, HY; Muller, DA			Why some interfaces cannot be sharp	NATURE MATERIALS												A central goal of modern materials physics and nanoscience is the control of materials and their interfaces to atomic dimensions. For interfaces between polar and nonpolar layers, this goal is thwarted by a polar catastrophe that forces an interfacial reconstruction. In traditional semiconductors, this reconstruction is achieved by an atomic disordering and stoichiometry change at the interface, but a new option is available in multivalent oxides: if the electrons can move, the atoms do not have to. Using atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy, we have examined the microscopic distribution of charge and ions across the (001) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. We find that there is a fundamental asymmetry between the ionically compensated AlO2/SrO/TiO2 interface, and the electronically compensated AlO2/ LaO/TiO2 interface, both in interfacial sharpness and charge density. This suggests a general strategy to design sharp interfaces, remove interfacial screening charges, control the band offset and, hence, markedly improve the performance of oxide devices.

Dissolvable films of silk fibroin for ultrathin conformal bio-integrated electronics	NATURE MATERIALS												Electronics that are capable of intimate, non-invasive integration with the soft, curvilinear surfaces of biological tissues offer important opportunities for diagnosing and treating disease and for improving brain/machine interfaces. This article describes a material strategy for a type of bio-interfaced system that relies on ultrathin electronics supported by bioresorbable substrates of silk fibroin. Mounting such devices on tissue and then allowing the silk to dissolve and resorb initiates a spontaneous, conformal wrapping process driven by capillary forces at the biotic/abiotic interface. Specialized mesh designs and ultrathin forms for the electronics ensure minimal stresses on the tissue and highly conformal coverage, even for complex curvilinear surfaces, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical studies. In vivo, neural mapping experiments on feline animal models illustrate one mode of use for this class of technology. These concepts provide new capabilities for implantable and surgical devices.

From the Sabatier principle to a predictive theory of transition-metal heterogeneous catalysis	JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS												We discuss three concepts that have made it possible to develop a quantitative understanding of trends in transition-metal catalysis: scaling relations, activity maps, and the d-band model. Scaling relations are correlations between surface bond energies of different adsorbed species including transition states; they open the possibility of mapping the many parameters determining the rate of a full catalytic reaction onto a few descriptors. The resulting activity map can be viewed as a quantitative implementation of the classical Sabatier principle, which states that there is an optimum "bond strength" defining the best catalyst for a given reaction. In the modern version, the scaling relations determine the relevant "bond strengths" and the fact that these descriptors can be measured or calculated makes it a quantitative theory of catalysis that can be tested experimentally by making specific predictions of new catalysts. The quantitative aspect of the model therefore provides new possibilities in catalyst design. Finally, the d-band model provides an understanding of the scaling relations and variations in catalytic activity in terms of the electronic structure of the transition-metal surface.

Additive Enhanced Crystallization of Solution-Processed Perovskite for Highly Efficient Planar-Heterojunction Solar Cells	ADVANCED MATERIALS												An effective method to control the rate of perovskite crystallization by incorporating rationally chosen additives into the perovskite precursor solutions is demonstrated. The processing additives simultaneously facilitate nucleation and modulate the kinetics of crystal growth during crystallization, leading to much smoother perovskite morphology with improved coverage area and crystal uniformity. As a result, it enables very high PCE (similar to 12%) planar-heterojunction solar cells to be fabricated through the low-temperature solution processes (under 150 degrees C). This study opens up a new direction for optimizing perovskite active layer properties to expand device performance ceilings.

Colloidal-quantum-dot photovoltaics using atomic-ligand passivation	NATURE MATERIALS												Colloidal-quantum-dot (CQD) optoelectronics offer a compelling combination of solution processing and spectral tunability through quantum size effects. So far, CQD solar cells have relied on the use of organic ligands to passivate the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticles. Although inorganic metal chalcogenide ligands have led to record electronic transport parameters in CQD films, no photovoltaic device has been reported based on such compounds. Here we establish an atomic ligand strategy that makes use of monovalent halide anions to enhance electronic transport and successfully passivate surface defects in PbS CQD films. Both time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and transient device characterization indicate that the scheme leads to a shallower trap state distribution than the best organic ligands. Solar cells fabricated following this strategy show up to 6% solar AM1.5G power-conversion efficiency. The CQD films are deposited at room temperature and under ambient atmosphere, rendering the process amenable to low-cost, roll-by-roll fabrication.

This opens pathways to novel cooperative reactions with added substrates. Small-molecule binding and activation by FLPs has led to the discovery of a variety of new reactions through unprecedented pathways. Hydrogen activation and subsequent manipulation in metal-free catalytic hydrogenations is a frequently observed feature of many FLPs.

Salvia officinalis was used as a reference plant with well documented antioxidant activity. G. macrorrhizum and P. fruticosa extracts possessed very high radical scavenging activity (RSA) in both assays, higher than that of S. officinalis extract. High RSA was also characteristic to other Salvia species and Rhaponticum carthamoides. The content of total phenolic compounds, flavonoids and flavonols was measured in plant extracts.

Integrated energy storage devices of this type are a key area that is still significantly underdeveloped, Here, we describe wearable power devices using everyday textiles as the platform. With an extremely simple "dipping and drying" process using single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) ink, we produced highly conductive textiles with conductivity of 125 S cm(-1) and sheet resistance less than 1 Omega/sq. Such conductive textiles show outstanding flexibility and stretchability and demonstrate strong adhesion between the SWNTs and the textiles of interest. Supercapacitors made from these conductive textiles show high areal capacitance, up to 0.48F/cm(2), and high specific energy. We demonstrate the loading of pseudocapacitor materials into these conductive textiles that leads to a 24-fold increase of the areal capacitance of the device. These highly conductive textiles can provide new design opportunities for wearable electronics and energy storage applications.

Cl-based additives are among the most prevalent in literature, yet their exact role is still uncertain. In this work, we systematically study the function of methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI(3))-based perovskite. Using density functional theory, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the interaction of MACl with a perovskite. We show that MACl successfully induces an intermediate to the pure FAPbI(3) alpha-phase without annealing. The formation energy is related to the amount of incorporated MACl. By tuning the incorporation of MACl, the perovskite film quality can be significantly improved, exhibiting a 6 x increase in grain size, a 3 x increase in phase crystallinity, and a 4.3 x increase in photoluminescence lifetime.

However, Li dendrite growth during Li plating/stripping causes safety concern and poor lifespan of Li metal batteries (LMB). Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additives are used to form a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The FEC-induced SEI layer is compact and stable, and thus beneficial to obtain a uniform morphology of Li deposits. This uniform and dendrite-free morphology renders a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency of 98% within 100 cycles in a Li | Cu half-cell. When the FEC-protected Li metal anode matches a high-loading LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NMC) cathode (12 mg cm(-2)), a high initial capacity of 154 mAh g(-1) (1.9 mAh cm(-2)) at 180.0 mA g(-1) is obtained. This LMB with conversion-type Li metal anode and intercalation-type NMC cathode affords an emerging energy storage system to probe the energy chemistry of Li metal protection and demonstrates the material engineering of batteries with very high energy density.

In order to obtain optimal mechanical properties, specific treatments are necessary due to the specific microstructure resulting from the SLM process. SLM is an additive manufacturing technique through which components are built by selectively melting powder layers with a focused laser beam. The process is characterized by short laser-powder interaction times and localized high heat input, which leads to steep thermal gradients, rapid solidification and fast cooling. In this research, the effect of several heat treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V processed by SLM is studied. A comparison is made with the effect of these treatments on hot forged and subsequently mill annealed Ti6Al4V with an original equiaxed microstructure. For SLM produced parts, the original martensite alpha' phase is converted to a lamellar mixture of alpha and beta for heat treating temperatures below the beta-transus (995 degrees C), but features of the original microstructure are maintained. Treated above the beta-transus, extensive grain growth occurs and large beta grains are formed which transform to lamellar alpha + beta upon cooling. Post treating at 850 degrees C for 2 h, followed by furnace cooling increased the ductility of SLM parts to 12.84 +/- 1.36%, compared to 7.36 +/- 1.32% for as-built parts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
