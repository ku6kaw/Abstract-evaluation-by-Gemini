BioChemistry_Molecular_Biology,high,1,Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2<SUP>-??<i>C</i></SUP><sub>T</sub> method,"The two most commonly used methods to analyze data from real-time, quantitative PCR experiments are absolute quantification and relative quantification. Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2(-DeltaDeltaCr) method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2(-DeltaDeltaCr) method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations of the 2(-DeltaDeltaCr) method that may be useful in the analysis of real-time, quantitative PCR data.

BioChemistry_Molecular_Biology,high,10,Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform,"Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e. g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is similar to 10-20 x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format.

Theoretical calculations reveal that the guest encapsulation within MPP5 is spontaneous and the conformer showing X weakly bound to pentyl rim of MPP5 is favoured over its other conformer wherein it interacts with methyl rim of the host. The noncovalent interactions namely C-H-pi, C-H-X and H\-H prevail over C- H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding in the complexes of MPP5.

BioChemistry_Molecular_Biology,low,2,Hypoxic hypometabolism in chicken embryos: conformism and downregulation,"Postnatally, during hypoxia the decrease in oxygen consumption ((V) over dot(O2)) can exceed what expected from the limitation in O-2 availability, meaning that (V) over dot(O2)-downregulation exceeds O-2-conformism. We questioned whether a similar phenomenon could occur prenatally, in chicken embryos at mid- (Ell, out of 20.5 days) or near end(E18) incubation. (V) over dot(O2) was measured with an open-flow system in the sequence of normoxia-normothermia (21%O- (2), 37 degrees C, 30 min), hypoxia in normothermia (Hx-NT, either 18, 15, 12 or 9% O-2, 37 degrees C, 1 hour), hypoxia in hyperthermia (Hx-HT, up to 43 degrees C, 1 hour) and return to normoxia-normothermia (30 min). During Hx-NT (V) over dot(O2) invariably decreased in a [O-2]-dependent fashion. The hypoxic drop in (V) over dot(O2) did not require a post-hypoxic payment of the O-2-debt, implying that the decrease in (V) over dot(O2) reflected hypometabolism. (V) over dot(O2) did not differ significantly between Hx-HT and Hx-NT for [O-2] = 15% or less, as expected by O-2-conformism. Differently, with milder hypoxia (18% O-2), (V) over dot(O2) during Hx-HT significantly exceeded that in Hx-NT, meaning that the value of (V) over dot(O2)( )in Hx-NT was not limited by O-2 supply. We conclude that a phenomenon of hypoxic (V) over dot(O2)( )downregulation like that observed in postnatal mammals can occur also prenatally, in the chicken embryos.

Extracting spatial and temporal joint, partially-joint, and individual sources of multi-subject datasets is of significant importance to analyze common and cross information of multiple subjects. New method: We present a new framework to extract these three types of spatial and temporal sources in multisubject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. In this framework, temporal and spatial independent component analysis are utilized, and a weighted sum of higher-order cumulants is maximized. Results: We evaluate the presented algorithm by analyzing simulated data and one real multi-subject fMRI dataset. Our results on the real dataset are consistent with the existing meta-analysis studies. We show that spatial and temporal jointness of extracted joint and partially-joint sources in the theory of mind regions of brain increase with the age of subjects. Comparison with existing method: In Richardson et al.

Multiple human traits have been extensively characterized at the genomic level, revealing their complex genetic architecture. However, it is difficult to resolve the mechanisms by which specific variants contribute to a phenotype. Recently, analyses of variant effects on molecular traits have uncovered intermediate mechanisms that link sequence variation to phenotypic changes. Yet, these methods only capture a fraction of genetic contributions to phenotype. Here, in reviewing the field, it is proposed that complex traits can be understood by characterizing the dynamics of biochemical networks within living cells, and that the effects of genetic variation can be captured on these networks by using protein-protein interaction (PPI) methodologies. This synergy between PPI methodologies and the genetics of complex traits opens new avenues to investigate the molecular etiology of human diseases and to facilitate their prevention or treatment.",yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no

Optical microcavities are excellent candidates for constructing powerful microlasers and label-free biosensors, owing to their low optical losses and small size. However, most of these microcavity syntheses rely on sophisticated fabrication methods and cannot be manipulated easily. To achieve facile and versatile microcavity fabrication, we present a robust microfluidics method for monodispersed self-coupling optical microcavity fabrication with a fine tunability. The microcavity polydispersity was less than 3%. The optical microcavity size could be varied from 10 to 30 mu m with a steady quality factor (Q) of approximately 1000. The lowest laser threshold that we obtained was 0.82 mu J with a microcavity size of 20 mu m. The doped fluorescent dye concentration can be tuned precisely from 0.001 to 0.05 wt% to explore an optimized fluorescent background. The experimental results and theoretical simulation match well in terms of Q and the electrometric resonance field intensity. Compared with previous precise and practical fabrication methods, we have demonstrated a facile approach for versatile optical microcavity fabrication.

In order to further the development of MES207 as a NPFFR1 probe, an UPLC-MS/MS bioanalytical method was developed and validated to quantify MES207 in rat plasma for a linearity range of 3-200 ng/mL. The method was applied in the analysis of the plasma, brain, and urine samples collected during pharmacokinetic studies in healthy male and female Sprague Dawley rats. The animals were dosed through oral gavage (50 mg/kg) and intravenously (2.5 mg/kg). Test samples were analyzed using the validated bioanalytical method to generate plasma concentration-time profiles. The results were further subjected to non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix 6.4 (R). MES207 exhibits a large volume of distribution (1.2 +/- 0.6 L), high clearance (0.8 +/- 0.1 L/h), and a poor oral bioavailability (1.7 +/- 0.4%).

There has a great body of research focusing on examining phosphorus fractions, which provide fundamental data that facilitate understanding the risk of P-induced eutrophication. Here, we have extracted the data of P fractions from 484 sediment samples residing in 48 lakes mainly in EU, China and USA. NH4Cl-P and total phosphorus (TP) displayed a well linear relationship, but not applicable to all lakes. Six groups were categorised as per the slope and intercept by using the clustering analysis. Specific measures were recommended to curb P release risk by considering the characteristics of each group. For instance, TP controlling is deemed as a priority in group with steep linear dependence of NH4Cl-P on TP. A significant correlation was determined between TP and NaOH-P (r(2) = 0.63). Among other findings, larger lake area significantly contributes to lower all P pools. Deeper depth could only pronouncedly influence the BD-P, HCl-P.

Chemistry,high,5,A consistent and accurate ab initio parametrization of density functional dispersion correction (DFT-D) for the 94 elements H-Pu,"The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C-6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding.

Chemistry,high,7,Semiempirical GGA-type density functional constructed with a long-range dispersion correction,"A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C-6 . R-6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group 11 element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol(-1). The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C-6 . R-6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance.

The analysis of the extracted OSCs was performed by gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry and/or flame photometric detectors. 3.3 mu l of organic solvent located in the lumen of hollow fibre was used to extract OSCs from 8 ml of an aqueous sample. Several parameters influencing extraction efficiency such as salt concentration, stirring speed, temperature, sample volume, organic phase volume and extraction time were studied and optimized using super-modified simplex method. Under optimized conditions, including extraction solvent (toluene) extraction time (15 min), salt addition (4% w/v), stirring rate (1200 rpm), sample volume (8 ml SV), organic solvent volume (3.3 mu l) and extraction temperature (35 degrees C), the limits of detection varied from 0.1 to 8.7 mu g l(-1) and 0.7 to 99.4 mu g l(-1) for GC-FPD and GC-MS, respectively. The calibration graphs were linear over three orders of magnitude for most of the studied OSCs. The relative standard deviations for inter- and intra- day analysis were in the range of 5-10%, and the relative recoveries of the analytes from three different real water samples were more than 83%.

To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle. The featured surface morphologies, including the pyramid, ripple, mounds and etch pits, are reproduced numerically, and these simulation results correspond well with the observations of directional etching experiments.

Urea is the key end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans. Increased level of urea leads to loss of kidney function. Thus determination of urea is important in analysis of kidney diseases. Al-TiO2 thin films were deposited with different concentration of Al by Spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the anatase phase of the Al-TiO2 thin films with tetragonal structure. A shift is observed in the XRD peak position compared to as prepared TiO2 thin film indicates the incorporation of Al ions into Ti ions. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study shows that the absorption increases and the absorption peak shifts towards the visible region for Al-TiO2 thin films compared with that of the as prepared TiO2 thin film.

Engineering,high,3,Compressed sensing,"Suppose x is an unknown vector in R-m (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n = O(m(1/4) log(5/2)(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an l(p), ball for O < p <= 1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with l(2) error O(N1/2-1/p). It is possible to design n = O (N log (m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of ""random"" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of l(p) balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0 < p <= 1, and give a criterion identifying near-optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths.

Engineering,high,4,A Survey on Transfer Learning,"A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold.

In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems.

Engineering,high,5,"DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs","In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed ""DeepLab"" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

Engineering,high,6,Robust uncertainty principles:: Exact signal reconstruction from highly incomplete frequency information,"This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f is an element of C-N and a randomly chosen set of frequencies Q. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set Q? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of vertical bar T vertical bar spikes f(t) = E-tau is an element of T f(tau)delta(t - tau) obeying vertical bar T vertical bar <= C-M (.) (logN)(-1 .) vertical bar ohm vertical bar for some constant C-M > 0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1 - O(N-m), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the l(1) minimization problem min/g Sigma(N-1)/t=0 vertical bar g(t)vertical bar, s.t. (g) over cap(omega) = (f) over cap(omega) for al omega is an element of ohm In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for Cm which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of vertical bar T vertical bar spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O(vertical bar T vertical bar (.) log N). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1 - O(N-M) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to vertical bar T vertical bar (.) log N. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples-provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above-by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,no
Engineering,high,7,Grey Wolf Optimizer,"This work proposes a new meta-heuristic called Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) inspired by grey wolves (Canis lupus). The GWO algorithm mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. Four types of grey wolves such as alpha, beta, delta, and omega are employed for simulating the leadership hierarchy. In addition, the three main steps of hunting, searching for prey, encircling prey, and attacking prey, are implemented. The algorithm is then benchmarked on 29 well-known test functions, and the results are verified by a comparative study with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Programming (EP), and Evolution Strategy (ES). The results show that the GWO algorithm is able to provide very competitive results compared to these well-known meta-heuristics. The paper also considers solving three classical engineering design problems (tension/compression spring, welded beam, and pressure vessel designs) and presents a real application of the proposed method in the field of optical engineering.

Engineering,high,8,Multiresolution gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification with local binary patterns,"This paper presents a theoretically very simple, yet efficient, multiresolution approach to gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification based on local binary patterns and nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype distributions. The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed ""uniform,"" are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the ""uniform"" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Excellent experimental results obtained in true problems of rotation invariance, where the classifier is trained at one particular rotation angle and tested with samples from other rotation angles, demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns. These operators characterize the spatial configuration of local image texture and the performance can be further improved by combining them with rotation invariant variance measures that characterize the contrast of local image texture. The joint distributions of these orthogonal measures are shown to be very powerful tools for rotation invariant texture analysis.",no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes,no
Engineering,high,9,SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation,"We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1]. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3], DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference.

The verification tasks for NbTi strands were undertaken by the Institute of Plasma Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP). In total, about 550 billets of NbTi strands have been verified and supplied for the PF conductors. The verification levels fit the ITER PA requirements. The test results showed that the quality of the NbTi strands has been well controlled.

Engineering,low,6,A robust cardinality-constrained model to address the machine loading problem,"Several deterministic models have been proposed in the literature to solve the machine loading problem (MLP), which considers a set of product types to be produced on a set of machines using a set of tool types, and determines the quantity of each product type to be produced at each time period and the corresponding machine tool loading configuration. However, processing times are subject to random increases, which could impair the quality of a deterministic solution. Thus, we propose a robust MLP counterpart, searching for an approach that properly describes the uncertainty set of model parameters and, at the same time, ensures practical application. We exploit the cardinality-constrained approach, which considers a simple uncertainty set where all uncertain parameters belong to an interval, and allows tuning the robustness level by bounding the number of parameters that assume the worst value. The resulting plans provide accurate estimations on the minimum production level that a system achieves even in the worst conditions. The applicability of the robust MLP and the impact of robustness level have been tested on several problem variants, considering single- vs multi-machine and single vs multi-period MLPs. We also consider the execution of the plans in a set of scenarios to evaluate the practical implications of MLP robustness. Results show the advantages of the robust formulation, in terms of improved feasibility of the plans, identification of the most critical tools and products, and evaluation of the maximum achievable performance in relation to the level of protection.

Engineering,low,7,The development of a video retrieval system using a clinician-led approach,"Patient video taken at home can provide valuable insights into the recovery progress during a programme of physical therapy, but is very time consuming for clinician review. Our work focussed on (i) enabling any patient to share information about progress at home, simply by sharing video and (ii) building intelligent systems to support Physical Therapists (PTs) in reviewing this video data and extracting the necessary detail. This paper reports the development of the system, appropriate for future clinical use without reliance on a technical team, and the clinician involvement in that development. We contribute an interactive content-based video retrieval system that significantly reduces the time taken for clinicians to review videos, using human head movement as an example. The system supports query-by-movement (clinicians move their own body to define search queries) and retrieves the essential fine-grained movements needed for clinical interpretation. This is done by comparing sequences of image-based pose estimates (here head rotations) through a distance metric (here Frechet distance) and presenting a ranked list of similar movements to clinicians for review. In contrast to existing intelligent systems for retrospective review of human movement, the system supports a flexible analysis where clinicians can look for any movement that interests them. Evaluation by a group of PTs with expertise in training movement control showed that 96% of all relevant movements were identified with time savings of as much as 99.1% compared to reviewing target videos in full. The novelty of this contribution includes retrospective progress monitoring that preserves context through video, and content-based video retrieval that supports both fine-grained human actions and query-by-movement. Future research, including large clinician-led studies, will refine the technical aspects and explore the benefits in terms of patient outcomes, PT time, and financial savings over the course of a programme of therapy. It is anticipated that this clinician-led approach will mitigate the reported slow clinical uptake of technology with resulting patient benefit. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although providing more flexibility in system design, it suffers from a special interference structure, namely intervector interference (IVI), when channel time variations are present. In this paper, we first derive the general OSDM signal model over time-varying channels, and then show that a time-domain window can be used to enhance the diagonal-block-banded (DBB) approximation of the channel matrix in a transformed domain. Furthermore, based on the DBB matrix enhancement, a low-complexity OSDM equalization algorithm is designed. Simulation results indicate that the proposed equalizer has significant performance advantages over that using the direct DBB approximation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The respective eigenfrequencies change with the angular velocity of the reference frame. This contradicts the understanding that eigenfrequencies are inherent system properties. Physically, the dynamics depend on the continuous distribution of magnetic energy and its spatial displacement during transient processes. Information on the system dynamics is lost when dividing the continuum of magnetic energy into discrete portions. Complex state variables associate the dynamics to the propagation in space of distributed magnetic fields. The dynamic analysis reveals the existence single-complex eigenvalues. These define a novel class of system identifiers. They are characterized by having only one imaginary part instead of a conjugate complex pair.

The most widely studied two-dimensional material is graphene(1,2), both because of its rich physics(3-5) and its high mobility(6). However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including transistors(7). Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon films(8-13) or requires high voltages(14,15). Although single layers of MoS2 have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8 eV (ref. 16), previously reported mobilities in the 0.5-3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) range(17) are too low for practical devices. Here, we use a halfnium oxide gate dielectric to demonstrate a room-temperature single-layer MoS2 mobility of at least 200 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), similar to that of graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate transistors with room-temperature current on/off ratios of 1 x 10(8) and ultralow standby power dissipation. Because monolayer MoS2 has a direct bandgap(16,18), it can be used to construct interband tunnel FETs19, which offer lower power consumption than classical transistors.

Here we establish that such dynamic structural complexity in a prototypical two-dimensional lead iodide perovskite gives rise to the coexistence of diverse excitonic resonances, each with a distinct degree of polaronic character. By means of high-resolution resonant impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy, we identify vibrational wavepacket dynamics that evolve along different configurational coordinates for distinct excitons and photocarriers. Employing density functional theory calculations, we assign the observed coherent vibrational modes to various low-frequency (less than or similar to 50 cm(-1)) optical phonons involving motion in the lead iodide layers.

Materials_Science,low,8,Study on the Formation of Ethyl Levulinate from Wheat Straw Based on a Model Compound,"Glucose and microcrystalline cellulose were selected as model compounds to investigate the formation of ethyl levulinate (EL). Optimal glucose and microcrystalline cellulose transformation conditions resulted in yields of 41.05 wt.% and 38.56 wt.% for EL, 0.73 wt.% and 2.63 wt.% for ethyl-glucoside (EG), 0.42 wt.% and 0.36 wt.% for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and 2.18 wt.% and 2.16 wt.% for 5-ethoxy methyl furfural (EMF), respectively. Increasing the reaction time and temperature resulted in an optimized yield of EL. These increases also resulted in decreased EG and EMF yield, and the change trend of HMF was not significant.

This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments.

Physics,high,2,A consistent and accurate ab initio parametrization of density functional dispersion correction (DFT-D) for the 94 elements H-Pu,"The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15%-40% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C-6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10%) weakens the interlayer binding.

Physics,high,5,Colloquium: Topological insulators,"Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe/CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1-xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation.

To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle.
