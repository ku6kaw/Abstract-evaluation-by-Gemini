J,"Hossain, MF",Fabrication of Nanosticks-Like CdS Sensitizer for the Application of Solar Cells,"The novelty of this work is to fabricate the Nanosticks (NSs) like CdS sensitizer on the surface of TiO2 electrode by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method with a very high vacuum annealed at 350 degrees C for 30 min. Whereas, nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes have been prepared on FTO (SnO2: F) glass by a spin-coating method with high purity (99.99%, Degussa P25) TiO2 powder. The surface of the CdS layer has been covered by NSs like structures which are confirmed by the scanning electron microscope image. The 100 nm of platinum-coated FTO substrate and polysulfide-based electrolyte are used to assemble the Gratzel Solar cell (GSC). The performance of solar cell (SC) based on NSs like CdS has been compared with the nanoparticles (NPs) based CdS sensitized SC, where CdS NPs has synthesized by CBD without any post-annealing. The efficiency of NSs like CdS sensitized SC exhibits 2.44%, which is 2 folds of the efficiency of the CdS NPs sensitized SC. The NSs like CdS sensitized SC shows the highest photocurrent 20.24 mA/cm(2) compared to CdS NPs based SC.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17477
J,"Li, KD",The Influence of Process Parameters on the Morphological Characteristics by Directional Etching for Materials Nanoarchitectonics,"In nanoarchitectonics, the advanced technology of directional etching is highly demanded for the fabrication of modern electronic device with high anisotropy ratio of structures. To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle. The featured surface morphologies, including the pyramid, ripple, mounds and etch pits, are reproduced numerically, and these simulation results correspond well with the observations of directional etching experiments. This study provides the fundamental knowledge and detailed information for the advanced application of the directional etching technology.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17429

J,"Vathani, AM; Dhanalakshmi, S; Jeyakumaran, N; Prithivikumaran, N",Fabrication of Al-TiO<sub>2</sub> Thin Film Electrode by Spray Pyrolysis Technique for Urea Sensing,A simple cost effective Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was fabricated for urea sensing. Urea is the key end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans. Increased level of urea leads to loss of kidney function. Thus determination of urea is important in analysis of kidney diseases. Al-TiO2 thin films were deposited with different concentration of Al by Spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the anatase phase of the Al-TiO2 thin films with tetragonal structure. A shift is observed in the XRD peak position compared to as prepared TiO2 thin film indicates the incorporation of Al ions into Ti ions. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study shows that the absorption increases and the absorption peak shifts towards the visible region for Al-TiO2 thin films compared with that of the as prepared TiO2 thin film. The optical band gap values changes with the change in the Al concentration in TiO2 thin films. The electrochemical analysis for optimized Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. CV studies of Al-TiO2 thin film electrode show the good stability and linearity which is essential to fabricate biosensor. The sensor response to urea is linear with correlation coefficient of 0.944 and the sensitivity is 3.17 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2).,10.1166/jnn.2020.17447

A series of the materials such as mesostructured aluminum organophosphonate (AOP) and AlPO type ones were investigated according to the molecular structure and crystallinity of inorganic-organic hybrid and non-hybrid inorganic frameworks. Considering a uniqueness of AlPO based frameworks, a rational insight on strength of interactions between crystalline/amorphous AlPO based units and cationic surfactant molecules was surveyed as one of the most significant factors for understanding the mesostructural variation.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17478

The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of silicon on microalgae growth by mixed-culture experiments with four different microalgae. The results showed that under the osmotic pressure caused by high concentration of Na2SiO3, Navicula sp. N6 had a competition advantage of absorbing nutrient compared with the other three microalgae. The impacts (initial pH, nitrogen content, and silicon content) on cell growth and lipid accumulation were investigated by response surface analysis and the biomass and lipid content increased from 1.01 g/L and 10.98% to 1.33 g/L and 20.04% under the optimal conditions, with lipid yield raised from 110.90 mg/L to 266.53 mg/L. Comparison on the growth under optimum and silicon deficiency condition indicated that silicon played an important role on the growth of Navicula sp.

Optimal glucose and microcrystalline cellulose transformation conditions resulted in yields of 41.05 wt.% and 38.56 wt.% for EL, 0.73 wt.% and 2.63 wt.% for ethyl-glucoside (EG), 0.42 wt.% and 0.36 wt.% for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and 2.18 wt.% and 2.16 wt.% for 5-ethoxy methyl furfural (EMF), respectively. Increasing the reaction time and temperature resulted in an optimized yield of EL. These increases also resulted in decreased EG and EMF yield, and the change trend of HMF was not significant. EMF, HMF, and EG are intermediates in the formation of EL. Finally, we concluded that biomass conversion occurs first through cellulose degradation to glucose followed by the production of EG through alcoholysis and hydrolysis and dehydration of the reaction products to produce EL.",10.1166/jbmb.2020.1947

In this study, GXDF33, a strain of Alternaria, together with the reported pathogen Cladosporium, was isolated from symptomatic leaves. The in vitro pathogenicity tests on seedlings showed GXDF33 can cause black spot disease. Based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) result, it was found that the biomass of both Cladosporium and Alternaria increased as the symptom went severer. According to amplicon sequencing data for the symptomatic samples from Guangxi and Zhejiang Provinces in China, Cladosporium and Alternaria were both common genera in symptomatic plants.

In the first step, synthesis of PPy was carried out by chemical oxidative route. In the second step, the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The as-synthesized PPy-ZnO nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) and Ultra violet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy to reveal the phase, morphology, chemical and optical properties. The physical and chemical characterizations confirmed presence of both PPy and ZnO phases in the nanocomposite. In the present work, antimicrobial activity of the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite against human pathogen Y. lipolytica has been investigated. Attempts have been made to reveal the influence of PPy percentage on the antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, all PPy-ZnO nanocomposites, irrespective of PPy percentage showed 90 to 95% inhibited growth of Yarrowia lipolytica. The results obtained herein imply the potential of PPy-ZnO biofilm in inhibiting the growth of Y. lipolytica and thus preventing infections caused due to Y. lipolytica in humans.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17367

The mechanical reliabilities of Sn58Bi and epoxy Sn58Bi solder were evaluated by the board-level drop test and the 3-point bend test after temperature-humidity storage testing. The microstructure and chemical composition of the solder joints were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The addition of epoxy in solder paste did not affect the morphology of the intermetallic compound. The thickness of the scalloped-shaped Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound of solder/OSP joint increased with aging time. The drop number until fail for the epoxy Sn58Bi/OSP joint was higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint; the average numbers of drops withstood by the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint and epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint following the reflow process were fewer than 10 drops and 180 drops, respectively. The drop number of solder/OSP joints decreased with increasing aging time. The result of the 3-point bend tests shows that the number of bend cycles for the epoxy Sn-58Bi/OSP joint was 30 times higher than that for the Sn-58Bi/OSP joint. The number of bend cycles for solder/OSP joints was decreased with increasing aging time.",10.1166/sam.2020.3660

J,"Yeo, NE; Kim, DI; Jeong, MY",Compressive and Shear Resistances of Confined Water Droplet in Sliding Motion Against Hydrophobic Counterpart,"The compressive and shear resistances of the water droplet confined between the hydrophobic surfaces were investigated to evaluate the effect of the micro-scale surface pattern on the repulsive capillary force and friction of droplet. The hydrophobic surfaces covered with square pillar structures in the hexagonal array were prepared and the repulsive normal load and friction coefficient of the droplet were characterized. The force measurements in the vertical and lateral directions on the droplet confined between the prepared hydrophobic surfaces revealed that the compressive resistance to the vertical motion which is identical with the repulsive capillary force increases with deformation when the deformed droplet is horizontally symmetric. On the other hand, the friction coefficient of the squeezed droplet is inversely proportional to the repulsive capillary force. It was found that the reduced pressure acting on the solid-liquid interface results in the abnormal reduction in friction coefficient. In addition, the critical hydraulic pressure analysis confirmed that the partially wetted Cassie-Baxter (CB) state is maintained during sliding motion.",10.1166/sam.2020.3671

The polar solvent, dimethylformamide (DMF), was mixed with the PEDOT:PSS solution to improve the conductivity of the HTL. When the DMF was added to the PEDOT:PSS solution, the conductive PEDOT fragments distributed more uniformly because of the high dipole moment of the DMF. In order to find the optimal process condition, the blending ratio of DMF and the baking condition of the PEDOT:PSS layer were examined. The detector with the PEDOT:PSS layer fabricated with 50 wt% DMF added and 160 degrees C baking for 30 min had the highest sensitivity, of 1.988 mA/Gy.cm(2), which was 61.23% higher than the sensitivity of the detector with the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer.",10.1166/sam.2020.3664

Using the principle of evaporation-induced assembly in contact free dispersion droplets, we have synthesized porous micrometric HAp granules consist of interlocked ellipsoidal nanoparticles. We have shown that the shape of the microgranules can be tuned from spherical to doughnut solely by controlling the drying temperature during assembly. The structure and interparticle correlation in the synthesized granules have been probed by electron microscopy and small-angle scattering. The observed morphological transition has been attributed to the buckling of elastic shell made of interlocked HAp nanoparticles. Alteration of granular morphology at higher drying rate does not affect the local packing fraction of the correlated HAp nanoparticles in the granules.

For the same peak-indentation load, increasing the holding time and/or decreasing the indentation-loading rate cause the increase of the indentation depth. There exists the ""bulge"" of the unloading curve at the onset of the unloading for small indentation-loading rates. The Vickers hardness is a monotonically increasing function of the indentation-loading rate for the same peak-indentation load. For the indentations with the same loading and unloading time of 30 s and without an intermediate stage at the peak-indentation load, the Vickers hardness of the Cu47.5Zr19Hf28.5Al5 bulk-metallic glass-matrix composite decreases with the increase of the indentation load.

J,"Chen, SH; Huang, TW",Spin-orbit torques from intrinsic spin-orbit couplings in a periodically buckled honeycomb lattice,"In this paper, we study the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) originated from the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of intrinsic type in a periodically buckled honeycomb nanoribbon such as silicene. Using the Green function formalism with density matrix expressions, we analyze the SOT contributions from the Fermi-level and -sea electrons. We find that the intrinsic-SOC-induced inverse spin galvanic effect generates spin accumulations perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The anti-damping torque results purely from the Fermi-level contribution, while the field-like torque from both the Fermi-level and -sea contributions. At zero bias voltage, the SOT is symmetric with respect to the Fermi energy (i.e., an even function of the Fermi energy), whereas the presence of bias further introduces the anti-symmetric torque components. When the ferromagnet magnetization lies in the honeycomb plane, all Fermi-sea contributions disappear. The maximum SOT among different Fermi energies is also inspected. For large enough in-plane magnetization compared to the staggered potential, the field-like torque has a maximum at zero Fermi energy. When the magnetization is smaller than some value characterized by the intrinsic SOC, the maximum of the anti-damping torque occurs at the cross point of the two Dirac linear bands in the leads. More importantly, we find that the anti-damping torques responsible for magnetic switching as well as the torkance require staggered potential from an applied out-of-plane electric field, i.e., lattice buckling is essential to the switching. When the electric field is reversed, the anti-damping torque and the torkance are also reversed. Accordingly, full electric control of the SOTs can be realized in this buckled system.",10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165914

This type of special cement is mixed with PVA as polymer additive material so it can have a higher strength and sufficient elasticity per unit weight. Also, boric acid which can absorb neutrons having poisonous effect in nuclear reactions is added into the cement in order to minimize environmental disaster caused by a nuclear accident. Compressive and bending strengths were measured based on TSE tests of graphene doped PVA and boron-based cement paste. Then, samples were measured by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller Method (BET) and subjected to X-ray Diffraction (XRD). In XRD measurements, crystalline structure was observed in all materials. According to compressive strength tests, as the graphene amount increases compressive strength also increases, however in bending strength tests as the graphene amount increases bending strength decreases. Although the values of bending strength of samples produced decreased with increase of graphene content, these values were found to be above the standard values. In addition to boron, graphene admixture has a significant effect on material with its positive strength properties.",10.1166/sam.2020.3701

However, as compared with bilayer heterostructures, it is very challenging in experiments to prepare single crystal epitaxial ultrathin superlattices consisting of ferromagnetic metal and antiferromagnetic insulator, where the interface exchange coupling, magnetic order, and electrical transport properties are expected to be greatly modulated due to the multiple interfaces and periodical structures. Here we prepared single crystal epitaxial [Co/CoO](n) superlattices consisting of ferromagnetic metal Co and antiferromagnetic insulator CoO by molecular beam epitaxy. It is found that the saturation magnetization of [Co 0.6 nm/CoO 1.2 nm](5) superlattice is robust against temperature increase, which only shows a slight decrease of 1.5% from 5 K to 300 K. Moreover, we found that the longitudinal resistivity and anomalous Hall resistivity of [Co/CoO](n) superlattices are strongly modulated by the short-period Co/CoO heterostructure, which are quite distinguished from the electrical transport properties of Co bulk ferromagnetic metal.

In this paper, a two-mode optimal control scheme for biomass/wind/diesel/storage independent microgrid system is proposed, which includes economic operation scheduling under normal operation and emergency power control under large disturbances, based on the operation characteristics of distributed power supply. Diesel generating unit runs near the base point of higher power generation efficiency, absorbs the instantaneous fluctuation of net load, and provides the reserve capacity for system operation. The fluctuating output of the apparent net load of biomass power generation system can effectively cooperate with wind power to generate electricity and improve the permeability of renewable energy. A new control method of battery energy storage system (BESS) is proposed, which gives priority to emergency power control, followed by peak shaving and valley filling, reduces the allocation requirement of energy storage capacity and optimizes operation conditions. Aiming at an independent microgrid system in a remote community, simulation studies are carried out from two aspects, namely, quasi-steady-state-based system operation economy and transient stability in typical operation scenarios.

Two kinds of doping scenarios are considered, namely dopants into pristine graphene and vacancy graphene. It is observed that the doping energy is negative for dopant (N, P, S) into vacancy graphene at pyridinictype site, yet it is positive at graphitic-type site for pristine graphene. It could be inferred that the introducing process is exothermic reaction for defective graphene. Meanwhile, for the adsorption of C2H2 on the surface of defective graphene, we notice that C2H2 would prefer to be adsorbed at the top site of the doping atom and the adsorption energy increases with the introducing of dopants, indicating that the dopant would enhance the interaction between C2H2 and graphene. Regarding hydrogen molecule, the dopant has less promotion effect on the adsorption. Moreover, the graphene plays a role of electron donor while the gas molecule (C2H2/H-2) is the electron acceptor when it is adsorbed. For the co-adsorption, the C2H2 is privileged to interact with the graphene and the pre-adsorbed C2H2 on doped graphene would weaken the opportunity of the uptake of H-2 molecule.

The results of these simulations show that equilibrium structures and flows of all confined liquids significantly depend not only on the shape of the SWCNT's rectangular cross sections but also on the types of liquids inside SWCNTs. The cross sections of equilibrium structures of all confined liquids resemble replicas of cross sections of corresponding SWCNTs. In addition, the equilibrium structures formed by nonpolar argon atoms are most spatially ordered whereas nonpolar water molecules form the least spatially ordered equilibrium structures. It has been found that, for nonpolar methane flows through SWCNTs with rectangular cross sections, there are critical values f(xc) of the external driving force below which an average flow velocity is equal to nearly zero and above f(xc) methane molecules can flow. The critical value of the external driving force depends strongly on the shape of rectangular cross sections of SWCNTs under consideration.

The non-commutativity of two rotations is graphically illustrated using the approximate expressions.

The QCM frequency behavior was explained by the gas flow condition, such as the plug flow and recirculating flow, in the reactor. The relationship was consistent with the gas flow calculations, because the heavy and light gases could directly flow downward and recirculate, respectively, in the chamber due to natural convection.

In this paper, anisotropic nanocomposite PrFeB/PrCo5 hot-deformed magnets with and without doping PrCu eutectic alloy were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. With the addition of 6 wt% PrCu, the coercivity of the magnet (10.8 kOe) is almost double than that of undoped magnet (5.6 kOe), with an enhancement of the remanence (9.1 kG versus 8.4 kG). For the magnet with PrCu, the nonmagnetic PrCu phase is mainly distributed in the phase boundary regions, introducing a coupling effect of demagnetization on the hard-magnetic phases, which obtained an enhancement of the coercivity. The deformed Pr2Fe14B grains of the hybrid magnet have elongated platelet shapes, but the PrCo5 grains are not easy to be deformed, which affects the overall degree of deformation texture of the hybrid magnet.

The photogenerated current of the InZnO phototransistor at long light wavelength (>600 nm) was significantly improved by utilizing narrow bandgap MoS2 as the capping layer (1.3 eV). At lower wavelength, photocarriers are generated due to the optical absorption of both InZnO and MoS2 layers, whereas the latter ensures significant photocarrier generation even at the higher wavelength region of the visible spectrum. The photogenerated carriers subsequently transfer to the underlying InZnO layer of superior carrier mobility that has a high channel conduction of additional electrons from the optically-induced doubly positively charged oxygen vacancies (Vo(++)) where the gate field is screening, thereby leading to the higher photoconductive gain of the InZnO/MoS2 phototransistors. The dynamic photosensitivity behaviour of the aforesaid phototransistor reveals the presence of persistent photoconductivity (PPC) due to the oxygen vacancy associated with InZnO which can be removed by applying a reset gate pulse from -15 to +5 V. The optical properties of these phototransistors were further enhanced by replacing the opaque Ti/Au electrode by an ultrathin transparent Ti/Au electrode. Utilization of the transparent electrode results in enhanced electron injection from source to channel due to a reduced barrier height under illumination giving rise to a ten-fold improvement in the photocurrent and responsivity of the phototransistors. A position-dependent study of the photocurrent w.r.t beam position also reveals that the enhancement in photocurrent is strongly dependent on the position and is at its maximum when the beam is placed near the source region.",10.1088/1361-6528/ab4526

As known, the ultrathin alumina mask (UTAM) surface nanopatterning technique allows the fabrication of periodic nanoparticle (NP) arrays with 5 nm gaps among the NPs, however, it still faces a significant challenge in realizing the reliable distribution of nanogaps over a large area, because of the unavoidable collapse of the UTAM pore wall during the traditional one-step homothermal pore-widening process. Herein, an efficient two-step poikilothermal pore-widening process was developed to precisely control the pore wall etching of a UTAM, enabling effectively avoiding the fragmentation of the UTAM and finally obtaining a large-scale UTAM with a pore wall thickness of about 5 nm. As a result, large-scale NP arrays with high-density sub-5 nm and even smaller gaps between the neighboring NPs have been realized through applying the as-prepared UTAM as the nanopatterning template. These NP arrays with sub-5 nm gaps show ultrahigh SERS sensitivity (signal enhancement improved by an order of magnitude compared with NP arrays with 5 nm gaps) and good reproducibility, which demonstrates the practical feasibility of this promising two-step pore-widening UTAM technique for the fabrication of high-performance active SERS substrates with large-scale ultra-small nanogaps.",10.1088/1361-6528/ab49ac

J,"Ayubali, AA; Shanmugavel, BP; Padmanabhan, KA",On the relative accuracy of power law analyses for uniaxial low stress steady state high homologous temperature deformation,"If the mathematical operations are correct, uniaxial low stress, steady state high homologous temperature creep and steady state structural Superplasticity phenomena can be well described by a 'power law' that relates the applied stress to the strain rate of deformation (Padmanabhan et al., 2015). Isothermal dislocation creep, which exhibits no grain size dependence, displays a linear log strain rate - log stress relationship till there is a change in the rate controlling mechanism. In contrast, during grain-size dependent, isothermal steady state structural superplastic flow, even within narrow strain rate ranges the slope changes, notwithstanding the presence of the same rate controlling mechanism. In both the phenomena the stress exponent, n, decreases with increasing temperature even for a constant rate controlling mechanism (Padmanabhan, 1973). Four analytical methods, differing in details, are based on the power law equation, viz., a procedure used by experimental scientists, its improved variant, a method in vogue in rheology and a procedure due to Padmanabhan et al., 2015. By examining experimental data pertaining to many systems, it is demonstrated that the method of rheology does not follow the tenets of Dimensional Analysis and that the scatter in the predictions is the maximum for this case. The method of experimental scientists ignores the temperature dependence of the stress exponent and this leads to significant discrepancies between the measured and predicted properties. When mathematics is correct and the relevant physical situation is taken into account, the other two methods, i.e. the improved method of the experimental scientists and that of Padmanabhan et al., 2015, lead to similar results, but the latter analysis is more accurate because of its better normalizing procedure.

The center of these semicircles was below the Z' axis. With temperature increment, the diameter of the semicircles decreased. The characteristics of the semicircular curve indicated that the parallel resistance (R-p) and constant phase element (CPE) in parallel combination with the series resistance (R-s) should be appropriate for the equivalent electrical circuit model for the produced heterojunctions.

The results of current density-voltage (J-V) curves justified a large leakage current along with minimal response under illumination. A recombination process controls the mechanism for carrier portage in the zone of V <= 0.16 V, while a space-charge-limited current process governs the carrier portage mechanism in the circumstance of V value beyond 0.16 V. Frequency (f) dependent conductance (G/omega)-V and capacitance (C)-V curves were measured to extract the series resistance (R-s) and density of the interface state (N-ss). On the basis of extraction in the manner of Nicollian-Brews, the value of R-s rose with f abatement. With zero bias voltage applied, the value of R-s was 189.84 Omega at 2 MHz and rose to 715.10 Omega at 20 kHz. The acquired R-s may be attributable to the occurrence of R-s in the neutral zones as well as Ohmic contact. The values for N-ss, which were extracted in the manner of Hill-Coleman, were 1.23 x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2) at 2 MHz and 6.51 x 10(12) eV(-1) cm(-2) at 20 kHz. This result was an indicator of the occurrence of interface states at the zone of the junction interface performing as a source of leakage current and a trap center for the carriers originated by light.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17295

Oxygen was introduced during the sputtering process to prevent the reduction of transmittance and the formation of nonstoichiometric compositions. The dependence of the optical and electrical properties of MTO thin films on the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio was systematically investigated. The transmittance of the MTO single layer (24 nm) at 550 nm gradually increased from 85.9% to 88.2% with an increase of the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio from 0% to 7.9%. The optical band gap was also affected by the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio, varying from 3.30 to 3.64 eV. The MTO film deposited at an O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio of 2.7% showed the minimum resistivity (0.03 Omega . cm). The XPS spectra indicated that the SnO2 thin films become almost stoichiometric as the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio increased. Thus, this sputtering process can be used to prepare flexible MTO films with a wider optical band gap, improved transmittance, and decreased resistivity.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17254

To reduce refractive index-mismatching, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and MTO layers were inserted between the MTO/Ag/MTO multilayer film and the PET substrate. MTO and Ag were deposited by RF/DC magnetron sputtering at room temperature, whereas spin-coating was used to deposit PDMS at various dilution ratios in hexane. In this study, pattern visibility was examined by comparing the differences in the color and reflectance of oxide/metal/oxide multilayers before and after adding the PDMS and MTO IMLs. In addition, the effects of the PDMS dilution ratio on the electrical and optical characteristics were also investigated. The MTO/Ag/MTO/PDMS/MTO multilayer films showed high transmittance (>86% at 550 nm) except at the dilution ratio of 1:50. As the PDMS dilution ratio increased from 1:50 to 1:200, the reflectance difference (Delta R) increased from 0.08% to 0.35% and the color difference (Delta b*) increased from 0.31 to 1.23.

In particular, the high contact resistance generated in a nano-area significantly degrades the device performance. In this study, we propose a direct contact resistance measurement method without a test structure by separate processes to improve the nano-area contact resistance. The nano-area contact resistance of Ti-Ti and Cu-Cu decreased from 6.46 M Omega to 1.08 M Omega and from 3.78 M Omega to 1.48 M Omega, respectively, when the metal line and native layer formed on the surface were removed. In addition, it is confirmed that the contact resistance decreased with an increase in bonding strength in the case of nano-area homo-metal contact. However, the contact resistance is affected by the tunneling effect and bond energy according to the distance between the first layers of atoms in the case of nano-area hetero-metal contact.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17273

With the development of nanotechnology, a huge potential has been created for the design of highly sensitive sensors with low energy consumption and low costs. If a composite material constructed with carbon nanotubes is used as an electrode in contact with a contaminant, this material undergoes an oxidation-reduction reaction with the contaminant that allows the electrode to function as an electrochemical sensor. This study involved the application of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and modified working electrodes constructed with multi-walled carbon nanotube composites (Ag- and ZnO-multi-walled carbon nanotubes) as electrochemical sensors. These electrodes have good response speed and sensitivity at low concentrations, and they are reusable.

J,"Gan, XL; Shu, LL; Fei, LF; Wang, Y; Zhou, NG",Atomic insights in crystallization of liquid Cu on single crystal Ta and amorphous Ta,"The crystallization processes of liquid Cu on single crystal Ta and amorphous Ta under different undercoolings were investigated with molecular dynamics simulation. As the undercooling is not greater than 350 K, only heteronucleation process occurred in both cases. However, at a larger undercooling (400 K), the nucleation transformed from a heteronucleation mode to a mix-mode of heteronucleation and homonucleation in both cases. Interestingly, we found that the heteronucleation of Cu embryos, in the amorphous-Ta/liquid-Cu samples, was always triggered by the recrystallization of amorphous Ta; it means that crystal Ta possesses a higher nucleation potency than amorphous Ta. Further analysis indicated that the higher nucleation potency of single crystal Ta originates from its ability to induce liquid Cu atoms ordering. Liquid Cu took a longer time, on average, to nucleate on amorphous Ta than on crystal Ta at different temperatures. In addition, microstructure analysis indicated that the crystallized region contained both stacking faults and twin crystals.",10.1088/2053-1591/ab5531
J,"Giannopoulou, A; Kounavis, P",Spectral-resolved two-light beam photoresponse spectroscopy to resolve and investigate different photogeneration processes in organic semiconductors,"A photocurrent spectroscopy employing two-color light excitation beams scanned at different photon energies is proposed to resolve and to investigate different photogeneration processes involving exciton dissociation and above bandgap excitations in organic semiconductors. The basic concept of this spectroscopy is based on the phenomenon of photoresponse enhancement (PE), recently observed in pentacene films. In this phenomenon, the photocurrent, generated with modulated probe-light creating excitons, undergoes enhancement under additional above bandgap bias-light excitation, which acts to facilitate exciton dissociation. In the proposed photocurrent spectroscopy, the excitation energies of probe-light producing photocurrent undergoing PE and those of the biaslight which can induce PE are specified. This allows us to resolve photogeneration via exciton dissociation, which is facilitated by above bandgap excitations, and the onset of the above bandgap excitations, which facilitate exciton dissociation in pentacene films. It is found that light excitation in the region of 1.77-2.43 eV generates excitons diffusing with a diffusion length of 50-80 nm, which is compatible with that of triplet excitons, to the pentacene-substrate interface where dissociate via electron transfer to positive donor-like traps. For light excitation exceeding 2.43 eV, above bandgap excitations become strong competing triplet exciton creation by singlet fission. These results can be explained if the singlet fission and the above bandgap excitations are mediated by charge transfer states with energy-dependent electron-hole separations.",10.1016/j.orgel.2019.105481

The capping layers for films with the thicknesses of 50 nm and 100 nm broadened the metal-insulator transition, though they produced rather few changes to other properties. The results were dramatically different for a 20-nm-thick LCMO layer compared to other thicker films. The metal-insulator transition temperature increased from 160 to 200 K for capped LCMO film despite the fact that the capping layer reduced the magnitude of magnetization. The temperature of maximum magnetoresistance (MR) shifted from 115 to 185 K. However, its magnitude, 1500% at 5 T, remained unchanged due to capping. This behavior was attributed to atomic inter-diffusion at the LCMO/Fe3O4 interface which resulted in the generation of Mn2+ ions.

This study was to evaluate the physical properties of mortar colored by carbon amino silica black (CASB), using a methyl cellulose (MC) polymer to reduce surface efflorescence and increase early strength by means of steam curing.

Twenty eight male, 10-week old Wistar rats were used, divided into three groups, i.e., the control one, the group including the diabetic rats and, finally, the group including the diabetic rats which were treated using sitagliptin. The biomechanical study was based on a series of three-point bending tests of the femora of the sacrificed rats and the analysis of the experimental data was implemented in terms of the actual geometry of the fractured cross-section.

On the contrary, the slope of the load-deflection curve (corresponding to a measure of the stiffness) of diabetic bones is slightly lower compared to the control bones.

The constitutive relation takes account the coupled large deformation and diffusion of gels. The dynamic governing equations take account the relative motions between the polymer network and solvent, which leads to a pressure diffusion wave similar to the ""slow pressure wave"" in the classical Biot's poroelastodynamics. It is different from the pressure wave in pure solid or pure liquid. The phase velocity, group velocity and attenuation coefficient are analyzed at different frequencies and propagating directions for both pressure wave and shear wave. We show that the wave propagation properties of gels are not only related to the material properties including the crosslink density and the interaction property between solvent and polymer, but also can be tuned by different mechanical loading conditions and chemical stimuli. It is also predicted that the constrained swollen gel exhibits anisotropic wave propagation properties, which leads to the splitting of the pressure wave and shear wave propagating through it. The theory provides a general frame for fundamental understanding and quantitative characterization of the dynamic behaviors of gels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The molten Aluminum alloy was maintained at 800 degrees C and then poured into a mould at 200 degrees C. Aluminum alloys were hot-extruded into a rod measuring 12 mm thick with a reduction ratio of 38: 1. The microstructure and electric conductivity properties of as-extruded Al-1.0RE alloy under different annealing processes were investigated and compared. After extrusion, the intermetallic compound having a needle shape in the cast state was finely decomposed based on the direction of extrusion. Significant changes in the microstructure were detected after annealing at 500 degrees C with fragmentation and sphering of eutectic particles. The annealing temperature of Al-1.0RE alloy increased proportionally to the electrical conductivity. The formation of Al-RE intermetallic compounds increases the electrical conductivity and improves the mechanical properties of the alloy through precipitation hardening.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17275

By using a compact quadrupole mass filter system a hyperthermal ion beam is mass filtered. The GaN thin film depositions with varying ion-to-atom arrival ratio and kinetic energies of 40 eV and 80 eV are performed to highlight the distinct impact of the ion species on the early stages of the growth. It is evaluated that precise selection of ion beam parameters enables the preferred growth of either the metastable zinc blende GaN phase or the stable wurtzite GaN phase on 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Further, using molecular nitrogen ion species thin films of high crystalline quality could be deposited even at ion kinetic energies of 80 eV, while films with atomic nitrogen ion assistance feature reduced crystalline quality.",10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.143830
J,"Nakata, K; Nakazawa, H; Okamoto, H; Kobayashi, Y",Influence of the terrace width of pentacene underlayers on the crystallinity of C<sub>60</sub> overlayers,"Pentacene and fullerene (C-60) form an efficient stacked heterostructure in organic solar cells, and C-60 films exhibit high crystallinity on pentacene films. However, the mechanism of the crystallinity improvement in C-60 overlayers remains to be fully elucidated. In this work, the surface (step and terrace structure) of pentacene films is investigated in terms of the terrace width using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to clarify the mechanism. We found that the terrace width becomes wider as the substrate temperature for pentacene film growth increases, and the terrace width becomes narrower as the thickness of pentacene films increases. In addition, we investigate the influence of the terrace width of pentacene underlayers on C-60 overlayers using AFM and X-ray diffraction. We found that pentacene underlayers with wide terraces increase the grain size and improve the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers. These findings indicate that growing pentacene underlayers with wider terraces allows for further enhancement in the crystallinity of C-60 overlayers, leading to higher quality pentacene/C-60 stacked heterostructures.",10.1016/j.tsf.2019.137638

Ti atoms of Ti-C-48 and Ti-B24N24 show catalytic activity towards ClO adsorption with low-barrier energies. Results displayed that the Ti-doped carbon and boron nitride nanocages oxidized ClO by the mechanisms of Eley-Rideal (ER) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH). Catalytic activities in the LH path were limited by irremediable adsorption of chloride dioxide (ClO2) on Ti-C-48 and Ti-B24N24.

We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because we showed that the interlayer distance of untreated MMT was increased from 1.23 to 2.05-2.21 nm, and thus verified the intercalation of CTS into the MMT interlayer. The maximum adsorption of Cu2+, as calculated using the Langmuir equation, was significantly higher for oxalic acid-crosslinked CTS-modified MMT, relative to untreated MMT or the non-crosslinked CTS-modified-MMT. The oxalic acid-crosslinked CTS-modified MMT could also take up more Cu2+ than Ni2+ from a solution containing a mixture of Cu2+-Ni2+. The selective adsorption of oxalic acid-crosslinked CTS-modified-MMT (i.e. Ni2+ < Cu2+) is governed by the selective adsorption of CTS and the oxalic acid.

However, many issues, especially imbalanced carrier injection, have limited their development, so further research is needed. Herein, 4,4 '-cyclohexane-1,1-diylbis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)aniline] (TAPC) with a large bandgap is introduced as a multifunctional hole transport layer (MHTL) for efficient hybrid organic/inorganic WLEDs. Optimized hybrid WLEDs with TAPC are achieved with a peak current efficiency of 20.6 cd A(-1) and a near purity white light with color coordinates of (0.32, 0.33). They exhibit better EL performance than those without TAPC. This proves that an optimized TAPC layer can effectively reduce electron overflow and improve hole injection to acquire much better charge balance in the emitting layers.

The small superimposed motion is discussed for the classical incompressible Mooney-Rivlin, James-Guth, and Gent models, as well as two limit classes of compressible Blatz-Ko material models, f=0 and f=1. The small-amplitude vibrational frequency is presented for each model, and the effects of limited extensibility are demonstrated for the James-Guth and Gent materials. Unstable equilibrium states are exhibited for the Blatz-Ko compressible foamed rubber material with f=0, while the others exhibit infinitesimally stable motion for an essentially arbitrary initial static stretch. It is shown that unstable equilibrium states exist for the general compressible Blatz-Ko model with 0<f<1, and these states are characterized graphically in terms of the static stretch and the material Poisson ratio. The article concludes with a discussion of the Blatz-Ko and Gent-Thomas foamed rubber materials and their relation to the classical molecular-based uni-constant theory of elasticity.",10.1177/1081286519885179
J,"Morice, C; Kopp, T; Kampf, AP",Nonunique connection between bulk topological invariants and surface physics,"At the heart of the study of topological insulators lies a fundamental dichotomy: Topological invariants are defined in infinite systems but surface states as their main footprint only exist in finite systems. In the slab geometry, namely, infinite in two planar directions and finite in the perpendicular direction, the 2D topological invariant was shown to display three different types of behavior. The perpendicular Dirac velocity turns out to be a critical control parameter discerning between different qualitative situations. When it is zero, the three types of behavior extrapolate to the three 3D topologically distinct phases: trivial, weak, and strong topological insulators. We show analytically that the boundaries between types of behavior are topological phase transitions of particular significance since they allow us to predict the 3D topological invariants from finite-thickness transitions. When the perpendicular Dirac velocity is not zero, we identify a new phase with surface states but no band inversion at any finite thickness, disentangling these two concepts which are closely linked in 3D. We also show that at zero perpendicular Dirac velocity, the system is gapless in the 3D bulk and therefore not a topological insulating state, even though the slab geometry extrapolates to the 3D topological phases. Finally, in a parameter regime with strong dispersion perpendicular to the surface of the slab, we encounter the unusual case that the slab physics displays nontrivial phases with surface states but nevertheless extrapolates to a 3D trivial state.",10.1103/PhysRevB.100.235427

An increase of one order of magnitude in grain size and 8% in density is shown after application of the pulse pattern 10:9, while the amount of consumed energy remained constant. When heated with different pulse patterns, the variation of the effective power and contact resistance induced by the mechanical pulse are two main reasons accounting for the varying energy efficiency.

The variations of surface supersaturation with thin layer height, bulk supersaturation and rotation rate are analyzed. The results show that keeping still is very unfavorable for the growth of thin layer, a certain rotation rate should be applied to the Z-cut plate to increase the concentration gradient across the (0 0 1) face, thus making sure that thin layers can grow from the edges while small pyramids barely grow from the face center. Given the result that end faces of thin layers nearly bear a bulk supersaturation, a relative low bulk supersaturation will be better to ensure both the growth of thin layers and the good surface uniformity brought by low supersaturation. Moreover, as thin layers grow, rotation rate should be increased to make up the insufficient solute supply resulting from the decreasing linear speed.

Firstly, for the nth complex dispersion curve the asymptotics of the wavenumber's static value is considered as n -> +infinity Two approaches to obtain this asymptotics are compared. Then, for any n the exact value in statics is calculated using iterations, starting with the asymptotic value as the initial approximation. The parametric analysis revealed a specific (critical) value of the geometrical parameter at which the wavenumbers are redistributed. Secondly, the low frequency asymptotics of the dispersion curves are obtained. They exibit the flat initial segment of each complex dispersion curve which is the longer, the larger is the index n of the curve. Thus, this part of spectrum can be described by simple analytical formulas. The exact dispersion curves are evaluated using another iterative algorithm for improving the approximations.
