J,"Hojjati, M; Haghighi, T",Determination of Organic Sulfur Contaminants Using Hollow Fibre-protected Liquid-phase Micro-extraction Coupled with Gas Chromatography,"A simple and solvent-minimized sample preparation technique based on hollow fibre-protected liquid-phase micro-extraction has been developed for extraction of fifteen organic sulfur compounds (OSCs) from aqueous samples. The analysis of the extracted OSCs was performed by gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry and/or flame photometric detectors. 3.3 mu l of organic solvent located in the lumen of hollow fibre was used to extract OSCs from 8 ml of an aqueous sample. Several parameters influencing extraction efficiency such as salt concentration, stirring speed, temperature, sample volume, organic phase volume and extraction time were studied and optimized using super-modified simplex method. Under optimized conditions, including extraction solvent (toluene) extraction time (15 min), salt addition (4% w/v), stirring rate (1200 rpm), sample volume (8 ml SV), organic solvent volume (3.3 mu l) and extraction temperature (35 degrees C), the limits of detection varied from 0.1 to 8.7 mu g l(-1) and 0.7 to 99.4 mu g l(-1) for GC-FPD and GC-MS, respectively. The calibration graphs were linear over three orders of magnitude for most of the studied OSCs. The relative standard deviations for inter- and intra- day analysis were in the range of 5-10%, and the relative recoveries of the analytes from three different real water samples were more than 83%. The results were compared with those obtained using direct single drop micro-extraction and headspace single drop micro-methods. The proposed method is reliable and can be considered useful for routine monitoring of the organic sulfur compounds in surface water samples.",

Whereas, nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes have been prepared on FTO (SnO2: F) glass by a spin-coating method with high purity (99.99%, Degussa P25) TiO2 powder. The surface of the CdS layer has been covered by NSs like structures which are confirmed by the scanning electron microscope image. The 100 nm of platinum-coated FTO substrate and polysulfide-based electrolyte are used to assemble the Gratzel Solar cell (GSC). The performance of solar cell (SC) based on NSs like CdS has been compared with the nanoparticles (NPs) based CdS sensitized SC, where CdS NPs has synthesized by CBD without any post-annealing. The efficiency of NSs like CdS sensitized SC exhibits 2.44%, which is 2 folds of the efficiency of the CdS NPs sensitized SC. The NSs like CdS sensitized SC shows the highest photocurrent 20.24 mA/cm(2) compared to CdS NPs based SC.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17477
J,"Li, KD",The Influence of Process Parameters on the Morphological Characteristics by Directional Etching for Materials Nanoarchitectonics,"In nanoarchitectonics, the advanced technology of directional etching is highly demanded for the fabrication of modern electronic device with high anisotropy ratio of structures. To facilitate the manufacturing processes, in this study we focus on establishing a phase-field model with a directional source term to simulate the dynamics of morphological formation and profile evolution in a crystalline substrate. Additionally, the influences of the etching rate, the degree of etching directionality, and the oblique angle on the structural characteristics are also taken into consideration to offer a broad perspective on the directional etching technologies. In the numerical analyses, the featured morphologies are elucidated by the dominant factors based on the mechanism of the profile evolution. The etched surface tends to be roughened with the crystallographic characters, while the kinetics of directional etching plays a prevailing role in the morphological formation. As the surface diffusion of substrate becomes a controlling factor, a flattened profile of the etched surface would be formed even in a condition of high directionality or high oblique angle. The featured surface morphologies, including the pyramid, ripple, mounds and etch pits, are reproduced numerically, and these simulation results correspond well with the observations of directional etching experiments. This study provides the fundamental knowledge and detailed information for the advanced application of the directional etching technology.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17429

J,"Vathani, AM; Dhanalakshmi, S; Jeyakumaran, N; Prithivikumaran, N",Fabrication of Al-TiO<sub>2</sub> Thin Film Electrode by Spray Pyrolysis Technique for Urea Sensing,A simple cost effective Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was fabricated for urea sensing. Urea is the key end product of nitrogen metabolism in humans. Increased level of urea leads to loss of kidney function. Thus determination of urea is important in analysis of kidney diseases. Al-TiO2 thin films were deposited with different concentration of Al by Spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the anatase phase of the Al-TiO2 thin films with tetragonal structure. A shift is observed in the XRD peak position compared to as prepared TiO2 thin film indicates the incorporation of Al ions into Ti ions. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study shows that the absorption increases and the absorption peak shifts towards the visible region for Al-TiO2 thin films compared with that of the as prepared TiO2 thin film. The optical band gap values changes with the change in the Al concentration in TiO2 thin films. The electrochemical analysis for optimized Al-TiO2 thin film electrode was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. CV studies of Al-TiO2 thin film electrode show the good stability and linearity which is essential to fabricate biosensor. The sensor response to urea is linear with correlation coefficient of 0.944 and the sensitivity is 3.17 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2).,10.1166/jnn.2020.17447

J,"Bi, GC; Shang, CH; Xie, J",Inhibition of Alga Contamination in Open-Culture Under Silicon Stress,"Alga contamination was a major problem in microalgae open cultivation. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of silicon on microalgae growth by mixed-culture experiments with four different microalgae. The results showed that under the osmotic pressure caused by high concentration of Na2SiO3, Navicula sp. N6 had a competition advantage of absorbing nutrient compared with the other three microalgae. The impacts (initial pH, nitrogen content, and silicon content) on cell growth and lipid accumulation were investigated by response surface analysis and the biomass and lipid content increased from 1.01 g/L and 10.98% to 1.33 g/L and 20.04% under the optimal conditions, with lipid yield raised from 110.90 mg/L to 266.53 mg/L. Comparison on the growth under optimum and silicon deficiency condition indicated that silicon played an important role on the growth of Navicula sp.

Optimal glucose and microcrystalline cellulose transformation conditions resulted in yields of 41.05 wt.% and 38.56 wt.% for EL, 0.73 wt.% and 2.63 wt.% for ethyl-glucoside (EG), 0.42 wt.% and 0.36 wt.% for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and 2.18 wt.% and 2.16 wt.% for 5-ethoxy methyl furfural (EMF), respectively. Increasing the reaction time and temperature resulted in an optimized yield of EL. These increases also resulted in decreased EG and EMF yield, and the change trend of HMF was not significant. EMF, HMF, and EG are intermediates in the formation of EL. Finally, we concluded that biomass conversion occurs first through cellulose degradation to glucose followed by the production of EG through alcoholysis and hydrolysis and dehydration of the reaction products to produce EL.",10.1166/jbmb.2020.1947

In this study, GXDF33, a strain of Alternaria, together with the reported pathogen Cladosporium, was isolated from symptomatic leaves. The in vitro pathogenicity tests on seedlings showed GXDF33 can cause black spot disease. Based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) result, it was found that the biomass of both Cladosporium and Alternaria increased as the symptom went severer. According to amplicon sequencing data for the symptomatic samples from Guangxi and Zhejiang Provinces in China, Cladosporium and Alternaria were both common genera in symptomatic plants.

In the first step, synthesis of PPy was carried out by chemical oxidative route. In the second step, the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. The as-synthesized PPy-ZnO nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) and Ultra violet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy to reveal the phase, morphology, chemical and optical properties. The physical and chemical characterizations confirmed presence of both PPy and ZnO phases in the nanocomposite. In the present work, antimicrobial activity of the PPy-ZnO nanocomposite against human pathogen Y. lipolytica has been investigated. Attempts have been made to reveal the influence of PPy percentage on the antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, all PPy-ZnO nanocomposites, irrespective of PPy percentage showed 90 to 95% inhibited growth of Yarrowia lipolytica.

Using the principle of evaporation-induced assembly in contact free dispersion droplets, we have synthesized porous micrometric HAp granules consist of interlocked ellipsoidal nanoparticles. We have shown that the shape of the microgranules can be tuned from spherical to doughnut solely by controlling the drying temperature during assembly. The structure and interparticle correlation in the synthesized granules have been probed by electron microscopy and small-angle scattering. The observed morphological transition has been attributed to the buckling of elastic shell made of interlocked HAp nanoparticles. Alteration of granular morphology at higher drying rate does not affect the local packing fraction of the correlated HAp nanoparticles in the granules. The absorption of bovine serum albumin protein by the synthesized granules has been tested as a potential application.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17142

It seems obvious that Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP) induced nephrotic syndrome is rare. In this regard, the present article introduces a patient suffering from nephrotic syndrome associated with CUP. Patient is a 65-year-old non-smoker male who referred to the clinic for one-month generalized edema. The patient was also complaining from coughing and bulky yellowish sputum with no signs of blood. Patient's chest radiography revealed pulmonary pleural effusion of the left lung, but no other pathological findings were revealed. Patient's cytology report of pleural fluid indicated metastatic carcinoma, and therefore, the patient needed additional examinations so that the origin of metastases (lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, etc.) could be detected. Finally, chemotherapy treatments began when the patient was diagnosed with Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP). With the continuation of chemotherapy treatment and follow-up after more than a year of treatment, the patient is now generally well-off; his nephrotic syndrome has also been in remission parallel to chemotherapy. Significant point in the treatment of this patient is proteinuria, hypercholesterolemia and hyponatremia remission in two stages of chemotherapy.

The purpose of this investigation was to gain insight as to why this might be the case. X-Ray crystallographic studies revealed that the N-C-N distances in the examined analogs are nearly identical (1.31-1.34 angstrom), suggesting that differences in N-C-N delocalization does not account for differences in affinity/action. Homology modeling hydrophatic interactions (HINT) analysis revealed that the 6-chloro analog formed a greater number, and more favorable, interactions with the receptor, whereas the 8-chloro analog formed fewer, and unfavorable, interactions. The affinity and activity of the 6-chloro quinazoline relative to its 8-chloro counterpart are unrelated to the N-C-N delocalization pattern but might be related to specific (favorable and unfavorable) interactions of quinazoline substituents with certain receptor features as determined by HINT analysis.

A distorted tetrahedral coordination field was adopted by this Cu(I) complex which experienced intense geometric distortion. To limit this excited state geometric distortion and consequently improve its emissive performance, this Cu(I) complex was dispersed and immobilized into a polymer rigid framework through electrospinning method. A detailed analysis on the photophysical parameters of solid sample, solution sample and electrospinning fibrous samples suggested that polymer immobilization was highly effective in limiting excited state geometric distortion. Dopant molecules were dispersed and immobilized in polymer's rigid and protective microenvironment. In this case, their geometric distortion was effectively limited, showing improved photophysical performance, such as emission blue shift, long-lived emissive center and better photostability.

UV-irradiation of TiCp2(CO)(2) produced TiCp2(CO) in the Ar matrix, and three types of nitrogen-containing compounds, TiCp2(CO)(N-2), TiCp2(N-2), and TiCp2(N-2)(2) were produced in the N-2 matrix. The yields of the species changed with the duration of UV-irradiation. Annealing of the sample resulted in the disappearance of unstable TiCp2(N-2) and an increase of TiCp2(N-2)(2). Isotope shifts of the infrared spectra were measured using N-15(2) to confirm the assignments. The structures of the species were estimated using a double hybrid density functional theory calculation (mPW2PLYP/cc-pVTZ), and the calculated infrared frequencies were in very good agreement with the experimentally measured spectra.

An experimental and theoretical investigation,"We report the complete recover of ketones from their corresponding hydrazones under UV-radiation. A series of -CH3, -H and -NO2 p-substituted acetophenone hydrazones was prepared and subjected to irradiation experiments using UV light (254 nm) in CCl4, CHCl3 and CH2Cl2. The process was monitored by UV-VIS and 1D/2D NMR spectra. The recovery time was found to be profoundly affected by the halogenation degree of the solvent with the shortest times observed for CCl4. Small fluctuations in recovery times were observed for the distinct substituents, but no clear trend could be stablished. In CCl4, the recovery time is essentially independent of the substituent. Additionally, NMR spectra showed that the process goes to completion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the recovery time is closely related to the bond dissociation enthalpy for the C-Cl bond. Based on these observations, a mechanism was proposed and analyzed by DFT calculations. Al the reactions involved presented activation energies much bellow the energy required to break the C-Cl bond. Therefore, the C-Cl bond breaking is identified as the rate determining step. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2019.127209

As a consequence, the thermodynamic behaviour in the blend of the different type of accompanying hydrocarbons (paraffins, cycloparaffins, olefins, aromatics) should be explored. Being a multicomponent mixture the best testing ground for checking prediction is the generation of the ternary systems made up of combinations of representatives of the indicated hydrocarbons two by two with alcohols. This paper reports the isothermal vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) at 313.15 K of the two remaining ternaries of an overall comprehensive study involving 1- or 2-butanol. A recognized accurate static technique consisting of an isothermal total pressure cell has been used for the measurements (Van Ness apparatus). Data were reduced using Barker's method together with Wilson equation, as excess Gibbs energy model, enabling the determination of all phase equilibrium properties. Starting from our new data we complete the study by discussing the ternary prediction from four model equations by Wohl, Wilson, NRTL and UNIQUAC commonly used. Parameters fed by their constituent binaries reported in previous papers conclude that Wilson model provides the best result in both of our ternary systems.

In this paper, a two-mode optimal control scheme for biomass/wind/diesel/storage independent microgrid system is proposed, which includes economic operation scheduling under normal operation and emergency power control under large disturbances, based on the operation characteristics of distributed power supply. Diesel generating unit runs near the base point of higher power generation efficiency, absorbs the instantaneous fluctuation of net load, and provides the reserve capacity for system operation. The fluctuating output of the apparent net load of biomass power generation system can effectively cooperate with wind power to generate electricity and improve the permeability of renewable energy. A new control method of battery energy storage system (BESS) is proposed, which gives priority to emergency power control, followed by peak shaving and valley filling, reduces the allocation requirement of energy storage capacity and optimizes operation conditions. Aiming at an independent microgrid system in a remote community, simulation studies are carried out from two aspects, namely, quasi-steady-state-based system operation economy and transient stability in typical operation scenarios.

Two kinds of doping scenarios are considered, namely dopants into pristine graphene and vacancy graphene. It is observed that the doping energy is negative for dopant (N, P, S) into vacancy graphene at pyridinictype site, yet it is positive at graphitic-type site for pristine graphene. It could be inferred that the introducing process is exothermic reaction for defective graphene. Meanwhile, for the adsorption of C2H2 on the surface of defective graphene, we notice that C2H2 would prefer to be adsorbed at the top site of the doping atom and the adsorption energy increases with the introducing of dopants, indicating that the dopant would enhance the interaction between C2H2 and graphene. Regarding hydrogen molecule, the dopant has less promotion effect on the adsorption. Moreover, the graphene plays a role of electron donor while the gas molecule (C2H2/H-2) is the electron acceptor when it is adsorbed. For the co-adsorption, the C2H2 is privileged to interact with the graphene and the pre-adsorbed C2H2 on doped graphene would weaken the opportunity of the uptake of H-2 molecule.

The characteristics of D:Si(110)-(1 x 1) are unique compared to those of H:Si(110)-(1 x 1) (Matsushita et al., 2015) in terms of the resolved vibrational modes. By the HREELS, one-dimensional surface phonons consisting of D-Si stretching vibrations are observed above the bulk-phonon band energy edge of 64.5 meV. Ten modes are observed below this value, classified as surface, surface resonant, and bulk phonons according to the calculated energy dispersion as well as the depth profile of spectral density and displacement vectors. In particular, five D Si bending modes are observed out of the seven theoretically predicted modes. The bending modes are strongly coupled with the displacements across the D and five Si layers.

Herein, we applied gold nanoflowers (AuNFs) as amplified nanocarriers to increase the Ln(3+) labeling ratio in a single molecular binding event for improving the sensitivity of traditional DELFIA. Two thiolated amphiphilic ligands (thiolated ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and thiolated acylhydrazine-terminated ligands), consisting of a hydrophobic alkane chain, oligo(ethylene glycol) unit, and functional terminal of the EDTA or acylhydrazine group, were designed for the surface modification of AuNFs. The resultant ligand-coated AuNFs exhibited dual functions of Ln(3+) chelation via the EDTA group and oriented attachment of antibodies via the acylhydrazine group.

The temperature dependences of the position of the maximum v (frequency), the width w and the intensity I of the spectral band, corresponding to the fully symmetric vibration v(1)(A) of the ClO4-1 perchlorate ion, in the spectral range from 933 cm(-1) to 944 cm(-1) were analyzed. The frequency v and intensity I decrease, and the width w increases with the increasing temperature. It is shown that these temperature dependences have certain features at a temperature of 460 K. With a further increase in temperature, the frequency v decreases more rapidly, the width w increases, and the intensity I decreases more intensively. In the temperature range from 460 K to the temperature T-str = 581 K of the first order structural phase transition, we observe a deviation of the temperature dependence of the frequency and width from the linear dependences characteristic of lower temperatures. These deviations appear at a temperature of 460 K and increase with the increasing temperature and approaching the phase transition temperature. It has been established that in the crystalline sodium perchlorate NaClO4 a structural first-order phase transition is stretched. At the phase transition temperature (T-str = 581 K), the width increases sharply, and the frequency decreases sharply, decreasing with a further increase in temperature. The existence of a pretransitional region in the studied crystalline sodium perchlorate NaClO4 was found. This pre-transition region occurs in the temperature range from 460 K to T-str = 581 K.",10.6060/ivkkt.20206301.6042
J,"Balunov, AI",COMPOSITIONS CALCULATION OF COMPLEX DISTILLATION SYSTEM PRODUCT FLOWS BASED ON THE EXTENDED VERSION OF THE MAXIMUM ENTROPY PRINCIPLE,"A method for calculating the most likely product compositions of athermal mixture separation in complex distillation systems, including systems of simple recycling and non-recycling columns, complex columns with side sampling, systems with joint heat flows, and others. The method is based on an extended version of the maximum entropy principle. The informational entropy of complex experiment involving conditional entropy and conditional probabilities is used as the like-lihood criterion. The adopted axiomatic allows one to obtain the most probable component distributions in the product flows of the system, which corresponds to the complex experience maximum entropy in accordance with the balance restrictions. It has been demonstrated that athermal properties accounting of the mixture create dependencies that include entropic activity coefficients associated with the conditional entropy in a typical thermodynamics form. Dependencies are a special case of the correlations obtained for ideal mixtures. The method for calculating the entropy activity coefficients as functions of the components molecule relative volumes and the mixture molar composition has been provided. This method is focused on the design version of the distillation system calculation. It allows to determine the parameters characterizing the process length (the number of theoretical separation steps in the non-selective mode) and the product flow composition products under the product quality restrictions. The accounting of mixture athermal nature leads to an increased duration of the process and has a slight impact on the product compositions. A comparison is given of the results of the calculation of the composition of the product flows of a typical gas fractionating unit with and without taking into account the athermal properties of the mixture to be separated with the data of an industrial experiment.",10.6060/ivkkt.20206301.6072

It has been demonstrated that, nanoparticles have made some progresses in the operational characteristics of the conventional cement. This research, via 13 experimental attempts, revealed a great improvement in compressive strength and rheological properties of the cement slurry after addition of silicon dioxide nanomaterial to the slurry. However, it did not make any significant change in the free water content of the cement and fluid loss. In the case of static gel strength analyzers (SGSA) test, transient time followed a decrementing pattern by increasing nanoparticle percentage.

Their alternating current impedance characteristics, under various frequencies, were measured and studied as a function of temperature in the range 200 to 400 K. Both the real (Z') and imaginary (Z '') parts of the complex impedance were temperature dependent. It was apparent that the Z ''-Z' curve for all temperatures exhibited single semicircles. The center of these semicircles was below the Z' axis. With temperature increment, the diameter of the semicircles decreased. The characteristics of the semicircular curve indicated that the parallel resistance (R-p) and constant phase element (CPE) in parallel combination with the series resistance (R-s) should be appropriate for the equivalent electrical circuit model for the produced heterojunctions. Through simulation, the value of R-s at 200 K was found to be 5.04 x 10(3) Omega, and fell to 252.05 Omega at 400 K.

The results of current density-voltage (J-V) curves justified a large leakage current along with minimal response under illumination. A recombination process controls the mechanism for carrier portage in the zone of V <= 0.16 V, while a space-charge-limited current process governs the carrier portage mechanism in the circumstance of V value beyond 0.16 V. Frequency (f) dependent conductance (G/omega)-V and capacitance (C)-V curves were measured to extract the series resistance (R-s) and density of the interface state (N-ss). On the basis of extraction in the manner of Nicollian-Brews, the value of R-s rose with f abatement. With zero bias voltage applied, the value of R-s was 189.84 Omega at 2 MHz and rose to 715.10 Omega at 20 kHz. The acquired R-s may be attributable to the occurrence of R-s in the neutral zones as well as Ohmic contact.

Oxygen was introduced during the sputtering process to prevent the reduction of transmittance and the formation of nonstoichiometric compositions. The dependence of the optical and electrical properties of MTO thin films on the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio was systematically investigated. The transmittance of the MTO single layer (24 nm) at 550 nm gradually increased from 85.9% to 88.2% with an increase of the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio from 0% to 7.9%. The optical band gap was also affected by the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio, varying from 3.30 to 3.64 eV. The MTO film deposited at an O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio of 2.7% showed the minimum resistivity (0.03 Omega . cm). The XPS spectra indicated that the SnO2 thin films become almost stoichiometric as the O-2/(Ar+O-2) ratio increased.

Initially, experimental data are exploited toward accurate prediction of pressure-volume isotherms and vapor-liquid equilibrium in bulk fluids. In the second part, the effects of quantum correction on the structure and thermodynamic properties of fluids confined in slit pores are investigated. Our results show that quantum effects may come into account by considering the effective size of the particles and also intermolecular interaction which both of them have direct effects on the density distribution of molecules in the slit pore. Furthermore, the excess adsorption of fluids at a fixed bulk density is shown to increase with quantum effect, but this trend is reversed with increasing wall fluid interaction because of the entropy and energy effects. Also, it is found that the excess adsorption and interfacial tension of the fluid against the solid surface of fluids exhibit oscillatory behaviors with maximum and minimum values for half integer and integer values of pore width. This oscillatory behavior disappears at high values of pore width with increasing quantum effect. Another finding of the present study indicates that the interfacial tensions of the fluid against the solid surface for a classical fluid are negative but quantum effect increases it and shifts its sign to positive. Finally, it is shown that the locus of phase transition is shifted toward higher bulk densities as a result of increasing quantum effect. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This research proposes capturing this energy loss through thermoelectric module-based energy recycling methods to improve the energy efficiency of LED applications, achieving savings of up to 18%. Additional analysis was performed on high power LED sources resulting in the manufacture of a high-power LED light grid system.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17267

When 0.025 M aqueous precursor solution was used, the obtained ZnO nanorods exhibited an improved vertical orientation and growth rate, showing directional growth along the (002) plane, as confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, ZnO nanorods (NR1) obtained on the seed layer prepared by oxidation of Zn films exhibited the faster growth rate than those (NR2) synthesized on the seed layer prepared by spin-coating method due to having access to a sufficient amount of Zn2+ ions. The ZnO nanorods obtained at a precursor concentration of 0.025 M exhibited the highest photocurrent, dark current, and photoresponsivity, with the photoresponsivity and photosensitivity of ZnO NR1 exceeding those of ZnO NR2, owing to the larger surface area.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17252
J,"Kim, MG; Lee, YH; Han, JH; Hong, TW",Effect of MWCNT (Multi-Walled Carbon Nano-Tube) Doping on Hydrogenation Kinetics of Mg-CaO Alloys,"Magnesium hydride has a high hydrogen storage capacity (7.6 wt.%), and is cheap and lightweight, thus advantageous as a hydrogen storage alloy. However, Mg-based hydrides undergo hydrogenation/dehydrogenation at high temperature and pressure due to their thermodynamic stability and high oxidation reactivity. Various attempts have been made to lower the reaction rate and dehydrogenation temperature by adding transition elements (e.g., Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Ce), metal oxides, and intermetallic compounds to overcome these shortcomings. On the other hand, carbon materials have been mainly studied in the field of hydrogen storage with high specific surface area and lightweight properties; however, results show that they cannot store a large amount of hydrogen. Recently, it has been theoretically reported that carbon materials act as adsorbents in hydrogen storage. This study focuses on the hydrogenation behavior of MgHx-CaO and MgHx-CaO-MWCNT composites prepared by hydrogen-induced mechanical alloying, and investigates the properties of these composite materials.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17269

The prepared specimen was post-annealed at a temperature of 773 K for various time durations, and the effects of annealing conditions have been investigated. Vickers hardness of Al6061, Al6063 and Cu decreases as annealing time decreases; however, that of the interface between Al alloys and Cu increases with an annealing time of 1 h, and then decreases as annealing time increases further. The growth of a diffusion layer in Al6063/Cu is larger than that in Al6061/Cu, because the activation energy in the Al6063/Cu is lower than that in Al6061/Cu during the annealing process. Cracking of the diffusion layer occurs by annealing for extended periods of time in both materials, which contributes to the decrease in hardness.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17258

However, mammary glands and ducts are highly sensitive to radiation; the absorbed dose to glandular tissue may increase the risk of secondary breast cancer. Therefore, accurate suborgan breast dosimetry for breast nuclear medicine imaging represents an important issue. In this study, a series of anthropomorphic software breast phantoms (ASBPs) with various volumes and glandularitles were built. The realism of the ASBPs was assessed by using the two-dimensional projection and fractal dimension (FD) analysis. Breast self S values and suborgan S values for F-18 and Tc-99(m) were simulated using the Monte Carlo technique. The projected images of the ASBPs were similar to clinical mammograms in tissue distribution and image contrast. The mean FD value for the ASBPs was 2.23. The maximum differences between the breast self S values of ASBPs and OLINDA/EXM for (18)( ) and Tc-99(m) were -14.4% and -16.7%, respectively. For the breast suborgan S values, the maximum ratios between the S value from gland to gland S(g <- g) and the S value from breast to breast S(1).-b) were 4.84 for F-18 and 3.60 for Tc-99(m). The mean ratios between the S value from gland to duct S(d <- g) and that from gland to gland S(g <- g) were 0.296 for F-18 and 0.356 for Tc-99m.

J,"Matveichuk, YV",EFFECT OF NATURE OF PLASTICIZER ON CHARACTERISTICS OF ION-SELECTIVE ELECTRODES REVERSIBLE TO DOUBLY CHARGED INORGANIC ANIONS,"A study of the effect of the nature of the plasticizer on the characteristics (lower detection limit and selectivity) of electrodes that are reversible to carbonate, hydrogen phosphate, sulfate, selenate, selenite, sulfite, molybdate, tungstate, and thiosulfate ions was carried out. It was found that the membranes of carbonate and hydrophosphate selective electrodes based on quaternary ammonium salts are preferable to plasticize with o-nitrophenyl decyl ether, membranes of sulfate, selenate, selenite-selective electrodes - 1-bromonaphthalene, sulfite, molybdate, tungstate, and thiosulfate selective electrodes - dibutyl phthalate. For sulfate, selenate, and selenite-selective electrodes, there is an improvement in selectivity and a decrease in the detection limit in the series: o-nitrophenyldecyl ether - dibutylphthalate approximate to didecylphthalate approximate to bis (ethylhexyl) sebacinate -1-bromonaphthalene. The replacement of o-nitrophenyldecyl ether with 1-bromonaphthalene leads to a decrease in logK(Pot) for these electrodes by 0.2-1.0 orders of magnitude depending on the interfering ion. The detection limit for sulfate, selenate, and selenite-selective electrodes is reduced by 0.2-0.65 orders of magnitude. For carbonate and hydrogen phosphate selective electrodes from o-nitrophenyldecyl ether to 1-bromonaphthalene, the detection limit decreases, for example, for a carbonate selective electrode by 0.6 orders of magnitude, for a hydrogen phosphate selective electrode by 1 order; the values of logK(Pot) (CO32-, j) decrease by 0.1-0.9 orders of magnitude, and the values of logK(Pot) (HPO42-, j) decrease by 0.6-1.25 orders of magnitude depending on the interfering ion. The results are explained in terms of the theories of Aigen-Denison-Ramzi-Fuoss and Born. The plasticizer that is optimal for carbonate and hydrophosphate selective electrodes has a large dielectric constant epsilon = 24; for all other electrodes, the optimal plasticizers have lower e values (epsilon = 5-6). The use of dibutyl phthalate and 1-bromonaphthalene membranes as plasticizers is consistent with the Aigen-Denison-Ramzi-Fuoss theory, and the use of o-nitrophenyldecyl ether with the Born theory.",10.6060/ivkkt.20206301.6019

It has been reported as a potent biopesticide and antifungal agent. Previous studies on the oxidation of terminal methylene of the allylic chain in Eusiderin A have been able to produce primary alcohol, pinacol, and an aldehyde which demonstrated strong activity against plant pathogenic fungi, therefore activity against dermal fungi needs to be studied. Objective: The current study aims to improve the hydrophilicity of Eusiderin A via oxidation of the allylic chain in order to derive a potent antifungal property. Methods: Transformation of Eusiderin A has been achieved by using the Wacker Oxidation Method in combination with the a-Hydroxylation-Ketone Method to produce 7,3'-epoxy-8,4'-oxyneolignane-1'carboxylic acid. The structure of the 7,3'-epoxy-8,4'-oxyneolignane-1'-carboxylic acid was identified from spectroscopy data. The in vitro antifungal activity study was performed using the paper disc diffusion method against Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Results: New molecule of natural Eusiderin A through the oxidation of the allylic chain to increase the hydrophilicity of Eusiderin A has been designed. Based on the observed UV, IR, H-1 and C-13-NMR, and MS spectra, it can be stated that the 7,3'-epoxy-8,4'-oxyneolignane-1'-carboxylic acid has been formed. At a concentration of 50 ppm, this compound showed antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes.

Analysis of the charges on the atoms showed that the largest positive NBO charge is concentrated on the carbon atom C-2 of the oxazole ring, while the carbon atoms C-4 and C-6 annelated benzene nucleus have the highest Mulliken charges both in the gas phase and in water. Thus, it has been established that a rigid base, a methoxide ion, is attached to the carbon atom C-2, which is a hard reaction center, and a reaction with a soft base, a hydride ion, can also proceed through softer reaction centers - carbon atoms of the benzene ring C-4 and C-6. The bond lengths calculated by the quantum-chemical method are in good agreement with the experimental data obtained by X-ray diffraction, which confirms the correctness of the choice of the quantum-chemical calculation method. New derivatives of 3-azabicyclo [3.3.1]nonane have been synthesized by Mannich condensation of 2-methyl-5,7-dinitrobenzo[d]oxazole hydride sigma-adduct with methylamine and beta-aminopropanoic acid. This method is distinguished by relative simplicity, availability of reagents and allows under mild conditions to transfer from the aromatic system activated by nitro groups to 3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives containing the nitro groups that are promising from the point of view of further functionalization. The structure of the compounds obtained was proved by IR, H-1-, C-13-, two-dimensional correlation NMR spectroscopy, as well as elemental analysis data. It was shown that the compounds obtained can serve as the basis for the creation of hybrid physiologically active compounds containing both a 3-azabicyclononane fragment and an oxazole cycle.",10.6060/ivkkt.20206301.5944

The coordinations of the P precursor to Zn, In, and Ga precursors were found to differ significantly, depending on the coordination number and the ionic radius, and these results were consistent with reports that found that InZnP can be alloyed, but InGaP is not easily alloyed.

The area of hazard associated with the damage depends on the mode of pipeline failure, time to ignition, environmental conditions at the failure point, and the meteorological conditions. To make the solution and results more similar to the actual scenario, gas leakage rate from the pipeline fracture was investigated in the steady state flow and transient flow modes were assessed. The numerical results revealed that, as the pressure at the fracture point was equal to the atmospheric pressure, the Mach number was smaller than one. In the pipe model, as the length of the pipe was long and the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pipe was high, the Mach number tended to one and the gas leak rate to the sound speed.

The effect of this composite coagulants-flocculants on solution's turbidity removal and characteristics of cohesion and coagulation process have been studied too. On the basis of experimental data obtained the character and mechanism of cohesion and coagulation for different types of composite coagulants-flocculants were discussed. It was stated out that the adsorption isotherm of cationic composite coagulants-flocculants conforms to Langmuir adsorption law, and it characterized by monolayer adsorption parameters, which increases their ability to neutralize electric charge. The anionic composite coagulants-flocculants enhance the adsorption value and bridging ability with the help of organic polymers, showing multilayer adsorption characteristics. It was observed specifically, that under the same conditions the flocculation rate and sedimentation rate of composite coagulants-flocculants are higher than polyaluminum chloride has. This fact was explained by the advantages of organic polymer due to its long chain which is able to form larger floc within short time. The large floc has strong attractive potential energy for tiny particles, which make the opportunity of effective collision between particles what leads to sharply increased coagulation. The influence of storage time period on composite coagulants-flocculants coagulation effectiveness has been examined. The experimental results witness that the coagulation characteristics of reagents will be reduced to some extent after long-term storage, but composite coagulants-flocculants have advantages in this aspect over polyaluminum chloride.
