J,"Zhang, H; Yang, L; Cui, PT; Zhao, FQ; Wang, YL; Gao, HX","Thermodynamic properties of 1,3-di (azido-acetoxy)-2-methyl-2-nitropropane","The thermal decomposition behaviors of 1,3-di (azido-acetoxy)-2-methyl-2-nitropropane (DAMNP) under pressures of 0.1 MPa and 3.0 MPa were investigated by DSC techniques. The results showed that with the increase in pressure, the decomposition heat increased significantly, while the peak temperature increased slightly. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of exothermic decomposition reaction were obtained, and the iso-kinetic point was found as 192.0 degrees C. Using the thermal decomposition parameters, the self-accelerating decomposition temperature and the critical temperature of thermal explosion were calculated to be 190.10 degrees C and 202.58 degrees C, respectively. The specific heat capacity of DAMNP was studied with micro-DSC method, and the molar heat capacity was found to be 531.98 J mol(-1) K-1. The adiabatic time-to-explosion was calculated to be 75.67 s. The combustion heat of DAMNP was determined with an oxygen bomb calorimeter, and the standard molar enthalpy of formation was calculated to be - 189.46 kJ mol(-1). These results are important in evaluating the thermal stability and application prospects of DAMNP.",10.1007/s10973-019-08357-8

These compounds were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffractions, powder X-ray diffractions, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analyses, respectively. Structural analyses indicate that these compounds constructed from a seven-nuclearity K-O-Ln (Ln = Dy, Ho, Er) heterometallic cluster stabilized by mixed dilacunary Keggin [alpha-GeW10O37](10-)/multilacunary open Wells-Dawson [Ge2W18O66](16-) fragments.

J,"Zhou, DG",Mechanisms of visible-light-induced Csp<SUP>2</SUP>-H functionalization of 1-methylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one and tetrahydrofuran: A DFT investigation,"The mechanisms for the visible-light-induced C-H cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction between tetrahydrofuran and 1-methylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one were investigated using M06-2X-D3/6-311 + G(d,p) method and level, and SMD model was applied to simulate the solvent effect. The computational results suggested that photocatalyst rose bengal could absorb energy from visible-light to become the first excited state (S1), which would convert ten-butyl hydroperoxide into free radicals via two possible paths; then the C-H activation of tetrahydrofuran should be finished via five probable paths; the obtained intermediate interacts with 1-methylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one to generate the product complex; finally, 1-methyl-3-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)quinoxalin-2(1H)-one would be yielded via one dehydrogenation and single electron transfer (SET) reactions. From the free energy surfaces, it indicates that path a3 and path a4 with lower energy barriers can accelerate this C-H cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction at the reactive temperature. The results could provide valuable insights into these types of interactions and related ones.",10.1016/j.comptc.2019.112639
J,"Zhu, ZY; Chen, JH; Cai, YF; Li, JQ",HIGH-TEMPERATURE FRICTION AND WEAR BEHAVIOR OF A NI-BASED VALVE ALLOY,"This study explored the friction and wear behavior of a Ni-based exhaust valve at high temperatures. Nickel-based superalloy was used with two types of processing states: the original forged sample and the sample under the standard T1 heat treatment. At room temperature and a loading force of 10 N, the average friction coefficient of the T1 heat-treated specimen is 0.61, which was lower than that of the forged sample (0.78). The wear rate of this specimen was also lower than that of the forged sample at the same temperature and loading force. Thus, T1 heat treatment can significantly improve the wear resistance of the alloy because of gamma' phase and carbides. The wear rate was the minimum at 550 degrees C and increased again at 750 degrees C dominated by the formation and flake-off of the oxide film.",10.1142/S0218625X19500744
J,"Markovic, S; Redzepovic, I; Furtula, B",Dependence of the Enthalpy of Formation of Phenols on Molecular Structure - Semiempirical Study,"The ability of three semiempirical methods (PM3, PM5, and PM7) in reproducing the enthalpy of formation (Delta H-f degrees) of polycyclic aromatic phenols (PAPs) was tested by comparing experimental and calculated values for 33 compounds. In addition, the results from the semiempirical methods were compared to those obtained from the suitable isodesmic reactions, performed using the B3LYP-D3 and M06-2X functionals in combination with the 6-311 + G(d,p) basis set. With an average absolute error less than 10 kJ mol(-1), all five methodologies yielded mutually comparable results. Considering low computational cost of semiempirical methods, the influence of structural features on Delta H-f degrees of PAPs was investigated using the PM5 and PM7 methods. It was found that the greatest influence on Delta H-f degrees has the size of the molecules, while the effects of other properties, i.e., the position of the OH group, number of bay regions, and molecular branching are weaker. The influence of the OH group position decreases with its moving away from molecular ends, and eventually becomes insignificant. As branching and the number of bay regions are mutually dependent and respective molecules are often nonplanar, it is difficult to examine individual contributions of these two structural features. In general, Delta H-f degrees decreases with increasing number of bay regions and molecular branching.",10.1080/10406638.2019.1696379
J,"Mohamed, AA; Hussain, S; Alamri, MS; Ibraheem, MA; Qasem, AAA",Thermal Degradation and Water Uptake of Biodegradable Resin Prepared from Millet Flour and Wheat Gluten Crosslinked with Epoxydized Vegetable Oils,"The degradation temperatures (DTs), heat stability (IPDT), degradation kinetics, and water uptake of epoxy resin were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis. Epoxy resins were prepared by crosslinking epoxydized oils with vital wheat gluten (VG) and millet flour. The reactions included three oils (cottonseed, sesame, and sunflower) and three levels of zinc chloride (ZC) (1, 2, and 3%). The apparent activation energy (E-a) was calculated using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method. The DT increased at higher heating rates within the same ZC level of the same oil type. Cottonseed oil exhibited the highest DT. The highest IPDT was 637 degrees C of the sunflower oil/millet resin (3% ZC), and the least was the cottonseed/millet (1% ZC) at 479 degrees C. The sesame-millet resin exhibited the highest E-a (622 KJ/mol) followed by sunflower-gluten (496 KJ/mol) and sesame-gluten (454 KJ/mol). The profiles of all resins point to a multistep degradation, but some of the profiles display two dominant kinetic processes, and the remaining resins showed three processes. The variation in crosslinking density between the oils is attributable to the different amounts of oxirane rings which are associated with the double bonds of the fatty acid of the oils. Like other parameters, the water uptake was affected by the ZC content, where most of the resins did not reach water uptake equilibrium. Nonetheless, the 3% ZC resin reached equilibrium after 5 days of immersion.",10.1155/2019/7050514

The product is a structural analogue of the archetypical MIL-53 framework. Its crystal structure was determined by Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. Furthermore 1,4-phenylenedipropionic acid (H2PDP) was employed for further synthesis, which resulted in the dense layered coordination polymers [Ga-2(OH)(4)(O2C-C10H12-CO2)] (2) and [Ga(OH)(O2C-C10H12-CO2)] (3), for which accurate structural models could be established.

J,"Calligari, P; Torsello, M; Bortoli, M; Orian, L; Polimeno, A",Modelling of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>-promoted structural effects in wild type and post-translationally modified Connexin26,"Connexins (Cx) are a class of membrane proteins important for auditory function, intercellular signalling and skin biology. Although the presence of concentration of calcium ions is known to work as a trigger for the Cx functionality, the structural changes induced by calcium binding still need to be well elucidated. In this computational study, we have explored the structural effects promoted by Ca2+ on both the wild type (Cx26WT) and on two post-translationally modified Connexin 26 (Cx26): Cx26E42-47 gamma, which contains two glutamates (E42 and E47) that are gamma-carboxylated and Cx26R75m, where a key arginine (R75) is N-monomethylated. These modified amino acids, whose forcefield parameters have been developed in this work, alter Cx26 structure around the Ca(2+)coordination site. Structural changes were assessed from the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We observed a strict relation between the chemical properties of the post-translational modifications and significantly different responses of Cx26 to Ca2+-binding, while charge-adding modifications have destabilising effects upon calcium coordination, the uncharged ones share the same structural properties of the wild-type counterpart. Overall, these findings suggest the critical role of the electrostatic network flanking the Ca2+ coordination site in maintaining the native tertiary and quaternary structures.",10.1080/08927022.2019.1690653

DFT studies indicate that one of the isomers is more stable in both solvents, but nevertheless different diastereoisomers are crystallized from the two solvents. The two complexes represent the first pair of well characterized diastereoisomers in the coordination chemistry of 2-pyridyl ketones, providing a new example in the chemistry of octahedral MA(2)(BC) over cap (2) complexes (A = a monodentate ligand, (BC) over cap = an unsymmetrical bidentate chelate).",10.1039/c9nj04876f
J,"Fischer, PJ; Senthil, S; Stephan, JT; Swift, ML; Young, VG",Seventeen-electron chromium(i)tricarbonyltris(phosphine) complexes supported by tris(phosphinomethyl)phenylborates,"The inaugural crystallographic characterization of chromium(i)tricarbonyltris(phosphine) radicals has been achieved. Oxidation of [PPN][Cr(CO)(3)(PhBPPh3)] (PhBPPh3 = [PhB(CH2PPh2)(3)](-)) and analogous Cr(0) complexes featuring 3,5-dimethylphenyl and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl borate substituents affords charge-neutral Cr(CO)(3)(PhBPPh3) zwitterions, containing the first fully characterized [Cr(CO)(3)P-3](+) units. The stabilization affected by the intramolecular charge separation established by PhBPPh3 ligands dramatically increases the robustness of these seventeen-electron Cr(i) complexes. Previous attempts to isolate salts of mer/fac-[Cr(CO)(3)P-3](+) were frustrated by the thermal instability of these cations. The EPR spectroscopic data of Cr(CO)(3)(PhBPPh3) supports Rieger's hypothesized low temperature preparation of fac-[Cr(CO)(3){CH3C(CH2PPh2)(3)}](+). The robust [Cr(CO)(3)P-3](+) unit of Cr(CO)(3)(PhBPPh3) motivated the preparation of structurally characterized Cr(0)/Cr(i) (Cr(CO)(3){eta (6)-(PhBPPh3)Cr(CO)(3)}, Cr(CO)(3){eta (6)-(((3,5-CH3)C6H3)BPPh3)Cr(CO)(3)}) and W(0)/Cr(i) (W(CO)(3){eta (6)-(((3,5-CH3)C6H3)BPPh3)Cr(CO)(3)}) complexes. While these bimetallics feature classical kappa (3)-phosphine and eta (6)-arene metal-binding, they are noteworthy since all other reported mixed-valent Cr(0)/Cr(i) complexes exhibit (a) significant thermal instability that has precluded their isolation and (b) greater uncertainty regarding the presence of distinct Cr(i) and Cr(0) centers. This work illustrates the utility of tris(phosphino)borates for the stabilization of cationic metal fragments within zwitterions that are inaccessible or difficult to characterize independently.",10.1039/c9dt03562a

The most stable structures of these clusters are triplet except for the Li2O2 monomer. In the Li2O2 monomer, the closed shell singlet is strongly favored. There are superoxide-like characteristics in terms of bond lengths and spin in the stoichiometric peroxide lithium clusters, which may have implications for the formation and decomposition of peroxide lithium in Li-O-2 batteries. Furthermore, the growth process of the lowest energy structures of (Li2O2)(n) clusters is ""ring-like"" (n = 2) -> ""rectangle-like"" (n = 3,4) -> ""Y-like"" (n = 5) -> ""disc-like"" (n = 6) feature, this growth pattern is in good agreement with the experimental observation at the initial phase of discharge in the Li-O-2 battery. In addition, the values of energy gaps for the (Li2O2)(n) clusters are much smaller than the band gap of bulk phase, and thus the (Li2O2)(n) cluster can enhance the electron conductivity in the peroxide lithium. The frontier molecular orbitals analysis indicates that there are pi* antibonding on the surface of (Li2O2)(n) clusters, making their structures more stable. Finally, the PES of (Li2O2)(n) clusters have been simulated, we hope that our simulated PES can be compared with future experimental data.",10.1007/s10876-019-01736-z
J,"Joshi, A; Ramachandran, CN",Switching the charge transfer characteristics of quaterthiophene from p-type to n-type <i>via</i> interactions with carbon nanotubes,"Carbon nanotube-based semiconductors are of great interest for optoelectronic applications at the nanoscale. The present study investigates the structural, optoelectronic and charge transport properties of non-covalent complexes formed between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and quaterthiophene (4T) by employing dispersion-corrected density functional methods. The effect of different functionals viz., B97-D, B3LYP-GD3 and omega B97X-D on the properties of endo- and exohedral complexes is examined. The endohedral complex (4T@CNT) is found to be energetically more stable than the exohedral one (4T-CNT). Electronic properties such as the ionization energy, electron affinity and energy gap between the frontier molecular orbitals of the CNT are not significantly changed by the adsorption or the encapsulation of 4T. Contrary to the p-type characteristics of 4T, its complexes formed with CNTs exhibit n-type characteristics due to the higher electron mobility than the hole mobility. Among the endo- and exohedral complexes, the former one shows the highest electron mobility of 3.79 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The absorption properties of all the systems were studied by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). It is found that the complexes undergo several charge transfer transitions in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The above results unequivocally suggest that the charge-transfer characteristics of 4T can be altered on forming complexes with CNTs.",10.1039/c9cp03030a

J,"van Huizen, NA; Holmes, JL; Burgers, PC",One electron less or one proton more: how do they differ?,"From the NIST website and the literature, we have collected the Ionisation Energies (IE) of 3,052 and the Proton Affinities (PA) of 1,670 compounds. For 614 of these, both the IE and PA are known; this enables a study of the relationships between these quantities for a wide variety of molecules. From the IE and PA values, the hydrogen atom affinities (HA) of molecular ions M center dot+ may also be assessed. The PA may be equated to the heterolytic bond energy of [MH](+) and HA to the homolytic bond energy. Plots of PA versus IE for these substances show (in agreement with earlier studies) that, for many families of molecules, the slope of the ensuing line is less negative than -1, i.e. changes in the PA are significantly less than the concomitant opposite changes in IE. At one extreme (high PA, low IE) are the metals, their oxides and hydroxides, which show a slope of close to -1, at the other extreme (low PA, high IE) are the hydrogen halides, methyl halides and noble gases, which show a slope of ca. -0.3; other molecular categories show intermediate behaviour. One consequence of a slope less negative than -1 is that the changes in ionic enthalpies of the protonated species more closely follow the changes in the enthalpies of the neutral molecules compared with changes in the ion enthalpies of the corresponding radical cations. This is consistent with findings from ab initio calculations from the literature that the incoming proton, once attached to the molecule, may retain a significant amount of its charge. These collected data allow a comparison of the thermodynamic stability of protonated molecules in terms of their homolytic or heterolytic bond cleavages. Protonated nitriles are particularly stable by virtue of the very large hydrogen atom affinities of their radical cations.",10.1002/jms.4462

The preparation of plasma sample was completed through a one-step liquid-liquid extraction method. An UHPLC column Phenomenex Kinetex C18 (50 mm x 2.1 mm, 2.6 mu m) was utilized to achieve the chromatography separation. Mobile phases A and B were acetonitrile and water with a ratio of 45:55 (v/v) under an isocratic gradient, both comprising 0.2% formic acid. Multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) was carried out on the triple quadrupole detection in position ionization mode with an electrospray ionization source, the transitions of m/z 383.1 -> 337.2 and m/z 284.9 -> 193.3 were used to determine loratadine and diazepam (internal standard), respectively. The total analysis run time was 3.5 min and the elution time of loratadine and diazepam occurred at 1.1 and 2.1 min, respectively. This method has the advantages of higher sensitivity (0.04 ng mL(-1)), wider linear range (0.04-400 ng mL(-1), r(2) > 0.995), shorter analysis time (3.5 min), needing only a smaller plasma volume (50 mu L) and simple preparation process.

In the present study, settled house dust (SHD) was selected to establish HPLC fingerprint method for simultaneously evaluating organic matters in an indoor environment. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the relative retention time (RRT) and relative peak area (RPA) for precision were 2.46% and 0.47%, respectively, while the RSDs of RRT and RPA for repeatability were 2.51% and 0.50%, respectively, and for stability within 24 h were 2.51% and 0.49%, respectively, which indicated good reliability of the method. Then, the method was used to evaluate the trend of indoor organic matters of Yunyan district (urban) and Gangou village (rural) from 2012 to 2014. The results showed the overall organic matters of Yunyan did not change significantly within 2 years, while the organic matters of Gangou village were a little aggravated by the appearance of some suspicious matters.

J,"Fuentes-García, M; González-Martínez, JM; Macía-Fernández, G; Camacho, J",PARAMO: Enhanced Data Pre-processing in Batch Multivariate Statistical Process Control,"Since the pioneering works by Nomikos and MacGregor, the Batch Multivariate Statistical Process Control (BMSPC) methodology has been extensively revised, and a sheer number of alternative monitoring approaches have been suggested. The different approaches vary in the batch data alignment, the pre-processing approach, the data arrangement, and/or the type of model used, from two-way to three-way and from linear to nonlinear. One of the most accepted pre-processing schemes, referred to as the trajectory centering and scaling (TCS), is based on the normalization to zero mean and unit variance around the average trajectory. However, the main drawback of TCS is the inherent increase of the level of uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters. In this work, we illustrate how to improve parameter estimation while maintaining the good properties of this pre-processing approach. This enhancement is achieved with the new pre-processing approach we call PARAMO, which uses more observations than TCS to estimate the pre-processing parameters. We show that this improvement favorably impacts the performance of the monitoring system. The results of this research work affect a large amount of the monitoring approaches proposed to date, and we advocate that the pre-processing procedure proposed here should be generally applied in BMSPC.",10.1002/cem.3188

Al3+ doping suppresses the ferromagnetic metal phase of La0.6Ca0.4MnO3-delta by weakening the double-exchange interaction of Mn3+-O2--Mn4+, leading to a phase separation state. Al3+ doping dependent irreversible metamagnetic transitions are observed at lower temperatures, especially a martensitic-like transition appears in x = 0.125 and 0.15 system below 4.2 K. Phase diagrams of La0.6Ca0.4Mn1-xAlxO3-delta (0.1 <= x <= 0.15) in the B-T plane are presented, in which the antiferromagnetic insulator and ferromagnetic metal phases boundary is figured out. The antiferromagnetic matrix and magnetic disorders caused by the random distribution of Al3+ ions and the spontaneous oxygen vacancies grow into a pinning center to pin the Mn moments. As magnetic field is increased to the critical field, the localized magnetic moments rotate to parallel to the magnetic field direction, leading to a martensitic-like transition.

We investigate these bonds locally using a probe programmed as a virtual molecule. Unlike the hydrogen bond, electric fields are detected having strengths that are different from the sum of the separated parts, meaning that molecular electrostatic potential surfaces analysis of the different parts are not enough to analyze the bonds. Based on an application of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which states that intermolecular bonds are fully described by Coulombian interactions (electrostatic plus polarization), we connect the electric field strength with the bond strength measured in experiments, so that it can be considered as a quantifier for the bonds.",10.1002/qua.26116

J,"Hamana, D; Lamiri, I; Chetibi, L; Achour, S",Low-temperature formation and characterization of Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanoparticles in the binary gold alloys,"Thermal analyses, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dilatometry, reveal an important anomaly at low temperature for Au-25 wt.% Cu composition after homogenization at 700 degrees C during 2 hours under vacuum followed by heating up to 160 degrees C before water quenching. This anomaly has been already observed and not explained. Surface characterization, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), exhibits a specific topography, consisting of a nanostructured surface. The precipitates of nanostructured particles are homogeneously scattered all over the surface for this 18-carat gold alloy. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the composition of the observed particles corresponds to cuprous oxide phase (Cu2O). The formation of such material can be explained by the diffusion of copper atoms from the lattice to the surface at 160 degrees C. Pulsed radio-frequency glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (RF GD-OES) further proves the proposed Cu2O formation through a diffusion process. The appearance of such cuprous oxide nanoparticles on the Au-Cu alloy surface explains the low-temperature DSC and dilatometry anomaly and affects directly the surface electrical resistance at low temperature. These results might open a large gate for new ideas to investigate in catalytic, electronic, and antimicrobial activities.",10.1002/sia.6723
J,"Cequier, E; Balcells, M; Canela-Garayoa, R",First insights of SHVO catalyst activity for monomeric phenol production from olive pomace,"BACKGROUND Materials from renewable sources are in great demand to reduce carbon fingerprint. Olive pomace is a waste with high lignin content (>25%) and generated in high volumes. Therefore lignin from olive pomace is susceptible to be transformed into added value chemicals such as monomeric phenols through its catalytic depolymerization combining hydrogen donors (i.e. molecular hydrogen, polar protic solvents and formic acid) and catalysts based on transition metals (i.e. palladium and ruthenium supported on carbon, and SHVO catalyst, also ruthenium-based). RESULTS The reaction conditions for the nitrogen and hydrogen experiments were temperatures of 250 and 200 degrees C and initial pressures of 4 and 20 bar respectively. The bio-oil obtained after the catalytic process was approximately half of the initial sample weight, although somewhat lower under hydrogen conditions. The SHVO catalyst yielded 15 and 10% of monomeric phenols under nitrogen and hydrogen conditions respectively, while the other two catalysts yielded between 6 and 9% irrespective of the gas. CONCLUSION Overall, the SHVO catalyst provided a richer mixture of phenolic compounds owing to its milder hydrogenation activity compared with the other catalysts, although at the end of the reaction the catalyst did not preserve its native form. The use of formic acid under nitrogen atmosphere was advantageous to increase the yields of phenols. The most abundant monomers in the experiments using SHVO catalyst under both atmospheres were 4-propylguaiacol, (Z)-propenylguaiacol, 4-propylsyringol, dihydroconiferyl alcohol, (Z)-propenylsyringol and dihydrosinapyl alcohol.

In this latter case, as we illustrate by sample numerical calculations, the points of the energy expectation value hypersurface where the eigenvalue equation is satisfied separate from those where the energy is stationary. We show that the variation of the energy at the eigensolution is determined by a generalized Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Functionals, other than the energy, can, however be constructed, that result the nonlinear Schrodinger equation upon setting their variation zero.

These compounds contain Cp (cyclopentadienyl) as a ligand, and M can be Cr, Mo or W. Their main electronic transitions were calculated and the results are in good agreement with the experimental data. This allows the assignment of some bands whose origin was not clear. In all the cases, the carbonyls and Cp groups restrict the symmetry. The molecular orbitals that would be involved in M-M bonding interact strongly with the carbonyls and show unusual shapes and occupations. The strongest electronic bands are caused by sigma ->sigma* transitions in most of the molecules containing CpM(CO)(3) groups, whereas in molecules such as Cp(CO)(2)M equivalent to M(CO)(2)Cp the most intense bands are produced by pi ->pi* transitions. The origin of other bands is now explained. The effect of the solvent on the electronic transitions and the use of EOM-CCSD method in some compounds were also checked.",10.1080/00268976.2019.1692153

J,"Fallon, MJ; Martinolich, AJ; Maughan, AE; Gallington, LC; Neilson, JR",Low-temperature synthesis of superconducting iron selenide using a triphenylphosphine flux,"Many functional materials have relatively low decomposition temperatures (T <= 400 degrees C), which makes their synthesis challenging using conventional high-temperature solid-state chemistry. Therefore, non-conventional techniques such as metathesis, hydrothermal, and solution chemistry are often employed to access low-temperature phases; the discovery of new chemistries is needed to expand access to these phases. This contribution discusses the use of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) as a molten flux to synthesize superconducting iron selenide (Fe1+delta Se) at low temperature (T = 325 degrees C). Powder X-ray diffraction and magnetism measurements confirm the successful formation of superconducting iron selenide while nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and in situ X-ray diffraction show that the formation of superconducting FeSe at low temperatures is enabled by an adduct between the triphenylphosphine and selenium. Exploration of the Fe-Se-PPh3 phase space indicates that the PPh3-Se adduct effectively reduces the chemical potential of the selenium at high concentrations of triphenylphosphine. This contribution demonstrates that the use of a poorly-solvating yet reactive flux has the potential to enable the synthesis of new low-temperature phases of solid materials.",10.1039/c9dt03723c

Now, density functional theory (DFT) has become a well-accepted tool for unveiling the origin of physical/chemical properties of materials and designing new materials with desirable properties. Recently, two novel POXD-based (N-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-diphenylphosphinic amide) iridium(iii) complexes 1 and 4 with different cyclometalated ligands showed significant performance differences. Herein, we employ DFT calculations to investigate the electronic structures, absorption and emission spectra, and charge transportation properties of iridium(iii) complexes 1 and 4. In comparison with 4, the good performance of 1 can be attributed to its favorable charge transport properties. Based on complex 1, two new iridium complexes (2 and 3) were theoretically designed by substituting phenyl rings with a tert-butyl group (-t-Bu) and methyl group (-CH3), respectively. The results clearly indicated that the -t-Bu and -CH3 groups enhance the hole and electron injection abilities and improve the charge balance. On the other hand, the designed complexes 2 and 3 also show a blue-shift in emission spectra with respect to complex 1.

A series of novel amide-sulfonamide derivatives were investigated for their gas-phase fragmentation behaviors using electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in negative ion mode. Upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), deprotonated amide-sulfonamides mainly underwent either an elimination of the amine to form the sulfonyl anion and amide anion or a benzoylamide derivative to provide sulfonamide anion bearing respective substituent groups. Based on the characteristic fragment ions and the deuterium-hydrogen exchange experiments, three possible fragmentation mechanisms corresponding to ion-neutral complexes including [sulfonyl anion/amine] complex (INC-1), [sulfonamide anion/benzoylamide derivative] complex (INC-2) and [amide anion/sulfonamide] complex (INC-3), respectively, were proposed. These three ion-neutral complexes might be produced by the cleavages of S-N and C-N bond from the amide-sulfonamides, which generated the sulfonyl anion (Route 1), sulfonamide anion (Route 2) and the amide anion (Route 3). DFT calculations suggested that Route 1, which generated the sulfonyl anion (ion c) is more favorable.

The formation, crystal chemistry, and physical properties of U2Ni21B6 and Nb3-yNi20+yB6 [ternary derivatives of the cubic Cr23C6-type (cF116, Fm3m)] have been studied; the formation of the hypothetical ""U3Ni20B6"" and ""Nb2Ni21B6"" has been disproved. U2Ni21B6 [a = 10.6701(2) angstrom] crystallizes in the ordered W2Cr21C6-type, whereas Nb3-yNi20+yB6 [a = 10.5842(1) angstrom] adopts the Mg3Ni20B6-type. Ni in U2Ni21B6 can be substituted by U, leading to the solid solution U2-xNi21+yB6 (0 <= x <= 0.3); oppositely, Nb in Nb3Ni20B6 is partially replaced by Ni, forming the solution Nb3-yNi20+yB6 (0 <= y <= 0.5), none of them reaching the limit corresponding to the hypothetically ordered ""U3Ni20B6 "" and ""Nb2Ni21B6"". These results prompted us to investigate quaternary compounds U2-zNbzNi21B6 and U6Nb3-delta Ni20B6: strong competition in the occupancy of the 4a and 8c sites by U, Nb, and Ni atoms has been observed, with the 4a site occupied by U/Ni atoms only and the 8c site filled by U/Nb atoms only. U2Ni21B6, U2.3Ni20.7B6, and Nb3Ni20B6 are Pauli paramagnets. Interestingly, Nb2.5Ni20.5B6 shows ferromagnetism with T-c approximate to 11 K; the Curie-Weiss fit gives an effective magnetic moment of 2.78 mu(B)/Ni, suggesting that all Ni atoms in the formula unit contribute to the total magnetic moment. The M(H) data at 2 K further corroborate the ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation moment of 10 mu(B)/fu (approximate to 0.49 mu(B)/Ni). The magnetic moment of Ni at the 4a site induces a moment in all of the Ni atoms of the whole unit cell (32f and 48h sites), with all atoms ordering ferromagnetically at 11 K. Density functional theory (DFT) shows that the formation of U2Ni21B6 and Nb3Ni20B6 is energetically preferred.

J,"Sullivan, C; Kazlauciunas, A; Guthrie, JT",Colored apparel and its potential influence on heterosexual attraction,"The objective of this study is to determine if men would follow the ""red effect"" when choosing colors for women to wear on a date, and also to determine if the colors that men would wear when going on a date would be the same as the colors that females (their date) would wish them to wear. A set of psychophysical data was generated from this experiment, where participants were asked to rank a set of 10 colored samples based on preference for each question asked. There were three different sets of colored samples. The set of colored samples given to the participant depended on the question. A total of five questions were asked. Scaling analysis was done on the data to organize a set of items according to preferences providing values, an interval scale (Z values), that correspond to the relative perceptual differences among the stimuli. The Z values were graphed to show the general preference of colors for women to wear, and the preference of colors for men to wear. A Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient (SRCC) was calculated comparing each individual's rank order with the mean rank order for that specific question. An average Spearman's rank order was calculated for each question and each gender in order to determine the variability in answers. Scaling results indicate that men follow the ""red effect,"" but women preferred to wear other colors such as turquoise, blue, or yellow depending on the outfit. Males and females agreed that no matter the colored bottoms (denim or black), blue was the preferred color top for men to wear. SRCC results showed a lot of variability between individual answers and the mean answer indicating that participants' rankings did not necessarily agree with general color preferences presented in the scaling analysis. While scaling analysis might suggest certain color preferences such as men following the ""red effect"" and women preferring to wear blue, the poor correlation found using SRCC between the individual answers and the mean rank orders suggests that color preferences for each individual are inherently unique.",10.1002/col.22458

Here, we made a simple and large-area photodetector based on the monolayer WS2, with high light sensitivity and fast response, benefiting from the special dynamics of carrier involving the exciton, trion, and charge. Moreover, we tested the relaxation behavior of the excited monolayer WS2 by employing transient absorption (TA). It was found that the multi-body interaction among exciton would occur after the density of pump photon increases to 3.45 x 10(14) photons per cm(2). The exciton dissociation accompanying the generation of trion would appear in the photo-induced relaxation process, which would be a benefit for the operation of this photodetector. Increasing the energy of the exciton is good for the generation of carrier by comparing the relaxation behavior of WS2 excited to A and B exciton states. However, the bound exciton relaxation, originating from the capture process of the defect state, would exist and play an unfavorable role during the functioning of devices.",10.1039/c9ra07924f

J,"Firsova, NE; Ktitorov, SA",Extraction of the short-range defect potential parameters from available experimental data on the graphene resistance,"We consider a problem of obtaining information about the scattering potentials of the monolayer graphene sample using available experimental data on its resistance. For this purpose, we study theoretically the dependence of graphene resistance on Fermi energy having in mind to compare it with experimental data where super-high mobility electrons in suspended graphene samples without chemical doping were investigated. As far as practical absence of the doping impurities in this case makes the Coulomb scattering negligible, we consider models of the short-range scattering potentials. The model of short-range potential is assumed to be supported by the close vicinity of the ring or the circumference of a circle. The diameter of circles is supposed to be of the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The empty core of the model potential guarantees the suppression of nonphysical shortwave modes. Two models are investigated: the delta function on the circumference of a circle (delta shell) and the annual well. An advantage of the former is simplicity, while a virtue of the latter is regularity. We consider scattering of electrons by these potentials and obtain exact explicit formulae for the scattering data. We here discuss application of these formulae for calculation of observables. Namely, we analyze the contribution of this scattering into the graphene resistance and plot the resistivity as a function of the Fermi energy according to our theoretical formulae. The obtained results are consistent with experiment, where the resistance was measured as a function of the Fermi momentum on the suspended annealed graphene. This fact gives a possibility to find parameters of the modeled potential on the basis of the available experimental data on resistance of the suspended graphene sample with the gate voltage controlled Fermi level position. It is clear to be very important for applications.",10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686624

Prosthesis alignment is often performed subjectively based on the experience and knowledge of the healthcare professional. In this work, we present the development of a referenced static alignment equipment for lower limb prostheses. The equipment has an instrumental platform that measures important parameters for suitable alignment of lower limb prostheses, giving the therapist objective data that allow for the best adjustment and alignment of the prosthesis to the individual. The developed system has a novel procedure in the prosthesis adjustment where through a movable base. The prosthesis length can be adjusted with a smooth displacement of 0.35 mm. This minimum displacement is important because the difficulty is greater when the longitudinal adjustment required in the prosthesis is less than 10 mm.

Two intriguing examples of contractile tails are those from bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin. Although the two systems are different in terms of biological activity, they share a fascinatingly similar injection mechanism, during which the tail sheaths of both systems contract from a so-called extended state to around half of their length (the contracted state), accompanied by release of elastic energy originally stored in the sheath. Despite the great prevalence and biomedical importance of contractile delivery systems, many fundamental details of their injection machinery and dynamics are still unknown. In this work, we calculate the bending and torsional stiffness constants of a helical tail sheath strand of bacteriophage T4 and R2-pyocin, in both extended and contracted states, using molecular dynamics simulations of about one-sixth of the entire sheath. Differences in stiffness constants between the two systems are rationalized by comparing their all-atom monomer structures, changes in sheath architecture on contraction, and differences in interstrand interactions. The calculated coefficients indicate that the T4 strand is stiffer for both bending and torsion than the corresponding R2-pyocin strands in both extended and contracted conformations. The sheath strands also have greater stiffness in the contracted state for both systems. As the main application of this study, we describe how the stiffness constants can be incorporated in a model to simulate the dynamics of contractile nanoinjection machineries.

J,"Munusamy, G; Mani, R; Varadharajan, K; Narasimhan, S",Experimental Study of Effective Mass and Spin-Orbital Energy of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/NiO Nanoheterostructure Material,"The effective mass of the materials relies on exciton dynamics which is greatly dominated by energy gap of the materials. We examined the effective mass for the Al2O3/NiO nanoheterostructure material through polarization in the dielectric study. The mean optical effective mass was calculated to be m(opt)*, = 5.69645 X 10(-20) m(op)/m(0) in the UV-visible region (1 x 10(6) to 5.4 x 10(6) Hz). From the group and phase velocity values, we observed that Al2O3/NiO is an anisotropic material. The electron spin-orbit energy splitting associated to electron in the valence band was identified using the Gaussian-confining 3D potential under normalized angular momentum (n, 1 = 0, 1, 2, 3). The 1S (S-1(1/2)) and 2S (S-2(1/2)) orbital ionization energies were calculated to be -6.08 and -5.99 eV for AlO3/NiO. The orbital ionization energies were established from the Bohr radius a(B) = 5.29 X 10(-11) m and donor Rydberg constant R-y = 1.097 x 10(7) m(-1) of the identical hydrogen atom. Our study gives insights into the exciton dynamics and calculation of orbital energy for the nanoheterostructure materials.",10.1021/acs.jpca.9b07366
J,"Schubert, M; Limbach, HH; Elguero, J","Synthesis of <SUP>15</SUP>N-labelled 3,5-dimethylpyridine","N-15-labelled pyridines are liquid- and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes for chemical and biological environments because their N-15 chemical shifts are sensitive to hydrogen-bond and protonation states. By variation of the type and number of substituents, different target pyridines can be synthesized exhibiting different pK(a) values and molecular volumes. Various synthetic routes have been described in the literature, starting from different precursors or modification of other N-15-labelled pyridines. In this work, we have explored the synthesis of N-15 N-15-labelled pyridines using a two-step process via the synthesis of alkoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran as precursor exhibiting already the desired pyridine substitution pattern. As an example, we have synthesized 3,5-dimethylpyridine-N-15 (lutidine-N-15) as demonstrated by N-15-NMR spectroscopy. That synthesis starts from methacrolein, propenyl ether, and N-15-labelled NH4Cl as nitrogen source.",10.1002/jlcr.3807

Two stable cell lines, hP2Y1R-tGFP/U2OS and hP2Y1R-beta-AR2-tGFP/U2OS, were generated with steady expression of fluorescent tGFP tagged P2Y1R or tGFP tagged beta-arrestin2. The High Content Screening (HCS) technique was used to investigate P2Y1R mediated signal transduction processes based on the distribution of fluorescent receptors or the beta-arrestin2/receptor complex. All procedures including aggregation, endolysis and resensitization that were involved in the interaction between the P2Y1 receptor and its ligand can be visualized using the tGFP labeled receptor combined with HCS technology in this study. ADP activated P2Y1R to induce a distinguished pattern of fluorescent vesicle formation inside both cell types. These two cell lines produced different peak fluorescence signals when activated by ADP at 100 mu M, and the time to form the maximal vesicles was detected as 15 and 20 min respectively. The EC50 values of the concentration-response curves of ADP induced formation of fluorescent vesicles were 35.7 nM and 71.8 nM respectively. The ADP effects could be blocked by a P2Y1R specific antagonist MRS2179. The P2Y1R are coupled to Gq protein to activate PLC first, PLC cleave PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. And then DAG and Ca2+ activate PKC pathway, and finally the phospholipase D initiates beta-arrestin2 mediated signal pathway. It took 30 and 45 min to complete P2Y1R re-sensitization in these two constructs respectively. Our results demonstrated that P2Y1R triggered downstream responses not only via heterotrimeric Gq proteins but also through beta-arrestin2.",10.1039/c9ay01807g

J,"Berlin, AA",The Mysteries of Science in Solving Applied Problems,"The solution of various applied problems usually leads to the need to find answers to purely scientific fundamental questions and discover new phenomena. The article gives examples of such discoveries. It was discovered that flammability of polymeric materials can be decreased by dispersion of a material containing microencapsulated low-boiling flame retardants on exposure to an external fire source. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere is analyzed in terms of dynamic equilibrium of the processes of oxygen production from forests and the consumption for their combustion during fires. The study of the amazing kinetics of the preparation of polyformaldehyde from formaldehyde and its cyclic trimer, trioxane, was explained, firstly, in the creation of the theory of reversible heterogeneous polymerization of trioxane and led to a fundamentally new, thermodynamic, method of regulating the molecular and supramolecular structure of the polymer. Secondly, on the example of polymerization of formaldehyde, a possible advantage of ""diffusion"" over ""kinetic"" modes was discovered. A similar effect was confirmed for the process of sulfuric acid alkylation of high-octane gasoline production.",10.1007/s10692-019-10066-9

J,"Campisi, LD",On apparent mass-independent fractionation (MIF) signatures from phase partitioning at equilibrium,"The chance of apparent isotope anomalies either in closed systems at equilibrium or during Rayleigh processes is investigated. The term 'apparent' is chosen to highlight that only mass-dependent fractionation (MDF) processes are considered. A goal is finding analytical expressions that could be used for dealing with the complexity of real systems. For example, the formula for calculating the isotopic fractionation in systems with any desired number of phases involved is identified. Terrestrial samples could exhibit artificially low MIF signatures because Delta is not invariant with the choice of the reference material. An alternative parameter Delta* only depending on beta is therefore introduced. The potential transfer of sample points in a three-isotope plot to parallel lines during reversible processes is also investigated. Larger apparent anomalies are expected in systems lacking an infinite reservoir and for large enrichment factors. Pyrite is stable beyond the conditions for a reducing environment and MIF signatures from Archaean sediments could be compatible with reversible processes involving oxidised species. Isotope anomalies in pyrite from the Dresser Formation, Australia, are compatible with post-depositional incorporation of 2-5% sulphur of atmospheric origin. Overall, observed delta values could mainly be related to changes in the local absolute isotope abundances.",10.1080/10256016.2019.1688318

J,"Asano, A; Yamada, T; Doi, M","Incorporation of β-amino acids into ascidiacyclamides: Effects on conformation, cytotoxicity and interaction with copper (II) ion","Seven ascidiacyclamide [cyclo(-Ile-oxazoline-d-Val-thiazole-)(2)] (ASC) analogues incorporating the beta-amino acids beta Ile, beta oxazoline, and/or d-beta Val were synthesized. We then investigated the effects of the position and number of incorporated beta-amino acids on the structure, cytotoxicity, and copper binding by these seven analogues. The structural analyses revealed that both beta Ile and d-beta Val favor a gauche-type theta torsion angles, while beta oxazoline favors a trans-type theta torsion angle. Expansion of the macrocycle by incorporation of beta Ile or d-beta Val readily induced molecular folding. On the other hand, the incorporation of two beta oxazoline residues strongly extended the peptide conformation, and the incorporation of one was sufficient for the moderate restriction important for conformational equilibrium and cytotoxicity. Despite expansion of the macrocycles, the structure-cytotoxicity relationships were largely maintained. In studies of complexation of the analogues with Cu (II) ion, the position and number of incorporated beta-amino acids had a large impact on the structure of the metal complex and may contribute to its stabilization.",10.1002/psc.3225
J,"Khemakhem, M; Raveyre, C; Monchatre, B; Sardo, L; Carrot, C",Gelation of Plasticized Polyvinyl Chloride Compounds in a Co-Kneader,"The co-kneader is a proper tool for processing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compounds. Gelation of PVC is complex because of a narrow processing window. At low temperature, gelation is incomplete and leads to poor mechanical properties, while at high temperature, degradation may occur. The aim of this study is to gain a fundamental understanding of the gelation process of PVC in co-kneaders. Careful examination of the gelation state of extruded PVC samples was carried out qualitatively by swelling the extruded samples in acetone and quantitatively by differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Gelation in various conditions of temperature and shear was firstly studied in a capillary device that ensures both pre-shearing and extrusion through a circular die. This provided a reference basis for comparison with gelation state obtained in the co-kneader. Samples were collected in the co-kneader by means of opening the barrel. The gelation state was particularly examined in connection with the measured temperature at a fixed position along the screw at which a temperature sensor was positioned. The obtained results showed that the co-kneader allows fast gelation with a mixing energy value lower than 200kJ/kg when the temperature is higher than a critical value of 165 degrees C for the studied formulation.

The absorption spectrum for the lambda = 266 nm photolysis of the 4-C6H4CH3X (X = Cl, Br)/N-2/O-2 mixture was measured in the wavelength range of lambda = 503-512 nm using N-2 as the buffer gas at a total pressure of 40 Torr using a cavity ring-down spectroscopy apparatus coupled with a pulsed laser photolysis system. Based on the absorbance of the product of the 4-C6H4CH3 + O-2 reaction at lambda = 504 nm, the reaction rate coefficient for the 4-C6H4CH3 + O-2 reaction was determined to be k = (1.21 +/- 0.10) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and k = (1.18 +/- 0.21) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) using 4-C6H4CH3Cl and 4-C6H4CH3Br, respectively, as the radical precursor. And there was no pressure dependence in the total pressure range of 10-90 Torr varying partial pressure of N-2 buffer gas at T = 296 +/- 5 K. The geometries, vibration frequencies, and potential energy surfaces of the reactants, major products, and transition states in the 4-C6H4CH3 + O-2 reaction were determined using the CBS-QB3 method. The k value at the high-pressure limit was calculated to be 1.26 x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) using the variational transition-state theory. The calculated value of k was consistent with the experimental value, which indicated that the 4-C6H4CH3 + O-2 reaction reaches the high-pressure limit at 10 Torr. Therefore, the oxidation of the 4-C6H4CH3 radical is almost 10 times faster than that of the benzyl radical, which has the same chemical formula, at the high-pressure limit.",10.1002/kin.21331
