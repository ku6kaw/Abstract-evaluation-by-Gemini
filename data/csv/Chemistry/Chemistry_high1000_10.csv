J,"Hyeon, T",Chemical synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles,"Recent advances in the synthesis of various magnetic nanoparticles using colloidal chemical approaches are reviewed. Typically, these approaches involve either rapid injection of reagents into hot surfactant solution followed by aging at high temperature, or the mixing of reagents at a low temperature and slow heating under controlled conditions. Spherical cobalt nanoparticles with various crystal structures have been synthesized by thermally decomposing dicobalt octacarbonyl or by reducing cobalt salts. Nanoparticles of Fe-Pt and other related iron or cobalt containing alloys have been made by simultaneously reacting their constituent precursors. Many different ferrite nanoparticles have been synthesized by the thermal decomposition of organometallic precursors followed by oxidation or by low-temperature reactions inside reverse micelles. Rod-shaped iron nanoparticles have been synthesized from the oriented growth of spherical nanoparticles, and cobalt nanodisks were synthesized from the thermal decomposition of dicobalt octacarbonyl in the presence of a mixture of two surfactants.",10.1039/b207789b

The growth of NiSe nanowire film on nickel foam (NiSe/NF) insitu by hydrothermal treatment of NF using NaHSe as Se source is presented. When used as a 3D oxygen evolution electrode, the NiSe/NF exhibits high activity with an overpotential of 270mV required to achieve 20mAcm(-2) and strong durability in 1.0M KOH, and the NiOOH species formed at the NiSe surface serves as the actual catalytic site. The system is also highly efficient for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction in basic media. This bifunctional electrode enables a high-performance alkaline water electrolyzer with 10mAcm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.63V.",10.1002/anie.201503407
J,"MacFarlane, DR; Tachikawa, N; Forsyth, M; Pringle, JM; Howlett, PC; Elliott, GD; Davis, JH; Watanabe, M; Simon, P; Angell, CA",Energy applications of ionic liquids,"Ionic liquids offer a unique suite of properties that make them important candidates for a number of energy related applications. Cation-anion combinations that exhibit low volatility coupled with high electrochemical and thermal stability, as well as ionic conductivity, create the possibility of designing ideal electrolytes for batteries, super-capacitors, actuators, dye sensitised solar cells and thermo-electrochemical cells. In the field of water splitting to produce hydrogen they have been used to synthesize some of the best performing water oxidation catalysts and some members of the protic ionic liquid family co-catalyse an unusual, very high energy efficiency water oxidation process. As fuel cell electrolytes, the high proton conductivity of some of the protic ionic liquid family offers the potential of fuel cells operating in the optimum temperature region above 100 degrees C. Beyond electrochemical applications, the low vapour pressure of these liquids, along with their ability to offer tuneable functionality, also makes them ideal as CO2 absorbents for post-combustion CO2 capture. Similarly, the tuneable phase properties of the many members of this large family of salts are also allowing the creation of phase-change thermal energy storage materials having melting points tuned to the application. This perspective article provides an overview of these developing energy related applications of ionic liquids and offers some thoughts on the emerging challenges and opportunities.",10.1039/c3ee42099j
J,"Grimme, S",Supramolecular Binding Thermodynamics by Dispersion-Corrected Density Functional Theory,"The equilibrium association free enthalpies ?Ga for typical supramolecular complexes in solution are calculated by ab initio quantum chemical methods. Ten neutral and three positively charged complexes with experimental ?Ga values in the range 0 to -21 kcal?mol-1 (on average -6 kcal?mol-1) are investigated. The theoretical approach employs a (nondynamic) single-structure model, but computes the various energy terms accurately without any special empirical adjustments. Dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) with extended basis sets (triple-? and quadruple-? quality) is used to determine structures and gas-phase interaction energies (?E), the COSMO-RS continuum solvation model (based on DFT data) provides solvation free enthalpies and the remaining ro-vibrational enthalpic/entropic contributions are obtained from harmonic frequency calculations. Low-lying vibrational modes are treated by a free-rotor approximation. The accurate account of London dispersion interactions is mandatory with contributions in the range -5 to -60 kcal?mol-1 (up to 200?% of ?E). Inclusion of three-body dispersion effects improves the results considerably. A semilocal (TPSS) and a hybrid density functional (PW6B95) have been tested. Although the ?Ga values result as a sum of individually large terms with opposite sign (?E vs. solvation and entropy change), the approach provides unprecedented accuracy for ?Ga values with errors of only 2 kcal?mol-1 on average. Relative affinities for different guests inside the same host are always obtained correctly. The procedure is suggested as a predictive tool in supramolecular chemistry and can be applied routinely to semirigid systems with 300400 atoms. The various contributions to binding and enthalpyentropy compensations are discussed.",10.1002/chem.201200497
J,"Bast√∫s, NG; Comenge, J; Puntes, V",Kinetically Controlled Seeded Growth Synthesis of Citrate-Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles of up to 200 nm: Size Focusing versus Ostwald Ripening,"Monodisperse citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles with a uniform quasi-spherical shape of up to similar to 200 rim and a narrow size distribution were synthesized following a kinetically controlled seeded growth strategy via the reduction of HAuCl4 by sodium citrate. The inhibition of any secondary nucleation during homogeneous growth was controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions: temperature, gold precursor to seed particle concentration, and pH. This method presents improved results regarding the traditional Frens method in several aspects: (i) it produces particles of higher monodispersity; (ii) it allows better control of the gold nanoparticle size and size distribution; and (iii) it leads to higher concentrations. Gold nanoparticles synthesized following this method can be further functionalized with a wide variety of molecules, hence this method appears to be a promising candidate for application in the fields of biomedicine, photonics, and electronics, among others.",10.1021/la201938u

Exosomes are comprised of natural lipid bilayers with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes. We posit that exosomes secreted by monocytes and macrophages can provide an unprecedented opportunity to avoid entrapment in mononuclear phagocytes (as a part of the host immune system), and at the same time enhance delivery of incorporated drugs to target cells ultimately increasing drug therapeutic efficacy. In light of this, we developed a new exosomal-based delivery system for a potent antioxidant, catalase, to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). Catalase was loaded into exosomes ex vivo using different methods: the incubation at room temperature, permeabilization with saponin, freeze-thaw cycles, sonication, or extrusion. The size of the obtained catalase-loaded exosomes (exoCAT) was in the range of 100-200 nm. A reformation of exosomes upon sonication and extrusion, or permeabilization with saponin resulted in high loading efficiency, sustained release, and catalase preservation against proteases degradation. Exosomes were readily taken up by neuronal cells in vitro. A considerable amount of exosomes was detected in PD mouse brain following intranasal administration. ExoCAT provided significant neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo models of PD. Overall, exosome-based catalase formulations have a potential to be a versatile strategy to treat inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders.

J,"Zhao, Y; Truhlar, DG","Design of density functionals that are broadly accurate for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and nonbonded interactions","This paper develops two new hybrid meta exchange-correlation functionals for thermochemistry, thermochemical kinetics, and nonbonded interactions. The new functionals are called PW6B95 (6-parameter functional based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation) and PWB6K (6-parameter functional for kinetics based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation). The resulting methods were comparatively assessed against the MGAE109/3 main group atomization energy database, against the IP13/3 ionization potential database, against the EA13/3 electron affinity database, against the HTBH38/4 and NHTBH38/04 hydrogen-transfer and non-hydrogen-transfer barrier height databases, against the HB6/04 hydrogen bonding database, against the CT7/04 charge-transfer complex database, against the DI6/04 dipole interaction database, against the WI7/05 weak interaction database, and against the new PPS5/05 pi-pi stacking interaction database. From the assessment and comparison of methods, we draw the following conclusions, based on an analysis of mean unsigned errors: (i) The PW6B95, MPW1B95, B98, B97-1, and TPSS1KCIS methods give the best results for a combination of thermochemistry and nonbonded interactions. (ii) PWB6K, MPWB1K, BB1K, MPW1K, and MPW1B95 give the best results for a combination of thermochemical kinetics and nonbonded interactions. (iii) PWB6K outperforms the MP2 method for nonbonded interactions. (iv) PW6B95 gives errors for main group covalent bond energies that are only 0.41 kcal (as measured by mean unsigned error per bond (MUEPB) for the MGAE109 database), as compared to 0.56 kcal/mol for the second best method and 0.92 kcal/mol for B3LYP.",10.1021/jp050536c
J,"Chatterjee, AK; Choi, TL; Sanders, DP; Grubbs, RH",A general model for selectivity in olefin cross metathesis,"In recent years, olefin cross metathesis (CM) has emerged as a powerful and convenient synthetic technique in organic chemistry; however, as a general synthetic method, CM has been limited by the lack of predictability in product selectivity and stereoselectivity. Investigations into olefin cross metathesis with several classes of olefins, including substituted and functionalized styrenes, secondary allylic alcohols, tertiary allylic alcohols, and olefins with alpha-quaternary centers, have led to a general model useful for the prediction of product selectivity and stereoselectivity in cross metathesis. As a general ranking of olefin reactivity in CM, olefins can be categorized by their relative abilities to undergo homodinnerization via cross metathesis and the susceptibility of their homodimers toward secondary metathesis reactions. When an olefin of high reactivity is reacted with an olefin of lower reactivity (sterically bulky, electron-deficient, etc.), selective cross metathesis can be achieved using feedstock stoichiometries as low as 1:1. By employing a metathesis catalyst with the appropriate activity, selective cross metathesis reactions can be achieved with a wide variety of electron-rich, electron-deficient, and sterically bulky olefins. Application of this model has allowed for the prediction and development of selective cross metathesis reactions, culminating in unprecedented three-component intermolecular cross metathesis reactions.",10.1021/ja0214882

In order to rank less classical solvents, a set of Safety, Health and Environment criteria is proposed, aligned with the Global Harmonized System (GHS) and European regulations. A methodology based on a simple combination of these criteria gives an overall preliminary ranking of any solvent. This enables in particular a simplified greenness evaluation of bio-derived solvents.",10.1039/c5gc01008j
J,"Sheppard, D; Terrell, R; Henkelman, G",Optimization methods for finding minimum energy paths,"A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum energy pathways (MEPs) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).

J,"Carlson, C; Hussain, SM; Schrand, AM; Braydich-Stolle, LK; Hess, KL; Jones, RL; Schlager, JJ",Unique Cellular Interaction of Silver Nanoparticles: Size-Dependent Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species,"The rapid advancement of nanotechnology has created a vast array of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) which have unique physical (size, shape, crystallinity, surface charge) and chemical (surface coating, elemental composition and solubility) attributes. These physicochemical properties of ENMs can produce chemical conditions to induce a pro-oxidant environment in the cells, causing an imbalanced cellular energy system dependent on redox potential and thereby leading to adverse biological consequences, ranging from the initiation of inflammatory pathways through to cell death. The present study was designed to evaluate size-dependent cellular interactions of known biologically active silver nanoparticles (NPs, Ag-15nm, Ag-30nm, and A-55nm). Alveolar macrophages provide the first defense and were studied for their potential role in initiating oxidative stress. Cell exposure produced morphologically abnormal sizes and adherence characteristics with significant NP uptake at high doses after 24 h. Toxicity evaluations using mitochondrial and cell membrane viability along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) were performed. After 24 h of exposure, viability metrics significantly decreased with increasing dose (10-75 mu g/mL-) of Ag-15nm and Ag-30nm NPs. A more than 10-fold increase of ROS levels in cells exposed to 50 mu g/mL A-15nm suggests that the cytotoxicity of Ag-15nm is likely to be mediated through oxidative stress. In addition, activation of the release of traditional inflammatory mediators were examined by measuring levels of cytokines/chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), released into the culture media. After 24 h of exposure to Ag-15nm nanoparticles, a significant inflammatory response was observed by the release of TNF-alpha, MIP-2, and IL- 1 beta. However, there was no detectable level of IL-6 upon exposure to silver nanoparticles. In Summary, a size-dependent toxicity was produced by silver nanoparticles, and one predominant mechanism of toxicity was found to be largely mediated through oxidative stress.",10.1021/jp712087m
J,"Wheate, NJ; Walker, S; Craig, GE; Oun, R",The status of platinum anticancer drugs in the clinic and in clinical trials,"Since its approval in 1979 cisplatin has become an important component in chemotherapy regimes for the treatment of ovarian, testicular, lung and bladder cancers, as well as lymphomas, myelomas and melanoma. Unfortunately its continued use is greatly limited by severe dose limiting side effects and intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Over the last 30 years, 23 other platinum-based drugs have entered clinical trials with only two (carboplatin and oxaliplatin) of these gaining international marketing approval, and another three (nedaplatin, lobaplatin and heptaplatin) gaining approval in individual nations. During this time there have been more failures than successes with the development of 14 drugs being halted during clinical trials. Currently there are four drugs in the various phases of clinical trial (satraplatin, picoplatin, Lipoplatin (TM) and ProLindac (TM)). No new small molecule platinum drug has entered clinical trials since 1999 which is representative of a shift in focus away from drug design and towards drug delivery in the last decade. In this perspective article we update the status of platinum anticancer drugs currently approved for use, those undergoing clinical trials and those discontinued during clinical trials, and discuss the results in the context of where we believe the field will develop over the next decade.",10.1039/c0dt00292e

Present-day time-dependent density functional theory employing local exchange-correlation functionals does not capture this effect and therefore fails to describe charge-transfer excited states correctly.

J,"Foloppe, N; MacKerell, AD",All-atom empirical force field for nucleic acids: I. Parameter optimization based on small molecule and condensed phase macromolecular target data,"Empirical force-field calculations on biological molecules represent an effective method to obtain atomic detail information on the relationship of their structure to their function. Results from those calculations depend on the quality of the force field. In this manuscript, optimization of the CHARMM27 all-atom empirical force field for nucleic acids is presented together with the resulting parameters. The optimization procedure is based on the reproduction of small molecule target data from both experimental and quantum mechanical studies and condensed phase structural properties of DNA and RNA. Via an iterative approach, the parameters were primarily optimized to reproduce macromolecular target data while maximizing agreement with small molecule target data. This approach is expected to ensure that the different contributions from the individual moieties in the nucleic acids are properly balanced to yield condensed phase properties of DNA and RNA, which are consistent with experiment. The quality of the presented force field in reproducing both crystal and solution properties are detailed in the present and an accompanying manuscript (MacKerell and Banavali, J Comput Chem, this issue). The resultant parameters represent the latest step in the continued development of the CHARMM all-atom biomolecular force field for proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.

J,"Vadivelan, V; Kumar, KV","Equilibrium, kinetics, mechanism, and process design for the sorption of methylene blue onto rice husk","Batch experiments were carried out for the sorption of methylene blue onto rice husk particles. The operating variables studied were initial solution pH, initial dye concentration, adsorbent concentration, and contact time. Equilibrium data were fitted to the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm equations and the equilibrium data were found to be well represented by the Langmuir isotherm equation. The monolayer sorption capacity of rice husks for methylene blue sorption was found to be 40.5833 mg/g at room temperature (32 degrees C). The sorption was analyzed using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models and the sorption kinetics was found to follow a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Also the applicability of pseudo second order in modeling the kinetic data was also discussed. The sorption process was found to be controlled by both surface and pore diffusion with surface diffusion at the earlier stages followed by pore diffusion at the later stages. The average external mass transfer coefficient and intraparticle diffusion coefficient was found to be 0.01133 min(-1) and 0.695358 mg/g min(0.5). Analysis of sorption data using a Boyd plot confirms that external mass transfer is the rate limiting step in the sorption process. The effective diffusion coefficient, D-i was calculated using the Boyd constant and was found to be 5.05 x 10(-04) cm(2)/s for an initial dye concentration of 50 mg/L. A single-stage batch-adsorber design of the adsorption of methylene blue onto rice husk has been studied based on the Langmuir isotherm equation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Kirklin, S; Saal, JE; Meredig, B; Thompson, A; Doak, JW; Aykol, M; R√ºhl, S; Wolverton, C",The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD): assessing the accuracy of DFT formation energies,"The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) is a high-throughput database currently consisting of nearly 300,000 density functional theory (DFT) total energy calculations of compounds from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and decorations of commonly occurring crystal structures. To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096 eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082 eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of similar to 3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.",10.1038/npjcompumats.2015.10

J,"Oostinga, JB; Heersche, HB; Liu, XL; Morpurgo, AF; Vandersypen, LMK",Gate-induced insulating state in bilayer graphene devices,"The potential of graphene-based materials consisting of one or a few layers of graphite for integrated electronics originates from the large room-temperature carrier mobility in these systems (similar to 10,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). However, the realization of electronic devices such as field-effect transistors will require controlling and even switching offthe electrical conductivity by means of gate electrodes, which is made difficult by the absence of a bandgap in the intrinsic material. Here, we demonstrate the controlled induction of an insulating state-with large suppression of the conductivity-in bilayer graphene, by using a double-gate device configuration that enables an electric field to be applied perpendicular to the plane. The dependence of the resistance on temperature and electric field, and the absence of any effect in a single-layer device, strongly suggest that the gate-induced insulating state originates from the recently predicted opening of a bandgap between valence and conduction bands.",10.1038/nmat2082

J,"Bolton, JL; Trush, MA; Penning, TM; Dryhurst, G; Monks, TJ",Role of quinones in toxicology,"Quinones represent a class of toxicological intermediates which can create a variety of hazardous effects in vivo, including acute cytotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and carcinogenesis. The mechanisms by which quinones cause these effects can be quite complex. Quinones are Michael accepters, and cellular damage can occur through alkylation of crucial cellular proteins and/or DNA. Alternatively; quinones are highly redox active molecules which can redox cycle with their semiquinone radicals, leading to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and ultimately the hydroxyl radical. Production of ROS can cause severe oxidative stress within cells through the formation of oxidized cellular macromolecules, including lipids, proteins, and DNA. Formation of oxidatively damaged bases such as 8-oxodeoxyguanosine has been associated with aging and carcinogenesis. Furthermore, ROS can activate a number of signaling pathways, including protein kinase C and RAS. This review explores the varied cytotoxic effects of quinones using specific examples, including quinones produced from benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, estrogens, and catecholamines. The evidence strongly suggests that the numerous mechanisms of quinone toxicity (i.e., alkylation vs oxidative stress) can be correlated with the known pathology of the parent compound(s).",10.1021/tx9902082

J,"Cammarata, L; Kazarian, SG; Salter, PA; Welton, T",Molecular states of water in room temperature ionic liquids,"ATR and transmission IR spectroscopy have been used to investigate the state of water in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) based on the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cation with the anions: [PF6](-), [SbF6](-), [BF4](-), [ClO4](-), [CF3SO3](-), [(CF3SO2)(2)N](-), [NO3](-) and [CF3CO2](-). It has been shown that in these RTILs water molecules absorbed from the air are present mostly in the ""free"" (not self-associated) state, bound via H-bonding with [PF6](-), [BF4](-), [SbF6](-), [ClO4](-), [CF3SO3](-), [(CF3SO2)(2)N](-) with the concentrations of dissolved water in the range 0.2-1.0 mol dm(-3). It has been concluded that most of the water molecules at these concentrations exist in symmetric 1:2 type H-bonded complexes: anion . . . HOH . . . anion. Additional evidence that the preferred sites of interaction with water molecules are the anions has been obtained from the experiments with RTILs of the 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium and 1-butyl-2,3,4,5-tetramethylimidazolium cations. Water molecules can also form associated liquid-like formations in RTILs with anions of stronger basicity such as [NO3](-) and [CF3CO2](-). When these RTILs are exposed to air the water concentrations exceed 1.0 mol dm(-3). The strength of H-bonding between water molecules and anions increases in the order [PF6](-) <[SbF6](-) <[BF4](-) <[(CF3SO2)(2)N](-) <[ClO4](-) <[CF3SO3](-) <[NO3](-) <[CF3CO2](-).

It was attempted to determine the feasibility of such a degradation by varying the chemical structures, either anthraquinonic (Alizarin S (AS)), or azoic (Crocein Orange G (OG), Methyl Red (MR), Congo Red (CR)) or heteropolyaromatic (Methylene Blue (MB)). In addition to a prompt removal of the colors, TiO2/UV-based photocatalysis was simultaneously able to fully oxidize the dyes, with a complete mineralization of carbon into CO2. Sulfur heteroatoms were converted into innocuous SO(4)(2-)ions. The mineralization of nitrogen was more complex. Nitrogen atoms in the -3 oxidation state, such as in amino-groups, remain at this reduction degree and produced NH4+ cations, subsequently and very slowly converted into NO3- ions. For azo-dye (OG, MR, CR) degradation, the complete mass balance in nitrogen indicated that the central -N=N- azo-group was converted in gaseous dinitrogen, which is the ideal issue for the elimination of nitrogen-containing pollutants, not only for environmental photocatalysis but also for any physicochemical method. The aromatic rings were submitted to successive attacks by photogenerated OH. radicals leading to hydroxylated metabolites before the ring opening and the final evolution of CO2 induced by repeated subsequent ""photo-Kolbe"" reactions with carboxylic intermediates. These results suggest that TiO2/UV photocatalysis maybe envisaged as a method for treatment of diluted colored waste waters not only for decolorization, but also for detoxification, in particular in textile industries in semi-arid countries.

Procedures for estimating the O-H BDE based on group additivity rules are given and tested. Several interesting classes of phenolic antioxidants are studied with these methods, including commercial antioxidants used as food additives, compounds related to Vitamin E, flavonoids in tea, aminophenols, stilbenes related to resveratrol, and sterically hindered phenols.

However, the dependence on expensive Pt-based electrocatalysts in such fuel cells remains a major obstacle for a widespread deployment of this technology. One solution to overcome this predicament is to reduce the Pt content by a factor of ten by replacing the Pt-based catalysts with non-precious metal catalysts at the oxygen-reducing cathode. Fe-and Co-based electrocatalysts for this reaction have been studied for over 50 years, but they were insufficiently active for the high efficiency and power density needed for transportation fuel cells. Recently, several breakthroughs occurred that have increased the activity and durability of non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs), which can now be regarded as potential competitors to Pt-based catalysts. This review focuses on the new synthesis methods that have led to these breakthroughs. A modeling analysis is also conducted to analyze the improvements required from NPMC-based cathodes to match the performance of Pt-based cathodes, even at high current density. While no further breakthrough in volume-specific activity of NPMCs is required, incremental improvements of the volume-specific activity and effective protonic conductivity within the fuel-cell cathode are necessary. Regarding durability, NPMCs with the best combination of durability and activity result in ca. 3 times lower fuel cell performance than the most active NPMCs at 0.80 V. Thus, major tasks will be to combine durability with higher activity, and also improve durability at cell voltages greater than 0.60 V.",10.1039/c0ee00011f
J,"Politzer, P; Murray, JS; Clark, T",Halogen bonding and other œÉ-hole interactions: a perspective,"A sigma-hole bond is a noncovalent interaction between a covalently-bonded atom of Groups IV-VII and a negative site, e.g. a lone pair of a Lewis base or an anion. It involves a region of positive electrostatic potential, labeled a sigma-hole, on the extension of one of the covalent bonds to the atom. The sigma-hole is due to the anisotropy of the atom's charge distribution. Halogen bonding is a subset of sigma-hole interactions. Their features and properties can be fully explained in terms of electrostatics and polarization plus dispersion. The strengths of the interactions generally correlate well with the magnitudes of the positive and negative electrostatic potentials of the sigma-hole and the negative site. In certain instances, however, polarizabilities must be taken into account explicitly, as the polarization of the negative site reaches a level that can be viewed as a degree of dative sharing (coordinate covalence). In the gas phase, sigma-hole interactions with neutral bases are often thermodynamically unfavorable due to the relatively large entropy loss upon complex formation.",10.1039/c3cp00054k

Recently, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbons has shown some promise in growing large-area graphene or few-layer graphene films on metal substrates such as Ni and Cu. It has been proposed that CVD growth of graphene on Ni occurs by a C segregation or precipitation process whereas graphene on Cu grows by a surface adsorption process. Here we used carbon isotope labeling in conjunction with Raman spectroscopic mapping to track carbon during the growth process. The data clearly show that at high temperatures sequentially introduced isotopic carbon diffuses into the Ni first, mixes, and then segregates and precipitates at the surface of Ni forming graphene and/or graphite with a uniform mixture of C-12 and C-13 as determined by the peak position of the Raman G-band peak. On the other hand, graphene growth on Cu is clearly by surface adsorption where the spatial distribution of C-12 and C-13 follows the precursor time sequence and the linear growth rate ranges from about 1 to as high as 6 mu m/min depending upon Cu grain orientation.

MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification.

Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of H-1 NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.",10.1021/ac051632c

A long-held view is that unstable electrodeposition is a consequence of inherent characteristics of these metals and their inability to form uniform electrodeposits on surfaces with inevitable defects. We report on electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolytes. We find that simple liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends exhibit stable long-term cycling at room temperature, often with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge and thousands of operating hours. We rationalize these observations with the help of surface energy data for the electrolyte/lithium interface and impedance analysis of the interface during different stages of cell operation. Our findings provide support for an important recent theoretical prediction that the surface mobility of lithium is significantly enhanced in the presence of lithium halide salts. Our results also show that a high electrolyte modulus is unnecessary for stable electrodeposition of lithium.",10.1038/NMAT4041

To develop a framework for performing consistent and meaningful comparisons between catalysts, we review standard experimental methodologies for measuring catalyst performance and define two metrics used in this perspective for comparing catalyst activity: the turnover frequency, an intrinsic activity metric, and the total electrode activity, a device-oriented activity metric. We discuss general strategies for synthesizing catalysts with improved activity, namely, increasing the number of electrically accessible active sites or increasing the turnover frequency of each site. Then we consider a number of state-of-the-art molybdenum sulfide catalysts, including crystalline MoS2, amorphous MoSx, and molecular cluster materials, to highlight these strategies in practice. Comparing these catalysts reveals that most of the molybdenum sulfide catalysts have similar active site turnover frequencies, so the total electrode activity is primarily determined by the number of accessible active sites per geometric electrode area. Emerging strategies to overcome current catalyst limitations and potential applications for molybdenum sulfide catalysts including photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and electrolyzers are also considered.",10.1021/cs500923c

This paper reports an interesting finding of Au(I)-thiolate complexes: strong luminescence emission by the mechanism of aggregation-induced emission (ME). The AIE property of the complexes was then used to develop a simple one-pot synthesis of highly luminescent Au-thiolate NCs with a quantum yield of similar to 15%. Our key strategy was to induce the controlled aggregation of Au(I)-thiolate complexes on in situ generated Au(0) cores to form Au(0)@Au(I)-thiolate core-shell NCs where strong luminescence was generated by the ATE of Au(I)-thiolate complexes on the NC surface. We were able to extend the synthetic strategy to other thiolate ligands with added functionalities (in the form of custom-designed peptides). The discovery (e.g., identifying the source of emission and the size effect in luminescence) and the synthesis protocols in this study can contribute significantly to better understanding of these new luminescence probes and the development of new synthetic routes.",10.1021/ja306199p

This allows the determination of kinetic data, such as reaction orders or apparent activation energies, for the orr directly without mathematical modeling. Collection experiments reveal a potential and rotation rate independent collection efficiency. RRDE measurements allow. for the first time, the direct determination of the fraction of peroxide production juring oxygen reduction on supported catalysts. Finally, comparison of measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M HClO4, respectively, reveals a significant effect of (bi)sulfate adsorption on the orr activity.

J,"Riplinger, C; Neese, F",An efficient and near linear scaling pair natural orbital based local coupled cluster method,"In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 10(5)-10(6) relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e. g., >100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below <0.05%, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD (""domain based LPNO-CCSD""). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured >8800 basis functions and >450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

J,"Politzer, P; Murray, JS; Clark, T",Halogen bonding: an electrostatically-driven highly directional noncovalent interaction,"A halogen bond is a highly directional, electrostatically-driven noncovalent interaction between a region of positive electrostatic potential on the outer side of the halogen X in a molecule R-X and a negative site B, such as a lone pair of a Lewis base or the pi-electrons of an unsaturated system. The positive region on X corresponds to the electronically-depleted outer lobe of the half-filled p-type orbital of X that is involved in forming the covalent bond to R. This depletion is labeled a sigma-hole. The resulting positive electrostatic potential is along the extension of the R-X bond, which accounts for the directionality of halogen bonding. Positive sigma-holes can also be found on covalently-bonded Group IV-VI atoms, which can similarly interact electrostatically with negative sites. Since positive sigma-holes often exist in conjunction with negative potentials on other portions of the atom's surface, such atoms can interact electrostatically with both nucleophiles and electrophiles, as has been observed in surveys of crystallographic structures. Experimental as well as computational studies indicate that halogen and other sigma-hole interactions can be competitive with hydrogen bonding, which itself can be viewed as a subset of sigma-hole bonding.",10.1039/c004189k

J,"Jain, PK; Huang, WY; El-Sayed, MA",On the universal scaling behavior of the distance decay of plasmon coupling in metal nanoparticle pairs: A plasmon ruler equation,"Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in lithographically fabricated gold (Au) nanodisc pairs are investigated using microabsorption spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting ""universal"" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a ""plasmon ruler equation"" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band. We find good agreement of the interparticle separations estimated using this equation with the experimental observations of Reinhard et al.",10.1021/nl071008a

The results are significantly different from those known for graphite. Spectra were collected using 514.5 nm radiation on films containing from n = 1 to 20 graphene layers, as determined by atomic force microscopy. Both the first- and second-order Raman spectra show unique signatures of the number of layers in the film. The nGL film analogue of the Raman G-band in graphite exhibits a Lorentzian line shape whose center frequency shifts linearly relative to graphite as similar to 1/n (for n = 1 omega(G) approximate to 1587 cm(-1)). Three weak bands, identified with disorder-induced first-order scattering, are observed at similar to 1350, 1450, and 1500 cm(-1). The similar to 1500 cm(-1) band is weak but relatively sharp and exhibits an interesting n-dependence. In general, the intensity of these D-bands decreases dramatically with increasing n. Three second-order bands are also observed (similar to 2450, similar to 2700, and 3248 cm(-1)). They are analogues to those observed in graphite. However, the similar to 2700 cm(-1) band exhibits an interesting and dramatic change of shape with n. Interestingly, for n < 5 this second-order band is more intense than the G-band.",10.1021/nl061420a

According to high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, they have different exposed crystal planes: {111} and {100} for polyhedra, {110} and {100} for rods, and {100} for cubes. During the synthesis, the formation of hexagonal Ce(OH)(3) intermediate species and their transformation into CeO2 at elevated temperature, together with the base concentration, have been demonstrated as the key factors responsible for the shape evolution. Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements at. 400 degrees C revealed that the oxygen storage takes place both at the surface and in the bulk for the as-obtained CeO2 nanorods and nanocubes, but is restricted at the surface for the nanopolyhedra just like the bulk one, because the {100}/{110}-dominated surface structures are more reactive for CO oxidation than the {111}-dominated one.

The properties follow quite reasonable trends. For instance, density decreases as the length of the alkyl chain on the cation increases. For a given cation, the density increases as the molecular weight of the anion increases for the anions studied here.

In this context, the crystal structure of the acetylcholine-binding proteins provides the theoretical foundation for designing homology models of the corresponding receptor ligand binding domains within the nAChRs, a useful basis for virtual screening of chemical libraries and rational design of novel insecticides acting on these practically relevant channels. Because of the relatively low risk for nontarget organisms and the environment, the high target specificity of neonicotinoid insecticides, and their versatility in application methods, this important class has to be maintained globally for integrated pest management strategies and insect resistance management programs.

For interfaces between polar and nonpolar layers, this goal is thwarted by a polar catastrophe that forces an interfacial reconstruction. In traditional semiconductors, this reconstruction is achieved by an atomic disordering and stoichiometry change at the interface, but a new option is available in multivalent oxides: if the electrons can move, the atoms do not have to. Using atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy, we have examined the microscopic distribution of charge and ions across the (001) LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. We find that there is a fundamental asymmetry between the ionically compensated AlO2/SrO/TiO2 interface, and the electronically compensated AlO2/ LaO/TiO2 interface, both in interfacial sharpness and charge density.

Scaling relations are correlations between surface bond energies of different adsorbed species including transition states; they open the possibility of mapping the many parameters determining the rate of a full catalytic reaction onto a few descriptors. The resulting activity map can be viewed as a quantitative implementation of the classical Sabatier principle, which states that there is an optimum ""bond strength"" defining the best catalyst for a given reaction. In the modern version, the scaling relations determine the relevant ""bond strengths"" and the fact that these descriptors can be measured or calculated makes it a quantitative theory of catalysis that can be tested experimentally by making specific predictions of new catalysts. The quantitative aspect of the model therefore provides new possibilities in catalyst design. Finally, the d-band model provides an understanding of the scaling relations and variations in catalytic activity in terms of the electronic structure of the transition-metal surface.

The processing additives simultaneously facilitate nucleation and modulate the kinetics of crystal growth during crystallization, leading to much smoother perovskite morphology with improved coverage area and crystal uniformity. As a result, it enables very high PCE (similar to 12%) planar-heterojunction solar cells to be fabricated through the low-temperature solution processes (under 150 degrees C).

So far, CQD solar cells have relied on the use of organic ligands to passivate the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticles. Although inorganic metal chalcogenide ligands have led to record electronic transport parameters in CQD films, no photovoltaic device has been reported based on such compounds. Here we establish an atomic ligand strategy that makes use of monovalent halide anions to enhance electronic transport and successfully passivate surface defects in PbS CQD films. Both time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and transient device characterization indicate that the scheme leads to a shallower trap state distribution than the best organic ligands. Solar cells fabricated following this strategy show up to 6% solar AM1.5G power-conversion efficiency. The CQD films are deposited at room temperature and under ambient atmosphere, rendering the process amenable to low-cost, roll-by-roll fabrication.",10.1038/NMAT3118

Salvia officinalis was used as a reference plant with well documented antioxidant activity. G. macrorrhizum and P. fruticosa extracts possessed very high radical scavenging activity (RSA) in both assays, higher than that of S. officinalis extract. High RSA was also characteristic to other Salvia species and Rhaponticum carthamoides. The content of total phenolic compounds, flavonoids and flavonols was measured in plant extracts. A correlation between radical scavenging capacities of extracts with total phenolic compound content was observed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.foodchem.2003.05.007

Integrated energy storage devices of this type are a key area that is still significantly underdeveloped, Here, we describe wearable power devices using everyday textiles as the platform. With an extremely simple ""dipping and drying"" process using single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) ink, we produced highly conductive textiles with conductivity of 125 S cm(-1) and sheet resistance less than 1 Omega/sq. Such conductive textiles show outstanding flexibility and stretchability and demonstrate strong adhesion between the SWNTs and the textiles of interest. Supercapacitors made from these conductive textiles show high areal capacitance, up to 0.48F/cm(2), and high specific energy. We demonstrate the loading of pseudocapacitor materials into these conductive textiles that leads to a 24-fold increase of the areal capacitance of the device.

Cl-based additives are among the most prevalent in literature, yet their exact role is still uncertain. In this work, we systematically study the function of methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI(3))-based perovskite. Using density functional theory, we provide a theoretical framework for understanding the interaction of MACl with a perovskite. We show that MACl successfully induces an intermediate to the pure FAPbI(3) alpha-phase without annealing. The formation energy is related to the amount of incorporated MACl. By tuning the incorporation of MACl, the perovskite film quality can be significantly improved, exhibiting a 6 x increase in grain size, a 3 x increase in phase crystallinity, and a 4.3 x increase in photoluminescence lifetime. The optimized solar cells achieved a certified efficiency of 23.48%.",10.1016/j.joule.2019.06.014
J,"Zhang, XQ; Cheng, XB; Chen, X; Yan, C; Zhang, Q",Fluoroethylene Carbonate Additives to Render Uniform Li Deposits in Lithium Metal Batteries,"Lithium (Li) metal has been considered as an important substitute for the graphite anode to further boost the energy density of Li-ion batteries. However, Li dendrite growth during Li plating/stripping causes safety concern and poor lifespan of Li metal batteries (LMB). Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additives are used to form a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The FEC-induced SEI layer is compact and stable, and thus beneficial to obtain a uniform morphology of Li deposits. This uniform and dendrite-free morphology renders a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency of 98% within 100 cycles in a Li | Cu half-cell. When the FEC-protected Li metal anode matches a high-loading LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NMC) cathode (12 mg cm(-2)), a high initial capacity of 154 mAh g(-1) (1.9 mAh cm(-2)) at 180.0 mA g(-1) is obtained. This LMB with conversion-type Li metal anode and intercalation-type NMC cathode affords an emerging energy storage system to probe the energy chemistry of Li metal protection and demonstrates the material engineering of batteries with very high energy density.",10.1002/adfm.201605989

J,"Vrancken, B; Thijs, L; Kruth, JP; Van Humbeeck, J",Heat treatment of Ti6Al4V produced by Selective Laser Melting: Microstructure and mechanical properties,"The present work shows that optimization of mechanical properties via heat treatment of parts produced by Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is profoundly different compared to conventionally processed Ti6Al4V. In order to obtain optimal mechanical properties, specific treatments are necessary due to the specific microstructure resulting from the SLM process. SLM is an additive manufacturing technique through which components are built by selectively melting powder layers with a focused laser beam. The process is characterized by short laser-powder interaction times and localized high heat input, which leads to steep thermal gradients, rapid solidification and fast cooling. In this research, the effect of several heat treatments on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V processed by SLM is studied. A comparison is made with the effect of these treatments on hot forged and subsequently mill annealed Ti6Al4V with an original equiaxed microstructure. For SLM produced parts, the original martensite alpha' phase is converted to a lamellar mixture of alpha and beta for heat treating temperatures below the beta-transus (995 degrees C), but features of the original microstructure are maintained. Treated above the beta-transus, extensive grain growth occurs and large beta grains are formed which transform to lamellar alpha + beta upon cooling. Post treating at 850 degrees C for 2 h, followed by furnace cooling increased the ductility of SLM parts to 12.84 +/- 1.36%, compared to 7.36 +/- 1.32% for as-built parts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
