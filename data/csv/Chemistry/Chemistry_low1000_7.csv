The effective parameters in vibronic coupling between reference states have been investigated in planar structures. Calculations at the B3LYP/DEF2-TZVPP, MP2/DEF2-TZVPP, and M062X/DEF2-TZVPP levels of theory produced the structural parameters, corrected electronic energies, electronegativity and hardness. The natural bond orbital (NBO) interpretation is associated with to obtain stabilization energy, vibronic coupling constant (), and energy gaps between reference states (.).The interactions and effectiveness of these parameters with the structural parameters of the desired compounds were the focus of the study.",10.1134/S003602441911030X
J,"Tan, XJ; Lu, XH",Features of Mechanism of Cycloaddition Reaction between H<sub>2</sub>Sn=Sn: and Ethylene,"X2Sn=Sn: (X = H, Me, F, Cl, Br, Ph, Ar, horizontal ellipsis ) are new species of chemistry. The cycloaddition reaction of X2Sn=Sn: are new study field of stannylene chemistry. To explore the rules of cycloaddition reaction between X2Sn=Sn: and the symmetric pi-bonded compounds, the cycloaddition reactions of H2Sn=Sn: and ethylene were selected as model reactions in this paper. The mechanism of cycloaddition reaction between singlet H2Sn=Sn: and ethylene has been first investigated with the MP2/GENECP (C, H in 6-311++G**; Sn in LanL2dz) method in this paper. From the potential energy profile, it could be predicted that the reaction has one dominant reaction channel. The reaction rule presented is that the two reactants firstly form a four-membered Sn-heterocyclic ring stannylene through the [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. Because of the 5p unoccupied orbital of Sn: atom in the four-membered Sn-heterocyclic ring stannylene and the pi orbital of ethylene forming a pi -> p donor-acceptor bond, the four-membered Sn-heterocyclic ring stannylene further combines with ethylene to form an intermediate. Because the Sn: atom in intermediate happens sp(3) hybridization after transition state, then, intermediate isomerizes to a spiro-Sn-heterocyclic ring compound. The research result indicates the laws of cycloaddition reaction between X2Sn=Sn: and the symmetric pi-bonded compounds. The study opens up a new research field for stannylene chemistry.",10.1134/S0036024419110311
J,"Tarabai, MK; de Azevedo, SG",USE OF SLUDGE FROM SANITARY SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS (S.T.P) AND THEIR USE AS RAW MATERIAL IN THE MANUFACTURE OF BRICKS,"This paper discusses a possible solution regarding the final disposal of sludge from Sanitary Sewage Treatment Stations (ET), aiming at environmental preservation. The solid waste generated after the wastewater treatment processes is highly contaminating and detrimental to the area in which it is deposited. Given this, the use of sludge with the application of reuse techniques becomes pertinent, both from the economic point of view and from the ecological point of view. By replacing the use of aggregates from mineral deposits, the main clay raw material in the manufacture of ceramic products (Vieira, 2000), by the treated sludge of WWTP we will save on the sources of granular materials. Aiming its reintegration to the production cycle through the introduction of sludge as raw material incorporated in the ceramic mass in the manufacture of hollow bricks, the viability of use was verified through performance analysis, compared to the control brick made of pottery, without the addition of sludge. Specimens were prepared with three types of samples: 90% clay and 10% sludge; 80% clay and 20% sludge; 70% clay and 30% sludge. Mass loss, water absorption index and compressive strength tests were performed. As for the tests, the specimens with 10% and 20% of sludge were the ones that had better adaptation to the technical requirements, but because it is a larger volume of the residue for the application of reuse techniques, the brick with 20% sludge dosage. is the most suitable. NBR7.171, November 1992: Ceramic Block for masonry; Specification NBR 6.461, June 1983: Masonry Ceramic Block - Compressive Strength Check: Test Method; NBR 8.947, November 1992: Ceramic Tile- Determination of Mass and Water Absorption: Test Method. As for the tests, the specimen with 20% of sludge was the one that had the best adaptation to technical and environmental requirements. The present article approaches a possible solution regarding the destination of the sludge coming from Sanitary Sewage Treatment Stations, aiming at environmental preservation. Aiming at its reintegration into the productive cycle through applications of reuse techniques, the sludge became raw material when the ceramic mass was incorporated into the brick fabrication. Three types of samples were elaborated: 90% of clay and 10% of mud; 80% clay and 20% sludge; 70% clay and 30% sludge. As for the tests, the test specimen with 20% of sludge was the one that had more adequacy to the technical and environmental requirements.",
J,"Tomozeiu, N",VIS-optical reflectometry: a method to investigate latex-based coatings,"In many applications, water-based dispersions of polymeric particles are dried under welldefined environmental conditions and/or technologies to form a continuous thin layer with special properties and morphology. The aim of this work is to present a recently developed noninvasive technique based on optical reflectometry in visible range used to study the film formation from aqueous mixtures layered up to 25 lm thickness. The sample holder is made of crystalline silicon (c-Si) because the interference fringes generated by the optical beams reflected at the air/liquid sample and liquid sample/c-Si are vital in determining the sample thickness. For the polymeric colloids with minimum film formation temperature higher than the room temperature, the setup is used to determine the evaporation rate and the temperature film formation. The versatility of the experimental setup is increased by a controlled temperature of the sample holder and a controlled microclimate chamber (temperature and relative humidity). Investigations on various aqueous dispersions considering the composition, the viscosity of the liquid, and different types of polymeric colloidal particles have been performed, and some results are discussed here. New challenges lie in analyzing the outputs of the experiments considering the interparticle distance and interparticle interferences.",10.1007/s11998-019-00218-1

The approach used has made it possible to determine the frontier of the resource potential of heavy petroleum residues, that is, to predict the quality of asphalt for any combination of the composition of residual petroleum feedstock and obtain information about the necessity of adjusting the component composition of mixtures for manufacturing the product with desired properties. Using a sample of 99 experiments, it has been shown that the highest efficiency in achieving the normative characteristics of asphalt is achieved by introducing heavy vacuum gas oil and atmospheric residue into a highly viscous vacuum residue. The feasibility has been shown of using effectively deasphalted asphalt and slop as modifying components, the optimum concentrations of which in the vacuum residue are 20 and 40 wt %, respectively.",10.1134/S0965544119110148
J,"Udal'tsov, AV",Proton-sharing frequency and dynamic characteristics of water molecule in the liquid in terms of polaronic exciton concept,"A developed polaronic concept has been suggested to describe dynamic molecular behavior of water with proton sharing. Fluctuating hydrogen-bonded structures formed due to the intermolecular dynamics provide different relaxation processes when microwave or THz spectroscopy is applied. Relaxation characteristics of water molecules in the liquid have been estimated by different modes taking into consideration proton sharing between the hydrogen-bonded molecules. One of the mode was deduced using Maxwell relation eta = B-m tau(r), where eta is dynamic viscosity, B-m is bulk modulus, and tau(r) is relaxation time. The latter (tau(r)) depending on temperature was used to estimate Debye relaxation time and its fast component (tau(2)). Rotational relaxation time (tau(rot)), which has been connected with tau(2), is introduced to characterize rotation of 2p(4)-electron orbit configuration arisen because of hydrogen bonding oscillations. Relaxation time of proton motion in the N-H+center dot center dot center dot O moiety with single hydrogen bond described like boson moving is found consistent with tau(2) of water.

For C-13 sites adjacent to protons, H-1-decoupling has been shown to increase the hyperpolarized signal resolution and SNR. Additionally, polarization transfer to protons has shown utility in increasing the sensitivity of detection. However, H-1-decoupling could lead to a change in the decay rate of a hyperpolarized C-13 site. Here we tested this possible effect in a case where the protons are directly bound to an sp(3) hyperpolarized C-13 site (using [1,2-C-13(2)]choline) and H-1-decoupling was applied continuously throughout the hyperpolarized decay measurement. We found that H-1-decoupling did not lead to any significant changes in the C-13 polarization decay time but did result in the expected collapse of J-coupling and produced sharper signals. This result suggested that H-1-decoupling did not affect the decay rate of hyperpolarized sp(3 13)C sites. The deuterium-substitution approach (using [1,1,2,2-D-4,1-C-13]choline) showed a dramatic prolongation of T-1. Upper bounds on the T-1 of all investigated sites were calculated.",10.1002/ijch.201900016
J,"Utamura, N; Yamamoto, S; Kinoshita, M; Suzuki, S",A New Separation Mode for Non-aqueous Capillary Electrophoresis Using Excess Adsorption of Cationic Species Electrolytes,"Non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis (NACE) has been developed as a powerful analytical method for a group of compounds having both a weak charge and high hydrophobicity, including pharmaceuticals. NACE is possible to apply a high voltage because of the low current value, compared to the commonly used aqueous system, which enables to shorten the analysis time. In addition, an improvement in the detection sensitivity can be attainable by sample stacking using an increased concentration of electrolytes. Hitherto, NACE has been limited to use as an alternative to aqueous capillary electrophoresis method, such as suppression of the current value, improving of the solubility of a hydrophobic compound, and adjusting the electroosmotic flow. In the process of searching for new analysis conditions for NACE, we found that the electroosmotic flow is reversed from the cathode to the anode by using boric acid/potassium borate with 1-propanol buffer solution. This phenomenon mainly occurs specifically in a solvent system containing 1-propanol, and the speed can be controlled by the mixing ratio of the solvents. In this study, we examined in detail the effect of the buffer composition for EOF direction and separation, and developed a new analysis method.",

Diluted HNO3 and H2SO4 were used as the mobile and striping phases, respectively. In these stages, concentrations of HNO3 and H2SO4 solutions for the uranium extraction yield were optimized. We found that 5 M HNO3 and 3 M H2SO4 were the best solutions for uranium separation. Effects of electrodeposition conditions on uranium deposition yield were considered.

J,"Vandoni, J; Le Hégarat-Mascle, S; Aldea, E",Augmenting Deep Learning Performance in an Evidential Multiple Classifier System,"The main objective of this work is to study the applicability of ensemble methods in the context of deep learning with limited amounts of labeled data. We exploit an ensemble of neural networks derived using Monte Carlo dropout, along with an ensemble of SVM classifiers which owes its effectiveness to the hand-crafted features used as inputs and to an active learning procedure. In order to leverage each classifier's respective strengths, we combine them in an evidential framework, which models specifically their imprecision and uncertainty. The application we consider in order to illustrate the interest of our Multiple Classifier System is pedestrian detection in high-density crowds, which is ideally suited for its difficulty, cost of labeling and intrinsic imprecision of annotation data. We show that the fusion resulting from the effective modeling of uncertainty allows for performance improvement, and at the same time, for a deeper interpretation of the result in terms of commitment of the decision.",10.3390/s19214664

J,"Vidya, C; Sheeja, J; Sekar, M",TOWARDS REDUCING COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT IN VORTEX INDUCED VIBRATION PREDICTIONS OF A CYLINDRICAL RISER,"Vibrations induced by flow, generally referred to as vortex induced vibrations, are of great importance in the design of marine risers. These flexible cylindrical risers undergo vibrations of very high amplitude when the vortex shedding frequency matches the natural frequency of the riser. Such vibrations are capable of putting the safety of crew working on offshore platforms in question. Hence the prediction of response of such structures is considered very important. Although a lot of numerical work has been done in this field treating the problem as a two-way fluid structure interaction, the fact that these works demand very high computational efforts has not made it pertinent where high end computing resources are not readily available. A quick prediction of the structural response of such slender structures needs to be handy to the engineers at times of need. This paper addresses a solution technique for such a problem through an economical method for quick and reliable prediction of riser response under vortex induced vibration utilizing minimum computational effort for moderate Reynolds number (Re <= 3 x 10(5)). Two dimensional flow simulations are carried out using RANSE based CFD followed by the uniform mapping of hydrodynamic forces on to the three dimensional riser. The grid used for the numerical simulation has been well validated against wind-tunnel experimental results for Re= 5.3 x 10(4). Hydrodynamic forces corresponding to the first three harmonics of natural frequency of the riser have been used as input solver to analyse the response using finite element method. Trajectories of the cylinder in the first three modes of vibration have been obtained, a typical eight figure pattern which is characteristic for lock-in vibration. It is found that the method is quite effective in the quick computation of flow induced vibration problems for low and moderate Reynolds numbers.",
J,"Volchikhin, V; Ivanov, A; Gazin, A",POSSIBILITY TO INCREASE THE CHI-SQUARE TEST POWER ON SMALL SAMPLES BY MEANS OF TRANSITION TOWARDS ANALYZING OF IT'S DISCRETE SPECTRUM,"The purpose of the work is to increase the chi-square test power by analyzing the spectrum of output states of this test discrete form. The refusal from a hypothesis of a spectrum continuity of a chi-square molecule output states allows you to observe 22 spectral lines of different probability amplitudes on a sample of 11 experiments. It is proposed to obtain a mode of support for the quantum superposition of the output states of the chi-square molecule through the random selection of 11 experiments from the general population of 21 experiments. This makes it possible to obtain about 200,000 different states of the molecule, which is quite sufficient to estimate the 8-level states of the probability amplitude of 22 output spectral lines. In the case of the histogram with 6 intervals, the hypothesis of a continuous spectrum of the chi-square test for a sample of 11 experiments does not allow us to distinguish between normal and uniform laws of data distribution with a confidence probability acceptable for practice. The situation changes dramatically if the spectrum discrete nature of the chi-square molecule states is taken into account. It is possible to obtain significantly different digital portraits of the normal and uniform data distribution. Their differences are about 40 bits as per the Hamming distance. The chi-square molecule can be interpreted as a certain square neuron with a Gammerstein structure. Simulation of Schrodinger equations on an ordinary computer has exponential computational complexity in relation to the number of electrons (degrees of freedom or experiments). For this reason, the reproduction of quantum computations on 22 qubits and more within the framework of quantum mechanics on an ordinary computer is technically difficult to perform. A completely different situation arises with the support of quantum superposition of the chi-square molecule. The support of quantum superposition of the chi-square molecule has linear computational complexity. As a consequence, it is possible to implement 22-qubit, 222-qubit, 2222-qubits, and higher quantum computations on an ordinary computer.",

The supramolecular solvent was prepared with hexanol as extraction solvent and tetrahydrofuran as dispersing agent for dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction of blood samples. The main parameters such as the composition and amount of supramolecular solvent and vortex time were systemically investigated by both single factor and orthogonal experiments in combination with statistical analyses.

J,"Wang, SY; Li, HY; Bowen, P",Investigation on Fatigue Threshold Testing Methods in a Near Lamellar TiAl Alloy,"The effects of influential fatigue testing factors, including loading schemes (e.g., traditional load shedding and staircase load increasing), morphology of crack starters, and precracking approaches on the near-threshold fatigue crack growth behaviors for a near lamellar gamma-TiAl alloy (Ti-45Al-2Mn-2Nb-1B) were investigated at room temperature and 650 degrees C. The results showed that the measured fatigue threshold values in lamellar gamma-TiAl alloys are very sensitive to the applied testing procedures. For example, the staircase load-increasing method yielded smaller threshold values. When such a load-increasing method was used, the threshold values were measured either from a notch machined by electro-discharge machining or prepared by a compression-compression fatigue loading. Moreover, some differences could be seen with respect to the morphologies of the crack starters. Most of the above influences are associated with the brittle nature of the material and the characteristics of the lamellar microstructures, and closure effects are primarily induced by crack wake roughness or unbroken ligaments.",10.3390/ma12213487
J,"Wei, C; Yang, WD; Cai, YM",Secure Transmission for Buffer-Aided Relay Networks in the Internet of Things,"This paper investigates the secure transmission for buffer-aided relay networks in the Internet of Things (IoT) in the presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers. For security enhancement, we adopt the max-link relay selection policy and propose three secure transmission schemes: (1) non-jamming (NJ); (2) source cooperative jamming (SCJ); and (3) source cooperative jamming with optimal power allocation (SCJ-OPA). Moreover, to analyze the secrecy performance comprehensively, two eavesdropping scenarios, i.e., non-colluding eavesdroppers (NCE) and colluding eavesdroppers (CE) are considered. Based on this, by modeling the dynamic buffer state transition as a Markov chain, we derive the exact closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability, the average secrecy throughput, and the end-to-end delay for each schemes. The analytical analysis and simulation shows that the SCJ-OPA scheme achieves similar performance as the NJ scheme when the total transmit power is small. On the other hand, when the transmit power is high, the performance achieved by SCJ-OPA is similar to that of SCJ. Thereby, the SCJ-OPA scheme can achieve better performance across the entire total transmit power, which makes up the defects of NJ and SCJ exactly.",10.3390/app9214506

However, in order to achieve pMMO-based continuous methane-to-methanol bioconversion, the problems of reducing power in vitro regeneration and pMMO stability need to be overcome. Methanobactin (Mb) is a small copper-chelating molecule that functions not only as electron carrier for pMMO catalysis and pMMO protector against oxygen radicals, but also as an agent for copper acquisition and uptake. In order to improve the activity and stability of pMMO, methanobactin-Cu (Mb-Cu)-modified gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-pMMO nanobiohybrids were straightforwardly synthesized via in situ reduction of HAuCl4 to AuNPs in a membrane fraction before further association with Mb-Cu. Mb-Cu modification can greatly improve the activity and stability of pMMO in the AuNP-pMMO nanobiohybrids. It is shown that the Mb-Cu-modified AuNP-pMMO nanobiohybrids can persistently catalyze the conversion of methane to methanol with hydroquinone as electron donor.

J,"Xiong, H; Esmail, A; Elsayed-Ali, HE",Size effects on phonon response of bismuth nanoislands to ultrafast laser excitation,"The lattice dynamics of bismuth nanoislands induced by ultrafast laser excitation is studied by ultrafast electron diffraction. The decay times of the Bragg peak intensity depend on the diffraction order. For 5-nm flat nanoislands, the decay time of the (110) diffraction order is close to the A(1g) optical phonon decay time. When the thickness is increased to similar to 16 nm, the excitation energy is dissipated into low energy phonons, making energy transport diffusive, thus leading to a longer decay time. The temporal evolution of the (012) Bragg diffraction peak shows a two exponential decay with a second decay time of similar to 40 ps emerging when the nanoislands are 5 nm thick and the laser fluence is lower than 1.5 mJ/cm(2).

J,"Xu, JW; Fujino, T",Metal Nanoparticles Loaded on Zeolite for Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry of Low-molecular-weight Compounds,"The application of metal nano-particles in laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry has been widely studied. Compared with tradition matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) methods, metal nano-particles have advantages, such as the suppression of fragment peaks, clear background of the mass spectrum, enhanced sensitivity and higher selectivity. Furthermore, some molecules that are difficult to be ionized with traditional MALDI can possibly be ionized by metal nano-particles. However, using metal nano-particles alone always achieves the aggregation of nano-particles, resulting in a low ionization efficiency. To overcome this drawback, our group developed a method involving combined metal nanoparticles with one kind of aluminosilicate, zeolite, which can prevent aggregation and make the ionization process more smooth. In this paper, we will introduce applications using this combination to detect low-molecular-weight compounds with MALDI mass spectrometry.",

There is a need for alternative treatments that can prevent mental and somatic stress manifestations during dental implantation in such patients. We investigated the therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of mesodiencephalic modulation (MDM) in patients with mild type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent dental implantation. This clinical randomized controlled study included 67 patients with mild type 2 diabetes mellitus and a dental pathology comprising a single defect in a dental arch. Group G-1 (n = 22) received dental implants and MDM therapy during the early post-implantation period. Group TG-2 (n = 22) received dental implants and MDM therapy during pre-implantation and early post-implantation periods. Group RG (n = 23) received dental implants without MDM therapy. Patients' blood glucose levels, heart rate, and emotional state in pre-and post-implantation periods were compared. In all groups, blood sugar levels and heart rate peaked at 5 minutes after dental procedure completion. An increase from 5 minutes before starting to 5 minutes after completing the dental procedures was significant in TG-1 and RG groups but not in the TG-2 group. Quality of life was significantly higher in both the treatment groups than in the RG group at 10 days after the procedure. MDM has therapeutic and prophylactic value for patients with mild type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing dental implantation during pre- and post-implantation periods as well as on the quality of life in the early post-surgery recovery period.",

Via applying the centre manifold theorem and bifurcation theorems, the occurrence conditions for flip bifurcation and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation as well as Turing instability are determined. Numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and reveal many interesting dynamic behaviours. The flip bifurcation and the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation both induce routes to chaos, on which we find period-doubling cascades, invariant curves, chaotic attractors, sub-Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, sub-flip bifurcation, chaotic interior crisis, sub-period-doubling cascade, periodic windows, sub-periodic windows, and various periodic behaviours. Moreover, the food chain system exhibits various self-organized patterns, including regular and irregular patterns of stripes, labyrinth, and spiral waves, suggesting the populations can coexist in space as many spatiotemporal structures. These analysis and results provide a new perspective into the complex dynamics of discrete food chain systems.",10.1515/zna-2019-0086

The results showed that the adsorption reaction was rapidly and greatly affected by pH. The experimental data conformed to the Freudlich model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, reflecting nonlinear chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the intra-particle and liquid film diffusion occurred simultaneously during the Th(IV) adsorption on the soils, and adsorption reaction was controlled by cation exchange reactions. According to adsorption thermodynamics in this experiment, the adsorption of Th(IV) on these two soils was found to be a spontaneous and endothermic process.

J,"Zhang, S; Huang, WJ",Application of a Propeller-Based Air Propulsion System to the Land-Based Holonomic Vehicle,"Holonomic vehicles with wheels such as ball wheels can move in any direction without rotating. For such a system, more driving motors and precise transmission mechanisms are necessary, which makes the control and fabrication complicated. This paper aims to present the design and construction of a novel holonomic mechanism to simplify the system. Air-based propulsion was applied to a land-based holonomic vehicle. A prototype with three roller balls was developed with a propeller for the propulsion of a triangular holonomic vehicle. Only two motors were applied, one for propeller rotation and the other for the adjustment of the angle of thrust. For the establishment of the methodology, the data, including propeller size, rotation per minute, velocity, thrust, efficiency, etc., were measured or calculated. The prototype can move at a velocity of approximate 0.558 m/s with an efficiency of 18.55%. Simulation results showed that with the increase of propulsion efficiency, the velocity can achieve more than 5 m/s if the efficiency is 70%. This study is the first attempt to apply air-based propulsion to a land-based holonomic vehicle. Further, the construction method is simple and can satisfy the accuracy requirement. This design method, therefore, will contribute to the application of holonomic vehicles due to the realization of holonomic functionality and simplicity.",10.3390/app9214657

J,"Zhang, ZH; Zhang, JP; Xu, ZG",A D-type adsorption kinetic model for single system based on irreversible thermodynamics,"The adsorption process is a highly efficient and widely applied fundamental technique in the field of Geo-environmental engineering. Most existing adsorption models are empirical or semi-empirical and lack a consistent and unified scientific theoretical basis. In this work, a new adsorption kinetic model with dispersion-type (D-type) has been proposed within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics for investigating the adsorption behavior of a single ionic species onto a solid adsorbent. Based on Ziegler's maximal rate of dissipation, an expression for mass exchange rate was determined after a detailed theoretical deviation by defining the thermodynamic force and thermodynamic flow; and by formulating two dispersion-type free energy functions and a dispersion-type dissipation rate density function. The mass exchange rate expression was introduced into the mass balance equation as further validation of the D-type adsorption kinetic model for a single system. Comparing the adsorption process predicted by the presented model with the tested adsorption processes of Pb2+ and Cd2+ onto beidellite and Pb2+ on bentonite, the results reveal good agreement with experimental data. The D-type adsorption kinetic model could provide a correct description of the kinetics of adsorption process for single ionic species onto solid adsorbent.",10.1007/s10450-019-00154-x

Ni solved in the glass matrix is preferentially combined with solvent Ce to be chemical order in the metastable state contributing to GFA improvement.

This appears to arise from the two undergoing an ene reaction followed by a rearrangement analogous to a ketenimine-nitrile rearrangement. Computational studies indicate that mechanistic steps suggested for the latter require energies too large for the reaction to take place under the experimental conditions. Instead, a mechanism in which the ene reaction product is attacked by a second molecule of 1, followed by hydrogen transfer and decomposition, exhibits barriers lower than that for the ene reaction. The mechanism implies that the fragment of 1 in the observed product is not the one that underwent the ene reaction.

An additional layer with a fluorophore of naphthalene or methylnaphthalene was deposited, and the bilayer was optically pumped. Vapor-deposited naphthalene and methyl-substituted naphthalene molecules on the surface of Al2O3 are amorphously arranged and exhibit a characteristic excimeric fluorescence that is spectrally broad, featureless, and red-shifted relative to the monomer fluorescence. When the bilayer was heated in a temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiment, the ordering in the alkylbenzene substrate caused the overlayer of naphthalenes to crystalize due to heteroepitaxy. Finally, the two layers mixed when the surface temperature was nearly at the desorption temperature and resonance energy transfer was observed from the alkylbenzene to naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes when the alkylbenzene percolated through the naphthalene and methylnaphthalene adlayers.

The complex viscosity and its components - viscosity and elasticity, were determined over the entire range of changes in the circular frequency, including the section of destruction of the initial structure of the polymer system. It was established that almost until the destruction of the initial structure, the constancy of the complex viscosity is maintained, within which its viscous and elastic components change. It is shown that the cause of the destruction of the initial structure of the polymer system (entanglement network) is its transition from a viscoelastic state to a forced elastic one, when the complex viscosity is almost completely determined by its elastic component. When the ultimate strength of the polymer network is reached, the initial structure is destroyed, accompanied by a decrease in the complex viscosity and its elastic component with their subsequent increase.",10.1007/s10692-019-10051-2

A resonant type magnetic field dependence of light absorption at fixed Fermi energy is demonstrated. Besides the ideal case of well-defined Landau levels with small broadening, the effects of resonance degradation due to big broadenings and big fluctuations of Fermi energy along the sample are demonstrated. The maximum values of light absorption coefficients and their resonance positions in magnetic field scale B-max were studied in a wide range of Fermi energies from 0 up to 400 meV at frequency THz of the incident beam. The calculation shows that B-max increases when Fermi energy grows, but there are regions of plateaus resulting in semiladder type of this dependence. The peak values of light absorption manifest a periodic-like dependence on Fermi energy with a huge change in value (in several orders), although the increase in average of maximum value of absorption with Fermi energy is also observed.

The temperature dependence of the degree of the photoinduced linear polarization of the emission of colloidal solutions of carbon nanodots was investigated. Increasing temperature is found to result in the depolarization of nanodot emission. The thermal effect on the polarization degree is well described by the Levshin-Perrin equation, which proves the rotational mechanism of the nanodot emission depolarization. By comparing the experimental data and the theory, the size of the rotating elementary emitters was estimated.

This is crucial to clarify the functioning of a mechanism, which can improve the impurity electroactivity. However, this observation, which is usually performed by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), is limited by some restrictions in the microscopic imaging conditions, such as the microscope resolution, the defocus of the objective lens, the specimen thickness, and the projected orientation of the specimen (i.e. the zone axis). Therefore, to eliminate these restrictions, conventional field-emission-gun HRTEM images in combination with image processing (deconvolution) were investigated in order to obtain structure images with atomic resolution.

J,"Stuart, DW; Mosey, NJ",Pseudodiagonalization-based wavefunction optimization with contracted planewave basis functions,"Electronic structure calculations representing the molecular orbitals (MOs) with contracted planewave basis functions (CPWBFs) have been reported recently. CPWBFs are Fourier-series representations of atom-centered basis functions. The mathematical features of CPWBFs permit the construction of matrix-vector products, FCo, involving the application of the Fock matrix, F, to the set of occupied MOs, C-o, without the explicit evaluation of F. This approach offers a theoretical speed-up of M/n over F-based methods, where M and n are the number of basis functions and occupied MOs, respectively. The present study reports methodological advances that permit FCo-based optimization of wavefunction formed from CPWBFs. In particular, a technique is reported for optimizing wavefunctions by combining pseudodiagonalization techniques based on an exact representation of FCo, approximate information regarding the virtual orbital energies, and direct inversion of the iterative subspace optimization schemes to guide the wavefunction to a converged solution. This method is found to speed-up wavefunction optimizations by factors of up to 6 - 8 over F-based optimization methods while providing identical results. Further, the computational cost of this technique is relatively insensitive to basis set size, thus providing further benefits in calculations using large CPWBF basis sets. The results of density functional theory calculations show that this method permits the use of hybrid exchange-correlation (XC) functionals with a small increase in effort over analogous calculations using generalized gradient approximation XC functionals.

The analysis was carried out isocratically on a C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm x 1.8 mu m particles) utilizing a solvent system of acetonitrile:water:formic acid (55:45:0.1, v/v). The flow rates were set to 0.2 ml min(-1) and 0.3 ml min(-1), at 0.00-4.00 min and 4.01-10.00 min, respectively. 5 mu l of sample was injected into the UHPLC column. A fluorescence detector was adjusted to 220 nm excitation and 340 nm emission wavelengths. The linearity, precision, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), stability and robustness variables were tested for the validation of the developed UHPLC method. A good linearity was achieved in the concentration interval of 2 ng ml(-1)-200 ng ml(-1) for CTV. The intra-day and inter-day assay variability was less than 3% for the CTV.

Our results show a weak interaction of about 25kcalmol(-1) per Hg atom, which is mainly of electrostatic character, followed by orbital and London dispersion-type interactions. This weak interaction can be understood as the formation of host-guest species, for which the inherent electronic and optical properties of the [M@Au-8(PPh3)(8)] cluster along the series do not vary to a large extent. This demonstrates that, in [M@Au8Hgx(PPh3)(8)], each Hg can be considered an inclusion atom rather than a dopant element, where the parent cluster is able to act as a Lewis acid host.

Tangential ordering (TANGO) is found to rely on dispersion forces driven by dipolar fluctuations. Transversal ordering (TRANSO) results from the interplay of two conditions: the broken translational invariance at the cluster interface and the interactions of multipoles of opposite parity. In this case, the orientational order parameter at the interface follows a universal scaling law behavior.

Heavy metal ions were successfully transferred from THF to the aqueous phase by the liquid-liquid extraction method during the pretreatment procedures. Then, enriched Cu2+, Mn2+, and Cr3+ were detected by three kinds of silver nanoparticles (4-MBA-AgNPs, 4-MBA-MA-AgNPs, and 4-NBT/4-MBA-AgNPs) using naked eyes and microplate reader, respectively. The visual detection limits of Cu2+, Mn2+, and Cr3+ were 1.0x10(-6) M, 1.0x10(-7) M, and 1.0x10(-6) M, while the detection limits of Cu2+, Mn2+, and Cr3+ were 2.5x10(-8) M, 5.0x10(-8) M, and 5.0x10(-8) M using microplate reader, respectively.

The fluoro derivative BIFOP-F however, ""switches"" the sense of enantioselectivity, yielding the (R)-enantiomer for 1,3-diphenylallyl acetate and the (S)-enantiomer for the cyclohexenyl acetate (up to 92% yield, 67% ee). Computational analyses of transition structures (M06-2X-D3/def2-TZVP//B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP) for these Pd-catalyzed allylic alkylations reproduce the experimental preference of BIFOP-H (and analogue BIFOP-X ligands) for (R)- or (S)-enantiomeric products of 1,3-diphenylallyl or cyclohexenyl acetate, respectively. The ""F-switch"" of the sense of enantioselectivity from BIFOP-H to BIFOP-F is also apparent computationally and is found (NBO-analyses) to originate from lp(Pd) -> sigma*(P-O) or lp(Pd) -> sigma*(P-F) hyperconjugations. The higher electronegativity of F vs. H in BIFOP-X hence controls the sense of enantioselectivity of this Pd-catalyzed allylic alkylation.",10.1039/c9nj02798j
J,"Durner, B; Ehmann, T; Matysik, FM",High-resolution polymer high performance liquid chromatography: optimization of the saw tooth gradient profile for various stationary phases and separations on preparative scale,"The recently introduced saw tooth gradient protocol for high-resolution polymer HPLC was further improved and optimized in terms of total runtime and separation performance. As a result, increased flow rates enabled drastically reduced runtimes in combination with enhanced peak resolutions. Moreover, the saw tooth gradient profile was further investigated using a saw tooth gradient with a down-to-zero approach concerning the height of the negative backward gradient step. Modifying the mobile phase composition enabled two further gradient protocols: a ternary, and a multicomponent approach, respectively. Thereby, a ternary saw tooth gradient was realized by repeating the whole gradient elution with two adequate pairs of weak or rather non-solvents and desorption promoting solvents for mixtures containing diverse polymer components. A multicomponent saw tooth gradient was established by combining three different solvents in the gradient elution. In addition to mobile phase modifications, various stationary phases were compared and examined. Applying size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns for saw tooth gradient polymer elution chromatography enabled the exploitation of two completely different separation mechanisms (SEC and high-resolution polymer HPLC) on one stationary phase. Thus, two-dimensional, heart-cut coupling of SEC and high-resolution polymer HPLC with only one stationary phase could be achieved. The application of the above-mentioned concept and its highly attractive performance characteristics are demonstrated for a silicone oil with a viscosity of 350 mPa s by using a hybrid HPLC system coupled to a fraction collector.",10.1039/c9ay00689c

Cr0.65Al1.35Se3 was found to crystallize into orthorhombic CrGeTe3-type structure with space group Pnma (no. 62). Vacancies and mixed occupancies were tested, and the results show that one of the 4c sites accommodates a mixture of Cr and Al atoms, while the other 4c site is fully occupied by Al atoms. Unique structural features include a T-shaped channel network created from the edge-sharing Cr/Al@Se-6 and Al@Se-4 polyhedra and a zipper effect of the puckered Se atoms inside the columnar channels. The round peak observed in the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility (chi(g)) plot at similar to 8(1) K corresponds to the antiferromagnetic-type transition in Cr0.65Al1.35Se3. However, the positive theta(CW) indicates an additional ferromagnetic interaction, which is highly likely due to the complex magnetic structure arising from the mixed Cr/Al occupancies on the 4c site.

J,"Martin, RW; Zwanikken, JW",Controlling the structure and mixing properties of anisotropic active particles with the direction of self-propulsion,"In the search for advanced materials active particles could offer unique structural and functional properties, with tunable time-dependent characteristics. We demonstrate here that the direction of self-propulsion, relative to the particle orientation, may be as influential for the phase behavior as the pair interactions are for passive particles, and enable dynamic properties that are not available to passive systems. We perform simulations on ensembles of self-propelled squares, and find that squares that self-propel in the direction perpendicular to a side rapidly reach a steady state with a characteristic cluster distribution, positional order, and well-defined diffusion constant. After tuning the direction towards a corner, the particles form large and dense clusters that show a transient collective motion, and display remarkable fluctuations over long time scales, with a distinct periodicity. Clusters of these particles appear unstable beyond a critical size, and susceptible to a catastrophic disintegration. Directionality is found to effect equally sharp transitions in the mixing properties of active squares and passive squares, and the behavior of the passive ensemble. We relate directionality to the collision dynamics and the resulting reaction network of clusters, evolved by a Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, to correlate propulsion direction to the observed phase behavior. Understanding this behavior could offer new design rules for programmable materials, and grant further insights in the dynamic processes that nature employs for self-assembly.",10.1039/c9sm01120j

The aim of this study is investigating the effectiveness of coated multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with amine agent (NH2CH2-MWCNT) and non-coated MWCNT with ferric chloride in comparison to ferric chloride in the removal of turbidity from the water surface. For the first time, the newest type of coagulant is synthesised with different Fe3+/NH2CH2-MWCNT molar ratios. The effect of the Fe3+/MWCNT molar ratios on the morphology and removal rate of turbidity is consistently investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Three types of experiments are performed from coagulant containing ferric chloride, ferric chloride/MWCNT and ferric chloride/NH2CH2-MWCNT for removal turbidity from the water surface, and all experiments are repeated three times. The optimum pH, ferric chloride doses and NH2CH2-MWCNT are determined experimentally as 8, 30 and 5 mg L-?1, respectively. The turbidity removal efficiency for ferric chloride is obtained 88.41% but the efficiency of the removal percentage for ferric chloride/MWCNT is obtained 56.89, while the turbidity removal for ferric chloride/NH2CH2-MWCNT increases up to 93.46%. For ferric chloride/MWCNT it seems that the ferric chloride is trapping by MWCNT and therefore its performance is reduced. But, for ferric chloride/NH2CH2-MWCNT, the effective interaction between ferric chloride and NH2CH2-MWCNT and increasing in effective surface of the particles cause the efficiency of removing turbidity increases by up to 93.46%, which can be easily understood by the water quality obtained after the test.",10.1080/03067319.2019.1679806

UV excitation of iodide ions produced fully solvated electrons, as well as transient (I, e(-)) and (counterion, e(-)) pairs, the overall concentration of which was monitored by NIR absorption with subpicosecond time resolution. After the UV pulse, the solution absorbance decays almost completely in a few hundreds of picoseconds due to geminate electron-iodine atom recombination and a competitive annihilation channel involving the scavenger. Recombination of transient (I, e(-)) pairs follows the well-known kinetic model, while the electron-nitromethane reaction proceeds by two distinct mechanisms: static scavenging (interpreted in terms of the encounter complex model), with a characteristic time shorter than the temporal resolution of the apparatus, or via a diffusion-limited bimolecular reaction, with a rate constant of 1.1 x 10(11) M-1 s(-1).",10.1039/c9cp03342d

The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical relationships. The results show that there are significant effects of the length on the temperature, the enthalpy and the entropy of structural transition of octahedral nanoparticles, and phase transition temperature and thermodynamic properties decrease with the length decreasing.
