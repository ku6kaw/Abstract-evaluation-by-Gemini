The reactions with fumaric and maleic acids (A and B) gave a new dinuclear carboxylato-containing niobocene derivative [(NbCp'(2))(2)(mu-kappa O-2,O-OOC-CH2-CH2-COO-kappa O-2,O)] (2), due to the occurrence of two processes, dihydrogen elimination and hydrogenation of the C=C bond of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Likewise, the use of an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid derivative such as mono-methyl fumarate (ester) (C) gave the mononuclear [NbCp'(2)(OOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe-kappa O-2,O)] (3). When other alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acids with less activated alkenes were used, such as trans-cinnamic acid (F), (E)-2-methyl-3-phenylacrylic acid (G), cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid (H), 3-methylbut-2-enoic acid (I), (E)-2-methylbut-2-enoic acid (J) or (E)-pent-2-enoic acid (K), only the complexes [NbCp'(2)(OOCR-kappa O-2,O)], (R = trans-CH = CHPh (4), trans-CMe = CHPh (5), 1-cyclohexenyl (6), (CH = CMe2) (7), (cis-CMe = CHMe) (8), (trans-C(H) = CH-Et) (9)), were isolated, respectively, resulting from a process with dihydrogen elimination and the hydrogenation of the C=C bond do not takes place. Treatment of 2-9 with CO (3 atm) promote that the coordination mode of the carboxylate ligand changes from (kappa O-2,O-OOC-R) to (kappa O-1-OOC-R) and yielding new carbonyl derivatives [(NbCp'(2))(2)(mu-kappa O-1-OOC-CH2-CH2-COO-kappa O-1) (CO)(2)] (10); and [NbCp'(2)(OOCR-kappa O-1) (CO)] (R = CH2-CH2-COOMe (11), trans-CH = CHPh (12), trans-CMe = CHPh (13), 1-cyclohexenyl (14), CH = CMe2 (15), cis-CMe = CHMe (16) and R = trans-CH] CH-Et) (17)). Reaction of 2 with O-2 afford a new diperoxo compound [{NbCp'(2)(O-2-kappa O-2,O)}(2) (mu - kappa O-1-OOC-CH2-CH2-COO-kappa O-1)] (19), through a monoperoxo derivative [NbCp'(2)(O-2-kappa O-2,O) (mu-kappa O-1-OOC-CH2-CH2-COO-kappa O-2,O) NbCp'(2)] (18). All the new complexes were characterized by usual IR and NMR spectroscopic methods and the crystal structure of 16 and 18 were determined by X-ray diffraction studies. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Araiza-Villanueva, MG; Olicón-Hernández, DR; Pardo, JP; Vázquez-Meza, H; Guerra-Sánchez, G",Monitoring of the enzymatic activity of intracellular lipases of <i>Ustilago maydis</i> expressed during the growth under nitrogen limitation and its correlation in lipolytic reactions,"Under nitrogen starvation, Ustilago maydis forms lipid droplets (LDs). Although the dynamics of these organelles are known in the literature, the identity of the lipases implicated in their degradation is unknown. We determined lipase activity and identified the intracellular lipases expressed during growth under nitrogen starvation and YPD media by zymograms. The results showed that cytosolic extracts exhibited higher lipase activity when cells were grown in YPD. Under nitrogen starvation, lipase activity was not detected after 24 h of culture, resulting in lipid accumulation in LDs. This suggests that these lipases could be implicated in LD degradation. In the zymogram, two bands, one of 25 and the other of 37 kDa, presented lipase activity. The YPD extracts showed lipase activity in olive and almond oils, which contain triacylglycerols with mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids. This is the first report about U. maydis cytosolic lipases involved in LD degradation.",10.3989/gya.1049182

In a hardware-based neural network, unwanted forward current can flow through gated Schottky diode-type synaptic devices during integration operations, possibly causing a malfunction of the neural network and increasing the power consumption. By adopting a field-plate structure, a virtual pn junction to suppress the forward current of the Schottky diode is formed in the poly-Si active layer. As a result, the unwanted forward current of the gated Schottky diode is successfully reduced to less than 1 pA/mu m.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17003

J,"Beiginejad, H; Nematollahi, D","Electrochemical oxidation of 2,5-diethoxy 4-morpholinoaniline in the presence of thiobarbituric acid: present an <i>ECCCEC</i> Mechanism","The electrochemical oxidation of 2,5-diethoxy-4-morpholinoaniline has been studied in the presence of thiobarbituric acid by the use of experimental and calculation methods. Cyclic voltammetry, controlled-potential coulometry and density functional theory (DFT) were used in this study. By the use of the cyclic voltammetry, the best condition of synthesis was obtained, and controlled-potential coulometry was performed under this condition. The results indicated that the produced p-benzoquinonediimine is unstable, and it was hydrolyzed in the experimental condition. It was found that the produced p-quinoneimine from oxidation/hydrolysis of 2,5-diethoxy-4-morpholinoaniline reacts with the thiobarbituric acid as a nucleophile and via an ECCCEC mechanism converts to the product. Also, computational calculations were used to analyze oxidation peaks in voltammetry.

Obtained by a Breeding Program","Featured Application This work could be used as operational scheme to work on the characterization of a medicinal plant, taking into account its characteristic variability. AbstractJatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceaefamily) is a multipurpose plant with considerable potential in biodiesel production, and in cosmetic and medicinal uses. The part of J. curcas usually used is the oil obtained from its seeds, whereas the leaves generally represent the waste material. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition and to preliminary investigate the biological activity of J. curcas leaves obtained from plants by a breeding program. To describe genomic structure, molecular markers were applied. For biological study, two genotypes (JA and JB) that are genetically divergent were selected by cluster analysis. A phytochemical analysis was carried out to characterize the chemical composition of the extracts, which resulted rich in biologically active compounds, whereas toxic phorbol esters were absent. Biological assays showed an antiproliferative effect on the Buffalo normal rat liver cell line (BRL-3A), with genotype B being more potent than that of the counterpart (JA). The purified compounds isolated did not show antiproliferative activity, suggesting that the effect observed was due to the phytocomplex and should involve several secondary metabolites. This study highlights that a plant of the same genus and same species that has been cultivated in the same soil and climatic conditions can be characterized by a high variability. This is what makes research in pharmacognosya complex process.",10.3390/app9204373

In this work, we experimentally study the behavior of AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel when bombarded by Ga+ ions in a FIB system. The results show the formation of nanometer sized spiky structures. Utilizing the nanospiking effect, we fabricated a single-tip needle with a measured 15.15 nanometer curvature radius and a microneedle with a nanometer sized spiky surface. The nanospikes can be made straight or angled, depending on the incident angle between the sample and the beam. We also show that the nanospiking effect is present in ferritic AISI 430 stainless steel. The weak occurrence of the nanospiking effect in between nano-rough regions (nano-cliffs) was also witnessed for austenitic AISI 316 and martensitic AISI 431 stainless steel samples.",10.3390/nano9101492
J,"Cha, TM; Jo, HC; Kwon, HS; Choi, WY",Active Region Formation of Nanoelectromechanical (NEM) Devices for Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor-NEM Co-Integration,"Considering the isotropic release process for nanoelectromechanical (NEM) devices, defining the specific sacrificial layer of the inter-metal-dielectric (IMD), i.e., the active region only for NEM devices, is one of the most important issue for complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor-NEM (CMOS-NEM) co-integrated circuits. In this paper, novel fabrication method to define the active region of NEM devices is proposed by forming the trenched mesa-shape pattern in the IMD and depositing aluminum oxide (Al2O3) protecting layer. By applying the proposed process, the void space for mechanical operation of NEM devices can be formed user-controllably without the damage and collapse of CMOS part located below the NEM part. The feasibility of the proposed process is verified by fabricating and measuring the proof-of-concept prototype consists of the aluminum (Al) interconnects, silicon dioxide (SiO2) IMD and NEM memory switches.",10.1166/jnn.2019.16988
J,"Chakrabarty, PP; Singh, P; Sen, K; Saha, S; Schollmeyer, D",An azido adduct of Schiff base manganese(III) phenoxo-bridged dimer in dual action: Sensing of benzene and phenoxazinone synthase activity,"A binuclear phenoxo-bridged azido adduct of manganese(III) Schiff base complex has been synthesized. Structure analysis reveals that two units of the tetradentate Schiff base forms the equatorial plane around manganese(III) center in this complex. One of the axial positions is occupied by a terminal azide, while the remaining axial position of the octahedron is connected to a phenoxo group of the neighboring monomeric unit which forms the bridge in the dimer. The benzene rings attached to the two adjacent Mn atoms through O are slightly opened up at their rear ends. The distance between the benzene rings facing each other gradually increase outward. This opens up the possibility of interaction with guest molecules which thereby results in sensing of the analyte molecules. The synthesized binuclear complex was evidently found to have dual actions in sensing and catalysis. Interesting spectral features of the compound allow it to act as a sensor towards an aromatic hydrocarbon, benzene down to similar to 0.06 mM (4.37 ppm) concentration range. A promising catalytic phenoxazinone synthase activity was also observed in the same compound due to the oxidation of o-aminophenol (OAPH). The Michaelis binding constant (K-M), maximum velocity (V-max) and turnover number (k(cat)) were found to be (1.09 +/- 0.3)x10(-2) M, 5.77x10(-8) M s(-1) and 20.77 h(-1), respectively. The rate determining step is governed by formation of substrate-catalyst adduct of OAPH with complex 1 followed by free radical mechanism. The structural and electronic parameters of complex 1 were justified by density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) computations.",
J,"Chalanchi, SM; Ebrahimi, A; Nowroozi, A","Complexes of damirone A/C, batzelline A/D, makaluvamine O and makaluvone with guanidinium and magnesium cations: a theoretical study","Among physiologically active compounds isolated from marine organisms, the pyrroloquinoline alkaloids (PQAs) family consisting of damirone A/C, batzelline A/D, makaluvamine O and makaluvone exhibit numerous biological activities derived from the inimitable highly-fused structures. Their structural and electronic properties were investigated through intramolecular interactions, electron affinities (EA), reduction potentials (E degrees) and complexation of compounds with magnesium and guanidinium cations (ionic and hydrogen bond interactions) using quantum mechanical calculations in the gas phase and solution. For both series of complexes, the most and least stable ones correspond to damirone A and batzelline D, respectively. The energy data, geometrical parameters, and the minima of electrostatic potentials (Vmin) are in good correlation with the results of population analyses. The localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analyses (LMO-EDA) demonstrate that the electrostatic interaction is the most important stabilizing component. The EA values are positive in the gas phase and solution, and are evaluated with the increase in the dielectric constant of solvent. Increase in the EA values and decrease in the E degrees values are observed after complexation with guanidinium and magnesium cations. Those changes are higher for electron-rich compounds compared to electron-deficient ones, containing halogen substituents.",10.1007/s11224-019-01325-w
J,"Chang, HW; Xu, YB; Lv, LS; Liu, HL; Wang, QF; Huan, XR",Computational study on C1-versus C3-regioselectivity in Pd(II)-catalyzed olefination/dearomatization of 2-naphthyl ureas,"The regioselectivity in Pd(II)-catalyzed C-H direct functionalization of C2-substituted naphthalenes has been a long-term issue in synthetic organic chemistry due to its existence of competitive reaction sites, including C1-, C3- and even C4-sites. Our recent achievement in Pd(II)-catalyzed C1-dearomatization of 2-naphthyl ureas encouraged us to find out the key factors for determining the C1- and C3- regioselectivity of 2-naphthyl ureas based on density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we identified a plausible reaction pathway, which led to the experimental C1-functionalized product with a reasonable energy profile. A homologous pathway giving C3-spirocycle was also calculated to investigate the nature of C1-regioselectivity in this reaction. According to the calculated results, we found that in our reaction C-H cleavage was the regioselectivity-determining step, and that C1 was the kinetically favorable site in this step due to electronic effect which makes C1 a more vulnerable site to electrophiles compared to C3, as reflected by the condensed Fukui function and its larger proportion of the highest occupied molecular orbital. Energy decomposition analyses and electronic structure analyses were further performed, which were in good accordance with our conclusion yet indicated C1 was a more sterically hindered site. This result provided us with the inspiration that steric hindrance may play an important role in frequently reported transition metal-catalyzed C3-arylation in the literature. We then selected a recently reported reaction Pd-catalyzed C3-arylation of 2-naphthyl aniline to study the regioselectivity. The result was in line with our assumption that in C3-arylation of 2-naphthyl aniline the preferential functionalization of C3-site is due to its less steric hindrance than C1-site. This work is thus instructive for understanding the regioselectivity in Pd(II)-catalyzed C-H direct functionalization of C2-substituted naphthalenes.",10.1016/j.mcat.2019.110540

Low driving current is the weakness of TFET in terms of switching speed, however it can gain advantage fully from reducing MOL capacitance owing to negligible impact of MOL resistance degradation.

In this study, the concentrations of five cerebral metabolites, namely N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), taurine (Tau) and glutathione (GSH) in two brain regions (i.e., striatum and medial prefrontal cortex) of 12-months old mice were measured by in vivo H-1-MRS using water signal as the internal standard. The detection results were then compared with those obtained by liquid. state H-1-NMR and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The results demonstrated that the NAA, Glu and Tau concentrations measured by the three techniques had no statistically significant differences among each other, suggesting that the results of in vivo H-1-MRS analyses were at least as reliably and accurate as those obtained by H-1-NMR and UHPLC-MS/MS. The absolute concentrations of Gln and GSH measured by UHPLC-MS/MS were significantly higher or lower, relative to those measured with magnetic resonance techniques. Such discrepancies might have originated from the systematic errors presented in the UHPLC-MS/MS measurements of Gln and GSH.

The proposed 1T-DRAM is made up of a silicon germanium storage region surrounding a silicon fin. When the two materials form a heterojunction, a potential well is formed by the band discontinuity which carriers can be stored. During the program operation, band-to-band tunneling and gate-induced drain leakage occur simultaneously due to the gate and drain bias. Because of these phenomena, the electron-hole pair occurs, and generated holes are stored in the storage region by potential well. The holes formed are positively charged within the storage region, which mitigates the depletion of the channel and improves the operating current. The proposed device realizes the memory operation by the difference of the operating current depending on the presence or absence of the stored holes.

J,"Cruz, R; Pineda, L",Promoting Optimal User Experience through Composite Challenge Tasks,"Optimal user experience or flow is a theory with great impact on user experience. Promoting flow has become a competitive advantage for interactive systems, including rehabilitation. This can be achieved through an engaging interface that provides a rewarding experience and motivates the user to use the system again. This theory sustains that promoting a state of flow and improving task performance depends heavily on the balance between the challenges posed by the system and the skills deployed by the user. We further claim that balanced mental and motor skills demanded by the task improve flow and task performance. This paper presents an experiment supporting these claims. For this, we built two movement-interaction rehabilitation systems called SIBMER and Macoli (arm in Nahuatl). Both systems have two versions, one with a balanced load of mental and motor skills, and the other with an unbalanced one. Both versions are compared in terms of their potential to promote the state of flow and to improve task performance. Results show that a balance demand of mental and motor skills promotes flow, independently of the task complexity.

Other mechanisms besides segmental aneuploidy and epigenetic changes may also cause this difference. Among the factors influencing the expression of members of the GABA(A) gene cluster, the imprinting effect and copy number differences has been debated. Limited numbers of studies investigate factors influencing the interaction of GABA(A) cluster homologues. Five isodicentric (15) patients are reported with heterogeneous symptoms, and structural differences of their isodicentric chromosomes based on array comparative genomic hybridization results. Relations between the structure and the heterogeneous clinical picture are discussed, raising the possibility that the structure of the isodicentric (15), which has an asymmetric breakpoint and consequently a lower copy number segment, would be the basis of the imbalance of the GABA(A) homologues. Studies of trans interaction and regulation of GABA(A) cluster homologues are needed to resolve this issue, considering copy number differences within the isodicentric chromosome 15.",10.3390/ijms20194935

These materials were evaluated towards the ethanol electrooxidation in acidic electrolyte in presence of three ethanol concentrations using cyclic voltammetry, while the species produced during the reaction were monitored by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results show that IrRh binary electrocatalysts are selective to the production of CO2 from ethanol, but the catalytic activity is poor. This finding is interpreted in terms of a slow adsorption of ethanol that is assumed to be the rate determining step during the electrooxidation of the alcohol. Ternary catalysts, in turn, present higher electrooxidation currents and anticipate the production of CO2. However, the selectivity towards the CO2 pathway is lost and the higher catalityc activity is justified by a growing production of acetic acid, illustrating the influence of Sn on the eletrooxidation of ethanol.",10.21577/0103-5053.20190072

Exploring magnetic sensitive materials which are easily obtainable and of low cost thereby become of great significance. Carbon film with crystallized features was recently reported with room-temperature ferro-magnetism and magnetoresistance, owing to its spin-orbital interactions at the graphene edges and temperature-depending carrier transport properties. Such phenomena indicate that the film can serve as a novel magnetic sensitive material. In this study, carbon films with vertically aligned nano-crystallites were obtained by a plasma-assisted physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. Basic test circuits were built on the films, and the sensing properties were investigated in external magnetic fields with different intensities and relative angles to the films surface. The results showed that the carbon-based sensing devices were capable to work in the temperature region of 250-400 K. The minimum field intensity and angle change to which the device can respond were 1 mT and 2 degrees. By substrate-introduced enhancement, the maximum changing-rate of the film resistance could reach to 1100%/T.

In this work, we analyzed the interactions of transition metal (TM) hydrides CpM(PMe3)(L)(2)H (M=Cr, Mo, W; L=PMe3, CO) with poor, moderate, and strong proton donors HX (NH3, H2O, and HF), and focus on the DHBs in these complexes. All important factors that can affect the DHBs have been considered: transition metal, proton donor, and substituent group. Electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis, topological (atoms in molecules) analysis and noncovalent interactions index (NCI) analysis of the electron density, energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and the effect of electric field were applied to better understand the nature of the DHBs (MH delta-center dot center dot center dot H delta+X) in CpM(PMe3)(L)(2)H center dot center dot center dot HX (M=Cr, Mo, W; L=PMe3, CO; X=F, OH, NH2). The calculated results showed that both the MH delta-center dot center dot center dot H delta+X bonds and M center dot center dot center dot H delta+X bonds can form in CpM(PMe3)(L)(2)H center dot center dot center dot HX complexes. Electron-rich 5d metal (W in this case) hydrides have a greater chance of forming M center dot center dot center dot H delta+X bonds rather than MH delta-center dot center dot center dot H delta+X bonds. Cr is more likely to form DHBs than Mo and W. This is a very inspiring finding because this may indicate that the first-row transition metal, which shows low cost, low toxicity, and exceptional synthetic versatility, is more suitable for catalytic hydrogenation. The type of proton donor and the substituting of PMe3 by CO can alter the strength of DHBs. The stronger proton donor involves the stronger DHBs form. The substitution of CO decreases the strength of the dihydrogen bond. Both the electrostatic interaction and the orbital interaction play important roles in DHBs, R (H delta-center dot center dot center dot H delta+) = 1.6 angstrom seems to be the boundary between these two kinds of interactions. The addition of electric field is conducive to H-2 formation for strong DHB complexes, while it has no effect on the weak DHB complexes.",10.1007/s11224-019-01313-0

As both OSAS and coronary heart disease (CHD) have same risk factors it's often difficult to quantify the proportion of each risk factor in developing cardiac events. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 10-year risk of developing a coronary heart disease (CHD) event or stroke in newly diagnosed OSAS patients. 65 patients diagnosed with OSAS over a period of four months in Oradea Sleep Laboratory were included. Demographic characteristics, anthropometric parameters, clinical and biochemical data, sleep disorder and daytime sleepiness assessment, results of polysomnography were collected in all patients. In 55 selected patients by age range from 34 to 74 years old, cardiovascular risk was assessed using Framingham score calculator. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-PC version 7.5 and Stata 10. The estimated 10-years risk of a CHD event was 18.97% (+/- 9.67) in all cases. It was higher in men (22.17% +/- 9.24) compare to women (12.39% +/- 6.92) and it was not significantly different by stages of OSAS severity (20.58% +/- 9.41 in patients with severe OSAS versus 15.4% in mild OSAS), suggesting that apnea hypopnea index is not a major confounding factor. Desaturation of oxygen is a better outcome to define the relation between OSAS and cardiovascular diseases.

Among various antibiotics, fluoroquinolones are of extreme interest, since they are broad-spectrum antibacterials with agrowing demand in hospitals, households, and veterinary applications. Wastewater discharge from conventional wastewater treatment plants isthe main source of fluoroquinolone in the aquatic environment. Removal of fluoroquinolone residue from aquatic environment is, therefore, considered as a priority and serves as an important study. For the degradation of FQs in aqueous solution, interesting remedy processes are required such as oxidation-degradation process in which formed intermediates mineralized into CO2, water, and mineral species. The electron transfer reactions and their mechanisms are of much importance in understanding various types of biochemical, pharmaceutical and industrial reactions.

Tantalum coatings have been deposited via atmospheric plasama spraying (APS) and vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) methods, and then their morphologies, porosities, bonding strengths and elastic modulous were investigated. In vitro cytocompatibility of the two coatings was evaluated via human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs). The results show that oxidation phenomenon was observed for the APS tantalum coatings, while less oxidation was found in the VPS tantalum coatings. Compared with APS tantalum coatings, the VPS tantalum coatings have a more compact microstructure and less impurity content, resulting in a better bonding with the titanium substrate. VPS tantalum coatings were measured to have a lower elastic modulus and a higher hardness than APS Tantalum coatings. Electrochemical corrosion of the coatings were examined and the VPS tantalum coating showed improved chemical stability. Besides, bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) adhere to and spread well on the surface of both VPS and APS tantalum coatings without significant difference. The proliferation rate of BMSCs is higher on VPS tantalum coating surface than on APS tantalum coatings.

Mechanical properties including the hardness and elastic modulus were explored by a nano-indentation tester. On increasing the nitrogen flow ratio, the N and O contents in films increased linearly and tended to become saturated, whereas the Cr and B contents decreased. With an increasing nitrogen flow ratio, the microstructure changed from a dense columnar structure to a bulky columnar structure, and then to a fine and stacked dense structure. Meanwhile, the deposition rate also changed with increasing nitrogen flow ratio, owing to the changes in structure. Crystalline phases were observed by the XRD and HRTEM analyses, consisting of several nanometer-size crystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix.

The additional effects of surrounding water molecules were approximated by employing the polarized continuum solvation model (PCM) within a self-consistent reaction field treatment. The calculations indicate that the global minimum resulting from the interaction of PF5 and one H2O molecule corresponds to the PF5-H2O adduct and remains the most stable isomer after addition of second and third H2O, whereas the presence of fourth H2O molecule renders the PF5OH-/H3O+/2H(2)O structure the most stable.

The lowest energy isomers resulting from the interaction of PCl5 with two, three, and four H2O molecules indicate the tendency of PCl3=O to subsequent replacement of the Cl ligands with OH groups resulting in formation of H3PO4 (with five surrounding HCl fragments) when the number of available H2O molecules is sufficient.

The complexes [M-2(mu-ox)(2)(9Meade)(3)](n) [M(II) = Zn (1), Cu (2); where ox = oxalato and 9Meade = 9-methyladenine] are composed of infinite corrugated one-dimensional chains in which two types of metal(11) centres are sequentially bridged by asymmetric bis-bidentate oxalato ligands and their coordination polyhedra are filled by N7-coordinated 9-methyladenine molecules giving rise to two different chromophores: an octahedral N2O4 donor set with the nucleobase moieties in trans-arrangement, and square based pyramidal NO4 coordination polyhedra. The cohesiveness of their supramolecular 3D architectures is achieved by means of an extensive network of non-covalent interactions including a short contact between the minor groove N3 site of the model 9-methyladenine and the oxalato bridging ligand from a neighbouring chain. This unconventional interaction between the lone pair of the pyrimidinic nitrogen atom of the nucleobase and the pi-system of the oxalate anion has been analysed and discussed in the light of available structural data for analogous systems. The compounds {[M(mu-ox)(H2O)(3Meade)]center dot H2O)}(n) [M(II) = Zn (3), Co (4) and Mn (5); where 3Meade = 3-methyladenine], and {[Cu(mu-ox) (3Meade)(2)]center dot 4H(2)O}(n) (6) are comprised of zig-zag metal-oxalato chains, with the oxalato adopting a symmetric bis-bidentate coordination mode. The octahedral environment of the metals is completed in a cis-arrangement by one water molecule and the imidazole N7 donor site of a 3-methyladenine ligand for 3-5, and by two N7-coordinated nucleobases for 6. The crystal packing of the chains leads to the presence of channels with dimensions of 5 x 10 angstrom for 6, and 4 x 6 angstrom for 3-5 which are occupied by crystallization water molecules. The non-covalent interactions of the nucleobases among them and with the metal-oxalato framework have been studied in detail as well as the magnetic interactions mediated by the bridging oxalato ligand.

J,"Genz, NS; Ressler, T",Influence of Calcination Conditions on Structural and Solid-State Kinetic Properties of Iron Oxidic Species Supported on SBA-15,"Iron oxidic species supported on silica SBA-15 were synthesized with various iron loadings using two different Fe-III precursors. The effect of varying powder layer thickness during calcination on structural and solid-state kinetic properties of FexOy/SBA-15 samples was investigated. Calcination was conducted in thin (0.3 cm) or thick (1.3 cm) powder layer. Structural characterization of resulting FexOy/SBA-15 samples was performed by nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, and DR-UV/Vis spectroscopy. Thick powder layer during calcination induced an increased species size independent of the precursor. However, a significantly more pronounced influence of calcination mode on species size was observed for the Fe-III nitrate precursor compared to the Fe-III citrate precursor. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments revealed distinct differences in reducibility and reduction mechanism dependent on calcination mode. Thick layer calcination of the samples obtained from Fe-III nitrate precursor resulted in more pronounced changes in TPR profiles compared to samples obtained from Fe-III citrate precursor. TPR traces were analyzed by model-dependent Coats-Redfern method and model-independent Kissinger method.

Two different tri block co polymers (P-123 and F-127) have been used as delivering system of this poor water soluble drug molecule AP and ANHP which are the main investigation of this work. To find out which one is the better delivering systems of AP and ANHP, spectroscopic studies have been carried out in P-123 and F-127 polymeric media. From the interactions of AP and ANHP with P-123 and F-127 polymers individually, binding constant values have been determined. The drug delivering efficiency of block co polymers has been investigated by using different spectroscopic techniques like absorbance, fluorescence, DLS and time resolved fluorescence measurements. All these experimental results indicate that P-123 is the better AP and ANHP delivering system than F-127 polymer.

Thanks to technological advances, today's educators and learners have ubiquitous and on-demand access to information. Technology has made it possible for us to communicate and share information effortlessly from anywhere in the world. However, the availability of vast amounts of heterogeneous educational content will not be useful unless we search, retrieve and integrate it, creating interoperable educational environments. The current challenges to integrating educational content arise from its distribution over several repositories.

This flexible architecture facilitates the search for and integration of heterogeneous content through an information retrieval model that involves both case-based reasoning and federated search. Moreover, AIREH is based on an adaptive organization model for distributed planning, thanks to which, it manages open systems flexibly, dynamically, and effectively.

J,"Golovanova, OA; Ghyngazov, SA",Thermodynamic and experimental modeling of the formation of the mineral phase of calcification,"Vascular calcification is the process of calcium salt precipitation in vessel walls. In-depth understanding of the mechanisms of crystallization of calcifications in blood vessels is crucial for developing effective protective therapy. Calcification processes reduce the life span of implanted heart valves. The purpose of this paper is a comprehensive study of calcification processes. We calculated the solubility diagrams of the basic poorly soluble compounds formed in the prototype human plasma, performed laboratory modeling of crystallization of calcification mineral phases under conditions typical of human blood plasma solution (ionic composition, pH), and verified the obtained theoretical and experimental modeling results for adequacy to pathogenic phase formation from human blood plasma solution. The paper presents the results of the thermodynamic calculation of the formation of calcification mineral phases and experimental results of phase formation under conditions typical of the human blood plasma prototype. The laboratory tests showed that dopants of the biological solution (magnesium ions and glutamic acid) affect phase composition and solubility of the samples. The bioactivity of synthetic samples was studied in solutions of different composition and in Verapamil. The results indicate that the model studies of the crystallization of pathogenic formations in the cardiovascular system performed to identify the mechanisms that control their genesis are significant and will provide timely diagnosis of calcification and development of new approaches in cardiology aimed to reduce the incidence of these diseases. Statement of significance: The processes of crystallization of organo-mineral associations (OMA) that are part of the physiogenetic (bone, teeth) and pathogenic minerals (urinary, dental, calcifications etc.) are currently one of the crucial study areas. These studies are of essential interest since pathogenic OMA are primarily considered to be human diseases, for example, arteriosclerosis, which is associated with precipitation of calcium salts in blood vessels. It is the second most common disease after atherosclerosis among all lesions of arterial vessels. It should be noted that the percentage of calcification in blood vessels, heart valves and operating stents has increased in recent years. Vascular calcification is a complex process that involves a number of mechanisms responsible for the precipitation of calcium salts in vessel walls. As a result, arterial stiffness and pulse wave velocity increase, which in turn increases the rate of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. The study and in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of calcification crystallization in blood vessels can be crucial for developing effective protective therapy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that when chloride ion concentration was below 20.0 mM, the Ba alpha-amylase was activated by increasing chloride ion concentration; when chloride ion concentration was over 20.0 mM, the biological activity of Ba alpha-amylase was inhibited by increasing chloride ion concentration. The spectroscopic analyses illustrated that the change in Ba alpha-amylase biological activity was caused by the alteration in secondary structure of Ba alpha-amylase. When chloride ion showed activation effect to Ba alpha-amylase, part of the random coils in Ba alpha-amylase gradually transformed to alpha-helix and beta-sheet with increasing chloride ion concentration and the Ba alpha-amylase transited from relatively disordered conformation to relatively ordered one.

The relationships between the thrust and rotation speed of a screw mixed-flow pump, drag and submerged speed of water-jet propulsion were obtained from flume experiments and numerical calculations, based on which a dynamic model of pump-jet propulsion was established in this paper. As an initial condition, the numerical solution of the submerged speed with respect to time was inputted to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for unsteady calculation based on a user-defined function (UDF). Thus, the relationships between the acceleration, drag, net thrust, propulsion torque and efficiency with respect to time were revealed. The results indicate that the relationship between the thrust and rotational speed of a water-jet propeller is a quadratic function, which agrees well with the experimental values. The variation of submerged speed with respect to time satisfies a hyperbolic tangent function distribution. The acceleration increases sharply at the beginning and then decreases gradually to zero, especially at high rotation speeds of the water-jet pump. The variations in drag and propulsion efficiency with respect to time coincide with the step response of a second-order system with critical damping. The method and results of this study can give a better understanding of the changes in dynamic parameters such as velocity, acceleration, thrust, and drag during the acceleration of a pump-jet submersible and helped to estimate the effects of pump performance on water-jet propulsion kinetic parameters.",10.3390/app9194194

Since there is no hard criterion for an optimal routing, the proposed algorithm minimizes an empirically chosen cost function over a set of parameters. Some of the latter are naturally of discrete type (e.g., interchange of particle/hole lines due to antisymmetry) while others (e.g., x, y-position of nodes) are naturally continuous. In order to arrive at a manageable optimization problem, the position space is artificially discretized. In terms of the (1) cost function, (2) the discrete vertex placement, (3) the interchange of particle/hole lines the routing problem is now well defined and fully discrete. However, it shows an exponential complexity with the number of vertices suggesting to apply a genetic algorithm for its solution. The presented algorithm is capable of routing non-trivial (several loops and crossings) Goldstone diagrams from given topologies. The resulting diagrams are qualitatively fully equivalent to manually routed ones. The proposed algorithm is successfully applied to several coupled cluster approaches and a perturbative (fixpoint iterative) CCSD expansion with repeated diagram substitution.",10.1007/s00214-019-2505-3

A novel PCR buffer named ""DDB buffer"" containing ammonium sulfate and glycerol were used instead of the conventional 10x PCR buffer.

Direct PCR amplification of DNA fragments ranging from 100 to 900 bp using filter paper spotted with 0.5 to 5 mu L of cord blood and various anticoagulants was successful. We were able to determine fetal single-gene disorders and chromosomal diseases in all 46 chromosomes using PCB samples successfully. Compared with prenatal diagnosis using purified DNA, the proposed method is simple, fast, less prone to cross-contamination at minimal cost.

J,"Iiguni, Y; Tamura, R; Kitagawa, S; Ohtani, H",Continuous Separation of Micro-particles by Microchip Electromagnetophoresis Utilizing Aqueous Two-phase Flow,"We report on a novel control technique for the transport of microparticles in a microchannel for microchip analysis using electromagnetophoresis combined with a conductive/nonconductive aqueous two phase (ATP) flow. A double Y-shaped microchip (20 mm length, 160 p.m width) with two inlets and two outlets was used to form a conductive/non-conductive ATP flow. When a 1.16 mol L-1 KCI aqueous solution and a 20 % dextran (Dex) aqueous solution were used as a conductive fluid and a non-conductive fluid, respectively, a conductive/non-conductive ATP flow could be formed in the micro-channel. In this conductive/non-conductive ATP flow, polystyrene (PS) particles with 3, 6 and 10 gm diameters dispersed in the conductive fluid could be focused on the ATP flow interface when electromagnetophoresis was applied on the particles toward the ATP flow interface. On the other hand, carboxylate PS (cPS) particles with 10 gm diameter were transferred into a Dex solution in the same situation. Moreover, by applying staggered-electromagnetophoresis, PS particles were redistributed in the conductive fluid although cPS particles stayed in the non-conductive fluid. Consequently, PS particles and cPS particles could be eluted at different outlets, respectively.",

Much remains to be known about its causes, especially in the Romanian context, where there is a scarcity of analyses on this particular topic. Its predictors are relevant for public policy in order to evaluate what strategy should be adopted given actual levels of salt intake and the way people think about their levels of salt intake. Our analyses focus on actual and perceived salt intake. Data for this analysis come from the SEPHAR project, gathered in 2016 (wave 3), a nationally representative sample of Romanians. After noting a major discrepancy between perceived and actual levels of salt intake, we used two regressions with actual and perceived salt intake as dependent variables and three types of factors as independent variables: socio-demographic (age, gender, region, type of locality, education), lifestyle (fat diet, alcohol consumption, active lifestyle, and smoking) and related diseases (obesity and diabetes). Results show Romanians have similar levels of salt intake perceptions independently of the characteristics considered, except fat diet and diabetes, and similar levels of actual salt intake except age and gender, even though previous research shows that there are differences between individuals across these characteristics when it comes to considering hypertension as a dependent variable. We conclude by noting policy interventions regarding salt intake based on the results of this research, especially the need to update the current Romanian TV campaign to reduce salt intake or similar campaigns from other countries.",

J,"Irvine, NM; Pearson, DL; Leng, RO; Von Wald, G; Dawson, J",Use of Predictive Engineering Systems To Model Manufacturing Processes for Crop Protection Active Ingredient Registration,"A batch study (also called a five-batch analysis) is a requirement for registering a new crop protection active ingredient (AI). A batch study defines the commercial specification of the technical-grade AI, including the minimum assay for the AI, the profile of impurities, and the maximum limit allowed for each impurity. One expectation of the regulatory guidance is that the specification is representative of product produced at commercial scale. However, predicting product purity and the level of impurities is challenging for a new crop protection AI when commercial-scale manufacture may not occur for several years. The registration dossier, which must include the batch study, is submitted often several years before commercial manufacture begins. Recognizing this challenge, many regulatory authorities propose a volume or quantity of material to be produced for the batch study, often referring to ""pilot plant"" samples, under the pretense that a ""larger"" scale will better represent the commercial production facility. We propose that the ability to model accurately the processing conditions and variability anticipated at commercial scale, not sample volume or quantity, is most critical to the predictive quality of the batch study. Herein we discuss the limitation of traditional ""pilot plants"" and introduce the concept of ""predictive engineering systems"" as a more advanced approach for preparing the samples used in the batch study for new crop protection active ingredient registration.",10.1021/acs.oprd.9b00268

Under the kinetic conditions, HCrO4- has been found kinetically active in the absence of phen catalyst while in the phen catalyzed path Cr(VI)-phen complex has been suggested in the active oxidant. In the catalysed path, Cr(VI)-phen complex receives a nucleophilic attack by the substrate to form a ternary complex which subsequently experiences a two-electron transfer redox decomposition leading to Cr(IV)-phen complex. Then Cr(IV)-phen complex participates further in the oxidation of malic acid and ultimately is converted into Cr(III)-phen complex. Both the paths show first-order dependence on [malic acid](T) and [Cr(VI)](T). The phen catalyzed path is first -order in [phen](T). These observations remain unaltered in the presence of externally added surfactants. Effect of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic surfactant N-cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) on the phen-catalysed path has been studied. SDS accelerates the phen-catalysed path and CPC shows the rate retarding effect on the path. The observes micellar effects have been explained by considering the hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction between the surfactants and reactants.",

This study investigates the effect of quercetin (QU), a CYP3A4 inducer, on the pharmacokinetics of LOS in rats. A rapid, sensitive high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) method was developed and validated for the bioanalysis of losartan using olmesartan as internal standard (IS). The salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) employing acetonitrile and MgCl2 gave high recovery of LOS (>90%). HPTLC separation, achieved on silica gel 60 F-254 plates employing toluene-ethyl acetate-acetone-formic acid (4:4:1:0.5 V/V) as the mobile phase, with densitometric analysis at 240 nm, gave good linearity (50-1200 ng mL(-1)) with high intra-day and inter-day precision. LOS in plasma samples was stable when stored under different stability conditions. The pharmacokinetics of LOS was found to be significantly altered when co-administered with QU: C-max = 809.8 +/- 4.1 at 40 min (t(max)) to C-max = 1124.8 +/- 86.6 ng mL(-1) at 120 min (t(max)). This study indicates the chances of herb-drug interaction when LOS is co-administered with QU, leading to its increased bioavailability, potentiating its side effect/toxic manifestation. As QU is abundantly present in herbs and dietary food, patients of LOS therapy need to be cautious while concurrently consuming herbal preparations containing QU.

For this purpose, a flow test and colour evaluation was carried out on white Portland cement paste and mortar mixed with CASB by changing the proportion of RPP.

The conventional bisulfite sequencing faces with the tremendous challenge in the discrimination of DNA methylation. Therefore, the improved and modification bisulfite sequencing has been conducted to raise the reaction selectivity. The key mechanism for these bisulfite sequencing is the reaction of nucleic acids with HSO3- under acidic conditions. The C5C6 bonds of 5-methylcytosine (5-MeCyt) and cytosine (Cyt) have been modified to improve the difference of activation free energies in bisulfite conditions. Because of this, the hydrolytic deamination of DHCytN3(+) (paths A and B) and 5-DHMeCytN3(+) isomers (equatorial and axial conformers, paths C and D) has been explored in the presence of the HSO3- group. The activation free energies (Delta G(s not equal)) of DHCytN3(+) and 5-DHMeCytN3(+) equatorial conformer paths exhibit no obvious difference, which increases difficulties in differentiating cytosine from 5-methylcytosine under bisulfite conditions. Meanwhile, the difference of Delta G(s not equal) between the 5-DHMeCytN3(+) axial conformer and DHCytN3(+) is consistent with the experimental results, where the calculated deamination rate is lower for 5,6-dihydro-5-methylcytosine than for 5,6-dihydrocytosine. And by extrapolation, the differentiating Cyt from 5-MeCyt may have a greater possibility by bisulfite treatment. These results have high expectations for the experimental scientists to explore new methods to avoid the formation of the 5-DHMeCytN3(+) equatorial conformer. Furthermore, the rate constant with Wigner tunneling correction for paths A, C, and D are in good agreement with uncorrected results.",10.1002/poc.3990

J,"Kang, B; Kang, S",Nanometer-Scale Surface Structure and Sterilization Characteristics of Na/Ag Ion-Exchanged Glass for Anti-Biofouling Application,"Most objects and structures exposed to a marine environment for more than a month undergo biofouling of the surface. Biofouling is a phenomenon in which micro-organisms attach to marine structures and may result in deterioration of the structure or breakage of the structure due to weight gain. In this study, glass, which can inhibit biofouling of marine structures, was prepared and its germicidal properties were analyzed. For this purpose, Ag ions were implanted into soda-lime-silicate glass by the ion-exchange method. For the glass immersed in seawater, the bactericidal effect of the glass specimen was than evaluated by inoculating the strain and counting the number of viable cells after 12 or 24 h. Experimental variables were ion exchange conditions, time immersed in seawater, and time spent inoculating the strain. In particular, the surface state of the ion exchange glass before and after immersion in seawater was observed at the nanometer level, and the elution amount of Ag ions with time was measured by the ICP mass analysis method. As the ion exchange time increased, the amount of ion exchange increased. The amount of ions was consistent with Fick's first law, which is proportional to the square root of time. When ion-exchanged specimens were immersed in seawater, the amount of Ag ions eluted was on the order of ppm. Si and Na ions were also eluted from the glass. As the ion exchange time increased, crystals of 60 similar to 80 nm, which are presumed to be Na2CO3 phase, formed densely on the surface of the specimen. However, when the glass specimens were immersed in seawater, crystals formed on the surface dissolved and disappeared. Cracks subsequently formed on the surface and finally the surface collapsed. After 30 days, a fresh glass surface appeared again. This is a very interesting result because it shows that the reaction between glass and seawater is very similar to that between aqueous solutions. When the glass implanted with Ag ions is immersed in seawater, the surface dissolves and the glass-network-structure collapses, resulting in considerable Ag ion elution, which enhances bactericidal action in seawater. For example, when a specimen immersed in seawater for 30 days was inoculated with the strain for 24 hours, the number of strains decreased from 2.1x10(6) cells/ml to 0 cell/ml, indicating 100% disinfection ability. In this study, soda-lime-silicate glass with Ag ion implantation by the Na/Ag ion exchange method showed an excellent germicidal effect when in contact with sea water. From this result, it can be expected that long-term marine biological pollution can be suppressed by applying the glass developed in this research to marine structures.",10.1166/jnn.2019.17041
