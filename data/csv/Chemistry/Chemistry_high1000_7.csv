J,"Li, CW; Kanan, MW",CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction at Low Overpotential on Cu Electrodes Resulting from the Reduction of Thick Cu<sub>2</sub>O Films,"Modified Cu electrodes were prepared by annealing Cu foil in air and electrochemically reducing the resulting Cu2O layers. The CO2 reduction activities of these electrodes exhibited a strong dependence on the initial thickness of the Cu2O layer. Thin Cu2O layers formed by annealing at 130 degrees C resulted in electrodes whose activities were indistinguishable from those of polycrystalline Cu. In contrast, Cu2O layers formed at 500 degrees C that were >= similar to 3 mu m thick resulted in electrodes that exhibited large roughness factors and required 0.5 V less overpotential than polycrystalline Cu to reduce CO2 at a higher rate than H2O. The combination of these features resulted in CO2 reduction geometric current densities > 1 mA/cm(2) at overpotentials < 0.4 V, a higher level of activity than all previously reported metal electrodes evaluated under comparable conditions. Moreover, the activity of the modified electrodes was stable over the course of several hours, whereas a polycrystalline Cu electrode exhibited deactivation within 1 h under identical conditions The electrodes described here may be particularly useful for elucidating the structural properties of Cu that determine the distribution between CO2 and H2O reduction and provide a promising lead for the development of practical catalysts for electrolytic fuel synthesis.",10.1021/ja3010978

In this work, based on the principle of the previously demonstrated triboelectric generator, we demonstrate a new high-output, flexible and transparent nanogenerator by using transparent polymer materials. We have fabricated three types of regular and uniform polymer patterned arrays (line, cube, and pyramid) to improve the efficiency of the nanogenerator. The power generation of the pyramid-featured device far surpassed that exhibited by the unstructured films and gave an output voltage of up to 18 Vat a current density of similar to 0.13 mu A/cm(2). Furthermore, the as-prepared nanogenerator can be applied as a self-powered pressure sensor for sensing a water droplet (8 mg, similar to 3.6 Pa in contact pressure) and a falling feather (20 mg, Pa in contact pressure) with a low-end detection limit of similar to 13 mPa.",10.1021/nl300988z

J,"Tareke, E; Rydberg, P; Karlsson, P; Eriksson, S; Törnqvist, M","Analysis of acrylamide, a carcinogen formed in heated foodstuffs","Reaction products (adducts) of acrylamide with N termini of hemoglobin (Hb) are regularly observed in persons without known exposure. The average Hb adduct level measured in Swedish adults is preliminarily estimated to correspond to a daily intake approaching 100 mug of acrylamide. Because this uptake rate could be associated with a considerable cancer risk, it was considered important to identify its origin. It was hypothesized that acrylamide was formed at elevated temperatures in cooking, which was indicated in earlier studies of rats fed fried animal feed. This paper reports the analysis of acrylamide formed during heating of different human foodstuffs. Acrylamide levels in foodstuffs were analyzed by an improved gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method after bromination of acrylamide and by a new method for measurement of the underivatized acrylamide by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), using the MS/MS mode. For both methods the reproducibility, given as coefficient of variation, was similar to5%, and the recovery close to 100%. For the GC-MS method the achieved detection level of acrylamide was 5 mug/kg and for the LC-MS/MS method, 10 mug/kg. The analytic values obtained with the LC-MS/MS method were 0.99 (0.95-1.04; 95% confidence interval) of the GC-MS values. The LC-MS/MS method is simpler and preferable for most routine analyses. Taken together, the various analytic data should be considered as proof of the identity of acrylamide. Studies with laboratory-heated foods revealed a temperature dependence of acrylamide formation. Moderate levels of acrylamide (5-50 mug/kg) were measured in heated protein-rich foods and higher contents (150-4000 mug/kg) in carbohydrate-rich foods, such as potato, beetroot, and also certain heated commercial potato products and crispbread. Acrylamide could not be detected in unheated control or boiled foods (<5 mug/kg). Consumption habits indicate that the acrylamide levels in the studied heated foods could lead to a daily intake of a few tens of micrograms.",10.1021/jf020302f
J,"Li, Z; Yang, MJ; Park, JS; Wei, SH; Berry, JJ; Zhu, K",Stabilizing Perovskite Structures by Tuning Tolerance Factor: Formation of Formamidinium and Cesium Lead Iodide Solid-State Alloys,"Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is an empirical index for predicting stable crystal structures of perovskite materials. A t value between 0.8 and 1.0 is favorable for cubic perovskite structure, and larger (>1) or smaller (<0.8) values of tolerance factor usually result in nonperovskite structures. CH(NH2)(2)PbI3 (FAPbI(3)) can exist in the perovskite a-phase (black phase) with good photovoltaic properties. However, it has a large tolerance factor and is more stable in the hexagonal delta(H)-phase (yellow phase), with delta(H)-to-alpha phase-transition temperature higher than room temperature. On the other hand, CsPbI3 is stabilized to an orthorhombic structure (delta(o)-phase) at room temperature due to its small tolerance factor. We find that, by alloying FAPbI(3) with CsPbI3, the effective tolerance factor can be tuned, and the stability of the photo active a-phase of the mixed solid-state perovskite alloys FA(1-x)C(sx)bI(3) is enhanced, which is in agreement with our first-principles calculations. Thin films of the FA(0.85)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) perovskite alloy demonstrate much improved stability in a high-humidity environment; this contrasts significantly with the pure FAPbI(3) film for which the alpha-to-delta(H) phase transition (associated with yellowing appearance) is accelerated by humidity environment. Due to phase stabilization, the FA(0.86)Cs(0.15)PbI(3) solid-state alloy showed better solar cell performance and device stability than its FAPbI(3) counterparts. Our studies suggest that tuning the tolerance factor through solidstate alloying can be a general strategy to stabilize the desired perovskite structure for solar cell applications.",10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b04107

J,"Sun, TL; Kurokawa, T; Kuroda, S; Bin Ihsan, A; Akasaki, T; Sato, K; Haque, MA; Nakajima, T; Gong, JP",Physical hydrogels composed of polyampholytes demonstrate high toughness and viscoelasticity,"Hydrogels attract great attention as biomaterials as a result of their soft and wet nature, similar to that of biological tissues. Recent inventions of several tough hydrogels show their potential as structural biomaterials, such as cartilage. Any given application, however, requires a combination of mechanical properties including stiffness, strength, toughness, damping, fatigue resistance and self-healing, along with biocompatibility. This combination is rarely realized. Here, we report that polyampholytes, polymers bearing randomly dispersed cationic and anionic repeat groups, form tough and viscoelastic hydrogels with multiple mechanical properties. The randomness makes ionic bonds of a wide distribution of strength. The strong bonds serve as permanent crosslinks, imparting elasticity, whereas the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. These physical hydrogels of supramolecular structure can be tuned to change multiple mechanical properties over wide ranges by using diverse ionic combinations. This polyampholyte approach is synthetically simple and dramatically increases the choice of tough hydrogels for applications.",10.1038/NMAT3713

J,"Lopes, JNAC; Pádua, AAH",Nanostructural organization in ionic liquids,"Nanometer-scale structuring in room-temperature ionic liquids is observed using molecular simulation. The ionic liquids studied belong to the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium family with hexafluorophosphate or with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide as the anions, [C(n)mim][PF6] or [C(n)mim][(CF3SO2)(2)N], respectively. They were represented, for the first time in a simulation study focusing on long-range structures, by an all-atom force field of the AMBER/OPLS_AA family containing parameters developed specifically for these compounds. For ionic liquids with alkyl side chains longer than or equal to C-4, aggregation of the alkyl chains in nonpolar domains is observed. These domains permeate a tridimensional network of ionic channels formed by anions and by the imidazolium rings of the cations. The nanostructures can be visualized in a conspicuous way simply by color coding the two types of domains (in this work, we chose red = polar and green = nonpolar). As the length of the alkyl chain increases, the nonpolar domains become larger and more connected and cause swelling of the ionic network, in a manner analogous to systems exhibiting microphase separation. The consequences of these nanostructural features on the properties of the ionic liquids are analyzed.",10.1021/jp056006y

Recent studies have proven that the carbon materials doped with the elements, which have the larger (N) or smaller (P, B) electronegative atoms than carbon such as N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs), P-doped graphite layers and B-doped CNTs, have also shown pronounced catalytic activity. Herein, we find that the graphenes doped with the elements, which have the similar electronegativity with carbon such as sulfur and selenium, can also exhibit better catalytic activity than the commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, indicating that these doped graphenes hold great potential far a substitute for Pt-based catalysts in FCs. The experimental results are believed to be significant because they not only give further insight Into the ORR mechanism of these metal-free doped carbon materials, but also open a way to fabricate other new low-cost NPMCs with high electrocatalytic activity by a simple, economical, and scalable approach for real FC applications.",10.1021/nn203393d
J,"Knothe, G",Dependence of biodiesel fuel properties on the structure of fatty acid alkyl esters,"Biodiesel, defined as the mono-alkyl esters of vegetable oils or animal fats, is an ""alternative"" diesel fuel that is becoming accepted in a steadily growing number of countries around the world. Since the source of biodiesel varies with the location and other sources such as recycled oils are continuously gaining interest, it is important to possess data on how the various fatty acid profiles of the different sources can influence biodiesel fuel properties. The properties of the various individual fatty esters that comprise biodiesel determine the overall fuel properties of the biodiesel fuel. In turn, the properties of the various fatty esters are determined by the structural features of the fatty acid and the alcohol moieties that comprise a fatty ester. Structural features that influence the physical and fuel properties of a fatty ester molecule are chain length, degree of unsaturation, and branching of the chain. Important fuel properties of biodiesel that are influenced by the fatty acid profile and, in turn, by the structural features of the various fatty esters are cetane number and ultimately exhaust emissions, heat of combustion, cold flow, oxidative stability, viscosity, and lubricity.

In this study, we report the preparation of vertically grown carbon-doped TiO2 (TiO2-C-x(x)) nanotube arrays with high aspect ratios for maximizing the photocleavage of water under white-light irradiation. The synthesized TiO2-xCx nanotube arrays showed much higher photocurrent densities and more efficient water splitting under visible-light illumination (> 420 nm) than pure TiO2 nanotube arrays.

J,"Masuko, T; Minami, A; Iwasaki, N; Majima, T; Nishimura, SI; Lee, YC",Carbohydrate analysis by a phenol-sulfuric acid method in microplate format,"Among many colorimetric methods for carbohydrate analysis, the phenol-sulfuric acid method is the easiest and most reliable method. It has been used for measuring neutral sugars in oligosaccharides, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. This method is used widely because of its sensitivity and simplicity. In its original form, it required 50-450 nmol of monosaccharides or equivalent for analysis and thus is inadequate for precious samples. A scaled-down version requiring only 10-80 nmol of sugars was reported previously. We have now modified and optimized this method to use 96-well microplates for high throughput, to gain greater sensitivity, and to economize the reagents. This modified and optimized method allows longer linear range (1-150 nmol for Man) and excellent sensitivity. Moreover, our method is more convenient, requiring neither shaking nor covering, and takes less than 15 min to complete. The speed and simplicity of this method would make it most suitable for analyses of large numbers of samples such as chromatographic fractions. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, hydrogels used as synthetic ECMs for three-dimensional (3D) culture are typically elastic. Here, we report a materials approach to tune the rate of stress relaxation of hydrogels for 3D culture, independently of the hydrogel's initial elastic modulus, degradation, and cell-adhesion-ligand density. We find that cell spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are all enhanced in cells cultured in gels with faster relaxation. Strikingly, MSCs form a mineralized, collagen-1-rich matrix similar to bone in rapidly relaxing hydrogels with an initial elastic modulus of 17 kPa. We also show that the effects of stress relaxation are mediated by adhesion-ligand binding, actomyosin contractility and mechanical clustering of adhesion ligands. Our findings highlight stress relaxation as a key characteristic of cell-ECM interactions and as an important design parameter of biomaterials for cell culture.",10.1038/NMAT4489
J,"Sun, SL; He, Q; Xiao, SY; Xu, Q; Li, X; Zhou, L",Gradient-index meta-surfaces as a bridge linking propagating waves and surface waves,"The arbitrary control of electromagnetic waves is a key aim of photonic research. Although, for example, the control of freely propagating waves (PWs; refs 1-6) and surface waves (SWs; refs 7-10) has separately become possible using transformation optics and metamaterials, a bridge linking both propagation types has not yet been found. Such a device has particular relevance given the many schemes of controlling electromagnetic waves at surfaces and interfaces, leading to trapped rainbows(11,12), lensing(13-16), beam bending(17), deflection(18-20), and even anomalous reflection/refraction(21,22). Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that a specific gradient-index meta-surface can convert a PW to a SW with nearly 100% efficiency. Distinct from conventional devices such as prism(23) or grating(24-26) couplers, the momentum mismatch between PW and SW is compensated by the reflection-phase gradient of the meta-surface, and a nearly perfect PW-SW conversion can happen for any incidence angle larger than a critical value. Experiments in the microwave region, including both far-field and near-field characterizations, are in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. Our findings may pave the way for many applications, including high-efficiency surface plasmon couplers, anti-reflection surfaces, light absorbers, and so on.",10.1038/NMAT3292

J,"Öner, D; McCarthy, TJ",Ultrahydrophobic surfaces.: Effects of topography length scales on wettability,"We discuss dynamic hydrophobicity from the perspective of the force required to move a water droplet on a surface and argue that the structure of the three-phase contact line is important. We studied the wettability of a series of silicon surfaces that were prepared by photolithography and hydrophobized using silanization reagents. Hydrocarbon, siloxane, and fluorocarbon surfaces were prepared. The surfaces contain posts of different sizes, shapes, and separations. Surfaces containing square posts with X-Y dimensions of 32 mu m and less exhibited ultrahydrophobic behavior with high advancing and receding water contact angles. Water droplets moved very easily on these surfaces and rolled off of slightly tilted surfaces. Contact angles were independent of the post height from 20 to 140 mu m and independent of surface chemistry. Water droplets were pinned on surfaces containing square posts with larger dimensions. Increasing the distance between posts and changing the shape of the posts from square to staggered rhombus, star, or indented square caused increases in receding contact angles. We ascribe these contact angle increases to decreases in the contact length and increases in tortuosity of the three-phase contact line. The maximum length scale of roughness that imparts ultrahydrophobicity is similar to 32 mu m.",10.1021/la000598o

The best meta-GGA is oTPSS-D3 although meta-GGAs represent in general no clear improvement compared to numerically simpler GGAs. Notably, the widely used B3LYP functional performs worse than the average of all tested hybrids and is also very sensitive to the application of dispersion corrections. We discourage its usage as a standard method without closer inspection of the results, as it still seems to be often done nowadays. Surprisingly, long-range corrected exchange functionals do in general not perform better than the corresponding standard hybrids. However, the omega B97X-D functional seems to be a promising method. The most robust hybrid is Zhao and Truhlar's PW6B95 functional in combination with DFT-D3. If higher accuracy is required, double-hybrids should be applied. The corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and PWPB95-D3 variants are the most accurate and robust functionals of the entire study. Additional calculations with MP2 and and its spin-scaled variants SCS-MP2, S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 revealed that double-hybrids in general outperform those. Only SCS-MP2 can be recommended, particularly for reaction energies. We suggest its usage when a large self-interaction error is expected that prohibits usage of double-hybrids. Perdews' metaphoric picture of Jacob's Ladder for the classification of density functionals' performance could unbiasedly be confirmed with GMTKN30. We also show that there is no statistical correlation between a functional's accuracy for atomization energies and the performance for chemically more relevant reaction energies.",10.1039/c0cp02984j

ESI-MS2 data were analyzed under nonstandardized, independent experimental conditions. MassBank is a distributed database. Each research group provides data from its own MassBank data servers distributed on the Internet. MassBank users can access either all of the MassBank data or a subset of the data by specifying one or more experimental conditions. In a spectral search to retrieve mass spectra similar to a query mass spectrum, the similarity score is calculated by a weighted cosine correlation in which weighting exponents on peak intensity and the mass-to-charge ratio are optimized to the ESI-MS2 data. MassBank also provides a merged spectrum for each compound prepared by merging the analyzed ESI-MS2 data on an identical compound under different collision-induced dissociation conditions. Data merging has significantly improved the precision of the identification of a chemical compound by 21-23% at a similarity score of 0.6. Thus, MassBank is useful for the identification of chemical compounds and the publication of experimental data. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/jms.1777

Here we present the large scale synthesis, crystal structure, and optical characterization of the 2D (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NR3)(n-1)PbnI3n+1 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, infinity) perovskites, a family of layered compounds with tunable semiconductor characteristics. These materials consist of well-defined inorganic perovskite layers intercalated with bulky butylammonium cations that act as spacers between these fragments, adopting the crystal structure of the Ruddlesden-Popper type. We find that the perovskite thickness (n) can be synthetically controlled by adjusting the ratio between the spacer cation and the small organic cation, thus allowing the isolation of compounds in pure form and large scale. The orthorhombic crystal structures of (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)-Pb2I7 (n = 2, Cc2m; a = 8.9470(4), b = 39.347(2) angstrom, c = 8.8589(6)), (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(2)Pb3I10 (n = 3, C2cb; a = 8.9275(6), b = 51.959(4) angstrom, c = 8.8777(6)), and (CH3(CH2)(3)NH3)(2)(CH3NH3)(3)Pb4I13 (n = 4, Cc2m; a = 8.9274(4), b = 64.383(4) angstrom, c = 8.8816(4)) have been solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and are reported here for the first time. The compounds are noncentrosymmetric, as supported by measurements of the nonlinear optical properties of the compounds and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The band gaps of the series change progressively between 2.43 eV for the n = 1 member to 1.50 eV for the n = infinity adopting intermediate values of 2.17 eV (n = 2), 2.03 eV (n = 3), and 1.91 eV (n = 4) for those between the two compositional extrema. DFT calculations confirm this experimental trend and predict a direct band gap for all the members of the Ruddlesden Popper series. The estimated effective masses have values of m(h) = 0.14 m(0) and m(e) = 0.08 m(0) for holes and electrons, respectively, and are found to be nearly composition independent. The band gaps of higher n members indicate that these compounds can be used as efficient light absorbers in solar cells, which offer better solution processability and good environmental stability. The compounds exhibit intense room-temperature photoluminescence with emission wavelengths consistent with their energy gaps, 2.35 eV (n = 1), 2.12 eV (n = 2), 2.01 eV (n = 3), and 1.90 eV (n = 4) and point to their potential use in light-emitting diodes. In addition, owing to the low dimensionality and the difference in dielectric properties between the organic spacers and the inorganic perovskite layers, these compounds are naturally occurring multiple quantum well structures, which give rise to stable excitons at room temperature.",10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b00847
J,"Christopher, P; Xin, HL; Linic, S",Visible-light-enhanced catalytic oxidation reactions on plasmonic silver nanostructures,"Catalysis plays a critical role in chemical conversion, energy production and pollution mitigation. High activation barriers associated with rate-limiting elementary steps require most commercial heterogeneous catalytic reactions to be run at relatively high temperatures, which compromises energy efficiency and the long-term stability of the catalyst. Here we show that plasmonic nanostructures of silver can concurrently use low-intensity visible light (on the order of solar intensity) and thermal energy to drive catalytic oxidation reactions-such as ethylene epoxidation, CO oxidation, and NH3 oxidation-at lower temperatures than their conventional counterparts that use only thermal stimulus. Based on kinetic isotope experiments and density functional calculations, we postulate that excited plasmons on the silver surface act to populate O-2 antibonding orbitals and so form a transient negative-ion state, which thereby facilitates the rate-limiting O-2-dissociation reaction. The results could assist the design of catalytic processes that are more energy efficient and robust than current processes.",10.1038/NCHEM.1032

J,"Peighambardoust, SJ; Rowshanzamir, S; Amjadi, M",Review of the proton exchange membranes for fuel cell applications,"Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are considered to be a promising technology for clean and efficient power generation in the twenty-first century. Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are the key components in fuel cell system. The researchers have focused to reach the proton exchange membrane with high proton conductivity, low electronic conductivity, low permeability to fuel, low electroosmotic drag coefficient, good chemical/thermal stability, good mechanical properties and low cost. These are classified into the ""iron triangle"" of performance, durability, and cost. Current PEMFC technology is based on expensive perflourinated proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) that operate effectively only under fully hydrated conditions. There is considerable application-driven interest in lowering the membrane cost and extending the operating window of PEMs. PEMFC system complexity could be reduced by the development of 'water-free' electrolytes that do not require hydration. It also enables the PEMFC to be operated under 'warm' conditions (i.e. above 100 degrees C) thus further improving its efficiency. Capital cost could also be further reduced because at warmer conditions less Pt could be used. This paper presents an overview of the key requirements for the proton exchange membranes (PEM) used in fuel cell applications, along with a description of the membrane materials currently being used and their ability to meet these requirements. A number of possible alternative candidates are reviewed and presented in this paper. Also discussed are some of the new materials, technologies, and research directions being pursued to try to meet the demanding performance and durability needs of the PEM fuel cell industry. The alternative PEMs are classified into three categories: (1) modified Nafion (R) composite membranes; (2) functionalized non-fluorinated membranes and composite membranes therein; and (3) acid base composite membranes. Several commonly used inorganic additives are reviewed in the context of composite membranes. Finally, the general methods of the measuring and evaluating of proton exchange membrane properties have been investigated such as proton conductivity, ion exchange capacity, water uptake, gas permeability, methanol permeability, durability, thermal stability and fuel cell performance test.

Here we report differential reflectance and PL spectra of mono- to few-layer WS2 and WSe2 that indicate that the band structure of these materials undergoes similar indirect-to-direct gap transition when thinned to a single monolayer.

A sharp resonance of nearly perfect transmission can arise within a broad absorption profile. These features show remarkable potential for slow light, novel sensors and low-loss metamaterials. In nanophotonics, plasmonic structures enable large field strengths within small mode volumes. Therefore, combining EIT with nanoplasmonics would pave the way towards ultracompact sensors with extremely high sensitivity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a nanoplasmonic analogue of EIT using a stacked optical metamaterial. A dipole antenna with a large radiatively broadened linewidth is coupled to an underlying quadrupole antenna, of which the narrow linewidth is solely limited by the fundamental non-radiative Drude damping. In accordance with EIT theory, we achieve a very narrow transparency window with high modulation depth owing to nearly complete suppression of radiative losses.",10.1038/NMAT2495

Herein, we report a novel hybrid nanostructure with CoP nanopartides (NPs) embedded in a N-doped carbon nanotube hollow polyhedron (NCNHP) through a pyrolysis-oxidation-phosphidation strategy derived from core-shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between highly active CoP NPs and NCNHP, the CoP/NCNHP hybrid exhibited outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performances.

Density functional theory calculations indicated that the electron transfer from NCNHP to CoP could increase the electronic states of the Co d-orbital around the Fermi level, which could increase the binding strength with H and therefore improve the electrocatalytic performance.

J,"Tadros, T; Izquierdo, R; Esquena, J; Solans, C",Formation and stability of nano-emulsions,"This review describes the principles of formation and stability of nano-emulsions. It starts with an introduction highlighting the main advantages of nano-emulsions over macroemulsions for personal care and cosmetic formulations. It also describes the main problems with lack of progress on nano-emulsions. The second section deals with the mechanism of emulsification and the dynamic light scattering technique for measurement of the droplet size of nano-emulsions. This is followed by a section on methods of emulsification and the role of surfactants. Three methods are described for nano-emulsion preparation, namely high energy emulsification (using homogenisers), low energy emulsification whereby water is added to an oil solution of the surfactant and the principle of the phase inversion temperature (PIT). A section is devoted to steric stabilisation and the role of the adsorbed layer thickness. The problem of Ostwald ripening (which is the main instability process of nano-emulsions) is described in some detail. The methods that can be applied to reduce Ostwald ripening are briefly described. This involves the addition of a second less soluble oil phase such as squalene and/or addition of a strongly adsorbed and water insoluble polymeric surfactant. The last part of the review gives some examples of nano-emulsions that are prepared by the PIT method as well as using high pressure homogeniser. A comparison of the two methods is given and the rate of Ostwald ripening is measured in both cases. The effect of changing the alkyl chain length and branching of the oil was investigated using decane, dodecane, tertadecane, hexadecane and isohexadecane. The branched oil isohexadcecane showed higher Ostwald ripening rate when compared with a linear chain oil with the same carbon number. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

From long to short geometries, the results presented here lead to three characteristic regions, which correspond to three different interaction states. While the extreme regions are associated to pure closed-shell (CS) and shared-shell (SS) interactions, the middle one has been related to the redistribution of rho(r) between those electronic states. The analysis carried out with this system has permitted to associate the transit region between pure CS and SS interactions to internuclear geometries involved in the building of the H-F bonding molecular orbital. A comparative analysis between the formation of this orbital and the behavior of some characteristic rho(r) properties has indicated their intrinsic correspondence, leading to the definition of a bond degree parameter [BD=H-CP/rho(CP); H-CP and rho(CP) being the total electron energy density and the electron density value at the H...F (3,-1) critical point]. Along with the isolated pairwise H...F interaction, 79 X-H...F-Y (neutral, positively and negatively charged) complexes have been also theoretically considered and analyzed in terms of relevant topological and energetic properties of rho(r) found at their H.F critical points.

The use of the CHARMM36 force field (C36 FF) in different MD simulation programs can result in disagreements with published simulations performed with CHARMM due to differences in the protocols used to treat the long-range and 14 nonbonded interactions. In this study, we systematically test the use of the C36 lipid FF in NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER, OpenMM, and CHARMM/OpenMM. A wide range of Lennard-Jones (LJ) cutoff schemes and integrator algorithms were tested to find the optimal simulation protocol to best match bilayer properties of six lipids with varying acyl chainsaturation and head groups. MD simulations of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer were used to obtain the optimal protocol for each program. MD simulations with all programs were found to reasonably match the DPPC bilayer properties (surface area per lipid, chain order parameters, and area compressibility modulus) obtained using the standard protocol used in CHARMM as well as from experiments. The optimal simulation protocol was then applied to the other five lipid simulations and resulted in excellent agreement between results from most simulation programs as well as with experimental data. AMBER compared least favorably with the expected membrane properties, which appears to be due to its use of the hard-truncation in the LJ potential versus a force-based switching function used to smooth the LJ potential as it approaches the cutoff distance. The optimal simulation protocol for each program has been implemented in CHARMM-GUI. This protocol is expected to be applicable to the remainder of the additive C36 FF including the proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecules.",10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00935

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study of GO sheets annealed at various reaction temperatures reveals that N-doping occurs at a temperature as low as 300 degrees C, while the highest doping level of similar to 5% N is achieved at 500 degrees C. N-doping is accompanied by the reduction of GO with decreases in oxygen levels from similar to 28% in as-made GO down to similar to 2% in 1100 degrees C NH3 reacted GO. XPS analysis of the N binding configurations of doped GO finds pyridinic N in the doped samples, with increased quaternary N (N that replaced the carbon atoms in the graphene plane) in GO annealed at higher temperatures (>= 900 degrees C). Oxygen groups in GO were found responsible for reactions with NH3 and C-N bond formation. Prereduced GO with fewer oxygen groups by thermal annealing in H-2 exhibits greatly reduced reactivity with NH3 and a lower N-doping level. Electrical measurements of individual GO sheet devices demonstrate that GO annealed in NH3 exhibits higher conductivity than those annealed in H-2, suggesting more effective reduction of GO by annealing in NH3 than in H-2, consistent with XPS data. The N-doped reduced GO shows clearly n-type electron doping behavior with the Dirac point (DP) at negative gate voltages in three terminal devices.

For related Ni-based materials, the addition of Fe dramatically enhances OER activity. The role of Fe in Co-based materials is not well-documented. We show that the intrinsic OER activity of Co1-xFex(OOH) is similar to 100-fold higher for x approximate to 0.6-0.7 than for x = 0 on a per-metal turnover frequency basis. Fe-free CoOOH absorbs Fe from electrolyte impurities if the electrolyte is not rigorously purified. Fe incorporation and increased activity correlate with an anodic shift in the nominally Co2+/3+ redox wave, indicating strong electronic interactions between the two elements and likely substitutional doping of Fe for Co. In situ electrical measurements show that Co1-xFex(OOH) is conductive under OER conditions (similar to 0.7-4 mS cm(-1) at similar to 300 mV overpotential), but that FeOOH is an insulator with measurable conductivity (2.2 x 10(-2) mS cm(-1)) only at high overpotentials >400 mV. The apparent OER activity of FeOOH is thus limited by low conductivity. Microbalance measurements show that films with x >= 0.54 (i.e., Fe-rich) dissolve in 1 M KOH electrolyte under OER conditions. For x < 0.54, the films appear chemically stable, but the OER activity decreases by 16-62% over 2 h, likely due to conversion into denser, oxide-like phases. We thus hypothesize that Fe is the most-active site in the catalyst, while CoOOH primarily provides a conductive, high-surface area, chemically stabilizing host. These results are important as Fe-containing Co- and Ni-(oxy)hydroxides are the fastest OER catalysts known.",10.1021/jacs.5b00281

The results reveal that at least five different fluorescent DOM fractions present (in significant amounts) in the catchment and that the relative composition is dependent on the source (e.g. agricultural runoff, forest soil, aquatic production).

However, to date, there has been little success in the development of high-performance solid-state batteries using these exceptional materials, the major challenge being the high solid-solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and electrode materials. In this work, we effectively address the large interfacial impedance between a lithium metal anode and the garnet electrolyte using ultrathin aluminium oxide (Al2O3) by atomic layer deposition. Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLCZN) is the garnet composition of choice in this work due to its reduced sintering temperature and increased lithium ion conductivity. A significant decrease of interfacial impedance, from 1,710 Omega cm(2) to 1 Omega cm(2), was observed at room temperature, effectively negating the lithium metal/garnet interfacial impedance. Experimental and computational results reveal that the oxide coating enables wetting of metallic lithium in contact with the garnet electrolyte surface and the lithiated-alumina interface allows effective lithium ion transport between the lithium metal anode and garnet electrolyte.

CoOx@CN exhibited a small onset potential of 85 mV, low charge-transfer resistance (41 Omega), and considerable stability for HER. Electrocatalytic experiments further indicated the better performance of CoOx@CN for HER can be attributed to the high conductivity of carbon, the synergistic effect of metallic cobalt and cobalt oxide, the stability of carbon-encapsulated Co nanoparticles, and the introduction of electron-rich nitrogen. In addition, when used as catalysts of OER, the CoOx@CN hybrids required 0.26 V overpotential for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable even superior to many other non-noble metal catalysts.

The total MP2 correlation energy is partitioned into parallel- and antiparallel-spin components which are separately scaled. The two parameters (scaling factors), whose values can be justified by basic theoretical arguments, have been optimized on a benchmark set of 51 reaction energies composed of 74 first-row molecules. It is found, that the new method performs significantly better than standard MP2: the rms [mean absolute error (MAE)] deviation drops from 4.6 (3.3) to 2.3 (1.8) kcal/mol. The maximum error is reduced from 13.3 to 5.1 kcal/mol. Significant improvements are especially observed for cases which are usually known as MP2 pitfalls while cases already described well with MP2 remain almost unchanged. Even for 11 atomization energies not considered in the fit, uniform improvements [MAE: 8.1 kcal/mol (MP2) versus 3.2 kcal/mol (new)] are found. The results are furthermore compared with those from density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) and quadratic configuration interaction [QCISD/QCISD(T)] calculations. Also for difficult systems including strong (nondynamical) correlation effects, the improved MP2 method clearly outperforms DFT/B3LYP and yields results of QCISD or sometimes QCISD(T) quality. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for ten diatomic molecules also show consistent enhancements. The uniformity with which the new method improves upon MP2, thereby rectifying many of its problems, indicates significant robustness and suggests it as a valuable quantum chemical method of general use.

Measurements of stain sensitivity after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) gave a detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio > 3) of 1 ng in a single zone. The somewhat lower sensitivity of ""blue silver"" as compared to classical silvering protocols in the presence of aldehydes is amply compensated for by its full compatibility with mass spectrometry of eluted polypeptide chains, after a two-dimensional map analysis, thus confirming that no dye is covalently bound (or permanently modifies) to any residue in the proteinaceous material. It is believed that the higher level of phosphoric acid in the recipe, thus its lower final pH, helps in protonating the last dissociated residues of Asp and Glu in the polypeptide coils, thus greatly favoring ionic anchoring of dye molecules to the protein moiety. Such a binding, though, must be followed by considerable hydrophobic association with the aromatic and hydrophobic residues along the polypeptide backbone.",10.1002/elps.200305844

Adler, G. Knizia, and H.-J. Werner, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 221106 (2007)] are explained in more detail and extended to open-shell systems. Extensive benchmark calculations are presented, which demonstrate great improvements in basis set convergence for a wide variety of applications. These include reaction energies of both open- and closed-shell reactions, atomization energies, electron affinities, ionization potentials, equilibrium geometries, and harmonic vibrational frequencies. For all these quantities, results better than the AV5Z quality are obtained already with AVTZ basis sets, and usually AVDZ treatments reach at least the conventional AVQZ quality. For larger molecules, the additional cost for these improvements is only a few percent of the time for a standard CCSD(T) calculation.

Here we report, for the first time, a synthetic method that leads to in situ growth of {210} high-index faceted Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF). We show that the resulting material, denoted Ni3S2/NF, can serve as a highly active, binder-free, bifunctional electro catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ni3S2/NF is found to give similar to 100% Faradaic yield toward both HER and OER and to show remarkable catalytic stability (for >200 h). Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that Ni3S2/NF's excellent catalytic activity is mainly due to the synergistic catalytic effects produced in it by its nanosheet arrays and exposed {210} high-index facets.",10.1021/jacs.5b08186

For such applications, it is important that the nanomaterials be harmlessly eliminated from the body in a reasonable period of time after they carry out their diagnostic or therapeutic function. Despite efforts to improve their targeting efficiency, significant quantities of systemically administered nanomaterials are cleared by the mononuclear phagocytic system before finding their targets, increasing the likelihood of unintended acute or chronic toxicity. However, there has been little effort to engineer the self-destruction of errant nanoparticles into non-toxic, systemically eliminated products. Here, we present luminescent porous silicon nanoparticles (LPSiNPs) that can carry a drug payload and of which the intrinsic near-infrared photoluminescence enables monitoring of both accumulation and degradation in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to most optically active nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles and quantum dots), LPSiNPs self-destruct in a mouse model into renally cleared components in a relatively short period of time with no evidence of toxicity. As a preliminary in vivo application, we demonstrate tumour imaging using dextran-coated LPSiNPs (D-LPSiNPs). These results demonstrate a new type of multifunctional nanostructure with a low-toxicity degradation pathway for in vivo applications.",10.1038/NMAT2398

Our first-generation devices containing (PEA)(2)(MA)(2)[Pb3I10] (1; PEA=C6H5(CH2)(2)NH3+, MA=CH3NH3+) show an open-circuit voltage of 1.18V and a power conversion efficiency of 4.73%. The layered structure allows for high-quality films to be deposited through spin coating and high-temperature annealing is not required for device fabrication. The 3Dperovskite (MA)[PbI3] (2) has recently been identified as a promising absorber for solar cells. However, its instability to moisture requires anhydrous processing and operating conditions. Films of 1 are more moisture resistant than films of 2 and devices containing 1 can be fabricated under ambient humidity levels. The larger bandgap of the 2Dstructure is also suitable as the higher bandgap absorber in a dual-absorber tandem device.

Furthermore, a nucleation-controlled strategy is established to systematically promote the formation of large-area, single-and few-layered films. Using high-resolution electron microscopy imaging, the atomic structure and morphology of the grains and their boundaries in the polycrystalline molybdenum disulphide atomic layers are examined, and the primary mechanisms for grain boundary formation are evaluated.

J,"Krishnamoorthy, K; Veerapandian, M; Yun, K; Kim, SJ",The Chemical and structural analysis of graphene oxide with different degrees of oxidation,"Graphene oxide (GO) with various degrees of oxidation was synthesized using a modified Hummers method. The formation of different types of oxygen containing functional groups in GO, and their influences on its structure were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), zeta potential analysis and Raman spectroscopy. XRD studies showed a disruption of the graphitic AS stacking order during the increase in oxidation levels. XPS analysis revealed the formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at lower oxidation levels and epoxide groups at higher oxidation levels. The influence of the oxidation degree on the properties of GO was evaluated by zeta potential analysis, which showed a linear increase in the zeta potential with increasing oxidation levels. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed that increasing oxidation levels results in a transition from a crystalline to an amorphous structure. The electrochemical properties of GO is highly influenced by the variation in degree of oxidation. Our results suggest that the properties of GO can be tuned by varying the oxidation degree, which may pave the way to new developments in the GO-based applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Qu, LH; Peng, XG",Control of photoluminescence properties of CdSe nanocrystals in growth,"The photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) of CdSe nanocrystals during their growth under a given set of initial conditions increases monotonically to a certain maximum value and then decreases gradually. Such a maximum is denoted as a PL ""bright point"", which does not always overlap with the minimum point of the PL peak width for the same reaction. The experimental results suggest that the existence of the PL bright point is a general phenomenon during the growth of semiconductor nanocrystals and likely is a signature of an optimal surface structure/reconstruction of the nanocrystals grown under a given set of initial conditions. The position of the bright point, the highest PL QY, the types of the bright points (sharp or flat), the sharpness of the PL peak, etc., were all strongly dependent on the initial Cd:Se ratio of the precursors in the solution. A large excess of the selenium precursor, with 5-10 times more selenium precursor than the amount of the cadmium precursor, was found necessary to achieve a high PL QY value and a narrow emission profile. The existence of the PL bright point and the sensitive temporal variation of the PL QY during the growth of semiconductor nanocrystals can explain the unpredictable nature and poor reproducibility of the PL properties of the as-prepared semiconductor nanocrystals observed previously. Furthermore, the knowledge gained in this study enabled us to reproducibly synthesize highly luminescent CdSe nanocrystals through a relatively simple and safe synthetic scheme. In a traditionally weak emission window for CdSe nanocrystals, the orange-red optical window, the PL QY of the as-prepared CdSe nanocrystals reached as high as 85% at room temperature, and the full width at half-maximum of the corresponding PL peak was as narrow as 23 nm, about 65-80 meV depending on the emitting position. The PL properties of the as-prepared CdSe nanocrystals are stable upon aging for at least several months. These as-prepared nanocrystals represent a series of best emitters that are highly efficient, highly pure in emission color, stable, and continuously tunable by simply varying the size of the nanocrystals.",10.1021/ja017002j

Together, these two catalyst systems cover a broad spectrum of commonly encountered substrates for Suzuki couplings. Furthermore, they display novel reactivity patterns, such as the selective cross-coupling by Pd-2(dba)(3)/P(t-Bu)(3) of an aryl chloride in preference to an aryl triflate, and they can be used at low lending, even for reactions of aryl chlorides.

J,"Dreuw, A; Head-Gordon, M",Failure of time-dependent density functional theory for long-range charge-transfer excited states: The zincbacteriochlorin-bacterlochlorin and bacteriochlorophyll-spheroidene complexes,"It is well-known that time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) yields substantial errors for the excitation energies of charge-transfer (CT) excited states, when approximate standard exchange-correlation (xc) functionals are used, for example, SVWN, BLYP, or B3LYP. Also, the correct 1/R asymptotic behavior of CT states with respect to a distance coordinate R between the separated charges of the CT state is not reproduced by TDDFT employing these xc-functionals. Here, we demonstrate by analysis of the TDDFT equations that the first failure is due to the self-interaction error in the orbital energies from the ground-state DFT calculation, while the latter is a similar self-interaction error in TDDFT arising through the electron transfer in the CT state. Possible correction schemes, such as inclusion of exact Hartree-Fock or exact Kohn-Sham exchange, as well as aspects of the exact xc-functional are discussed in this context. Furthermore, a practical approach is proposed which combines the benefits of TDDFT and configuration interaction singles (CIS) and which does not suffer from electron-transfer self-interaction. The latter approach is applied to a (1,4)-phenylene-linked zincbacteriochlorin-bacteriochlorin complex and to a bacteriochlorophyll-spheroidene complex, in which CT states may play important roles in energy and electron-transfer processes. The errors of TDDFT alone for the CT states are demonstrated, and reasonable estimates for the true excitation energies of these states are given.",10.1021/ja039556n

J,"Kim, J; Cote, LJ; Kim, F; Yuan, W; Shull, KR; Huang, JX",Graphene Oxide Sheets at Interfaces,"Graphite oxide sheet, now called graphene oxide (GO), is the product of chemical exfoliation of graphite and has been known for more than a century. GO has been largely viewed as hydrophilic, presumably due to its excellent colloidal stability in water. Here we report that GO is an amphiphile with hydrophilic edges and a more hydrophobic basal plane. GO can act like a surfactant, as measured by its ability to adsorb on interfaces and lower the surface or interfacial tension. Since the degree of ionization of the edge COOH groups is affected by pH, GO's amphiphilicity can be tuned by pH. In addition, size-dependent amphiphilicity of GO sheets is observed. Since each GO sheet is a single molecule as well as a colloidal particle, the molecule colloid duality makes it behave like both a molecular and a colloidal surfactant. For example, GO is capable of creating highly stable Pickering emulsions of organic solvents like solid particles. It can also act as a molecular dispersing agent to process insoluble materials such as graphite and carbon nanotubes in water. The ease of its conversion to chemically modified graphene could enable new opportunities in solution processing of functional materials.",10.1021/ja102777p
