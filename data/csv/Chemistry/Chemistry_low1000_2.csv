The molten Aluminum alloy was maintained at 800 degrees C and then poured into a mould at 200 degrees C. Aluminum alloys were hot-extruded into a rod measuring 12 mm thick with a reduction ratio of 38: 1. The microstructure and electric conductivity properties of as-extruded Al-1.0RE alloy under different annealing processes were investigated and compared. After extrusion, the intermetallic compound having a needle shape in the cast state was finely decomposed based on the direction of extrusion. Significant changes in the microstructure were detected after annealing at 500 degrees C with fragmentation and sphering of eutectic particles. The annealing temperature of Al-1.0RE alloy increased proportionally to the electrical conductivity. The formation of Al-RE intermetallic compounds increases the electrical conductivity and improves the mechanical properties of the alloy through precipitation hardening.",10.1166/jnn.2020.17275

It is found that the unit area emitting intensity of small size mu-LED is stronger that of big size mu-LED at the same conditions, due to the enhancement of both the internal quantum efficiency eta(int) and extraction efficiency C-ex.

By using a compact quadrupole mass filter system a hyperthermal ion beam is mass filtered. The GaN thin film depositions with varying ion-to-atom arrival ratio and kinetic energies of 40 eV and 80 eV are performed to highlight the distinct impact of the ion species on the early stages of the growth. It is evaluated that precise selection of ion beam parameters enables the preferred growth of either the metastable zinc blende GaN phase or the stable wurtzite GaN phase on 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Further, using molecular nitrogen ion species thin films of high crystalline quality could be deposited even at ion kinetic energies of 80 eV, while films with atomic nitrogen ion assistance feature reduced crystalline quality.",10.1016/j.apsusc.2019.143830

The generation of co-crystals occurs due to the flexible structure of the A-S-TTF and its electrostatic interaction with the polyoxometalate anions. The complexes can be divided into three types, i.e., type I, type II, and type III, which have organic/inorganic ratios of 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1, respectively. Multiple intermolecular interactions are observed between the organic and inorganic moieties, which stabilize the structures of the resulting hybrid clusters. In the clusters, Ar-S-TTFs are oxidized into radical cations [except in complex (TTF4)center dot(PMA)center dot(TBA), where TTF4 is presented as a +2 cation]. There are two factors affecting the packing styles and compositions of the hybrid clusters: 1) valence state of the Ar-S-TTF and 2) volume of the aryl groups thereon.",10.1002/ejic.201901185

And we also examined preservice chemistry teachers' perceptions of modeling in different audience groups. The participants of the study were 18 university students in the first grade of preservice chemistry teachers taking a general chemistry experiment course. They completed eleven topics of general chemistry experiment using argument-based modeling strategy. The understanding of chemistry concept was compared with the effect size of pre- and post-chemistry concept test scores. To find out modeling ability, we analyzed level of model by each preservice chemistry teacher. Analytical framework for the modeling ability was composed of three elements, explanation, representation, and communication. The questionnaire was conducted to check up on preservice chemistry teacher's recognition of modeling. The result of analyzing the effect of modeling for different audience on the understanding of chemistry concept and modeling ability, the preservice chemistry teachers' were found to be more effective when the level of audience was low. There was no difference in the recognition of modeling between the groups for audience. However, we could confirm that the responses of preservice chemistry teachers are changed in concrete when they have an experience in succession on modeling.",10.5012/jkcs.2019.63.6.459

Average crystallite sizes determined by Scherrer equation are the range similar to 14-32 nm, whereas SEM micrographs show nano-micro meter size particles formed in ZnCo2O3. Endothermic peak at similar to 798 K in the Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) trace without weight loss could be due to structural transformation and the endothermic peak similar to 1143 K with weight loss is due to reversible loss of O-2 in air atmosphere. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis profile shows the presence of elements Zn, Co and O which indicates the purity of the sample. Magnetic measurements in the range of +12 kOe to -12 kOe at 10 K, 77 K, 120 K and at 300 K by PPMS-II Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) shows hysteresis loops having very low values of the coercivity and retentivity which indicates the weakly ferromagnetic nature of the oxide. Observed Xband EPR isotropic lineshapes at 300 K and 77 K show positive g-shift at g(iso) similar to 2.230 and g(i)(so) similar to 2.217, respectively which is in agreement with the presence of paramagnetic site Co2+(3d(7)) in the oxide. DC conductivity value of 2.875 x10(-8) S/cm indicates very weakly semiconducting nature of ZnCo2O3 at 300 K. DRS absorption bands similar to 357 nm, similar to 572 nm, similar to 619 nm and -654 nm are due to the d-d transitions T-4(1g)(F-4)-> E-2(g)((2)G), T-4(1g)(F-4)-> T-4(1g)(P-4), T-4(1g)(F-4)->(4)A(2g)(F-4), T-4(1g)(F-4) -> T-4(2)g(F-4), respectively in octahedral ligand field around Co2+ ions.

When cathode active material was leached by lactic acid, lactic acid showed the highest efficiency at 2 N than 1 N and above 4 N concentration. When the cathode active material was added incrementally into the solution of lactic acid, the maximum solubility was 30 g/L at 2 N concentration. Oxalic acid was added in the solution of lactic acid and it showed that rare metals represent the most economical recovery efficiency at 4 g/L. Based on this study, it was found that the optimal condition for recovery of rare metals from cathode active material is oxalic acid : cathode active material = 7 : 1 as a ratio of weight. In addition, it was observed that the precipitate produced by oxalic acid is a polynuclear crystalline material bonded with 3 components of Co, Ni, and Mn.",10.5012/jkcs.2019.63.6.446

A test consisting of three similar data sets regarding daily-life and scientific contexts was developed, and administered to 151 ninth graders. They were expected to construct proportional, inverse-proportional, and increasing and become constant form of graphs for each data set. Graphs constructed were analyzed in the aspects of constructing a trend line (types of a trend line, interpolation/extrapolation), selecting axes variables, scaling axes, and plotting points. Analyses of the results revealed that the students with set paradigm tended to construct a curved trend line, while those with point paradigm constructed a broken trend line in inverse-proportional graph questions. In the aspects of interpolation/extrapolation, most students with set paradigm performed both interpolation and extrapolation better than those with point paradigm in scientific context. Most students with set paradigm performed both interpolation and extrapolation regardless of contexts, while the proportion of interpolation of those with point paradigm was higher in scientific context than in daily-life context. In selecting axes variables, scaling axes, and plotting dots, there were no statistically significant differences between set and point paradigms. On the bases of the results, educational implications for improving graph construction skills of middle school students are discussed.",10.5012/jkcs.2019.63.6.473

Deuterium was used as a collision gas and affinity column with ammonium formate was used as an eluting solvent for the accurate quantitation of selenoproteins in human blood serum. Certified reference material BCR 639 (133 +/- 12 ng g(-1)) was tested for the accuracy and the result was satisfactory 130 +/- 6 ng g(-1).

The difference was statistically obvious when t-test was performed (t(cal) 4.93 > t(95%) 2.04). The decrease for cancer group was more obvious for female and aged group. The distributions of three selenoproteins were similar with each other, which means rectal cancer group did not show any specificity for any selenoproteins. As cancer developed, GPx showed a slight decrease but not obvious while the total concentration was increasing particularly at the second stage of cancer.",10.5012/jkcs.2019.63.6.420

The measurements of thermal cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C and 24-hour temperature cycling from -40 degrees C to +85 degrees C withstanding the effects of 20-hour penetration of 85 degrees C were carried out in CdS/CdTe solar cells with structures of FTO/CdS/CdTe/Au, FTO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, and FTO/MZO/CdS/CdTe/back contact/Au, respectively. The performances of these cells before and after the thermal aging experiments were investigated by using light and dark I-V together with C-V. The results reveal varied performance degradation before and after thermal aging in the cells with different structures. Among these, the most deteriorated device is the one without back contact (BC), whose efficiency decreased by 25.12% after thermal cycling accompanying an obvious roll-over phenomenon when forward bias was greater than open circuit voltage. On the contrary, the reduction in the efficiency was about 16.80% in the case cells with BC, and the roll-over phenomenon was not so significant. Furthermore, for the devices with optimized front contact of FTO/MZO, the thermal stability was improved obviously. Interestingly, short-circuit current density associated with the carrier concentration of cells remained relatively small variations compared with the change of Voc and fill factor. All the results indicated that an efficient back contact layer and an optimized front electrode were the indispensable structural elements to attain high stabilization in the CdS/CdTe solar cells.",10.1155/2019/3579587

Absorption spectra recorded for L-1, ZnL1, and complexes 1-3 display ligand-based absorption bands in the UV (lambda(max) approximate to 320 nm) and visible regions (lambda(max) approximate to 430 nm) with molar absorption coefficients up to 6.3 x 10(4) and 3.9 x 10(4) m(-)(1) cm(-1), respectively. Upon excitation into ligand-centered absorption bands in the visible range, characteristic NIR emission signals of Yb3+ (1), Nd3+ (2), and Er3+ (3) have been obtained.

However, his inflexible belief in an alternating structure of rows of VII and VIII groups made it impossible for him to include the 'rare earths', and the relationship between the two rows of VII at the top confused the system. From 1873 onwards, other interests prevented him from thinking about his table, apart from accommodating the noble gases.

Optical microcavities are excellent candidates for constructing powerful microlasers and label-free biosensors, owing to their low optical losses and small size. However, most of these microcavity syntheses rely on sophisticated fabrication methods and cannot be manipulated easily. To achieve facile and versatile microcavity fabrication, we present a robust microfluidics method for monodispersed self-coupling optical microcavity fabrication with a fine tunability. The microcavity polydispersity was less than 3%. The optical microcavity size could be varied from 10 to 30 mu m with a steady quality factor (Q) of approximately 1000. The lowest laser threshold that we obtained was 0.82 mu J with a microcavity size of 20 mu m. The doped fluorescent dye concentration can be tuned precisely from 0.001 to 0.05 wt% to explore an optimized fluorescent background. The experimental results and theoretical simulation match well in terms of Q and the electrometric resonance field intensity. Compared with previous precise and practical fabrication methods, we have demonstrated a facile approach for versatile optical microcavity fabrication.

Here we report a new polymorph of 25,26,27,28-tetrakis(methoxycarbonylmethoxy)calix [4]arene, which is present with two similar crystallographically independent molecules. These molecules are cone-shaped, in contrast to the 1,3-alternate conformation found in the previously known crystal form of the same compound. Our DFT calculations have also pointed out that the literature 1,3-alternate conformation is more stable than the cone one in the gas phase. Therefore, the higher energy cone conformation is assisted in the solid state by C-H center dot center dot center dot pi contacts, since these interactions occur only in the polymorph described here. We also reported in this study the simultaneous occurrence of two conformations in the crystal lattice of 5,11,17,23-tetra(p-fluoroaminobenzylidene)-25,26,27,28-tetrabutoxycalix [4]arene. Pinched cone conformations are assumed through either pi center dot center dot center dot pi or C-H center dot center dot center dot pi intramolecular contacts between phenyl rings of the upper rim substituents. These non-covalent contacts are responsible for pointing two alternate phenyl rings from the annulus and their interacted upper rim substituents inwards the cone cavity. DFT calculations reveal that these conformations have very similar energies, helping us to understand the conformerism phenomenon into the elucidated solid state form. Such conformerism found either in two distinct solid state forms or into a same one shows the high conformational complexity of simple calixarenes, which can be decisive to their desired host-guest properties.

The aldehydic C-H bond activation was found directed by anionic phenolic group rather than neutral phenolic hydroxyl, which reasonably rationalizes the reversibility of the C-H bond activation. Direct ring-opening rather than N-O oxidative addition of isoxazole, and subsequent C-C reductive elimination generate the stable tripodal intermediate that has been demonstrated by LC-MS analysis. Finally, sequential amino and phenolic protonations of the tripodal species produce the product Z-enamide. Stereospecificity of Z-enamide can be attributed to the rigid carbon-carbon double bond formed by direct ringopening of isoxazole. The rate-determining process is found to include the directing ring-opening and C-N reductive elimination with an overall barrier of 26.7 kcal/mol. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This type of product, however, can suffer from syneresis: densification due to the expulsion of fluid. Gaining insight into the physical principles governing syneresis in such soft hybrid dispersions remains a challenge from a theoretical perspective, as experimental data are needed to establish a basis. We record non-accelerated syneresis in a model system for low-fat mayonnaise: a colloid polymer mixture, consisting of oil in water emulsion with starch in the aqueous phase. We find the flow rate of expelled fluid to be proportional to the difference in hydrostatic pressure over the system. The osmotic pressure of the added starch, while being higher than the hydrostatic pressure, does not prevent syneresis because the soluble starch is lost to the expelled fluid. From these findings, we conclude that forced syneresis in these systems can be described as a gravity-driven porous flow through the densely packed emulsion, explainable with a model based on Darcy's law.",10.1039/c9sm01097a

For an initial state with equal probability densities in both the wells, stabilized localization atop the barrier can be achieved on a periodic high-frequency driving. The barrier localization is characterized using Shannon information entropies in position and momentum spaces, defined as S-rho = - integral |psi|(2) ln |psi|(2) dx and S-gamma = - integral |phi|(2) ln |phi|(2) dp, where psi and phi refer to position and momentum space wave functions, respectively. The information entropy sum, S-rho + S-gamma, goes through a minimum indicating the formation of the barrier-localized state, when the peak intensity of the oscillating field is reached. The generalized uncertainty via the Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski inequality (S-rho + S-gamma >= 1 + ln pi) is saturated upon this minimization.

Adaptive Bayesian optimization is demonstrated here as a valuable support tool in increasing both the per-batch yield and quality of short polymer fibers, produced by wet spinning and shear dispersion methods.

The obtained monolith was developed as a solid-phase extraction sorbent and used with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the analysis of three benzodiazepines (BZDs) including bromazepam (BRZ), lorazepam (LRZ) and diazepam (DZP) in urine. The effects of reaction time and the solid-phase extraction conditions (washing solution, elution solvent and volume) on the extraction efficiencies of the three BZDs were investigated. The monolithic column was successfully prepared within 4 h, and it offered 100% adsorption efficiency for the three BZDs. The urine sample (4 mL) was loaded on the monolith, washed with 4 mL of H2O, and eluted with 1 mL of ethyl acetate. Under the optimized conditions, the linear ranges were 4. 0-1 000 ng/mL for the three BZDs, with correlation coefficients (r) of 0. 999.

According to the large negative values of binding energies, the noncovalent structures (CPSeNP/GCB1-15) exhibit significant energetic stability. The solvation energies demonstrated that solubility of GCB and SeNP increases which is a major factor in any anticancer drug delivery system. The important role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and Se-X interactions in CPSeNPs was revealed by atoms in molecules (AIM) analysis (X = O, N, C, F, H).

This involved the optimization and evaluation of a quick vortex-assisted extraction. Target compounds included pentachlorobenzene, hexachlorocyclohexanes (alpha, beta, gamma), hexachlorobenzene, DDE/DDD/DDT (o,p ' and p,p ' isomers) and PCBs (no. 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180). Involved assays were accomplished by analyzing real contaminated samples without previous spiking and using gas chromatography with a mass detector (GC/MS). As interesting aspects, a light oven drying with subsequent grinding and the addition of purchasable copper to remove sulfur were found to make the proposed procedure more affordable. In addition to describing the development of the analytical procedure, the reliability of the results was also assessed. In detail, the presence of possible bias and intermediate precision were estimated. The absence of bias in the analytical results was investigated by the Youden method. Regarding analytical variability, intermediate precision was estimated from the overall analyses of different real samples. Values were mainly between 6 and 15%, except for the DDT isomers, DDE and HCH, which ranged from 15 to 30%. The limits of detection (LODs) ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 ng mL(-1).

The iron(ii)-gentisate complexes react with dioxygen to afford the corresponding iron(iii) species. On the contrary, DHN-H undergoes oxidative C-C coupling to form [2,2 '-binaphthalene]-1,1 ',4,4 '-tetrone 3-hydroxy-3 '-carboxylic acid (BNTHC) on 1a, and [2,2 '-binaphthalene]-1,1 ',4,4 '-tetrone 3,3 '-dicarboxylic acid (BNTD) on 2a and 3a.

J,"Jamali, M; Tafreshi, HV; Pourdeyhimi, B",Easy-to-use correlations to estimate droplet mobility on hydrophobic fibrous coatings,"While a water droplet beads up on a hydrophobic fibrous surface, it does not necessarily detach or move on the surface under its own weight. The underlying physics of droplet adhesion to a rough surface is very complicated, and the ability to engineer a fibrous texture that promotes or prevents droplet mobility for droplets of different liquids has been a long-standing challenge. In this concern, the current work is devised to develop easy-to-use correlations for the force needed to detach a droplet from a hydrophobic fibrous coating in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These correlations are obtained by first writing an equation for the balance of forces acting on a detaching droplet in terms of its geometrical dimensions at the moment of detachment, and then relating these dimensions to those in the absence of an external force via curve fitting to a series of computational data. These easy-to-use correlations only require the physical properties of the fibrous coatings (e.g., fiber diameter, fiber spacing, and fiber contact angle) and the droplets (e.g., volume and surface tension) as inputs, and they can therefore be used to optimize the surface geometry prior to manufacturing. To examine their accuracy, predictions of these correlations are compared to experimental data obtained for droplet detachment from fibrous mats with fibers having a diameter of about two orders of magnitude smaller than those considered in developing the correlations.",10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.123867
J,"Lingwood, MD; Schepergerdes, BJ; Hermosillo, DMT; Delgado, JN; Sanders, KP",Probe Molecules for Pulsed-Field-Gradient Diffusion Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Experiments on Micelles,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion measurements of surfactants suffer from fast exchange of the surfactant between the micellar aggregate and bulk solution. Therefore, hydrophobic probe molecules are commonly used to directly measure aggregate diffusion under the assumption that the probe molecules remain solubilized inside the micelles. Aggregate size is then determined or estimated from the aggregate diffusion value. Unfortunately, the probe molecule also experiences rapid exchange between the aggregate and bulk, leading to inaccurate or unreasonable micelle diffusion values, a fact that has often been ignored in the literature. In this article, we present a systematic evaluation of probe molecules in cationic and anionic surfactants, obtained by measuring the diffusion of probe molecules with varying hydrophobicity. We find that an octanol-water partition coefficient of at least similar to 5 is required for correct measurements of aggregate diffusion in the systems studied. Notably, some commonly used probes have a partition coefficient much lower than five and are therefore not suitable for aggregate diffusion measurements. Consideration of these results will help researchers obtain accurate results for micelle sizing or partitioning studies with pulsed-field-gradient NMR.",10.1002/jsde.12378

Dielectric inks applied to the fibers offer a number of potential advantages over conventional calendar bonding including more efficient energy conversion, faster heating rates, heating directed to desired bond sites, facile patterning, the ability to function on materials with substantial amounts of loft, and avoidance of fiber damage induced by calendar roller contact. Poly(ethylene) and poly (propylene) do not efficiently convert microwave energy to heat on their own; therefore, propylene carbonate (PC) and glycerine carbonate (GC) were selected as ink candidates due to their large dipole moments and dielectric constants. The temperature-dependent dielectric constant and dielectric loss values of both carbonates were measured as well as their thermal responses to microwave energy at 2.45 GHz. The dispersion of each carbonate on bico-PE/PP fibers, including the application to nonwoven fabrics, was characterized by optical microscopy.

Ion stability is favored by having the basic secondary amine of the proline residue at the N-terminus and by an amino acid residue accommodating one of the protons on the side chain. Dissociation of [a(3) + H](2+) ions derived from peptides containing only aliphatic residues is by cleavage of the second amide bond to give [b(2)](+) or [a(2)](+) ions along with internal [a(1)](+) ions. For [a(3) + H](2+) ions containing a tryptophan residue in the central location, in addition to cleavage of the amide bond, losses of neutrals NH3, HN=CHR, (NH3 + CO), and HNCO were observed. Dissociations of some unsolvated Ln(3+)/tripeptide complexes gave [b(3) + H](2+) ions in low abundance; formation of these [b(3) + H](2+) ions was favored by the presence of a proline residue at the N-terminus and by either a histidine or tryptophan residue in the central position. Dissociation of these [b(3) + H](2+) ions was by the loss of (H2O + CO) and not only CO, indicating that these ions did not have the same type of oxazolone structure as found for [b(n)](+) ions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the observed [b(3) + H](2+) ions of ProGlyGly were formed from [Ce(ProGlyGly)](3+) complexes in which the peptide was bound to the metal ion as an enolate. Dissociation of the slightly lower-energy complex, where the peptide is bound in the keto form, would produce an oxazolone but the high barrier required to create this isomer of the [b(3) + H](2+) ion would be sufficient to result in further dissociation. Two isomers of the [b(3) + H](2+) ion of ProHisGly have been created, one from the [Ce(ProHisGly)](3+) complex that characteristically dissociates by the combined loss of (H2O + CO) and the other by the loss of glycine from [ProHisGlyGly + 2H](2+).

Here, the annihilation process of the 30 degrees Shockley partial dislocation pairs in CdTe is studied by first-principles calculations. We found that the dislocations can glide relatively easily due to the weak local bonding. Our systematic study of the slipping mechanism of the dislocations suggests that the energy barrier for the annihilation process is low. Band structure calculations reveal that the band bending caused by the charge transfer between the two dislocation cores depends on the core-core distance. A simple linear model is proposed to describe the mechanism of formation of the dislocation pair. More importantly, we demonstrate that hole injection can affect the core structure, increase the mobility, and eventually trigger a spontaneous mutual annihilation, which could be employed as a possible facile way to reduce the dislocation density.",10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b02918

J,"Kawamorita, S; Ahadito, BR; Naota, T",Proximity effects on the phosphorescent properties of dinuclear salicylaldiminato cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes linked with polymethylene spacers,"The synthesis, structure and photophysical properties of dinuclear bis(phenylpyridine)(salicylaldiminato)Ir(III) complexes bearing polymethylene linkers are described herein. Chiral and achiral dinuclear Ir complexes bearing short (n = 2), medium (n = 5) and long (n = 8) polymethylene linkers were prepared by reacting [Ir(2-phenylpyridinato)IrCl](2) with the corresponding salicylaldimine derivatives. The facial configurations of the coordination sites and the polymethylene-linked structures were unequivocally established based on X-ray crystallography. The emission wavelengths of these polymethylene-linked binuclear complexes in 2-MeTHF in a glassy state at 77 K were found to vary with the length of the linker, such that a hypsochromic shift from yellow to green was observed upon changing from pentamethylene (n = 5) or octamethylene (n = 8) to ethylene (n = 2) linkages. X-ray crystallography and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance analysis combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the present chromism arises from variations in the proximity and conformational rigidity between the two iridium cores, both of which are controlled by the length of the polymethylene linkage.",10.1007/s11243-019-00368-6
J,"Carranza, ME",Design of experiments in <SUP>241</SUP>Am alpha source preparation by electrodeposition: an approach to process optimization,"This work describes a procedure to improve the quality of an Am-241 alpha source obtained by means of electrodeposition. The technique of design of experiments (DoE) was applied in order to perform a multivariate analysis of the experimental variable effects taking into consideration the following: i-amperage, d-cathode-anode distance, t-time and PP-polishing process. A 3(4-2) fractional design was employed using four experimental factors, three levels per factor, and three response variables were studied: H-area = electrodeposited active area, %R = activity recovery percentage, and Delta(1/2) = width at half-height. Thanks to this simple design, 9 experiments were enough, done in triplicate, to discern how Delta(1/2) and %R are modified when experimental factors change. Additionally, this work provides tools to perform effect statistical analysis of experimental factors, and to pose linear models applying significant terms. The models obtained were validated by analysis of variance and they were of help to verify the choice of significant factors by means of DoE and to approximate to the optimization of the preparation method of a Am-241 alpha source by means of contour plots of Delta(1/2) and %R.",10.1007/s10967-019-06952-5
J,"Glushkov, VN; Wilson, S",Parametrisation of the optimised effective potential method based on the Coulson-Fischer wave function for excited states,"This article further develops the Coulson-Fischer formalism in conjunction with the optimised effective potential method [V.N. Glushkov and S. Wilson, Molec. Phys. 110, 149 (2012)] to incorporate both exchange and static correlation effects for excited states having the same symmetry as the ground state. By using this formalism, we compute complete potential energy curves for the ground and first excited states of the molecule and the isoelectronic heteronuclear ion. Effective potentials are generated in according to a novel density functional theory [A.K. Theophilou, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 074104 (2018)] in which the Kohn-Sham (KS) like potential has spherical symmetry around each nucleus. In this way, the inconsistencies of standard density functional theory concerning the asymmetry of the KS potential are remedied. In our implementation, an effective potential which satisfies this requirement is expressed as a direct mapping of the external potential. Different approximations for the effective potentials are investigated. It is shown that applications of the proposed formalism support good agreement with the exact Coulson-Fischer theory for both the ground and first excited state potential energy curves and thus a qualitatively correct description of dissociation.

The direct correlation function of a hardcore potential is assumed to be represented by A Mayer function instead of THE one used in the Random Phase Approximation and Mean Spherical Approximation. Correcting the unphysical behaviour of the corresponding pair correlation function in the hardcore region will give rise to a new perturbation theory as a natural generalisation of the Optimised Random Phase Approximation. To assess its accuracy and reliability, the theory is used to find the structure and thermodynamics of hard-core Yukawa fluids.

The electronic structure of native Cu-A sites can be described by a double-potential well with a dominant sigma(u)* ground state in fast equilibrium with a less populated pi(u) ground state. Here, we report a Cu-A mutant in which a lysine was introduced in the axial position. This results in a highly unstable protein with a pH-dependent population of the two ground states. Deep analysis of the high-pH form of this variant shows the stabilization of the pi(u) ground state due to direct binding of the Lys residue to the copper center that we attribute to deprotonation of this residue.",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.9b01868

These iron oxide-based materials were obtained by a direct plasma-dynamic synthesis with supersonic outflow of an iron-containing electric discharge plasma into an oxygen atmosphere. Subsequently, they were used as an initial precursor and placed in the plasma-chemical reactor, where the multicomponent C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanostructures were synthesized under the influence of the pulsed electron beam. This method was based on the volume excitation of the reaction gas by a pulsed electron beam in such a way as to control the uniform process implementation in the entire excitation region. The morphology and phase composition of the synthesized C/SixOy/Fe2O3 nanocomposites were studied.

Their surface activities including hydrophile?lipophile balance values (HLB), emulsification properties, foaming properties, critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the minimum surface tension (?CMC) were evaluated. With the increase in ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic in polymeric surfactant, the CMC values of the surfactants decreased, and the emulsification and foaming properties of these surfactants increased, and the HLB values of them decreased. This type of polymeric surfactants was used to disperse single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in water, and their dispersal capacities were comparatively determined by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to quantify the amount of surfactant attached onto the nanotubes. More intuitive image of their dispersion states were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that this type of polymeric surfactants had good dispersion capacity and dispersion stability to SWCNTs in water through strong hydrophobic attraction and weak van der Waals interactions.",10.1080/01932691.2018.1534592
J,"Abatti, L; Vieira, ER; Crespo, JD",Thermal evaluation of rubber compounds containing pecan nutshell powder for tire treads,"This work presents the thermal study of rubber compositions with the addition of pecan nutshell powder, which is renewable and environmentally friendly, as a replacement for carbon black in treads for tires. Pecan nutshell is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and their quantity was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TG) through the step-and-hold method. Thermal stability of the samples with pecan nutshell was verified by TG compared with the sample with only carbon black. The value of tan delta evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis in the specific temperature values indicates the wet traction and rolling resistance for tires. Higher tan delta at 0 degrees C was observed in the samples containing pecan nutshell, which indicates better wet traction; however, the higher results observed at 60 degrees C indicate a worst rolling resistance. Results of oxidation induction time, by differential scanning calorimetry, show that the oxidation time increased with the addition of pecan nutshell in the compounds, indicating better antioxidant properties, justified by the presence of lignin.",10.1007/s10973-019-08833-1

J,"Allahi, A; Fathi, MB; Mohajerani, E",The dominant molecular orbitals contributing into absorption peaks of an organic light-emitting molecule,"The dominant molecular orbitals (MO) making roles in electronic transitions responsible for optical processes in an OLED molecule are investigated. Whole molecule transition during absorption of stimulus light in such devices are commonly described first-principally as a summation of electronic transitions between several MOs. Time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can determine the percent of each electronic transition contributing into a specific molecular transition between ground and excited states. This scheme, however, ignores electronic correlation during the transitions, which of crucial importance for correcting the difference energies between MO levels. This electron-hole interaction energy can be recovered considering every peak of absorption spectrum of the molecule to one single electronic transition between two specific MOs. The corresponding single-excited molecular orbitals (SEMO) are employed to calculate the intensities of absorption peaks of a well-known OLED molecule Alq(3). First, TDDFT is used to simulate the molecule and to obtain its MOs and it is shown that TDDFT is capable to track the dominant electronic transitions and their specific MOs responsible for the optical process, and so, it provides a reliable basis for calculations of SEMO. The SEMO is then applied on MOs contributing dominantly in each absorption peak of the molecule. The calculations, performed within this scheme, move the computational curve excellently closer to experimental measurement of the absorption peaks.",10.1016/j.jpcs.2019.109092
