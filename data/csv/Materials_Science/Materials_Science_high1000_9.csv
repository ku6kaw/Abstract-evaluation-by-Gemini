J,"Fürstner, R; Barthlott, W; Neinhuis, C; Walzel, P",Wetting and self-cleaning properties of artificial superhydrophobic surfaces,"The wetting and the self-cleaning properties (the latter is often called the ""Lotus-Effect"") of three types of superhydrophobic surfaces have been investigated: silicon wafer specimens with different regular arrays of spikes hydrophobized by chemical treatment, replicates of water-repellent leaves of plants, and commercially available metal foils which were additionally hydrophobized by means of a fluorinated agent. Water droplets rolled off easily from those silicon samples which had a microstructure consisting of rather slender spikes with narrow pitches. Such samples could be cleaned almost completely from artificial particulate contaminations by a fog consisting of water droplets (diameter range, 8-20 mum). Some metal foils and some replicates had two levels of roughening. Because of this, a complete removal of all particles was not possible using artificial fog. However, water drops with some amount of kinetic impact energy were able to clean these surfaces perfectly. A substrate where pronounced structures in the range below 5 mum were lacking could not be cleaned by means of fog because this treatment resulted in a continuous water film on the samples.",10.1021/la0401011
J,"Brincker, R; Zhang, LM; Andersen, P",Modal identification of output-only systems using frequency domain decomposition,"In this paper a new frequency domain technique is introduced for the modal identification of output-only systems, i.e. in the case where the modal parameters must be estimated without knowing the input exciting the system. By its user friendliness the technique is closely related to the classical approach where the modal parameters are estimated by simple peak picking. However, by introducing a decomposition of the spectral density function matrix, the response spectra can be separated into a set of single degree of freedom systems, each corresponding to an individual mode. By using this decomposition technique close modes can be identified with high accuracy even in the case of strong noise contamination of the signals. Also, the technique clearly indicates harmonic components in the response signals.",10.1088/0964-1726/10/3/303

The devices are typically fabricated using condensed or mesoporous TiO2 as the electron transport layer and 2,2'7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-dip-methoxyphenylamine)9,9'-spirobifluorene as the hole transport layer. However, the high-temperature processing (450 degrees C) requirement of the TiO2 layer could hinder the widespread adoption of the technology. In this report, we adopted a low-temperature processing technique to attain high-efficiency devices in both rigid and flexible substrates, using device structure substrate/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3-x)Cl(x)/PCBM/Al, where PEDOT:PSS and PCBM are used as hole and electron transport layers, respectively. Mixed halide perovskite, CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3-x)Cl(x) was used due to its long carrier lifetime and good electrical properties. All of these layers are solution-processed under 120 degrees C. Based on the proposed device structure, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.5% is obtained in rigid substrates (glass/ITO), and a 9.2% PCE is achieved for a polyethylene terephthalate/ITO flexible substrate.",10.1021/nn406020d

J,"Yu, DS; Goh, K; Wang, H; Wei, L; Jiang, WC; Zhang, Q; Dai, LM; Chen, Y",Scalable synthesis of hierarchically structured carbon nanotube-graphene fibres for capacitive energy storage,"Micro-supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices that can complement or even replace batteries in miniaturized portable electronics and microelectromechanical systems. Their main limitation, however, is the low volumetric energy density when compared with batteries. Here, we describe a hierarchically structured carbon microfibre made of an interconnected network of aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes with interposed nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide sheets. The nanomaterials form mesoporous structures of large specific surface area (396 m(2) g(-1)) and high electrical conductivity (102 S cm(-1)). We develop a scalable method to continuously produce the fibres using a silica capillary column functioning as a hydrothermal microreactor. The resultant fibres show a specific volumetric capacity as high as 305 F cm(-3) in sulphuric acid (measured at 73.5 mA cm(-3) in a three-electrode cell) or 300 F cm(-3) in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/H3PO4 electrolyte (measured at 26.7 mA cm(-3) in a two-electrode cell). A full micro-supercapacitor with PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte, free from binder, current collector and separator, has a volumetric energy density of similar to 6.3 mWh cm(-3) (a value comparable to that of 4 V-500 mu Ah thin-film lithium batteries) while maintaining a power density more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of batteries, as well as a long cycle life. To demonstrate that our fibre-based, all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors can be easily integrated into miniaturized flexible devices, we use them to power an ultraviolet photodetector and a light-emitting diode.",10.1038/NNANO.2014.93

The model assumes a stationary alpha/gamma interface, and requires a uniform chemical potential for carbon, but not iron, in the two phases, leading to a metastable equilibrium condition identified here as ""constrained paraequilibrium"" or CPE. The model is explained with example calculations showing the characteristics of the constrained paraequilibrium condition, and applications are discussed with respect to new microstructures and processes, including a new ""quenching and partitioning,"" or Q&P process, to create mixtures of carbon-depleted martensite, and carbon-enriched retained austenite.

J,"Notomi, M",Theory of light propagation in strongly modulated photonic crystals: Refractionlike behavior in the vicinity of the photonic band gap,"Although light propagation in weakly modulated photonic crystals is basically similar to propagation in a diffraction grating in which conventional refractive index loses its meaning, we demonstrate that light propagation in strongly modulated two-dimensional (2D)/3D photonic crystals becomes refractionlike in the vicinity of the photonic bandgap. Such a crystal behaves as a material having an effective refractive index controllable by the band structure. This situation is analogous to the effective-mass approximation id electron-band theory. By utilizing this phenomenon, negatively refractive material can be realized, which has interesting optical properties such as mirror-image refraction.",10.1103/PhysRevB.62.10696

Inspired by the efficiency of the brain, CMOS-based neural architectures(3) and memristors(4,5) are being developed for pattern recognition and machine learning. However, the volatility, design complexity and high supply voltages for CMOS architectures, and the stochastic and energy-costly switching of memristors complicate the path to achieve the interconnectivity, information density, and energy efficiency of the brain using either approach. Here we describe an electrochemical neuromorphic organic device (ENODe) operating with a fundamentally different mechanism from existing memristors. ENODe switches at low voltage and energy (<10 pJ for 10(3) mu m(2) devices), displays >500 distinct, non-volatile conductance states within a similar to 1V range, and achieves high classification accuracy when implemented in neural network simulations. Plastic ENODes are also fabricated on flexible substrates enabling the integration of neuromorphic functionality in stretchable electronic systems(6,7). Mechanical flexibility makes ENODes compatible with three-dimensional architectures, opening a path towards extreme interconnectivity comparable to the human brain.",10.1038/NMAT4856
J,"Sivanantham, A; Ganesan, P; Shanmugam, S",Hierarchical NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> Nanowire Arrays Supported on Ni Foam: An Efficient and Durable Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Oxygen and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions,"A recent approach for solar-to-hydrogen generation has been water electrolysis using efficient, stable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts within strong electrolytes. Herein, the direct growth of 1D NiCo2S4 nanowire (NW) arrays on a 3D Ni foam (NF) is described. This NiCo2S4 NW/NF array functions as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting with excellent activity and stability. The 3D-Ni foam facilitates the directional growth, exposing more active sites of the catalyst for electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The binder-free, self-made NiCo2S4 NW/NF electrode delivers a hydrogen production current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 260 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and at 210 mV (versus a reversible hydrogen electrode) for the hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH. This highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst enables the preparation of an alkaline water electrolyzer that could deliver 10 mA cm(-2) under a cell voltage of 1.63 V. Because the nonprecious-metal NiCo2S4 NW/NF foam-based electrodes afford the vigorous and continuous evolution of both H-2 and O-2 at 1.68 V, generated using a solar panel, they appear to be promising water splitting devices for large-scale solar-to-hydrogen generation.",10.1002/adfm.201600566
J,"Nie, JF",Precipitation and Hardening in Magnesium Alloys,"Magnesium alloys have received an increasing interest in the past 12 years for potential applications in the automotive, aircraft, aerospace, and electronic industries. Many of these alloys are strong because of solid-state precipitates that are produced by an age-hardening process. Although some strength improvements of existing magnesium alloys have been made and some novel alloys with improved strength have been developed, the strength level that has been achieved so far is still substantially lower than that obtained in counterpart aluminum alloys. Further improvements in the alloy strength require a better understanding of the structure, morphology, orientation of precipitates, effects of precipitate morphology, and orientation on the strengthening and microstructural factors that are important in controlling the nucleation and growth of these precipitates. In this review, precipitation in most precipitation-hardenable magnesium alloys is reviewed, and its relationship with strengthening is examined. It is demonstrated that the precipitation phenomena in these alloys, especially in the very early stage of the precipitation process, are still far from being well understood, and many fundamental issues remain unsolved even after some extensive and concerted efforts made in the past 12 years. The challenges associated with precipitation hardening and age hardening are identified and discussed, and guidelines are outlined for the rational design and development of higher strength, and ultimately ultrahigh strength, magnesium alloys via precipitation hardening.",10.1007/s11661-012-1217-2

The anisotropy of the function was introduced in the formulation using two linear transformations on the Cauchy stress tensor. It was shown that the accuracy of this new function was similar to that of other recently proposed non-quadratic yield functions. Moreover, it was proved that the function is convex in stress space. A new experiment was proposed to obtain one of the anisotropy coefficients. This new formulation is expected to be particularly suitable for finite element (FE) modeling simulations of sheet forming processes for aluminum alloy sheets. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J,"Ramasubramaniam, A",Large excitonic effects in monolayers of molybdenum and tungsten dichalcogenides,"Quasiparticle band structures and optical properties of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, and WSe2 monolayers are studied using the GW approximation in conjunction with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The inclusion of two-particle excitations in the BSE approach reveals the presence of two strongly bound excitons (A and B) below the quasiparticle absorption onset arising from vertical transitions between a spin-orbit-split valence band and the conduction band at the K point of the Brillouin zone. The transition energies for monolayer MoS2, in particular, are shown to be in excellent agreement with available absorption and photoluminescence measurements. Excitation energies for the remaining monolayers are predicted to lie in the range of 1-2 eV. Systematic trends are identified for quasiparticle band gaps, transition energies, and exciton binding energies within as well as across the Mo and W families of dichalcogenides. Overall, the results suggest that quantum confinement of carriers within monolayers can be exploited in conjunction with chemical composition to tune the optoelectronic properties of layered transition-metal dichalcogenides at the nanoscale.",10.1103/PhysRevB.86.115409
J,"Dickey, MD",Stretchable and Soft Electronics using Liquid Metals,"The use of liquid metals based on gallium for soft and stretchable electronics is discussed. This emerging class of electronics is motivated, in part, by the new opportunities that arise from devices that have mechanical properties similar to those encountered in the human experience, such as skin, tissue, textiles, and clothing. These types of electronics (e.g., wearable or implantable electronics, sensors for soft robotics, e-skin) must operate during deformation. Liquid metals are compelling materials for these applications because, in principle, they are infinitely deformable while retaining metallic conductivity. Liquid metals have been used for stretchable wires and interconnects, reconfigurable antennas, soft sensors, self-healing circuits, and conformal electrodes. In contrast to Hg, liquid metals based on gallium have low toxicity and essentially no vapor pressure and are therefore considered safe to handle. Whereas most liquids bead up to minimize surface energy, the presence of a surface oxide on these metals makes it possible to pattern them into useful shapes using a variety of techniques, including fluidic injection and 3D printing. In addition to forming excellent conductors, these metals can be used actively to form memory devices, sensors, and diodes that are completely built from soft materials. The properties of these materials, their applications within soft and stretchable electronics, and future opportunities and challenges are considered.",10.1002/adma.201606425

ZnO was prepared by the base hydrolysis of zinc acetate in a 2-propanol medium and also by a precipitation method using Zn(NO3)(2) and NaOH. The products were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Bacteriological tests such as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk diffusion were performed in Luria-Bertani and nutrient agar media on solid agar plates and in liquid broth systems using different concentrations of ZnO by a standard microbial method for the first time. Our bacteriological study showed the enhanced biocidal activity of ZnO nanoparticles compared with bulk ZnO in repeated experiments. This demonstrated that the bactericidal efficacy of ZnO nanoparticles increases with decreasing particle size.

J,"Chen, WT; Zhu, AY; Sanjeev, V; Khorasaninejad, M; Shi, ZJ; Lee, E; Capasso, F",A broadband achromatic metalens for focusing and imaging in the visible,"A key goal of metalens research is to achieve wavefront shaping of light using optical elements with thicknesses on the order of the wavelength. Such miniaturization is expected to lead to compact, nanoscale optical devices with applications in cameras, lighting, displays and wearable optics. However, retaining functionality while reducing device size has proven particularly challenging. For example, so far there has been no demonstration of broadband achromatic metalenses covering the entire visible spectrum. Here, we show that by judicious design of nanofins on a surface, it is possible to simultaneously control the phase, group delay and group delay dispersion of light, thereby achieving a transmissive achromatic metalens with large bandwidth. We demonstrate diffraction-limited achromatic focusing and achromatic imaging from 470 to 670 nm. Our metalens comprises only a single layer of nanostructures whose thickness is on the order of the wavelength, and does not involve spatial multiplexing or cascading. While this initial design (numerical aperture of 0.2) has an efficiency of about 20% at 500 nm, we discuss ways in which our approach may be further optimized to meet the demand of future applications.",10.1038/s41565-017-0034-6

Ultrafine-grained (UFG) bulk materials were fabricated through cryomilling, degassing, hot isostatic pressing and extrusion, followed by a subsequent heat treatment. The mechanical behavior and microstructure of the materials were analyzed and compared directly to the coarse-grained (CG) counterpart. Three-dimensional atom-probe tomography was utilized to investigate the intermetallic precipitates and oxide dispersoids formed in the as-extruded UFG material. UFG 7075 exhibits higher strength than the CG 7075 alloy for each equivalent condition. After a T6 temper, the yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of UFG 7075 achieved 734 and 774 MPa, respectively, which are similar to 120 MPa higher than those of the CG equivalent. The strength of as-extruded UFG 7075 (YS: 583 MPa, UTS: 631 MPa) is even higher than that of commercial 7075-T6. More importantly, the strengthening mechanisms in each material were established quantitatively for the first time for this complex precipitation-strengthened system, accounting for grain-boundary, dislocation, solid-solution, precipitation and oxide dispersoid strengthening contributions.

A 3D TDS is not only a bulk analogue of graphene; it also exhibits non-trivial topology in its electronic structure that shares similarities with topological insulators. Moreover, a TDS can potentially be driven into other exotic phases (such as Weyl semimetals(1,7), axion insulators(1,4) and topological superconductors(8,9)), making it a unique parent compound for the study of these states and the phase transitions between them. Here, by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe a pair of 3D Dirac fermions in Cd3As2, proving that it is a model 3D TDS. Compared with other 3D TDSs, for example, beta-cristobalite BiO2 (ref. 3) and Na3Bi (refs 4,5), Cd3As2 is stable and has much higher Fermi velocities.

The construction materials industry is under increasing pressure to reduce the energy used in production of Portland cement clinker and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Further, Portland cement is not the ideal binder for all construction applications, as it suffers from durability problems in particularly aggressive environments. Several alternative binders have been available for almost as long as Portland cement, yet have not been extensively used, and new ones are being developed. In this paper, four promising binders available as alternatives to Portland cement are discussed, namely calcium aluminate cement, calcium sulfoaluminate cement, alkali-activated binders, and supersulfated cements.

Gold nanoparticles were chosen as model substances as they are used in several medical applications. In addition, the detection of the presence of gold is feasible with no background levels in the body in the normal situation. Rats were intravenously injected in the tail vein with gold nanoparticles with a diameter of 10, 50, 100 and 250 nm, respectively. After 24 h, the rats were sacrificed and blood and various organs were collected for gold determination. The presence of gold was measured quantitatively with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For all gold nanoparticle sizes the majority of the gold was demonstrated to be present in liver and spleen. A clear difference was observed between the distribution of the 10 rum particles and the larger particles. The 10 rum particles were present in various organ systems including blood, liver, spleen, kidney, testis, thymus, heart, lung and brain, whereas the larger particles were only detected in blood, liver and spleen.

J,"Tang, ZY; Kotov, NA; Magonov, S; Ozturk, B",Nanostructured artificial nacre,"Finding a synthetic pathway to artificial analogs of nacre and bones represents a fundamental milestone in the development of composite materials. The ordered brick-and-mortar arrangement of organic and inorganic layers is believed to be the most essential strength- and toughness-determining structural feature of nacre. It has also been found that the ionic crosslinking of tightly folded macromolecules is equally important. Here, we demonstrate that both structural features can be reproduced by sequential deposition of polyelectrolytes and clays. This simple process results in a nanoscale version of nacre with alternating organic and inorganic layers. The macromolecular folding effect reveals itself in the unique saw-tooth pattern of differential stretching curves attributed to the gradual breakage of ionic crosslinks in polyelectrolyte chains. The tensile strength of the prepared multilayers approached that of nacre, whereas their ultimate Young modulus was similar to that of lamellar bones.

Although recent reports on cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries have demonstrated performances comparable to their lithium-ion counterparts, the major scientific challenge for a competitive sodium-ion battery technology is to develop viable anode materials. Here we show that a hybrid material made out of a few phosphorene layers sandwiched between graphene layers shows a specific capacity of 2,440 mA h g(-1) (calculated using the mass of phosphorus only) at a current density of 0.05 A g(-1) and an 83% capacity retention after 100 cycles while operating between 0 and 1.5 V. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy and ex situ X-ray diffraction techniques, we explain the large capacity of our anode through a dual mechanism of intercalation of sodium ions along the x axis of the phosphorene layers followed by the formation of a Na3P alloy. The presence of graphene layers in the hybrid material works as a mechanical backbone and an electrical highway, ensuring that a suitable elastic buffer space accommodates the anisotropic expansion of phosphorene layers along the y and z axial directions for stable cycling operation.",10.1038/NNANO.2015.194

The techniques reported here allow transfer onto three different classes of substrates: substrates covered with shallow depressions, perforated substrates, and flat substrates. A novel dry, transfer technique was used to make graphene-sealed microchambers without trapping-liquid inside. The dry transfer technique utilizes a polydimethylsiloxane frame that attaches to the poly(methyl methacrylate) spun over the graphene film, and the monolayer graphene was transferred onto shallow depressions with 300 nm depth. The improved wet transfer onto perforated substrates with 2.7 mu m diameter holes yields 98% coverage of holes covered with continuous films, allowing the ready use of Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to study the intrinsic properties of CVD-grown monolayer graphene.

J,"Agnew, SR; Yoo, MH; Tomé, CN",Application of texture simulation to understanding mechanical behavior of Mg and solid solution alloys containing Li or Y,"The viscoplastic self-consistent model was used to interpret differences in the mechanical behavior of hexagonal close packed magnesium alloys. There are only subtle differences in the compression textures of magnesium and its solid solution alloys containing lithium or yttrium. However, the plane strain compression textures of the alloys showed an increasing tendency for the basal poles to rotate away from the ""normal direction"" towards the ""rolling direction"". Texture simulations enabled these distinctions to be attributed to the increased activity of the non-basal (c + a) slip mode. The alloys had improved compressive ductilities compared to pure magnesium, and the increased c + a slip mode activity provides a satisfying explanation for this improvement, since it can accommodate c-axis compression within individual grains. Accounting for individual deformation mode hardening enabled the flow curves to be simulated and the anisotropic plastic response of textured wrought alloys to be mechanistically understood and predicted.

SAMs presenting a wide range of wettabilities were prepared by mixing two kinds of alkanethiols carrying terminal methyl (CH3) hydroxyl (OH), carboxylic acid (COOH), or amino (NH2) groups. Adhesion behavior of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HeLa cells on these mixed SAMs were examined. The number of adhered HUVECs reached a maximum on CH3/OH mixed SAMs with a water contact angle of 40 degrees, while cell adhesion increased with decreasing water contact angle up to 60-70 degrees and then leveled off on CH3/COOH and CH3/NH2 mixed SAMs. Numbers of adhered HeLa cells showed a maximum on CH3/OH and CH3/COOH mixed SAMs with a water contact angle of 50 degrees. These facts suggest that cell adhesion is mainly determined by surface wettability, but is also affected by the surface functional group, its surface density, and the kinds of cells. The effect of exchange of adsorbed proteins on cell adhesion was also examined. HUVECs were cultured on the mixed SAMs preadsorbed with albumin. Cell adhesion was effectively prohibited on hydrophobic SAMs pretreated with albumin. Albumin strongly adsorbed and resisted replacement by cell adhesive proteins on hydrophobic SAMs. On the other hand, cells adhered to albumin-adsorbed hydrophilic SAW Displacement of preadsorbed albumin with cell adhesive proteins effectively occurs on these hydrophilic SAMs. This effect contributes to induce SAMs with moderate wettability to give suitable surfaces for cell adhesion.

For the reliable and cost-effective design of FRP jackets, an accurate stress-strain model is required for FRP-confined concrete. In this paper, a new design-oriented stress-strain model is proposed for concrete confined by FRP wraps with fibres only or predominantly in the hoop direction based on a careful interpretation of existing test data and observations. This model is simple, so it is suitable for direct use in design, but in the meantime, it captures all the main characteristics of the stress-strain behavior of concrete confined by different types of FRP. In addition, for unconfined concrete, this model reduces directly to idealized stress-strain curves in existing design codes. In the development of this model, a number of important issues including the actual hoop strains in FRP jackets at rupture, the sufficiency of FRP confinement for a significant strength enhancement, and the effect of jacket stiffness on the ultimate axial strain, were all carefully examined and appropriately resolved. The predictions of the model are shown to agree well with test data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/S0950-0618(03)00045-X

The critical particle sizes that determine the superhydrophobicity and the anti-icing property are in two different length scales, The effect of particle size on ice formation is explained by using a classical heterogeneous nucleation theory. This result implies that the anti-icing property of a surface is not directly correlated with the superhydrophobicity, and thus, it is uncertain whether a superhydrophobic surface is anti-icing without detailed knowledge of the surface morphology, The result also opens up possibilities for rational design of anti-icing superhydrophobic surfaces by tuning surface textures in multiple length scales.",10.1021/la902882b

However, both the extent to which extracellular-matrix mechanics affect stem-cell fate in three-dimensional microenvironments and the underlying biophysical mechanisms are unclear. We demonstrate that the commitment of mesenchymal stem-cell populations changes in response to the rigidity of three-dimensional microenvironments, with osteogenesis occurring predominantly at 11-30 kPa. In contrast to previous two-dimensional work, however, cell fate was not correlated with morphology. Instead, matrix stiffness regulated integrin binding as well as reorganization of adhesion ligands on the nanoscale, both of which were traction dependent and correlated with osteogenic commitment of mesenchymal stem-cell populations.

As expected, the surface energies of anatase appear to be related to the presence of undercoordinated Ti atoms: the surfaces with fourfold-coordinated Ti atoms have a larger energy than those with fivefold-coordinated Ti. Furthermore, we find that the average surface energy of a TiO2 anatase macroscopic crystal is smaller than that of rutile. Finally, patterns in the relaxation of the surface atoms which are com;non to different surfaces are analyzed.",10.1103/PhysRevB.63.155409

The caging effect is typically removed by photolysis with ultraviolet light to liberate the bioactive species. Although this technique has been successfully applied to many biological problems, it suffers from a number of intrinsic drawbacks. For example, it requires dedicated efforts to design and synthesize a precursor compound for each effector. The ultraviolet light may cause damage to biological samples and is suitable only for in vitro studies because of its quick attenuation in tissue(4). Here we address these issues by developing a platform based on the photothermal effect of gold nanocages. Gold nanocages represent a class of nanostructures with hollow interiors and porous walls(5). They can have strong absorption (for the photothermal effect) in the near-infrared while maintaining a compact size. When the surface of a gold nanocage is covered with a smart polymer, the pre-loaded effector can be released in a controllable fashion using a near-infrared laser. This system works well with various effectors without involving sophisticated syntheses, and is well suited for in vivo studies owing to the high transparency of soft tissue in the near-infrared region(6).",10.1038/NMAT2564
J,"Hoppe, H; Sariciftci, NS",Morphology of polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells,"Within the different organic photovoltaic devices the conjugated polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunction approach is one of the foci of today's research interest. These devices are highly dependent on the solid state nanoscale morphology of the two components (donor/acceptor) in the photoactive layer. The need for finely phase separated polymer - fullerene blends is expressed by the limited exciton diffusion length present in organic semiconductors. Typical distances that these photo-excitations can travel within a pristine material are around 10 - 20 nm. In an efficient bulk heterojunction the scale of phase separation is therefore closely related to the respective exciton diffusion lengths of the two materials involved. Once the excitons reach the donor/ acceptor interface, the photoinduced charge transfer results in the charge separation. After the charges have been separated they require percolated pathways to the respective charge extracting electrodes in order to supply an external direct current. Thus also an effective charge transport relies on the development of a suitable nanomorphology i.e. bicontinuous interpenetrating phase structures within these blend films. The present feature article combines and summarizes the experimental findings on this nanomorphology - efficiency relationship.",10.1039/b510618b

The feasibility was demonstrated by showing the localization and quantification of the cell uptake of fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles of standard size and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or vitamin E TPGS. Coumarin-6 loaded PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by a modified solvent extraction/evaporation method and characterized by laser light scattering for size and size distribution, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for surface morphology, zeta-potential for surface charge, and spectrofluorometry for fluorescent molecule release from the nanoparticles. The effects of particle size and particle surface coating on the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles were quantified by spectrofluorometric measurement. Cellular uptake of vitamin E TPGS-coated PLGA nanoparticles showed 1.4 folds higher than that of PVA-coated PLGA nanoparticles and 4-6 folds higher than that of nude polystyrene nanoparticles. Images of confocal laser scanning microscopy, cryo-SEM and transmission electron microscopy clearly evidenced the internalization of nanoparticles by the Caco-2 cells, showing that surface modification of PLGA nanoparticles with vitamin E TPGS notably improved the cellular uptake.

Herein, a modified synthetic method is reported for producing high-quality monolayer Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes. Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on monolayer Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes are fabricated and their electronic properties are measured. Individual Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes exhibit a high conductivity of 4600 +/- 1100 S cm(-1) and field-effect electron mobility of 2.6 +/- 0.7 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The resistivity of multilayer Ti(3)C(2)Tx films is only one order of magnitude higher than the resistivity of individual flakes, which indicates a surprisingly good electron transport through the surface terminations of different flakes, unlike in many other 2D materials. Finally, the fabricated FETs are used to investigate the environmental stability and kinetics of oxidation of Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes in humid air. The high-quality Ti(3)C(2)Tx flakes are reasonably stable and remain highly conductive even after their exposure to air for more than 24 h.

An open issue, especially problematic for colour imaging and display applications, is the correction of chromatic aberration, an intrinsic effect originating from the specific resonance and limited working bandwidth of each nanoantenna. As a result, no metalens has demonstrated full-colour imaging in the visible wavelength.

Cell spreading and differentiation were unaffected by polydimethylsiloxane stiffness. However, cells on polyacrylamide of low elastic modulus (0.5 kPa) could not form stable focal adhesions and differentiated as a result of decreased activation of the extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway. The differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells was also unaffected by PDMS stiffness but regulated by the elastic modulus of PAAm. Dextran penetration measurements indicated that polyacrylamide substrates of low elastic modulus were more porous than stiff substrates, suggesting that the collagen anchoring points would be further apart. We then changed collagen crosslink concentration and used hydrogel-nanoparticle substrates to vary anchoring distance at constant substrate stiffness. Lower collagen anchoring density resulted in increased differentiation.

The luminescence quenching temperature is an important parameter, especially in high-power LEDs, but surprisingly no systematic research has been done to measure and understand the temperature quenching of the yellow Ce luminescence in YAG:Ce. Here we report on the luminescence temperature quenching in YAG:Ce. For a wide range of Ce concentrations (between 0.033% and 3.3%) the temperature dependence of the emission intensity and the luminescence lifetimes are reported. The intrinsic quenching temperature of the Ce luminescence is shown to be very high (>700 K). The lower quenching temperatures reported in the literature are explained by thermally activated concentration quenching (for highly doped systems) and the temperature dependence of the oscillator strength (for low doping concentrations). In addition, high-resolution spectra are reported, which provide insight into the position of the zero-phonon transition (20450 cm(-1)), the Stokes shift (2400 cm(-1)), the energy of the dominant phonon mode (200 cm(-1)), and the Huang-Rhys parameter (S = 6).

Electronic logic and memory devices have already been constructed from graphene-MoS2 hybrids(7,8), but they do not make use of the photosensitivity of MoS2, which arises from its optical-range bandgap(9). Here, we demonstrate that graphene-on-MoS2 binary heterostructures display remarkable dual optoelectronic functionality, including highly sensitive photodetection and gate-tunable persistent photoconductivity. The responsivity of the hybrids was found to be nearly 1 x 10(10) A W-1 at 130 K and 5 x 10(8) A W-1 at room temperature, making them the most sensitive graphene-based photodetectors. When subjected to time-dependent photoillumination, the hybrids could also function as a rewritable optoelectronic switch or memory, where the persistent state shows almost no relaxation or decay within experimental timescales, indicating near-perfect charge retention.

J,"Devaraj, S; Munichandraiah, N",Effect of crystallographic structure of MnO<sub>2</sub> on its electrochemical capacitance properties,"MnO2 is currently under extensive investigations for its capacitance properties. MnO2 crystallizes into several crystallographic structures, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and lambda structures. Because these structures differ in the way MnO6 octahedra are interlinked, they possess tunnels or interlayers with gaps of different magnitudes. Because capacitance properties are due to intercalation/deintercalation of protons or cations in MnO2, only some crystallographic structures, which possess sufficient gaps to accommodate these ions, are expected to be useful for capacitance studies. In order to examine the dependence of capacitance on crystal structure, the present study involves preparation of these various crystal phases of MnO2 in nanodimensions and to evaluate their capacitance properties. Results of alpha-MnO2 prepared by a microemulsion route (alpha-MnO2(m)) are also used for comparison. Spherical particles of about 50 nm, nanorods of 30-50 nm in diameter, or interlocked fibers of 10-20 nm in diameters are formed, which depend on the crystal structure and the method of preparation. The specific capacitance (SC) measured for MnO2 is found to depend strongly on the crystallographic structure, and it decreases in the following order: alpha(m) > alpha congruent to 6 > gamma > lambda > beta. A SC value of 297 F g(-1) is obtained for alpha-MnO2(m), whereas it is 9 F g(-1) for beta-MnO2. A wide (-similar to 4.6 angstrom) tunnel size and large surface area of alpha-MnO2(m) are ascribed as favorable factors for its high SC. A large interlayer separation (similar to 7 angstrom) also facilitates insertion of cations in delta-MnO2 resulting in a SC close to 236 F g(-1). A narrow tunnel size (1.89 A) does not allow intercalation of cations into beta-MnO2. As a result, it provides a very small SC.",10.1021/jp7108785

One important aspect of the structural analysis of materials such as zeolites and metal organic frameworks is the investigation of the geometrical parameters describing pores. Here, we present algorithms and tools to efficiently calculate some of these important parameters. Our tools are based on the Voronoi decomposition, which for a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph representation of the void space. The resulting Voronoi network is analyzed to obtain the diameter of the largest included sphere and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters that are frequently used to describe pore geometry. Accessibility of nodes in the network is also determined for a given guest molecule and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible surfaces and volumes. The presented algorithms are implemented in a software tool, Zeo++, which includes a modified version of the Voro++ library. We present example applications of our algorithms and tools using zeolite frameworks currently listed in the Atlas of Zeolite Frameworks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Marmur, A",Wetting on hydrophobic rough surfaces: To be heterogeneous or not to be?,"Equilibrium wetting on rough surfaces is discussed in terms of the ""competition"" between complete liquid penetration into the roughness grooves and entrapment of air bubbles inside the grooves underneath the liquid. The former is the homogeneous wetting regime, usually described by the Wenzel equation. The latter is the heterogeneous wetting regime that is described by the Cassie-Baxter equation. Understanding this ""competition"" is essential for the design of ultrahydrophobic surfaces. The present discussion puts the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter equations into proper mathematical-thermodynamic perspective and defines the conditions for determining the transition between the homogeneous and heterogeneous wetting regimes. In particular, a new condition that is necessary for the existence of the heterogeneous wetting regime is added. It is demonstrated that when this condition is violated, the homogeneous wetting regime is in effect, even though the Cassie-Baxter equation may be satisfied.",10.1021/la0344682

In this regard, the hardly explored compound class of nitridoaluminates affords a new material with superior luminescence properties. Doped with Eu2+, Sr[LiAl3N4] emerged as a new high-performance narrow-band red-emitting phosphor material, which can efficiently be excited by GaN-based blue LEDs. Owing to the highly efficient red emission at lambda(max) similar to 650 nm with a full-width at half-maximum of similar to 1,180 cm(-1) (similar to 50 nm) that shows only very low thermal quenching (>95% relative to the quantum efficiency at 200 degrees C), a prototype phosphor-converted LED (pc-LED), employing Sr[LiAl3N4]:Eu2+ as the red-emitting component, already shows an increase of 14% in luminous efficacy compared with a commercially available high colour rendering index (CRI) LED, together with an excellent colour rendition (R(a)8 = 91, R9 = 57). Therefore, we predict great potential for industrial applications in high-power white pc-LEDs.",10.1038/NMAT4012
J,"Lee, W; Ji, R; Gösele, U; Nielsch, K",Fast fabrication of long-range ordered porous alumina membranes by hard anodization,"Nanoporous anodic aluminium oxide has been widely used for the development of various functional nanostructures. So far these self-organized pore structures could only be prepared within narrow processing conditions. Here we report a new oxalic-acid-based anodization process for long-range ordered alumina membranes. This process is a new generation of the so-called 'hard anodization' approach that has been widely used in industry for high-speed fabrication of mechanically robust, very thick (> 100 mu m) and low-porosity alumina films since the 1960s. This hard anodization approach establishes a new self-ordering regime with interpore distances, (D-int) = 200-300 nm, which have not been achieved by mild anodization processes so far. It offers substantial advantages over conventional anodization processes in terms of processing time, allowing 2,500-3,500% faster oxide growth with improved ordering of the nanopores. Perfectly ordered alumina membranes with high aspect ratios (> 1,000) of uniform nanopores with periodically modulated diameters have been realized.",10.1038/nmat1717

Previously, perovskite/silicon tandems were limited by significant parasitic absorption and poor environmental stability. Here, we improve the efficiency of monolithic, two-terminal, 1-cm(2) perovskite/silicon tandems to 23.6% by combining an infrared-tuned silicon heterojunction bottom cell with the recently developed caesium formamidinium lead halide perovskite. This more-stable perovskite tolerates deposition of a tin oxide buffer layer via atomic layer deposition that prevents shunts, has negligible parasitic absorption, and allows for the sputter deposition of a transparent top electrode. Furthermore, the window layer doubles as a diffusion barrier, increasing the thermal and environmental stability to enable perovskite devices that withstand a 1,000-hour damp heat test at 85 degrees C and 85% relative humidity.",10.1038/nenergy.2017.9
J,"Zhuang, LH; Ge, L; Yang, YS; Li, MR; Jia, Y; Yao, XD; Zhu, ZH",Ultrathin Iron-Cobalt Oxide Nanosheets with Abundant Oxygen Vacancies for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction,"Electrochemical water splitting is a promising method for storing light/electrical energy in the form of H-2 fuel; however, it is limited by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To improve the accessibility of H-2 production, it is necessary to develop an efficient OER catalyst with large surface area, abundant active sites, and good stability, through a low-cost fabrication route. Herein, a facile solution reduction method using NaBH4 as a reductant is developed to prepare iron-cobalt oxide nanosheets (FexCoy-ONSs) with a large specific surface area (up to 261.1 m(2) g(-1)), ultrathin thickness (1.2 nm), and, importantly, abundant oxygen vacancies. The mass activity of Fe1Co1-ONS measured at an overpotential of 350 mV reaches up to 54.9 A g(-1), while its Tafel slope is 36.8 mV dec(-1); both of which are superior to those of commercial RuO2, crystalline Fe1Co1-ONP, and most reported OER catalysts. The excellent OER catalytic activity of Fe1Co1-ONS can be attributed to its specific structure, e.g., ultrathin nanosheets that could facilitate mass diffusion/transport of OH-ions and provide more active sites for OER catalysis, and oxygen vacancies that could improve electronic conductivity and facilitate adsorption of H2O onto nearby Co3+ sites.",10.1002/adma.201606793
J,"Neaton, JB; Ederer, C; Waghmare, UV; Spaldin, NA; Rabe, KM",First-principles study of spontaneous polarization in multiferroic BiFeO<sub>3</sub> -: art. no. 014113,"The ground-state structural and electronic properties of ferroelectric BiFeO3 are calculated using density functional theory within the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) and the LSDA+U method. The crystal structure is computed to be rhombohedral with space group R3c, and the electronic structure is found to be insulating and antiferromagnetic, both in excellent agreement with available experiments. A large ferroelectric polarization of 90-100 muC/cm(2) is predicted, consistent with the large atomic displacements in the ferroelectric phase and with recent experimental reports, but differing by an order of magnitude from early experiments. One possible explanation is that the latter may have suffered from large leakage currents. However, both past and contemporary measurements are shown to be consistent with the modern theory of polarization, suggesting that the range of reported polarizations may instead correspond to distinct switching paths in structural space. Modern measurements on well-characterized bulk samples are required to confirm this interpretation.",10.1103/PhysRevB.71.014113
J,"Er, DQ; Li, JW; Naguib, M; Gogotsi, Y; Shenoy, VB","Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene as a High Capacity Electrode Material for Metal (Li, Na, K, Ca) Ion Batteries","Two-dimensional (2-D) materials are capable of handling high rates of charge in batteries since metal ions do not need to diffuse in a 3-D lattice structure. However, graphene, which is the most well-studied 2-D material, is known to have no Li capacity. Here, adsorption of Li, as well as Na, K, and Ca, on Ti3C2, one representative MXene, is predicted by first-principles density functional calculations. In our study, we observed that these alkali atoms exhibit different adsorption energies depending on the coverage. The adsorption energies of Na, K, and Ca decrease as coverage increases, while Li shows little sensitivity to variance in coverage. This observed relationship between adsorption energies and coverage of alkali ions on Ti3C2 can be explained by their effective ionic radii. A larger effective ionic radius increases interaction between alkali atoms, thus lower coverage is obtained. Our calculated capacities for Li, Na, K, and Ca on Ti3C2 are 447.8, 351.8, 191.8, and 319.8 mAh/g respectively. Compared to materials currently used in high-rate Li and Na ion battery anodes, MXene shows promise in increasing overall battery performance.",10.1021/am501144q
