J,"Brow, RK",Review: the structure of simple phosphate glasses,"Recent developments of phosphate glasses for a variety of technological applications, from rare-earth ion hosts for solid state lasers to low temperature sealing glasses, have led to renewed interest in understanding the structures of these unusual materials. In this review, spectroscopic and diffraction studies of simple phosphate glasses, including v-P2O5 and binary phosphate compositions, are described. Special attention is given to the structures of anhydrous ultra-phosphate glasses, which have received close attention from the glass community only in the past six years.

J,"Kim, HS; Gibbs, ZM; Tang, YL; Wang, H; Snyder, GJ",Characterization of Lorenz number with Seebeck coefficient measurement,"In analyzing zT improvements due to lattice thermal conductivity (kappa(L)) reduction, electrical conductivity (sigma) and total thermal conductivity (kappa(Total)) are often used to estimate the electronic component of the thermal conductivity (kappa(E)) and in turn kappa(L) from kappa(L) = similar to kappa(Total) - L sigma T. TheWiedemann-Franz law, kappa(E) = L sigma T, where L is Lorenz number, is widely used to estimate kappa(E) from sigma measurements. It is a common practice to treat L as a universal factor with 2.44 x 10(-8) W Omega K-2 (degenerate limit). However, significant deviations from the degenerate limit (approximately 40% or more for Kane bands) are known to occur for non-degenerate semiconductors where L converges to 1.5 x 10(-8) W Omega K-2 for acoustic phonon scattering. The decrease in L is correlated with an increase in thermopower (absolute value of Seebeck coefficient (S)). Thus, a first order correction to the degenerate limit of L can be based on the measured thermopower, vertical bar S vertical bar, independent of temperature or doping. We propose the equation: L = 1.5 + exp [ -vertical bar S vertical bar/116] (where L is in 10(-8) W Omega K-2 and S in mu V/K) as a satisfactory approximation for L. This equation is accurate within 5% for single parabolic band/acoustic phonon scattering assumption and within 20% for PbSe, PbS, PbTe, Si0.8Ge0.2 where more complexity is introduced, such as non-parabolic Kane bands, multiple bands, and/or alternate scattering mechanisms. The use of this equation for L rather than a constant value (when detailed band structure and scattering mechanism is not known) will significantly improve the estimation of lattice thermal conductivity.

J,"Stoimenov, PK; Klinger, RL; Marchin, GL; Klabunde, KJ",Metal oxide nanoparticles as bactericidal agents,"Reactive magnesium oxide nanoparticles and halogen (Cl-2, Br-2) adducts of these MgO particles were allowed to contact certain bacteria and spore cells. Bacteriological test data, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, and electron microscopy (TEM) images are provided, which yield insight into the biocidal action of these nanoscale materials. The tests show that these materials are very effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as spores. zeta-Potential measurements show an attractive interaction between the MgO nanoparticles and bacteria and spore cells, which is confirmed by confocal microscopy images. The AFM studies illustrate considerable changes in the cell membranes upon treatment, resulting in the death of the cells. TEM micrographs confirm these results and supply additional information about the processes inside the cells. Overall, the results presented illustrate that dry powder nanoparticulate formulations as well as water slurries are effective. It is proposed that abrasiveness, basic character, electrostatic attraction, and oxidizing power (due to the presence of active halogen) combine to promote these biocidal properties.",10.1021/la0202374
J,"Gref, R; Lück, M; Quellec, P; Marchand, M; Dellacherie, E; Harnisch, S; Blunk, T; Müller, RH",'Stealth' corona-core nanoparticles surface modified by polyethylene glycol (PEG):: influences of the corona (PEG chain length and surface density) and of the core composition on phagocytic uptake and plasma protein adsorption,"Nanoparticles possessing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains on their surface have been described as blood persistent drug delivery system with potential applications for intravenous drug administration. Considering the importance of protein interactions with injected colloidal dug carriers with regard to their in vivo fate, we analysed plasma protein adsorption onto biodegradable PEG-coated poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles employing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). A series of corona/core nanoparticles of sizes 160-270 nm were prepared from diblock PEG-PLA, PEG-PLGA and PEG-PCL and from PEG-PLA:PLA blends. The PEG Mw was varied from 2000-20 000 g/mole and the particles were prepared using different PEG contents. It was thus possible to study the influence of the PEG corona thickness and density, as well as the influence of the nature of the core (PLA, PLGA or PCL), on the competitive plasma protein adsorption, zeta potential and particle uptake by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells. 2-D PAGE studies showed that plasma protein adsorption on PEG-coated PLA nanospheres strongly depends on the PEG molecular weight (Mw) (i.e. PEG chain length at the particle surface) as well as on the PEG content in the particles (i.e. PEG chain density at the surface of the particles). Whatever the thickness or the density of the corona, the qualitative composition of the plasma protein adsorption patterns was very similar, showing that adsorption was governed by interaction with a PLA surface protected more or less by PEG chains. The main spots on the gels were albumin, fibrinogen, IgG, Ig light chains, and the apolipoproteins apoA-I and apoE. For particles made of PEG-PLA45K with different PEG Mw, a maximal reduction in protein adsorption was found for a PEG Mw of 5000 g/mole. For nanospheres differing in their PEG content from 0.5 to 20 wt %, a PEG content between 2 and 5 wt % was determined as a threshold value for optimal protein resistance. When increasing the PEG content in the nanoparticles above 5 wt % no further reduction in protein adsorption was achieved. Phagocytosis by PMN studied using chemiluminescence and zeta potential data agreed well with these findings: the same PEG surface density threshold was found to ensure simultaneously efficient steric stabilization and to avoid the uptake by PMN cells. Supposing all the PEG chains migrate to the surface, this would correspond to a distance of about 1.5 nm between two terminally attached PEG chains in the covering 'brush'. Particles from PEG5K-PLA45K, PEG5K-PLGA45K; and PEG5K-PCL45K copolymers enabled to study the influence of the core on plasma protein adsorption, all other parameters (corona thickness and density) being kept constant. Adsorption patterns were in good qualitative agreement with each other. Only a few protein species were exclusively present just on one type of nanoparticle. However, the extent of proteins adsorbed differed in a large extent from one particle to another. In vivo studies could help elucidating the role of the type and amount of proteins adsorbed on the fate of the nanoparticles after intraveinous administration, as a function of the nature of their core. These results could be useful in the design of long circulating intravenously injectable biodegradable drug carriers endowed with protein resistant properties and low phagocytic uptake.

Yet the lack of a general approach to rapidly construct such networks remains a major challenge for 3D tissue culture(2-4). Here, we printed rigid 3D filament networks of carbohydrate glass, and used them as a cytocompatible sacrificial template in engineered tissues containing living cells to generate cylindrical networks that could be lined with endothelial cells and perfused with blood under high-pressure pulsatile flow. Because this simple vascular casting approach allows independent control of network geometry, endothelialization and extravascular tissue, it is compatible with a wide variety of cell types, synthetic and natural extracellular matrices, and crosslinking strategies. We also demonstrated that the perfused vascular channels sustained the metabolic function of primary rat hepatocytes in engineered tissue constructs that otherwise exhibited suppressed function in their core.",10.1038/NMAT3357

J,"Pei, SF; Zhao, JP; Du, JH; Ren, WC; Cheng, HM",Direct reduction of graphene oxide films into highly conductive and flexible graphene films by hydrohalic acids,"We report a simple but highly-effective hydrohalic acid reducing method to reduce graphene oxide (GO) films into highly conductive graphene films without destroying their integrity and flexibility at low temperature based on the nucleophilic substitution reaction. GO films reduced for 1 h at 100 degrees C in 55% hydroiodic (HI) acid have an electrical conductivity as high as 298 S/cm and a C/O ratio above 12, both of which are much higher than films reduced by other chemical methods. The reduction maintains good integrity and flexibility, and even improves the strength and ductility, of the original GO films. Based on this reducing method, a flexible graphene-based transparent conductive film with a sheet resistance of 1.6 k Omega/sq and 85% transparency was obtained, further verifying the advantage of HI acid reduction.

J,"De, S; Higgins, TM; Lyons, PE; Doherty, EM; Nirmalraj, PN; Blau, WJ; Boland, JJ; Coleman, JN","Silver Nanowire Networks as Flexible, Transparent, Conducting Films: Extremely High DC to Optical Conductivity Ratios","We have used aqueous dispersions of silver nanowires to prepare thin, flexible, transparent, conducting films. The nanowires are of length and diameter close to 6.5 mu m and 85 nm, respectively. At low thickness, the films consist of networks but appear to become bulk-like for mean film thicknesses above similar to 160 nm. These films can be very transparent with optical transmittance reaching as high as 92% for low thickness. The transmittance (550 nm) decreases with increasing thickness, consistent with an optical conductivity of 6472 S/m. The films are also very uniform; the transmittance varies spatially by typically <2%. The sheet resistance decreases with increasing thickness, falling below 1 Omega/square for thicknesses above 300 nm. The DC conductivity increases from 2 x 101 S/m for very thin films before saturating at 5 X 106 S/m for thicker films. Similarly, the ratio of DC to optical conductivity increases with increasing thickness from 25 for the thinnest films, saturating at similar to 500 for thicknesses above similar to 160 nm. We believe this Is the highest conductivity ratio ever observed for nanostructured films and is matched only by doped metal oxide films. These nanowire films are electromechanically very robust, with all but the thinnest films showing no change in sheet resistance when flexed over >1000 cycles. Such results make these films ideal as replacements for indium tin oxide as transparent electrodes. We have prepared films with optical transmittance and sheet resistance of 85% and 13 Omega/square, respectively. This is very close to that displayed by commercially available indium tin oxide.",10.1021/nn900348c
J,"Ohno, T; Hasegawa, T; Tsuruoka, T; Terabe, K; Gimzewski, JK; Aono, M",Short-term plasticity and long-term potentiation mimicked in single inorganic synapses,"Memory is believed to occur in the human brain as a result of two types of synaptic plasticity: short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP; refs 1-4). In neuromorphic engineering(5,6), emulation of known neural behaviour has proven to be difficult to implement in software because of the highly complex interconnected nature of thought processes. Here we report the discovery of a Ag2S inorganic synapse, which emulates the synaptic functions of both STP and LTP characteristics through the use of input pulse repetition time. The structure known as an atomic switch(7,8), operating at critical voltages, stores information as STP with a spontaneous decay of conductance level in response to intermittent input stimuli, whereas frequent stimulation results in a transition to LTP. The Ag2S inorganic synapse has interesting characteristics with analogies to an individual biological synapse, and achieves dynamic memorization in a single device without the need of external preprogramming. A psychological model related to the process of memorizing and forgetting is also demonstrated using the inorganic synapses. Our Ag2S element indicates a breakthrough in mimicking synaptic behaviour essential for the further creation of artificial neural systems that emulate characteristics of human memory.",10.1038/NMAT3054

The stability of the materials with respect to the most common solvents, acids, and bases is determined by combining XRPD and TGA/MS techniques. The structures of the two forms of UiO-66 are refined through an interactive XRPD/EXAFS approach and validated by ab initio calculations. Experimental and calculated IR spectra are reported and compared to enlighten the nature of vibrational modes upon dehydroxylation and to show the complete reversibility of the dehydration/hydration phenomenon. Experimental and calculated band gaps are also reported and compared. In this work, we show the necessity to combine, in a synergic way, different experimental techniques and periodic ab initio approaches to disclose and fully understand the nature of complex novel materials such as UiO-66 on structural, vibrational, and electronic grounds. The correct structure refinement could not be possible using one of these three approaches alone, in particular, XRPD data were unable to detect an important distortion of the Zr6O6 units of the dehydrated material that was, however, foreseen in the ab initio calculations and measured in the EXAFS spectra.",10.1021/cm1022882

They are fabricated according to different processing routes (chemical vapor infiltration, polymer impregnation/pyrolysis, liquid silicon infiltration or slurry impregnation/hot pressing) each of them displaying advantages and drawbacks which are briefly discussed. SiC-matrix composites are highly tailorable materials in terms of fiber-type (carbon fibers of SiC-based fibers such as Si-C-O, SiC + C or quasi-stoichiometric SiC reinforcements), interphase (pyrocarbon or hexagonal BN, as well as (PyC-SiC)(n) or (BN SiC)(n) multilayered interphases), matrix (simple SiC or matrices with improved oxidation resistance, such as self-healing matrices) and coatings (SiC or engineered multilayered coatings).

Here we report a low-temperature, environmentally benign, solution-based approach for the preparation of complex and oriented ZnO nanostructures, and the systematic modification of their crystal morphology. Using controlled seeded growth and citrate anions that selectively adsorb on ZnO basal planes as the structure-directing agent, we prepared large arrays of oriented ZnO nanorods with controlled aspect ratios, complex film morphologies made of oriented nanocolumns and nanoplates (remarkably similar to biomineral structures in red abalone shells) and complex bilayers showing in situ column-to-rod morphological transitions.

In general, such sensors contain a number of circuits or complex layered matrix arrays. Here, we present a simple architecture for a flexible and highly sensitive strain sensor that enables the detection of pressure, shear and torsion. The device is based on two interlocked arrays of high-aspect-ratio Pt-coated polymeric nanofibres that are supported on thin polydimethylsiloxane layers. When different sensing stimuli are applied, the degree of interconnection and the electrical resistance of the sensor changes in a reversible, directional manner with specific, discernible strain-gauge factors. The sensor response is highly repeatable and reproducible up to 10,000 cycles with excellent on/off switching behaviour. We show that the sensor can be used to monitor signals ranging from human heartbeats to the impact of a bouncing water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface.",10.1038/NMAT3380
J,"Deng, MT; Yu, CL; Huang, GY; Larsson, M; Caroff, P; Xu, HQ",Anomalous Zero-Bias Conductance Peak in a Nb-InSb Nanowire-Nb Hybrid Device,"Semiconductor InSb nanowires are expected to provide an excellent material platform for the study of Majorana fermions in solid state systems. Here, we report on the realization of a Nb-InSb nanowire-Nb hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap Delta(InSb) similar to 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value, at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is E-z similar to Delta(Insb), is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the InSb nanowire.",10.1021/nl303758w

Further development of large, flexible displays requires a cost-effective manufacturing process for the active-matrix backplane, which contains one transistor per pixel. One way to further reduce costs is to integrate (part of) the display drive circuitry, such as row shift registers, directly on the display substrate. Here, we demonstrate flexible active-matrix monochrome electrophoretic displays based on solution-processed organic transistors on 25-mum-thick polyimide substrates. The displays can be bent to a radius of 1 cm without significant loss in performance. Using the same process flow we prepared row shift registers. With 1,888 transistors, these are the largest organic integrated circuits reported to date. More importantly, the operating frequency of 5 kHz is sufficiently high to allow integration with the display operating at video speed. This work therefore represents a major step towards 'system-on-plastic'.",10.1038/nmat1061

J,"Kempton, W; Tomic, J",Vehicle-to-grid power fundamentals: Calculating capacity and net revenue,"As the light vehicle fleet moves to electric drive (hybrid, battery, and fuel cell vehicles), an opportunity opens for ""vehicle-to-grid"" (V2G) power. This article defines the three vehicle types that can produce V2G power, and the power markets they can sell into. V2G only makes sense if the vehicle and power market are matched. For example, V2G appears to be unsuitable for baseload power-the constant round-the-clock electricity supply-because baseload power can be provided more cheaply by large generators, as it is today. Rather, V2G's greatest near-term promise is for quick-response, high-value electric services. These quick-response electric services are purchased to balance constant fluctuations in load and to adapt to unexpected equipment failures; they account for 5-10% of electric cost-$12 billion per year in the US. This article develops equations to calculate the capacity for grid power from three types of electric drive vehicles. These equations are applied to evaluate revenue and costs for these vehicles to supply electricity to three electric markets (peak power, spinning reserves, and regulation). The results suggest that the engineering rationale and economic motivation for V2G power are compelling. The societal advantages of developing V2G include an additional revenue stream for cleaner vehicles, increased stability and reliability of the electric grid, lower electric system costs, and eventually, inexpensive storage and backup for renewable electricity.

We report the design, formation and testing of QD-protein assemblies that function as chemical sensors. In these assemblies, multiple copies of Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) coordinate to each QD by a C-terminal oligohistidine segment and function as sugar receptors. Sensors are self-assembled in solution in a controllable manner. In one configuration, a beta-cyclodextrin-QSY9 dark quencher conjugate bound in the MBP saccharide binding site results in fluorescence resonance energy-transfer (FRET) quenching of QD photoluminescence. Added maltose displaces the beta-cyclodextrin-QSY9, and QD photoluminescence increases in a systematic manner. A second maltose sensor assembly consists of QDs coupled with Cy3-labelled MBP bound to beta-cyclodextrin-Cy3.5. In this case, the QD donor drives sensor function through a two-step FRET mechanism that overcomes inherent QD donor-acceptor distance limitations.

These studies demonstrate that ZnO nanoparticles have a wide range of antibacterial activities toward various microorganisms that are commonly found in environmental settings. The antibacterial activity of the ZnO nanoparticles was inversely proportional to the size of the nanoparticles in S. aureus. Surprisingly, the antibacterial activity did not require specific UV activation using artificial lamps, rather activation was achieved under ambient lighting conditions. Northern analyses of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) specific genes and confocal microscopy suggest that the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles might involve both the production of reactive oxygen species and the accumulation of nanoparticles in the cytoplasm or on the outer membranes.

However, the hydrophilicity of MXene films may affect their stability and reliability when applied in moist or wet environments. Herein, for the first time, an efficient and facile approach is reported to fabricate freestanding, flexible, and hydrophobic MXene foam with reasonable strength by assembling MXene sheets into films followed by a hydrazine-induced foaming process. In striking contrast to well-known hydrophilic MXene materials, the MXene foams surprisingly exhibit hydrophobic surfaces and outstanding water resistance and durability. More interestingly, a much enhanced EMI-shielding effectiveness of approximate to 70 dB is achieved for the lightweight MXene foam as compared to its unfoamed film counterpart (53 dB) due to the highly efficient wave attenuation in the favorable porous structure. Therefore, the hydrophobic, flexible, and lightweight MXene foam with an excellent EMI-shielding performance is highly promising for applications in aerospace and portable and wearable smart electronics.",10.1002/adma.201702367

J,"Yeh, JW",Recent progress in high-entropy alloys,"The thirty or so presently used common alloy systems are typically based on one or, at most, two elements. It has been considered that alloys consisting of a greater number of principal elements will form complicated and brittle microstructures, and hence research regarding such multi-principal-element alloys has received very limited attention. It was suggested by Yeh in 1995, however, that alloy systems with five or more metallic elements will in fact possess higher mixing entropies, and therefore favour the formation of multielement solid-solution phases, as opposed to the inferred complex structures consisting of many intermetallic compounds. Indeed, work over the past decade into such multi-principal-element alloys, which have fittingly been coined as ""high-entropy alloys"" (HE alloys), has found them to form simple phases with nanocrystalline and even amorphous structures. In addition to the high-entropy effect, these structural characteristics are ascribed to the large lattice distortion and sluggish diffusion of such multielemental mixtures. Dependant upon the composition and/or processing route, HE alloys have been found to possess a wide spectrum of microstructures and properties. The superior properties exhibited by HE alloys over conventional alloys, along with the huge number of possible compositions that may give new phenomena and functional uses, makes these proposed HE alloys of great interest not only from a research perspective but also in numerous industrial applications. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress made on HE alloys, and possible future directions.",10.3166/acsm.31.633-648

It is highly desirable, even necessary in certain situations, for wireless sensor nodes to be self-powered.

The focus of this paper is to discuss the modeling, design. and optimization of a piezoelectric generator based on a two-layer bending element. An analytical model of the generator has been developed and validated. In addition to providing intuitive design insight, the model has been used as the basis for design optimization. Designs of 1 cm(3) in size generated using the model have demonstrated a power output of 375 muW from a vibration source of 2.5 m s(-2) at 120 Hz. Furthermore, a 1 cm(3) generator has been used to power a custom designed 1.9 GHz radio transmitter from the same vibration source.",10.1088/0964-1726/13/5/018

The constants in the LJ potential are different for graphene-graphene and C-60-C-60 interactions. From these, the constants for tube-C-60 interactions were estimated using averaging rules from the theory of dispersion forces. For tubes in ropes, the cohesive energy per unit length, the compressibility, and the equilibrium separation distance were computed as a function of tube radius. For a C-60 molecule interacting with tubes, the binding energy inside a tube was much higher than on a tube or at the tube mouth. Within a tube, the binding energy was highest at a spherically capped end. The potential energies for tubes of all radii, as well as for interactions between C-60 molecules, for a C-60 molecule outside of a nanotube, between a C-60 molecule and a graphene sheet, and between graphene sheets, all fell on the same curve when plotted in terms of certain reduced parameters. Because of this, all the potentials can be represented by a simple analytic form, thereby greatly simplifying all computations of van der Waals interactions in graphitic systems. Binding-energy results were all consistent with the recently proposed mechanism of peapod formation based on transmission electron microscopy experiments.",10.1103/PhysRevB.62.13104

However, the task of generating excited states with long lifetimes has been met with limited success, owing to the ultrafast deactivation of the highly active excited states(5). Here, we present a design rule that can be used to tune the emission lifetime of a wide range of luminescent organic molecules, based on effective stabilization of triplet excited states through strong coupling in H-aggregated molecules. Our experimental data revealed that luminescence lifetimes up to 1.35 s, which are several orders of magnitude longer than those of conventional organic fluorophores(6,7), can be realized under ambient conditions. These results outline a fundamental principle to design organic molecules with extended lifetimes of excited states, providing a major step forward in expanding the scope of organic phosphorescence applications.",10.1038/NMAT4259

Skyrmion lattices were initially observed in bulk non-centrosymmetric crystals, but have more recently been noted in ultrathin films, where their existence is explained by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions induced by the proximity to an adjacent layer with strong spin-orbit coupling. Skyrmions are promising candidates as information carriers for future information-processing devices due to their small size (down to a few nanometres) and to the very small current densities needed to displace skyrmion lattices. However, any practical application will probably require the creation, manipulation and detection of isolated skyrmions in magnetic thin-film nanostructures.

J,"Sheng, WC; Gasteiger, HA; Shao-Horn, Y",Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution Reaction Kinetics on Platinum: Acid vs Alkaline Electrolytes,"The kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on polycrystalline platinum [Pt(pc)] and high surface area carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles (Pt/C) were studied in 0.1 M KOH using rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements. After corrections of noncompensated solution resistance from ac impedance spectroscopy and of hydrogen mass transport in the HOR branch, the kinetic current densities were fitted to the Butler-Volmer equation using a transfer coefficient of alpha = 0.5, from which HOR/HER exchange current densities on Pt(pc) and Pt/C were obtained, and the HOR/HER mechanisms in alkaline solution were discussed. Unlike the HOR/HER rates on Pt electrodes in alkaline solution, the HOR/HER rates on a Pt electrode in 0.1 M HClO(4) were limited entirely by hydrogen diffusion, which renders the quantification of the HOR/HER kinetics impossible by conventional RDE measurements. The simulation of the hydrogen anode performance based on the specific exchange current densities of the HOR/HER at 80 degrees C illustrates that in addition to the oxygen reduction reaction cell voltage loss on the cathode, the slow HOR kinetics are projected to cause significant anode potential losses in alkaline fuel cells for low platinum loadings (> 130 mV at 0.05 mg(Pt)/cm(anode)(2) and 1.5 A/cm(anode)(2)), contrary to what is reported for proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

Most of the attention has been focused on solution-processed polymer bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells3-7. A combination of polymer design, morphology control, structural insight and device engineering has led to power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching the 6-8% range for conjugated polymer/fullerene blends(8,9). Solution-processed small-molecule BHJ (SM BHJ) solar cells have received less attention, and their efficiencies have remained below those of their polymeric counterparts(10).

A record PCE of 6.7% under AM 1.5G irradiation (100mWcm(-2)) is achieved for small-molecule BHJ devices from DTS(PTTh2)(2) V PC70BM (donor to acceptor ratio of 7: 3). This high efficiency was obtained by using remarkably small percentages of solvent additive (0.25% v/v of 1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) during the film-forming process, which leads to reduced domain sizes in the BHJ layer.

However, many present high-ZT materials are based on low-abundance elements that pose challenges for scale-up, as they entail high material costs in addition to brittleness and difficulty in large-area deposition. Here we demonstrate a strategy to improve ZT in conductive polymers and other organic semiconductors (OSCs) for which the base elements are earth-abundant. By minimizing total dopant volume, we show that all three parameters constituting ZT vary in a manner so that ZT increases; this stands in sharp contrast to ISCs, for which these parameters have trade-offs. Reducing dopant volume is found to be as important as optimizing carrier concentration when maximizing ZT in OSCs.

Electroluminescence has already been observed from monolayer MoS2 devices(17,18). However, the electroluminescence efficiency was low and the linewidth broad due both to the poor optical quality of the MoS2 and to ineffective contacts. Here, we report electroluminescence from lateral p-n junctions in monolayer WSe2 induced electrostatically using a thin boron nitride support as a dielectric layer with multiple metal gates beneath. This structure allows effective injection of electrons and holes, and, combined with the high optical quality of WSe2, yields bright electroluminescence with 1,000 times smaller injection current and 10 times smaller linewidth than in MoS2 (refs 17,18).

Here, we demonstrate the vertical and lateral integration of ZnO nanowires into arrays that are capable of producing sufficient power to operate real devices. A lateral integration of 700 rows of ZnO nanowires produces a peak voltage of 1.26 V at a low strain of 0.19%, which is potentially sufficient to recharge an AA battery.

J,"Meyers, MA; Vöhringer, O; Lubarda, VA",The onset of twinning in metals:: A constitutive description,"A constitutive approach is developed that predicts the critical stress for twinning as a function of external (temperature, strain rate) and internal (grain size, stacking-fault energy) parameters. Plastic deformation by slip and twinning are considered as competitive mechanisms. The twinning stress is equated to the slip stress based on the plastic flow by thermally assisted movement of dislocations over obstacles, which leads to successful prediction of the slip-twinning transition. The model is applied to body centered cubic, face centered cubic, and hexagonal metals and alloys: Fe, Cu, brasses, and Ti, respectively. A constitutive expression for the twinning stress in BCC metals is developed using dislocation emission from a source and the formation of pile-ups, as rate-controlling mechanism. Employing an Eshelby-type analysis, the critical size of twin nucleus and twinning stress are correlated to the twin-boundary energy, which is directly related to the stacking-fault energy (SFE) for FCC metals. The effects of grain size and SFE are examined and the results indicate that the grain-scale pile-ups are not the source of the stress concentrations giving rise to twinning in FCC metals. The constitutive description of the slip-twinning transition are incorporated into the Weertman-Ashby deformation mechanism maps, thereby enabling the introduction of a twinning domain.

This groundbreaking approach to temporary metallic implants is one of the latest developments in biomaterials science that is being rediscovered. It is a challenging topic, and several secrets still remain that might revolutionize various biomedical implants currently in clinical use. Magnesium alloys were investigated as implant materials long ago. A very early clinical report was given in 1878 by the physician Edward C. Huse. He used magnesium wires as ligature for bleeding vessels. Magnesium alloys for clinical use were explored during the last two centuries mainly by surgeons with various clinical backgrounds, such as cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and general surgery. Nearly all patients benefited from the treatment with magnesium implants. Although most patients experienced subcutaneous gas cavities caused by rapid implant corrosion, most patients had no pain and almost no infections were observed during the postoperative follow-up.

J,"Agnew, SR; Duygulu, Ö",Plastic anisotropy and the role of non-basal slip in magnesium alloy AZ31B,"Mechanistic explanations for the plastic behavior of a wrought magnesium alloy are developed using a combination of experimental and simulation techniques. Parameters affecting the practical sheet formability, such as strain hardening rate, strain rate sensitivity, the degree of anisotropy, and the stresses and strains at fracture, are examined systematically by conducting tensile tests of variously oriented samples at a range of temperatures (room temperature to 250 degreesC and strain rates (10(-5)-0.1s(-1)). Polycrystal plasticity simulations are used to model the observed anisotropy and texture evolution. Strong in-plane anisotropy observed at low temperatures is attributed to the initial texture and the greater than anticipated non-basal cross-slip of dislocations with dropadrop type Burgers vectors. The agreement between the measured and simulated anisotropy and texture is further validated by direct observations of the dislocation microstructures using transmission electron microscopy. The increase in the ductility with temperature is accompanied by a decrease in the flow stress, an increase in the strain rate sensitivity, and a decrease in the normal anisotropy. Polycrystal simulations indicate that an increased activity of non-basal, dropc + adrop, dislocations provides a self-consistent explanation for the observed changes in the anisotropy with increasing temperature.

J,"Gartner, E","Industrially interesting approaches to ""low-CO<sub>2</sub>"" cements","This article discusses the practicality of replacing portland cements with alternative hydraulic cements that could result in lower total CO2 emissions per unit volume of concrete of equivalent performance. Currently, the cement industry is responding rapidly to the perceived societal need for reduced CO2 emissions by increasing the production of blended portland cements using supplementary cementitious materials that are principally derived from industrial by-products, such as blast-furnace slags and coal combustion fly ashes. However, the supplies of such by-products of suitable quality are limited. An alternative solution is to use natural pozzolans, although they must still be activated either by portland cement or lime or by alkali silicates or hydroxides, the production of all of which still involves significant CO2 emissions. Moreover, concretes based on activated pozzolans often require curing at elevated temperatures, which significantly limits their field of application. The most promising alternative cementing systems for general concrete applications at ambient temperatures currently appear to be those based at least in part on calcium sulfates, the availability of which is increasing due to the widespread implementation of sulfur dioxide emission controls. These include calcium sulfoaluminate-belite-ferrite cements of the type developed in China under the generic name ""Third Cement Series"" (TCS) and other similar systems that make good use of the potential synergies among calcium sulfate, calcium silicate and calcium aluminate hydrates. However, a great deal more research is required to solve significant unresolved processing and reactivity questions and to establish the durability of concretes made from such cements. If we are to use these potentially more CO2-efficient technologies on a large enough scale to have a significant global impact, we will also have to develop the performance data needed to justify changes to construction codes and standards.

The most stable configuration has one carbon atom on top of a boron atom, and the other centered above a BN ring. The resulting inequivalence of the two carbon sites leads to the opening of a gap of 53 meV at the Dirac points of graphene and to finite masses for the Dirac fermions. Alternative orientations of the graphene sheet on the BN substrate generate similar band gaps and masses. The band gap induced by the BN surface can greatly improve room temperature pinch-off characteristics of graphene-based field effect transistors.",10.1103/PhysRevB.76.073103

To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096 eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082 eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of similar to 3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.",10.1038/npjcompumats.2015.10

The dependence of the resistance on temperature and electric field, and the absence of any effect in a single-layer device, strongly suggest that the gate-induced insulating state originates from the recently predicted opening of a bandgap between valence and conduction bands.",10.1038/nmat2082

However, their use in ion sieving and desalination technologies is limited by a permeation cutoff of similar to 9 angstrom (ref. 4), which is larger than the diameters of hydrated ions of common salts(4,6). The cutoff is determined by the interlayer spacing (d) of similar to 13.5 angstrom, typical for graphene oxide laminates that swell in water(2,4). Achieving smaller d for the laminates immersed in water has proved to be a challenge. Here, we describe how to control d by physical confinement and achieve accurate and tunable ion sieving. Membranes with d from similar to 9.8 angstrom to 6.4 angstrom are demonstrated, providing a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions. In this regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with energy barriers of similar to 10-100 kJ mol(-1) depending on d. Importantly, permeation rates decrease exponentially with decreasing sieve size but water transport is weakly affected (by a factor of <2). The latter is attributed to a low barrier for the entry of water molecules and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries. Building on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable method to obtain graphene-based membranes with limited swelling, which exhibit 97% rejection for NaCl.",10.1038/NNANO.2017.21

Recently, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbons has shown some promise in growing large-area graphene or few-layer graphene films on metal substrates such as Ni and Cu. It has been proposed that CVD growth of graphene on Ni occurs by a C segregation or precipitation process whereas graphene on Cu grows by a surface adsorption process. Here we used carbon isotope labeling in conjunction with Raman spectroscopic mapping to track carbon during the growth process. The data clearly show that at high temperatures sequentially introduced isotopic carbon diffuses into the Ni first, mixes, and then segregates and precipitates at the surface of Ni forming graphene and/or graphite with a uniform mixture of C-12 and C-13 as determined by the peak position of the Raman G-band peak. On the other hand, graphene growth on Cu is clearly by surface adsorption where the spatial distribution of C-12 and C-13 follows the precursor time sequence and the linear growth rate ranges from about 1 to as high as 6 mu m/min depending upon Cu grain orientation.

J,"Mercelis, P; Kruth, JP",Residual stresses in selective laser sintering and selective laser melting,"Purpose - This paper presents an investigation into residual stresses in selective laser sintering (SLS) and selective laser melting (SLM), aiming at a better understanding of this phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach - First, the origin of residual stresses is explored and a simple theoretical model is developed to predict residual stress distributions. Next, experimental methods are used to measure the residual stress profiles in a set of test samples produced with different process parameters. Findings - Residual stresses are found to be very large in SLM parts. In general, the residual stress profile consists of two zones of large tensile stresses at the top and bottom of the part, and a large zone of intermediate compressive stress in between. The most important parameters determining the magnitude and shape of the residual stress profiles are the material properties, the sample and substrate height, the laser scanning strategy and the heating conditions. Research limitations/implications - All experiments were conducted on parts produced from stainless steel powder (316L) and quantitative results cannot be simply extrapolated to other materials. However, most qualitative results can still be generalized. Originality/value - This paper can serve as an aid in understanding the importance of residual stresses in SLS/SLM and other additive manufacturing processes involving a localized heat input.

Non-uniform metal deposition and dendrite formation on the negative electrode during repeated cycles of charge and discharge are major hurdles to commercialization of energy-storage devices based on each of these chemistries. A long-held view is that unstable electrodeposition is a consequence of inherent characteristics of these metals and their inability to form uniform electrodeposits on surfaces with inevitable defects. We report on electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolytes. We find that simple liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends exhibit stable long-term cycling at room temperature, often with no signs of deposition instabilities over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge and thousands of operating hours. We rationalize these observations with the help of surface energy data for the electrolyte/lithium interface and impedance analysis of the interface during different stages of cell operation.

The hydrogel dressings showed suitable stretchable and compressive property, comparable modulus with human skin, good adhesiveness and fast self-healing ability to bear deformation. The hydrogels exhibited efficient hemostatic performance and biocompatibility. Moreover, the curcumin loaded hydrogel showed good antioxidant ability and pH responsive release profiles. In vivo experiments indicated that curcumin loaded hydrogels significantly accelerated wound healing rate with higher granulation tissue thickness and collagen disposition and upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a full-thickness skin defect model. Taken together, the antibacterial adhesive hydrogels with self-healing and good mechanical property offer significant promise as dressing materials for joints skin wound healing.",10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.08.044
J,"López, R; Gómez, R",Band-gap energy estimation from diffuse reflectance measurements on sol-gel and commercial TiO<sub>2</sub>: a comparative study,"A comparison of the band gap energy estimated from UV-vis reflectance spectra of TiO2 powders prepared by sol-gel route versus commercial TiO2 powders, nanopowder, bulkpowder and P25 is reported. The experimental results obtained from the optical absorption spectra were reported for all the TiO2 samples. Graphic representations were used to calculate E-g: absorbance versus lambda; F(R) versus E; (F(R) h nu)(n) versus E, with n = A1/2 for an indirect allowed transition and n = 2 for a direct allowed transition. From the results, it could be seen that E-g strongly varied according to the equation used for the graphic representation. Differences in E-g up to 0.5 eV for the same semiconductor depending on the transition chosen were observed. Accurate E-g estimation in the four semiconductors studied was obtained by using the general equation alpha (h nu) a parts per thousand B (h nu - E-g)(n) (where alpha similar to F(R)) and indirect allowed transition.",10.1007/s10971-011-2582-9

Considerable progress has been made in recent decades in both developing new experimental DIC techniques and in enhancing the performance of the relevant computational algorithms.

J,"Jain, PK; Huang, WY; El-Sayed, MA",On the universal scaling behavior of the distance decay of plasmon coupling in metal nanoparticle pairs: A plasmon ruler equation,"Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in lithographically fabricated gold (Au) nanodisc pairs are investigated using microabsorption spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting ""universal"" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a ""plasmon ruler equation"" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band. We find good agreement of the interparticle separations estimated using this equation with the experimental observations of Reinhard et al.",10.1021/nl071008a

Not only could silver nanoparticles ranging from 55 to 80 nm in size be fabricated, but also triangular or spherical shaped gold nanoparticles could be easily modulated by reacting the novel sundried biomass of Cinnamomum camphora leaf with aqueous silver or gold precursors at ambient temperature. The marked difference of shape control between gold and silver nanoparticles was attributed to the comparative advantage of protective biomolecules and reductive biomolecules.

The results are significantly different from those known for graphite. Spectra were collected using 514.5 nm radiation on films containing from n = 1 to 20 graphene layers, as determined by atomic force microscopy. Both the first- and second-order Raman spectra show unique signatures of the number of layers in the film. The nGL film analogue of the Raman G-band in graphite exhibits a Lorentzian line shape whose center frequency shifts linearly relative to graphite as similar to 1/n (for n = 1 omega(G) approximate to 1587 cm(-1)). Three weak bands, identified with disorder-induced first-order scattering, are observed at similar to 1350, 1450, and 1500 cm(-1). The similar to 1500 cm(-1) band is weak but relatively sharp and exhibits an interesting n-dependence. In general, the intensity of these D-bands decreases dramatically with increasing n. Three second-order bands are also observed (similar to 2450, similar to 2700, and 3248 cm(-1)). They are analogues to those observed in graphite. However, the similar to 2700 cm(-1) band exhibits an interesting and dramatic change of shape with n. Interestingly, for n < 5 this second-order band is more intense than the G-band.",10.1021/nl061420a

J,"Lim, CW; Zhang, G; Reddy, JN",A higher-order nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and its applications in wave propagation,"In recent years there have been many papers that considered the effects of material length scales in the study of mechanics of solids at micro- and/or nano-scales. There are a number of approaches and, among them, one set of papers deals with Eringen's differential nonlocal model and another deals with the strain gradient theories. The modified couple stress theory, which also accounts for a material length scale, is a form of a strain gradient theory. The large body of literature that has come into existence in the last several year has created significant confusion among researchers about the length scales that these various theories contain. The present paper has the objective of establishing the fact that the length scales present in nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory describe two entirely different physical characteristics of materials and structures at nanoscale. By using two principle kernel functions, the paper further presents a theory with application examples which relates the classical nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient theory and it results in a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient theory. In this theory, a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient elasticity system which considers higher-order stress gradients and strain gradient nonlocality is proposed. It is based on the nonlocal effects of the strain field and first gradient strain field. This theory intends to generalize the classical nonlocal elasticity theory by introducing a higher-order strain tensor with nonlocality into the stored energy function. The theory is distinctive because the classical nonlocal stress theory does not include nonlocality of higher-order stresses while the common strain gradient theory only considers local higher-order strain gradients without nonlocal effects in a global sense. By establishing the constitutive relation within the thermodynamic framework, the governing equations of equilibrium and all boundary conditions are derived via the variational approach. Two additional kinds of parameters, the higher-order nonlocal parameters and the nonlocal gradient length coefficients are introduced to account for the size-dependent characteristics of nonlocal gradient materials at nanoscale. To illustrate its application values, the theory is applied for wave propagation in a nonlocal strain gradient system and the new dispersion relations derived are presented through examples for wave propagating in Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko nanobeams. The numerical results based on the new nonlocal strain gradient theory reveal some new findings with respect to lattice dynamics and wave propagation experiment that could not be matched by both the classical nonlocal stress model and the contemporary strain gradient theory. Thus, this higher-order nonlocal strain gradient model provides an explanation to some observations in the classical and nonlocal stress theories as well as the strain gradient theory in these aspects.

The paradigm proved itself extremely versatile and led to rapid demonstration of tunnelling diodes with negative differential resistance(4), tunnelling transistors(5), photovoltaic devices(6,7) and so on. Here, we take the complexity and functionality of such van der Waals heterostructures to the next level by introducing quantum wells (QWs) engineered with one atomic plane precision. We describe light-emitting diodes (LEDs) made by stacking metallic graphene, insulating hexagonal boron nitride and various semiconducting monolayers into complex but carefully designed sequences. Our first devices already exhibit an extrinsic quantum efficiency of nearly 10% and the emission can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies by appropriately choosing and combining 2D semiconductors (monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides). By preparing the heterostructures on elastic and transparent substrates, we show that they can also provide the basis for flexible and semi-transparent electronics. The range of functionalities for the demonstrated heterostructures is expected to grow further on increasing the number of available 2D crystals and improving their electronic quality.",10.1038/nmat4205

The Raman response as well as the luminescence as a function of the number of S-W-S layers is also reported. The PL weakens with increasing number of layers due to a transition from direct band gap in a monolayer to indirect gap in multilayers. The edges of WS2 monolayers exhibit PL signals with extraordinary intensity, around 25 times stronger than that at the platelet's center. The structure and chemical composition of the platelet edges appear to be critical for PL enhancement.",10.1021/nl3026357

The solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the most exciting of these energy technologies; it is an all-ceramic device that operates at temperatures in the range 500-1,000degreesC. The SOFC offers certain advantages over lower temperature fuel cells, notably its ability to use carbon monoxide as a fuel rather than being poisoned by it, and the availability of high-grade exhaust heat for combined heat and power, or combined cycle gas-turbine applications. Although cost is clearly the most important barrier to widespread SOFC implementation, perhaps the most important technical barriers currently being addressed relate to the electrodes, particularly the fuel electrode or anode. In terms of mitigating global warming, the ability of the SOFC to use commonly available fuels at high efficiency, promises an effective and early reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and hence is one of the lead new technologies for improving the environment. Here, we discuss recent developments of SOFC fuel electrodes that will enable the better use of readily available fuels.",10.1038/nmat1040
