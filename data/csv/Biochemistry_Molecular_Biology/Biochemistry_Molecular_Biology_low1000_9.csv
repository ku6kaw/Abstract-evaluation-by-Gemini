An efficient and accurate method for detecting cyanide in urine sample has been established. The process was carried out by a two-step derivatization reaction. The cyanide reacted with benzaldehyde to form a stable intermediate which reacted with heptafluorobutyryl chloride in the second step. The quantitative MS/MS transition of thecyanide derivative was m/z 330.2m/z 303.4, and the qualitative MS/MS transition was m/z 330.2m/z 185.2. The method had good linearity (r(2)=0.999 4) and covered the cyanide poisoning detection window (0.01-10 mu g mL(-1)), and the limit of detection was 3ng mL(-1). At the same time, the method demonstrated good accuracy (recoveries=92.7.0-102.0%) and precision (intra-day precision=3.3-5.1%, inter-day precision=4.4-5.3%). The complete derivatization reaction and detection time were controlled within 20min and successfully applied in a lethal case of ingestion of potassium cyanide.

J,"Zhang, J; Zhao, ZG; Zhang, K; Wei, Z",A Feature Sampling Strategy for Analysis of High Dimensional Genomic Data,"With the development of high throughput technology, it has become feasible and common to profile tens of thousands of gene activities simultaneously. These genomic data typically have sample size of hundreds or fewer, which is much less than the feature size (number of genes). In addition, the genes, in particular the ones from the same pathway, are often highly correlated. These issues impose a great challenge for selecting meaningful genes from a large number of (correlated) candidates in many genomic studies. Quite a few methods have been proposed to attack this challenge. Among them, regularization-based techniques, e.g., lasso, become much more appealing, because they can do model fitting and variable selection at the same time. However, the lasso regression has its known limitations. One is that the number of genes selected by the lasso couldn't exceed the number of samples. Another limitation is that, if causal genes are highly correlated, the lasso tends to select only one or few genes from them. Biologists, however, desire to identify them all. To overcome these limitations, we present here a novel, robust, and stable variable selection method. Through simulation studies and a real application to the transcriptome data, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in selecting highly correlated causal genes. We also provide some theoretical justifications for this feature sampling strategy based on the mean and variance analyses.",10.1109/TCBB.2017.2779492
J,"Zhao, XY; Wang, XJ; Su, G; Sun, Q; Fu, JT; Zhang, HL; Teng, JF",The effect of early growth response 1 on levels of Amyloid-β 40 peptide in U87MG cells,"A recent study has shown that early growth response 1 (EGR1) plays a critical role in the beta-amyloid cascade and tau hypotheses. In addition, evidence has suggested that EGR1 can regulate levels of amyloid-beta peptides, key molecules in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether EGR1 is a deleterious or protective factor in the AD is still controversial. In this present study, we constructed an overexpression plasmid, CMV-EGFP-EGR1-Kanamycin, and transfected it into U87MG cells to investigate the effects of EGR1 expression on amyloid-beta (1-40) peptide (A beta 40) levels. U87MG cells transfected by CMV-EGFP-EGR1-Kanamycin and CMV-EGFP-Kanamycin were assigned, respectively, to experimental and control groups. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe transfection efficiencies of the plasmids after 6 hours. EGR1 messenger RNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A beta 40 secretion was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of the amyloid precursor protein, beta-secretase enzyme, and presenilin 1 proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The results showed that EGR1 overexpression increased A beta 40 secretion in vitro, possibly through increasing BACE1 expression. Based on these results, EGR1 might be a promising therapeutic target for the AD.",10.1002/jcb.27627

J,"Zhu, YL; Peng, ZB; Chen, ZP; Wang, JK; Shi, CX; Chen, Y; Yu, RQ",Quantification of enantiomers by mass spectrometry based on chemical derivatization and spectral shape deformation quantitative theory,"A facile mass spectrometric kinetic method for quantitative analysis of chiral compounds was developed by integrating mass spectrometry based on chemical derivatization and the spectral shape deformation quantitative theory. Chemical derivatization was employed to introduce diastereomeric environments to the chiral compounds of interest, resulting in different abundance distribution patterns of fragment ions of the derivatization products of enantiomers in mass spectrometry. The quantitative information of the chiral compounds of interest was extracted from complex mass spectral data by an advanced calibration model derived based on the spectral shape deformation quantitative theory. The performance of the proposed method was tested on the quantitative analysis of R-propranolol in propranolol tablets. Experimental results demonstrated that it could achieve accurate and precise concentration ratio predictions for R-propranolol with an average relative predictive error (ARPE) of about 4%, considerably better than the corresponding results of the mass spectrometric method based on chemical derivatization and the univariate ratiometric model (ARPE: about 12%). The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the proposed method for the concentration ratio of R-propranolol were estimated to be 1.5% and 6.0%, respectively. The proposed method is complementary to the existing methods designed for the quantification of enantiomers such as the Cooks kinetic method.",10.1002/jms.4334
J,"Jian, FF; Liu, E; Li, ZY",An efficient <i>t</i>RNA cleaver without additional co-reactants at physiological condition,"A square-planar Cu(II) complex, [Cu(Me-Im)(gly-gly)]center dot H2O 1 (Me-Im = 1 methyl-imidazole, gly-gly = glycylglycinato), has been prepared and structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray. The complex 1 was tested for its ability to the transfer RNA by UV-vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), capillary electrophoresis (CE). Comparative spectroscopic analysis shows a maximum fluorescence quenching ratio of 0.41 of 1 upon binding to RNA, which gives a binding constant (K-b) of 1.24 x 10(5) M-1. Cyclic voltammograms of complex 1 attached on the mercaptoethanol (-SH) linked Au electrodes in phosphate buffer solution give a well-defined and quasi-reversible redox couple, indicate complex 1 can efficiently degrade the high-order structure of RNA in physiological conditions (pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution at 37 degrees C) without additional co-reactants, yielding a digestion coefficient more than 90% within 113 h. This study targeting the genetic biomacromolecule degradation based on the strong binding of chemical nucleases paves an important way to the novel materials in the decontamination of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and viruses) at mild condition.

We evaluated the efficiency of pre-germinative genotypic screening by DNA markers from manually cut partial seeds of rice, beans and maize. Tests to evaluate PCR amplification and physiological quality were performed. We observed that the Sarkosyl method was efficient to extract DNA from a 1/2 fraction of the rice seeds and 1/4 of the bean and maize seeds, generating good quality SSR-PCR products. The physiological quality of the rice seeds cut in half and the bean and maize seeds remaining fraction of 3/4 of the original seed provided a high germination percentage. The method is effective for simultaneously genotyping and germinating plants from a single seed, since DNA extracted from these fractions of seeds can be used for studies with DNA markers, while the remaining portions can be used for seedling production.",10.4238/gmr18130

Previous trials to eradicate CSFV have been expensive, inefficient and time-consuming process without complete success. In contrast to DNA transfection into cultured cells, the efficacy of gene transduction in in vivo organ is very low because of the presence of cortical laminar structures and multilayered cells followed by quality and quantity of DNA. Therefore, to eradicate CSFs, developing an effective and inexpensive vaccine targeting E2 glycoprotein is important. Here, we reported using different quantity of DNA with lipofectamine-2000 reagents that could markedly enhance the effectiveness of gene transfer in particular experiment while we are looking for long term development of animal vaccine and an alternative strategy for large scale production of CSFV E2 glycoprotein using baculovirus (bac-to-bac) system in silkworm, Bombyx mori, L. Our results show successful expression of E2 glycoprotein in BmN cell lines and silkworm larvae. The direct injection of recombinant rBacmid/BmNPV/E2 DNA with lipofectamine-2000 reagent infecting the silkworm larvae are varied in different groups and clear symptoms of infection were found and polyhedrons were counted by hemocytometer in individual and different batch. Confocal and electronic microscopy further revealed the expressed polyhedral, followed by SDS-PAGE and western blot further supporting our data. Our study provides an alternative strategy to produce large scale protein against CSFV.

Systemic arterial hypertension is the main risk factor for the formation of atheromas, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Several genes are involved in atherogenesis and hypertension. We analyzed polymorphisms of candidate genes that potentially participate in processes related to this pathology, including G894T and T786C of eNOS, as well as GSTT1 and GSTM1 in 167 hypertensive patients and 100 controls. Blood samples were from patients attended at the Angiogenesis/Vascular Surgery and Cardiology Department of the Angiogyn clinic in Goiania. There was significant prevalence of the genotype GT (76%) and the mutant allele T (56%) of the T786C (eNOS) polymorphism in the patients. For the polymorphism T786C (eNOS), the heterozygote genotype (TC) was found in 58% of the samples; allele C was found in 61%, but there was no significant difference compared to controls. The GSTT1 genotype was found in 84% and GSTM1 was found in 73%; for both their predominance was significant. There are many possible explanations for how these polymorphisms affect the development of atherosclerosis and hypertension, but more studies are necessary for their elucidation.",10.4238/gmr18089
J,"Broadwater, DWB; Altman, RB; Blanchard, SC; Kim, HD",ERASE: a novel surface reconditioning strategy for single-molecule experiments,"While surface-based single-molecule experiments have revolutionized our understanding of biology and biomolecules, the workflow in preparing for such experiments, especially surface cleaning and functionalization, remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. Even worse, meticulously assembled flow channels can be used only once for most experiments. A reusable surface would thus dramatically increase productivity and efficiency of single-molecule experiments. In this paper, we report a novel surface reconditioning strategy termed ERASE (Epitaxial Removal Aided by Strand Exchange) that allows a single flow cell to be used for vast repetition of single-molecule experiments. In this method, biomolecules immobilized to the surface through a nucleic acid duplex are liberated when a competing DNA strand disrupts the duplex via toehold-mediated strand displacement. We demonstrate the wide-range applicability of this method with various common surface preparation techniques, fluorescent dyes, and biomolecules including the bacterial ribosome. Beyond time and cost savings, we also show ERASE can assort molecules based on a nucleic acid barcode sequence, thus allowing experiments on different molecules in parallel. Our method increases the utility of prepared surfaces and is a significant improvement to the current single-use paradigm.",10.1093/nar/gky1168

The aim of this work is to identify the regulatory effect of Palbociclib on apoptosis of H9c2 cells induced by high glucose (HG) and to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms. It was observed that Palbociclib decreased intracellular ROS production, augmented mitochondrial membrane potential and hindered apoptosis of H9c2 cells. Palbociclib increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, diminished the expressions of Bax and cleaved-caspase-3, and affected the RB phosphorylation and p53 expression. Altogether, the anti-apoptotic efficacy of Palbociclib could be attributed in part to the modulation of the mitochondria apoptotic pathway. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Carroll, HD; Spouge, JL; Gonzalez, M",MultiDomainBenchmark: a multi-domain query and subject database suite,"Genetic sequence database retrieval benchmarks play an essential role in evaluating the performance of sequence searching tools. To date, all phylogenetically diverse benchmarks known to the authors include only query sequences with single protein domains. Domains are the primary building blocks of protein structure and function. Independently, each domain can fulfill a single function, but most proteins (> 80% in Metazoa) exist as multi-domain proteins. Multiple domain units combine in various arrangements or architectures to create different functions and are often under evolutionary pressures to yield new ones. Thus, it is crucial to create gold standards reflecting the multi-domain complexity of real proteins to more accurately evaluate sequence searching tools. This work introduces MultiDomainBenchmark (MDB), a database suite of 412 curated multi-domain queries and 227,512 target sequences, representing at least 5108 species and 1123 phylogenetically divergent protein families, their relevancy annotation, and domain location. Here, we use the benchmark to evaluate the performance of two commonly used sequence searching tools, BLAST/PSI-BLAST and HMMER. Additionally, we introduce a novel classification technique for multi-domain proteins to evaluate how well an algorithm recovers a domain architecture.

J,"Hayman, DC; Shalliker, RA",Renewing the performance of an expired particle packed column using active flow technology end fittings,"The performance of a particle packed column will inevitably degrade through use or misadventure. 'Active flow technology' (AFT) is known to greatly improve the performance of pristine columns, but is as of yet untested when used on columns that have degraded significantly. In this study AFT was used to regenerate a degraded column, where the reduced plate height and asymmetry values were 3.5 and 1.25 respectively. Once the AFT fittings were fitted to the column outlet and the flow segmentation ratio adjusted to 28% from the radial central exit port, the reduced plate height decreased to 2.0, and the bands were almost perfectly symmetrical with asymmetry factors equal to 1.04. Subsequently, the performance of the degraded column with AFT fittings provided performance that was comparable to that of a new conventional column fitted with traditional end fittings. The separation power of the degraded conventional column and that of the same column fitted with the AFT end fittings was then tested using the separation of oligostyrenes. In AFT mode, detection was undertaken at both the radial central exit port of the column and the peripheral exit port. The resulting separation that was achieved from the radial central exit port was superior to that observed on the conventional column, whereas, the separation observed from the peripheral port was very poor. It was subsequently determined that the reason for the degraded performance of the conventional column was a result of increased heterogeneity associated with the packing material in the wall region of the column.

This purity is achieved through step-wise purifications. In this work single, anion-exchange beads were trapped in the tubing to allow for dynamic solution cycling over the surface of the beads to improve the rates of metal complex uptake. Rates of Pu sorption on single similar to 900 mu m SIR-1200 and similar to 620 mu m Reillex-HPQ beads were determined for single beads trapped in a tube with syringe pump driven dynamic solution cycling over the bead, improving sorption and desorption rates. A static control was used as a comparison. Using Pu-238 to enable facile activity-based measurements, rates were determined by measuring the residual Pu after contact with beads using liquid scintillation analysis (LSA) for fixed periods of time. Syringe pump driven dynamic solution cycling results in similar to 5 and similar to 15-fold improvements in the sorption rates for SIR-1200 and Reillex-HPQ Impacts on desorption were also examined.

Its functional diversity is determined by differential binding of a variety of cofactors. In this study, we analyzed the physiological role of a CDC-48 cofactor UBXN-6 in Caenorhabditis elegans. The amount of UBXN-6 was markedly increased upon starvation, but not with the treatment of tunicamycin and rapamycin. The induction upon starvation is a unique characteristic for UBXN-6 among C-terminal cofactors of CDC-48. During starvation, lysosomal activity is triggered for rapid clearance of cellular materials. We observed the lysosomal activity by monitoring GLO-1::GFP, a marker for lysosomerelated organelles. We found that more puncta of GLO-1::GFP were observed in the ubxn-6 deletion mutant after 12 h starvation compared with the wild-type strain. Taken together, we propose that UBXN6 is involved in clearance of cellular materials upon starvation in C. elegans. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.155

This method was based on the synthesis of photoaffinity probes, and used the semiquantitative protein electrophoretic mobility shift technique. Three novel photoaffinity probes bearing different secondary tags were synthesized. Their potency was evaluated in an enzyme inhibition assay against rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase a (RMGPa). The inhibitory activity of probe 1 was only 100-fold less potent than the mother compound CP-320626. The photoaffinity labeling experiments were also performed, and a protein with molecular weight (MW) of about 90-100 kDa, which was consistent with the MW of GP, was clearly labeled by probe 1. A semiquantitative evaluation of the GP level in serum with probe 1 was also performed. The results showed that the protein band with a MW of about 90-100 kDa was tagged, and the concentration of the protein in serum was found to be between 25 and 50 ng/mL.

SCUBE1 is thought to play roles both in platelet activation and inflammation, which are important stages for the development of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The purpose of our study was to determine the diagnostic and prognostic values and temporal change of plasma SCUBE1 levels in AIS patients. Materials and methods: Thirty-five patients diagnosed with AIS at the Cumhuriyet University Faculty of Medicine Neurology Department, between June and December 2017, and a control group of 35 healthy volunteers were included. Results: Median first day SCUBE1 value in the patient group was 97.51 ng/mL, and the median 7th day SCUBE1 value was 32.72 ng/mL. Median control group SCUBE1 value was 27.51 ng/mL. The first day SCUBE1 levels were significantly higher than the 7th day and the control group SCUBE1 levels (p = 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). The ROC analysis showed that SCUBE1 levels above 68.8 ng/mL can be used as an indicator with high sensitivity and specificity for AIS diagnosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that the first day SCUBE1 had significant independent effects on development of AIS. In correlation analysis, plasma SCUBE1 levels showed a significantly positive correlation with lesion volume, NIHSS and MRS values (p < 0.01).

The positional isotope exchange technique is a useful tool in understanding the mechanisms and kinetics of many enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Detection of the positions and concentration of these exchanged isotopes is the key. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging are commonly used analytical techniques for measurement of O-18/O-16, P-31 and N-15 isotope enrichment. Since these techniques either require a time-consuming derivatization step or have a limited sensitivity, an LC and accurate mass-based method for monitoring O-18/O-16 exchange was developed and compared with a standard GC-MS method. Our results showed that the LC-QTOF-MS method developed was not only as accurate as the standard GC-MS method, but also a sensitive and robust analytical platform for the simultaneous determination of isotope enrichment and the analysis of positional isotopes without chemical derivation. The LC-QTOF-MS method developed was successfully applied to the measurement of O-18/O-16 in the reversibility study of ATP hydrolysis by Lon proteases.",10.1016/j.ab.2018.11.001

This isoform, in addition to the enzymatic action common to all SODs, also shows special functional and structural properties, essentially due to the presence of a first leader peptide that allows the protein to enter easily into cells. Among endogenous antioxidants, SOD constitutes the first line of natural defence against pathological effects induced by an excess of free radicals. Here, we firstly describe the effects of our rMnSOD administration on the proliferant and malignant undifferentiated human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cell line. Moreover, we also test the effects of rMnSOD in the all trans retinoic-differentiated SK-N-BE neuron-like cells, a quiescent not malignant model. While rMnSOD showed an antitumor activity on proliferating cells, a poor sensitivity to rMnSOD overload in retinoid-differentiated neuron-like cells was observed. However, in the latter case, in presence of experimental-induced oxidative stress, overcharge of rMnSOD enhanced the oxidant effects, through an increase of H2O2 due to low activity of both catalase and glutathione peroxidase. In conclusion, our data show that rMnSOD treatment exerts differential effects, which depend upon both cell differentiation and redox balance, addressing attention to the potential use of the recombinant enzyme on differentiated neurons. These facts ultimately pave the way for further preclinical studies aimed at evaluation of rMnSOD effects in models of neurodegenerative diseases.",10.1007/s11064-018-2686-5

In addition to the active biosynthesis of steroids in classic steroidogenic organs such as gonads, adrenals and placenta, testosterone also produced in astrocyte cells of brain. Testosterone and its level must be regulated in brain; because, it directly and indirectly affects memory and several key behavioral characteristics. The significance of sound waves on key enzymes that regulate levels of testosterone in brain has not been investigated. The aim of our study was to examine physical stress of such as sound on induction behavioral changes in animal models. According to the current study, sound waves with 528Hz frequency in 100dB intensity induce testosterone production in brain by enhancing StAR and SF-1 and reducing P450 aromatase gene expression. Frequency of 528Hz also reduces total concentration of reactive oxidative species in brain tissue. Prolonged exposure to this sound wave showed reduction of anxiety related behaviors in rats. The results reveal that reduced anxiety is related to increased concentration of testosterone in brain. This study may lead to ascertain a possible therapy in which sounds may be utilized to reduce anxiety in individual.",10.1007/s13258-018-0753-6

We have observed the effects of Azolla in both fresh and dried forms. This work signifies the possible physiological changes of a crop plant by using Azolla as a bioremediator. In brief the herbicide 2,4-D is considered as stressor to rice plants and by applying the fresh and dried Azolla we investigate the changes occurred. The activities of different nitrogen metabolizing enzymes and reactive oxygen species were observed. On the other hand chlorophyll and carotenoids synthesis were retrieved by addition of fresh and dried Azolla mass over 2,4-D toxicity. Thus, the efficiency of fresh and dried Azolla mass was evaluated under herbicidal toxicity in rice. We evaluate the bio remediating role of Azolla plants against 2,4-D stress and conclude this species would also be supporting in supplementation of major nutrients to rice plants.",10.1007/s11033-018-4443-x

EH are involved in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous epoxides, and thus have application in pharmacology and biotechnology. In this work, we describe the substrates and inhibitors selectivity of an epoxide hydrolase recently cloned from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei QM9414 (TrEH). We also studied the TrEH urea-based inhibitors effects in the fungal growth. TrEH showed high activity on radioative and fluorescent surrogate and natural substrates, especially epoxides from docosahexaenoic acid. Using a fluorescent surrogate substrate, potent inhibitors of TrEH were identified. Interestingly, one of the best compounds inhibit up to 60% of T. reesei growth, indicating an endogenous role for TrEH.

J,"Devlin, T; Hofman, CR; Acevedo, ZPV; Kohler, KR; Tao, LZ; Britt, RD; Hoke, KR; Hunsicker-Wang, LM",DEPC modification of the Cu<sub>A</sub> protein from Thermus thermophilus,"The Cu-A center is the initial electron acceptor in cytochrome c oxidase, and it consists of two copper ions bridged by two cysteines and ligated by two histidines, a methionine, and a carbonyl in the peptide backbone of a nearby glutamine. The two ligating histidines are of particular interest as they may influence the electronic and redox properties of the metal center. To test for the presence of reactive ligating histidines, a portion of cytochrome c oxidase from the bacteria Thermus thermophilus that contains the Cu-A site (the TtCu(A) protein) was treated with the chemical modifier diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) and the reaction followed through UV-visible, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies at pH 5.0-9.0. A mutant protein (H40A/H117A) with the non-ligating histidines removed was similarly tested. Introduction of an electron-withdrawing DEPC-modification onto the ligating histidine 157 of TtCu(A) increased the reduction potential by over 70mV, as assessed by cyclic voltammetry. Results from both proteins indicate that DEPC reacts with one of the two ligating histidines, modification of a ligating histidine raises the reduction potential of the Cu-A site, and formation of the DEPC adduct is reversible at room temperature. The existence of the reactive ligating histidine suggests that this residue may play a role in modulating the electronic and redox properties of TtCu(A) through kinetically-controlled proton exchange with the solvent. Lack of reactivity by the metalloproteins Sco and azurin, both of which contain a mononuclear copper center, indicate that reactivity toward DEPC is not a characteristic of all ligating histidines.",10.1007/s00775-018-1632-y

Previous data demonstrated that PAs may be transferred from root-feeding larvae into the adult beetles. Here we compared the patterns and concentrations found in larvae and pupae of L. anchusae and L. echii with those of the roots of their respective hosts, Symphytum officinale and Echium vulgare (Boraginaceae). PA patterns and concentrations in the roots were complex and variable, whereas those in the larvae and pupae were simpler and more constant. In L. anchusae, intermedine and lycopsamine were the dominant PAs even if they could not be detected in the roots. In L. echii simpler, hydrolized PAs prevailed. Overall, the concentrations of total PAs of larvae and pupae were significantly higher than those of the roots the larvae had been feeding on. Larvae and pupae of both species also had considerably higher PA concentrations than determined previously for field collected beetles. Possibly the rather immobile juvenile stages enjoy a better protection by higher PA concentrations. On the other hand, we could not detect PAs in eggs of either species, indicating that transmission of appreciable amounts of PAs from mother to offspring does not occur.",10.1007/s10886-018-1010-9

Materials and methods: Seventy-two participants enrolled in this cross-sectional case-control study including HFpEF patients (n = 41) and healthy (n = 31) subjects. Blood samples were collected and serum VEGF, sVEGFR-1 analysis, and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. Results and discussion: The average sVEGFR-1 level of HFpEF patient group was significantly higher than the control group (respectively 0.136 ng/L (0.04-0.34), 0.06 ng/L (0.01-0.25); p < 0.001). The average VEGF level of HFpEF patients using beta blocker was significantly higher than the HFpEF patients not using it (respectively 0.585 +/- 0.194 ng/L; 0.349 +/- 0.269 ng/L; p = 0.025). The average VEGF level of HFpEF patients using statins was significantly higher than the HFpEF patients without a medication (respectively 0.607 +/- 0.099 ng/L; 0.359 +/- 0.273 ng/L; p = 0.038).

J,"Fitch, K",Does the urinary concentration of an inhaled beta-2 agonist always reflect the inhaled dose and method of administration?,"The urinary threshold of 1000 ng/mL for salbutamol was established by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2001 following a study that was not undertaken for that purpose. At least 25 athletes have exceeded this concentration and some after inhaling no more than the permitted daily maximum dose of 1600 mu g. However, there is concern that some providing expert evidence and tribunal members hearing such cases are unaware of the occasional unpredictability of the pharmacokinetics of beta-2 agonists. The World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA's) change from 1 March 2018 to allow correction of urinary specific gravity (SG) down to 1.020 for prohibited substances with a urinary threshold is a major advance and will assist in some instances. However, future cases are anticipated to occur when athletes unexpectedly exceed the urinary threshold for salbutamol after inhaling no more than the allowable dose and within WADA's stated time frame. They will then be required to appear before doping tribunals. The rapidity by which salbutamol is inhaled can influence the resultant urinary concentration and is yet to be addressed adequately in WADA's 2019 Prohibited List. The list's recommended pharmacokinetic study fails to replicate the circumstances that prevailed when the athlete was competing and the adverse analytical finding (AAF) occurred. Tribunals, and experts who advise them, need to be cognizant that the urinary concentration of salbutamol does not invariably reflect the inhaled dose and that a high urinary salbutamol concentration is not always ipso facto evidence of super-dosing with inhaled salbutamol.",10.1002/dta.2546
J,"Fredriksson, J; Bermel, W; Billeter, M",Complete protein assignment from sets of spectra recorded overnight,"A flexible and scalable approach for protein NMR is introduced that builds on rapid data collection via projection spectroscopy and analysis of the spectral input data via joint decomposition. Input data may originate from various types of spectra, depending on the ultimate goal: these may result from experiments based on triple-resonance pulse sequences, or on TOCSY or NOESY sequences, or mixtures thereof. Flexible refers to the free choice of spectra for the joint decompositions depending on the purpose: assignments, structure, dynamics, interactions. Scalable means that the approach is open to the addition of similar or different experiments, e.g. larger proteins may require a wider selection of triple-resonance based experiments. Central to the proposed approach is the mutual support among the different spectra during the spectral analysis: for example, sparser triple-resonance spectra may help decomposing (separating) spin systems in a TOCSY or identifying unique NOEs. In the example presented, backbone plus side chain assignments of ubiquitin were obtained from the combination of either two or three of the following projection experiments: a 4D HCCCONH, a 4D HNCACO and a 3D HNCACB. In all cases, TOCSY data (4D HCCCONH) proved crucial not only for the side chain assignments, but also for the sequential assignment. Even when total recording time was reduced to about 10 h, nearly complete assignments were obtained, with very few missing assignments and even fewer differences to a reference.",10.1007/s10858-019-00226-8

In this study, the mRNA expression of the CTLA4 gene increased significantly in IPEC-J2 cells after Escherichia coli K88 infection. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the 5 flanking region (SNPs g.107281989C>T) and 3-untranslated region (3-UTR; SNPs g.107288753C>A) were identified, and they were in linkage disequilibrium in both Min pigs and the Landrace population. Association analysis showed that Landrace piglets with a TT or AA genotype had a lower diarrhea index, and AA animals had higher average daily gain when compared to CC pigs, respectively (p<0.05). However, the relationship between SNPs and diarrhea and performance traits in the Min population was not significant. Haplotype analysis indicated that the TC haplotype had the lowest diarrhea index. The 5 flanking deletion assay suggested that SNP g.107281989C>T was a molecular marker instead of the functional marker. This research demonstrated that genetic variances in the CTLA4 gene had significant effects on Landrace piglet diarrhea resistance.",10.1007/s11033-018-4536-6
J,"Gautam, A; Beggs, JD",Mutagenesis of Snu114 domain IV identifies a developmental role in meiotic splicing,"Snu114, a component of the U5 snRNP, plays a key role in activation of the spliceosome. It controls the action of Brr2, an RNA-stimulated ATPase/RNA helicase that disrupts U4/U6 snRNA base-pairing prior to formation of the spliceosome's catalytic centre. Snu114 has a highly conserved domain structure that resembles that of the GTPase EF-2/EF-G in the ribosome. It has been suggested that the regulatory function of Snu114 in activation of the spliceosome is mediated by its C-terminal region, however, there has been only limited characterisation of the interactions of the C-terminal domains. We show a direct interaction between protein phosphatase PP1 and Snu114 domain 'IVa' and identify sequence 'YGVQYK' as a PP1 binding motif. Interestingly, this motif is also required for Cwc21 binding. We provide evidence for mutually exclusive interaction of Cwc21 and PP1 with Snu114 and show that the affinity of Cwc21 and PP1 for Snu114 is influenced by the different nucleotide-bound states of Snu114. Moreover, we identify a novel mutation in domain IVa that, while not affecting vegetative growth of yeast cells, causes a defect in splicing transcripts of the meiotic genes, SPO22, AMA1 and MER2, thereby inhibiting an early stage of meiosis.",10.1080/15476286.2018.1561145
J,"Groves, JA; Gillman, C; DeLay, CN; Kroll, TT",Identification of Novel Binding Partners for Transcription Factor Emx2,"The mammalian homolog of Drosophila empty spiracles 2 (Emx2) is a homeobox transcription factor that plays central roles in early development of the inner ear, pelvic and shoulder girdles, cerebral cortex, and urogenital organs. The role for Emx2 is best understood within the context of the development of the neocortical region of the cortex, where Emx2 is expressed in a high posterior-medial to low anterior-lateral gradient that regulates the partitioning of the neocortex into different functional fields that perform discrete computational tasks. Despite several lines of evidence demonstrating an Emx2 concentration-dependent mechanism for establishing functional areas within the developing neocortex, little is known about how Emx2 physically carries out this role. Although several binding partners for Emx2 have been identified (including Sp8, eIF4E, and Pbx1), no screens have been used to identify potential protein binding partners for this protein. We utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen using a library constructed from embryonic mouse cDNA in an attempt to identify novel binding partners for Emx2. This initial screen isolated two potential Emx2-binding partner proteins, Cnot6l and QkI-7. These novel Emx2-binding proteins are involved in multiple levels of mRNA metabolism that including splicing, mRNA export, translation, and destruction, thus making them interesting targets for further study.",10.1007/s10930-019-09810-1

Using NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor (diphenyleneiodonium) or reactive oxygen species scavenger (para-aminobenzoic acid), we suppose that ethanol promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species in Saccharothrix algeriensis, which, in turn, could induce biomass decline and dithiolopyrrolone overproduction.

J,"Harper, B; Fellous, JM",Ground truth construction and parameter tuning for the detection of sleep spindle timing in rodents,"Background: The precise detection of cortical sleep spindles is critical to basic research on memory consolidation in rodents. Previous research using automatic spindle detection algorithms often lacks systematic parameter variations and validations. New Method: We present a method to systematically tune and validate algorithm parameters in automatic spindle detection algorithms using a moderate number of human raters. Results: Comparing a Hilbert transform-based algorithm to a ground truth constructed by six human raters, this method produced a parameter set yielding an F1 score of 0.82 at 10 ms resolution. The algorithm performance fell within the range of human agreement with the ground truth. Both human and algorithm failures arose largely from disagreement in spindle boundaries rather than spindle occurrence. With no additional tuning, the algorithm performed similarly in recordings from different days or rats. Comparison with existing methods: Most spindle detection algorithms do not perform systematic parameter variations and validation using a ground truth. To our knowledge, our study is the first in which rodent spindle data is scored by humans, and in which an automatic spindle detection algorithm is evaluated with respect to this ground truth. The rodent data from this study make it possible to compare our algorithm with others previously tested on human data. Conclusions: We present a general ground truth based approach for the tuning and validation of spindle extraction algorithms and suggest that algorithms aimed at extracting precise spindle timing in rats should use a systematic approach for parameter tuning.",10.1016/j.jneumeth.2018.11.023
J,"He, ZX; Wang, L; Dewan, AT; Leal, SM",MendelProb: probability and sample size calculations for Mendelian studies of exome and whole genome sequence data,"Motivation: For the design of genetic studies, it is necessary to perform power calculations. Although for Mendelian traits the power of detecting linkage for pedigree(s) can be determined, it is also of great interest to determine the probability of identifying multiple pedigrees or unrelated cases with variants in the same gene. For many diseases, due to extreme locus heterogeneity this probability can be small. If only one family is observed segregating a variant classified as likely pathogenic or of unknown significance, the gene cannot be implicated in disease etiology. The probability of identifying several disease families or cases is dependent on the gene-specific disease prevalence and the sample size. The observation of multiple disease families or cases with variants in the same gene as well as evidence of pathogenicity from other sources, e.g. in silico prediction, expression and functional studies, can aid in implicating a gene in disease etiology. MendelProb can determine the probability of detecting a minimum number of families or cases with variants in the same gene. It can also calculate the probability of detecting genes with variants in different data types, e.g. identifying a variant in at least one family that can establish linkage and more the two additional families regardless of their size. Additionally, for a specified probability MendelProb can determine the number of probands which need to be screened to detect a minimum number of individuals with variants within the same gene. Results: A single Mendelian disease family is not sufficient to implicate a gene in disease etiology. It is necessary to observe multiple families or cases with potentially pathogenic variants in the same gene. MendelProb, an R library, was developed to determine the probability of observing multiple families and cases with variants within a gene and to also establish the numbers of probands to screen to detect multiple observations of variants within a gene.",10.1093/bioinformatics/bty542

Here, a new peptide (TC22) with the amino acid sequence MTVVLLLIVLPLLGGVHSSGIL was identified and characterized from the beetle Tribolium castaneum. We found it inhibited the growth and viability of HeLa and MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated the TC22 induced HeLa cell apoptosis, and activated caspase-9 and caspase-3. Furthermore, TC22 led to ROS generation, and triggered p53 transcription and expression. Taken together, our results indicated that TC22 exhibited high anticancer capacity via activating p53, inducing ROS generation and through a mitochondrial pathway. This research provided a novel natural source peptide with strong anticancer capacity. These findings provide some novel insights on the potential candidate reagent in cancer treatment.",10.1007/s00726-018-2666-8
J,"Maldonado, A; Nowicki, J; Pratchett, MS; Schlenk, D",Differences in diet and biotransformation enzymes of coral reef butterflyfishes between Australia and Hawaii,"Many reef fishes are capable of feeding on chemically-defended benthic prey, such as soft (alcyonarian) corals; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underpin allelochemical biotransformation and detoxification. Butterflyfishes (Chaetodon: Chaetdontidae) are a useful group for comparatively exploring links between biotransformation enzymes and diet, because they commonly feed on chemically defended prey. Moreover, diets of some species vary among geographic locations. This study compares gene expression, protein and enzymatic activity of key detoxification enzymes (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2, 3, epoxide hydrolase, glutathione transferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) in livers of four coral-feeding butterflyfish species between Australia and Hawaii, where these fishes differ in diet composition. For C. kleinii, C. auriga, and C. unimaculatus, we found higher CYP2 and CYP3 levels were linked to more allelochemically rich diets in Australia relative to Hawaii. For C. lunulatus from Hawaii CYP2 and CYP3 levels were 1 to 20-fold higher than C. lunulatus from Australia, possibly due to their predominant prey in Hawaii (Porities spp.) being richer in allelochemicals. UGT, GST and epoxide hydrolase varied between species and location and did not correspond to any specific dietary preference or location. Higher levels of CYP2 and CYP3A isozymes in species that feed on allelochemically-rich prey suggest that these biotransformation enzymes may be involved in detoxification of coral dietary allelochemicals in butterflyfishes.",10.1016/j.cbpc.2018.10.004

Many studies in the field of glycobiology have identified the various and complicated biological roles of these glycans which make them perfect molecules to use in labelling and selecting body cells specifically. This study aims at analyzing the modifications in saccharide units of glycans on a cell membrane surfaces of the pancreatic tissue of rats to which normal and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are established. To this end, a MetS model was created through a high fructose diet in Spraque Dawley breed of rats and the pancreatic tissue sections of the group with MetS and control group animals were evaluated comparatively. The targeted saccharide units were examined with Fluorescent Microscope by using two different Fluorescein (FITC) labelled lectins, namely Maackia amurensis-1 lectin [FITC-(MAL-I)] and the Wheat Germ Agglutinin (FITC-WGA). It was observed that FITC-MAL-1-labelled Gal beta 4GlcNAc units did not change much due to high-fructose diet. On the other hand, more GlcNAc, Neu5Ac and beta-GlcNAc units which are labelled with FITC-WGA lectin increase in numbers in pancreatic sections of high fructose diet, compared to control group. Thus, a rapid and specific labelling method, which can identify surface saccharide sequences specifically, was developed. The method can be used in early diagnosis and/or treatment for metabolic diseases.",10.1515/tjb-2017-0194

The fungitoxic effect depended on the substituent and its position in the aromatic ring. Compounds substituted with halogens in meta and/or para positions (compounds 3, 4, 5 and 7), methyl (compounds 8 and 9), methoxyl (compounds 10 and 11), or ethoxy-carbonyl groups (compound 12) presented higher antifungal activity than compound 1, which had an unsubstituted aromatic ring. In addition, compounds with halogens in the ortho position, such as compounds 2 and 6, and a substitution with an acetyl group in the para position (compound 13) were less active. The role of the ABC efflux pump Bctr B-type as a defense mechanism of B. cinerea against these naphthalentrione derivatives was analyzed. This pump could be involved in the detoxification of compounds 2, 6, and 13. On the contrary, this mechanism would not participate in the detoxification of compounds 1, 7, 9 and 12. Finally, the biotransformation of compound 7 by B. cinerea was studied. A mixture of two biotransformed products was obtained.

Aberrant EGFR signalling has implicated in several cancers including MMs. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are new treatment options harbouring deregulated signalling network components. In this study, we aimed to investigate anti-proliferative effect of CL-387,785 in MM cells. Materials and methods: Alteration of cell proliferation was evaluated with using MTS assay. Profile of EGFR, ERK, AKT, JNK and p38 proteins and ELK-1, JUN, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 genes were analysed by western blot and RT-PCR, respectively. Results: Viability of MM cells was inhibited in dose- and time-dependent manner. CL-387,785 affected MM cells earlier and at higher extent compared to the meso-thelial cells. CL-387,785 treatments suppressed EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK, AKT, STAT3 and STAT5 but not SAPK/JNK and p38 in SPC212 cells.

It has been linked to various pathologies, including pain and inflammation. Several peptide and peptidomimetic agonizts for PAR-2 have been developed exhibiting high potency and efficacy. However, the number of PAR-2 antagonists is smaller. We screened the Food and Drug Administration library of approved compounds to retrieve novel antagonists for repositioning in the PAR-2 structure. The most efficacious compound bicalutamide bound to the PAR-2 binding groove near the extracellular domain as observed in the in silico studies. Further, it showed reduced Ca2+ release in trypsin activated cells in a dose-dependent manner. Hence, bicalutamide is a novel and potent PAR-2 antagonist which could be therapeutically useful in blocking multiple pathways diverging from PAR-2 signaling.

Liver HBXIP-/- mice exhibited a phenotype of glycometabolic dysregulation, such as higher fasting blood glucose level, accumulation of hepatic glycogen, recession of blood glucose profiles, and elevation of gluconeogenesis. The expression levels of PEPCK were remarkably up-regulated in the liver tissues of HBXIP-/- mice. Then, we validated that HBXIP expressions were negatively correlated with those of PEPCK in 30 clinical liver tissues.

Our hypothesis is that acid quenching of acridine orange by AeBBMVw is predominantly mediated by Na+/H+ antiport via the NHA1 component of the AeBBMVw in the absence of amino acids and ATP. AeNHA1 is a Na+/H+ antiporter that has been postulated to exchange Na+ and H+ across the apical plasma membrane in posterior midgut of A. aegypti larvae. Its principal function is to recycle the H+ and Na+ that are transported during amino acid uptake, e.g., phenylalanine. This uptake is mediated, in part, by a voltage-driven, Na+-coupled, nutrient amino acid transporter (AeNAT8). The voltage is generated by an H+ V-ATPase. All three components, V-ATPase, antiporter, and nutrient amino acid transporter (VAN), are present in brush border membrane vesicles isolated from whole larvae of A. aegypti. By omitting ATP and amino acids, Na+/H+ antiport was measured by fluorescence quenching of acridine orange (AO) caused by acidification of either the internal vesicle medium (Na-in(+) > Na-out(+)) or the external fluid-membrane interface (Na-in(+) < Na-out(+)). Vesicles with 100 micromolar Na+ inside and 10 micromolar Na+ outside or with 0.01 micromolar Na+ inside and 100 micromolar Na+ outside quenched fluorescence of AO by as much as 30%. Acidification did not occur in the absence of AeBBMVw. Preincubation of AeBBMVw with antibodies to NHA1 inhibit Na+/H+ antiport dependent fluorescence quenching, indicating that AeNHA1 has a significant role in Na+/H+ exchange.",10.1007/s00232-018-0053-8

Methods: FOLR1 mRNA expression data of ovarian cancer were retrieved from the Oncomine database and further analyzed by comparing tumor to healthy tissue. The prognostic value of FOLR1 in ovarian cancer was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier Plotter, an online survival analysis database. Results A total of 439 studies were included in the Oncomine database in multiple types of cancers. Of the 439 studies, there were 54 with statistical differences for the expression of FOLR1, 19 with increased expression of FOLR1 and 35 with decreased expression comparing ovarian cancer to normal ovary tissue. After searching the Oncomine database, six datasets were discovered comparing the mRNA expression in ovarian tumor to healthy tissue. FOLR1 mRNA expression in ovarian tumor was significantly higher than that of normal ovarian tissue (all p<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier Plotter database analyzed the correlation between FOLR1 expression and ovarian cancer patient's prognosis. A significant difference of progression-free survival between FOLR1 high and low expressing groups was found in ovarian cancer patients (HR=1.14, 95%CI: 1.00-1.29, p=0.043).

Moreover, the crystal is stationary during the femtosecond pulse, so reflections are generally only partially recorded. Therefore, each XFEL diffraction image must be scaled individually and, ideally, corrected for partiality prior to merging. An additional complication may arise owing to indexing ambiguities when the symmetry of the Bravais lattice is higher than that of the space group, or when the unit-cell dimensions are similar to each other. Here, an automated method is presented that diagnoses these indexing ambiguities based on the Brehm-Diederichs algorithm [Brehm & Diederichs (2014), Acta Cryst.

J,"Wang, LY; Zhong, K; Ma, J; Liu, J; Xu, H",Learning the initial mechanical response of composite material: structure evolution and energy profile of a plastic bonded explosive under rapid loading,"Plastic bonded explosive (PBX) is a typical composite material used widely in the defense industry and in aerospace engineering. The mechanical behavior of PBX is an important factor to be considered in its formulation design, but the initial mechanical response is not well understood due to the complexities of atomic interactions in a multi-component system. We applied a hybrid force field to investigate the initial mechanical response of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine(RDX)-based PBX, by molecular dynamics. The structure evolution shows that the initial damage occurs mainly in the binder region, and is caused by conformational stretching and void propagation. The relationship between loading rate and initial damage indicates that lower loading rate is more beneficial to conformation relaxation, and consequently to increasing strain limitation. The energy profile indicates that the variation of non-bonded interaction energy, especially coulomb energy, has a significant influence on the variation of total energy. Therefore, when designing PBX, good mechanical strength can be expected by selecting polymer and explosive formulations with strong electrostatic interaction",10.1007/s00894-018-3913-3

Cell growth and proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression were monitored using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, the wound scratch assay, and flow cytometry, respectively. Caspase-3/8/9 activity was examined using the caspase-3/8/9 assay kit. An hydrogen peroxide (H O-2 (2))-induced oxidative-stress damage model was used to study the effect of NYD-SP15 knockdown by examining the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Expressions of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Akt were detected by Western blot analysis. The mRNA chip of NYD-SP15 overexpressed ARPE-19 cells as well as controls were performed by one array plus process.Overexpression (OE) of NYD-SP15 inhibited the proliferation and migration of ARPE-19 cells, and led to apoptosis and caspase-3/9 activation. OE of NYD-SP15 inhibited MAPKs and Akt signaling. Downregulation of NYD-SP15 had no effect on the growth of normally cultured ARP19 cells with 10% fetal bovine serum, but promoted the growth of ARP19 cells in the presence of starvation challenge. Gene chip showed that OE of NYD-SP15 led to downregulation of 254 genes and upregulation of 57 genes. Downregulation of NYD-SP15 also exerted a protective effect on H O-2 (2)-induced cell apoptosis and ROS. NYD-SP15 downregulation led to increments in the expression of Nrf2, Keap-1, and HO-1 in response to 200M H O-2 (2). NYD-SP15 might inhibit the growth, proliferation, and migration and promote apoptosis of ARPE-19 cells via MAPK and Akt signaling. Downregulation of NYD-SP15 could protect ARPE-19 cells from H O-2 (2)-induced oxidative damage by active Keap-1/HO-1/Nrf2, Akt, and MAPK signaling.",10.1002/jcb.27104

In the present study, we aimed to identify the DNA binding proteins (DBPs) in rabbit sperm and to gain further understanding of the molecular mechanism of sperm and exogenous DNA interaction. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used for separating free sperm proteins and complexes of DNA fragment/sperm proteins. A distinct band was found after Coomassie blue staining, and seven potential proteins were identified by mass spectrometry analysis. An analysis of the physical/chemical properties of the seven proteins revealed that the sperm inner acrosomal membrane protein IAM38 (IAM38) matched the features of the DBPs. Western blotting analysis showed that the IAM38 and CD4 were present in the sperm but not in the seminal plasma. Blocking of the IAM38 impaired the DNA-binding capacity of the sperm. Blocking the CD4 decreased the DNA-uptake capacity of the sperm but did not influence the DNA-binding capacity of the sperm. Moreover, the EGFP-positive embryos and EGFP-positive blastocysts were also decreased after IAM38 blocking or CD4 blocking in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, our results imply that foreign DNA first binds to the transmembrane IAM38 of the sperm plasma membrane and then forms the complex of DNA/IAM38/CD4 with CD4 to complete the transportation of exogenous DNA into the nucleus of sperm.",10.1007/s11033-018-4466-3
J,"Zhao, MP; Wang, XJ; Zhou, MF",Correlation between serum Hcy level and severity of chronic HBV hepatitis,"Objective The aim of this work was to investigate the serum homocysteine (Hcy) level and severity of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Methods 72 patients with chronic HBV and 28 healthy controls were included in this work. Of the included 72 chronic HBV hepatitis patients, 20 patients had mild disease, 31 had moderate disease and 21 had severe disease. The serum homocysteine (Hcy), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBIL) were examined in both HBV hepatitis and control patients. Results Significant statistical difference was observed for serum Hcy, ALT, AST and TBIL in different groups (p<0.05). The serum Hcy, ALT, AST and TBIL in the severe group were significantly higher than those of other groups with statistical difference (p<0.05); significant correlation was observed between serum Hcy and AST in the moderate (r=0.43, p<0.05) and severe disease groups (r=0.63, p<0.05). However, the correlation between Hcy and ALT, and Hcy and TBIL were not statistically significant in any group (p>0.05). Conclusion The serum Hcy level in patients with hepatitis B reflects the damage to the of liver. The continuous increase of serum Hcy level can be regarded as a risk factor for the progression of hepatitis, and it can be used as serological marker for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.",10.1515/pteridines-2019-0007

The purpose of the current study is to assess the activity of a novel-engineered IFN-alpha 2b. The crystallographic structure of IFN-alpha 2b and its receptors was acquired from Protein Data Bank. Various amino acid substitutions were designed based on structural properties and other biological characteristics of residues to find the most effective amino acid on IFN affinity to advanced activities. The IFN-alpha 2b mutants and receptors have been modeled and the interactions between two proteins have been studied as in silico by protein-protein docking for both mutants and native forms. The proper nucleic acid sequence IFN-alpha 2 (T79Q) has been prepared based on the selected mutant. The modified IFN gene was cloned in pcDNA 3.1(-) and introduced to Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. Antiviral and antiproliferative assays of native and IFN-alpha 2 (T79Q) proteins were performed in vitro.

It was based on measuring the CC signal of methanol released from an aqueous solution during the temperature increasing. When the temperature of AKD MP reached, the AKD granules floated on the surface aqueous solution was liquidized and completely isolated the methanol transfer from the solution to the headspace. Thus, a transition point, corresponding to the MP of AKD wax, was observed when plotting the GC signal of methanol vs. the temperature. The results showed that the method has a good measurement precision (RSD <0.68%) and accuracy (the relative differences were < 7.16%, compared to a reference method). The present method is simple, accurate and particularly suitable to be used in the batch sample testing. This new measurement concept can be also adopted to many related applications.

In the current study, in addition to confirming its antiapoptotic function in neuronal survival, we demonstrated that the spatial-temporal expression profile of B23 during development of hippocampal neurons is high in the embryonic stage, down-regulated after birth, and preferentially localized at the tips of growing neuritis and branching points. Overexpression of B23 promotes axon growth with abundant branching points in growing hippocampal neurons, but depletion of B23 impairs axon growth, leading to neuronal death. Following injury to the trisynaptic path in hippocampal slice, overexpression of B23 remarkably increased the number and length of regenerative fibers in the mossy fiber path. Our study suggests that B23 expression in developing neurons is essential for neuritogenesis and axon growth and that up-regulation of B23 may be a strategy for enhancing the reconstitution of synaptic paths after injury to hippocampal synapses.

DNA sample pooling combined with massive parallel sequencing is a powerful tool for discovering DNA variants (polymorphisms) in large analysing populations, which is the base of such research fields as Genome-Wide Association Studies, evolutionary and population studies, etc. Usage of overlapping pools where each sample is present in multiple pools can enhance the accuracy of polymorphism detection and allow identifying carriers of rare-variants. Surprisingly there is a lack of tools for result interpretation and carrier identification, i.e. for depooling.ResultsHere we present s-dePooler, the application for analysis of pooling experiments data. s-dePooler uses the variants information (VCF-file) and the pooling scheme to produce a list of candidate carriers for each polymorphism. We incorporated s-dePooler into a pipeline (dePoP) for automation of pooling analysis.

Multivariate analysis showed that Cpd 861 significantly reversed the metabolic perturbation induced by BDL to normal state, which is in agreement with the serum biochemical and histopathological findings. 15 metabolites were screened as potential biomarkers. Eight metabolic pathways were recognized as the most relevant pathways, involving dysfunction of amino acids metabolism and synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, phospholipids metabolism, and others.

J,"Guadagnin, E; Bagchi, D; Sinha, I; Neppl, RL",Nuclear localized Akt limits skeletal muscle derived fibrotic signaling,"Skeletal muscle regeneration following injury is a complex multi-stage process involving the recruitment of inflammatory cells, the activation of muscle resident fibroblasts, and the differentiation of activated myoblasts into myocytes. Dysregulation of these cellular processes is associated with ineffective myofiber repair and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins leading to fibrosis. PI3K/Akt signaling is a critical integrator of intra- and intercellular signals connecting nutrient availability to cell survival and growth. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in skeletal muscle leads to hypertrophic growth and a reversal of the changes in body composition associated with obesity and advanced age. Though the molecular mechanisms mediating these effects are incompletely understood, changes in paracrine signaling are thought to play a key role. Here, we utilized modified RNA to study the biological role of the transient translocation of Akt to the myonuclei of maturing myotubes. Using a conditioned medium model system, we show that ectopic myonuclear Akt suppresses fibrogenic paracrine signaling in response to oxidative stress, and that interventions that increase or restore myonuclear Akt may impair fibrosis.

However, the precise pharmacological profile of SR 57227A remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the pharmacological profile of SR 57227A at the 5-HT(3)A and 5-HT(3)AB receptors. We microinjected Xenopus laevis oocytes with human 5-HT(3)A complementary RNA (cRNA) or a combination of human 5-HT(3)A and human 5-HT(3)AB cRNA and performed two electrode voltage clamp recordings of 5-HT(3)A and 5-HT(3)AB receptor current in the presence of SR 57227A. Results showed that SR 57227A acts as partial agonist/partial antagonist at the 5-HT3 receptor. Interestingly, SR 57227A specifically reduced subsequent current amplitudes induced by 5-I-IT or SR 57227A. Based on its 5-HT3 receptor partial agonist/partial antagonist properties, we predict that SR 57227A functions as a serotonin stabilizer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This approach may potentially miss some truly functional genes if both its low and high modes have associations with end-point observation. Such genes act as both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, a scenario that is unlikely but theoretically possible.ResultsWe invented an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to divide patients into low-, middle- and high-expressing groups according to the expression level of a certain gene in both tumor and normal patients. We found one gene, ORMDL3, whose low and high modes were both associated with worse survival and higher tumor grade in breast cancer patients in multiple patient cohorts. We speculate that its tumor suppressor gene role may be real, while its high expression correlating with worse end-point outcome is probably due to the passenger event of the nearby ERBB2's amplification.ConclusionsThe proposed EM algorithm can effectively detect genes having tri-modal distributed expression in patient groups compared to normal genes, thus rendering a new perspective on dissecting the association between genomic features and end-point observations. Our analysis of breast cancer datasets suggest that the gene ORMDL3 may have an unexploited tumor suppressive function.",10.1186/s12859-018-2582-7

Dietary cholesterol (CL), in conjunction with resistance training (RT), has been strongly associated with improvements in lean mass. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two opposing environments on rat skeletal muscle: (1) hindlimb unloading and (2) CL and RT.MethodsIn protocol 1, 13 male Sprague-Dawley rats were unloaded for 28days (HU; n=6) or served as cage controls (CC; n=7). In protocol 2, 42 rats were assigned to 1 of 6 groups: CC (n=7), CC+CL (n=4), RT controls (RTC; n=7), RTC+CL (n=8), RT (n=8) and RT+CL (n=8). RT/RTC consisted of squat-like exercise. RT had weights added progressively from 80 to 410g over 5weeks. CL was supplemented in the chow with either 180ppm (controls) or 1800ppm (CL).

The combined application of the K-means clustering algorithm and the social network analysis theorem enabled the effective calculation of the representative sequence. First, a common sequence is made that has the highest hybridization property to analog sequences. Next, the sequence complementary to the common sequence is designated as a representative sequence'. Based on this, we obtained a representative sequence from multiple analog sequences that are 8-10-bases long.

Labile Hb A(1c) can then undergo slow, largely irreversible, formation of stable Hb A(1c) (the Amadori product). Stable Hb A(1c) is measured to assess diabetic progression after labile Hb A(1c) removal. This study aimed to increase the understanding of the distinctions between labile and stable Hb A(1c) from a mechanistic perspective in the presence of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate is an effector reagent that reversibly binds in the Hb A(1c) pocket and modestly enhances overall NEG rate. The deprotonation of C2 on labile Hb A(1c) in the formation of the Amadori product was previously proposed to be rate-limiting. Computational chemistry was used here to identify the mechanism(s) by which 2,3-BPG facilitates the deprotonation of C2 on labile Hb A(1c). 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate is capable of abstracting protons on C2 and the alpha-nitrogen of labile Hb A(1c) and can also deprotonate water and/or amino acid residues, therefore preparing these secondary reagents to deprotonate labile Hb A(1c). Parallel reactions not leading to an Amadori product were found that include formation of the neutral Schiff base, dissociation of glucose from the protein, and cyclic glycosylamine formation. These heretofore under appreciated parallel reactions may help explain both the selective removal of labile from stable Hb A(1c) and the slow rate of NEG.",10.1080/03630269.2019.1597731

S,"Abdelatti, M; Schofield, P; Christ, D",Expression of Human VH Single Domains as Fc Fusions in Mammalian Cells,"Single-domain antibodies represent an emerging class of antibody fragments with promising therapeutic and diagnostic potential. As a result, multiple strategies have been developed in order to improve their biophysical and/or biological properties. In particular, the fusion of single-domain antibodies to the Fc part of an IgG molecule has become a common protein engineering approach toward this aim. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for a streamlined laboratory-scale production of VH single-domain antibodies as Fc fusions in mammalian cells. Firstly, DNA sequence encoding VH domain of interest fused to an IgG Fc is synthesized as a double-stranded gene fragment. Secondly, the DNA fragment is directly assembled into a restriction enzyme-digested vector in an assembly reaction. Finally, vector carrying the VH-Fc-fusion construct is introduced into suspension-adapted mammalian cells for transient expression of the Fc chimeric fusion. One-week post-transfection, the expressed Fc-fusion protein is purified using protein A/G affinity chromatography. Using this protocol, we were able to clone, express, and purify milligrams of isolated anti-HER2 VH domain as a mouse IgG2c Fc fusion in less than 2 weeks. This protocol can be readily modified to express proteins of interest other than VH domains as Fc fusions.",10.1007/978-1-4939-9145-7_8

Hence, the total phenolic content and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of Fagara zanthoxyloides root and Zingiber officinaie rhizome have been comparatively evaluated. Zingiber officinale cold extract (GC) exhibited highest DPPH scavenging activity as well as the highest TPC while the hot extract from Fagara zanthoxyloides root (FH) had more phenolic content than its cold counterpart. Consequently, the anti-oxidative potential of refined soybean oil fortified with GC and FH was investigated at 65 degrees C (accelerated storage temperature) for a lenght of 24 days. Established indicators such as peroxide, p-anisidine and total oxidation value (TOTOX) were used to monitor the extent of lipid deterioration with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) as the positive control. Generally, GC was more effective in stabilizing the soybean oil. After 24 days of storage, soybean oil fortified with GC, FH and BHA achieved 68.58%, 57.50% and 67.56% retardation in the formation of primary oxidation products respectively. The lowest TOTOX (146.38) value was also observed in GC supplemented oil, suggesting that GC could be effectively employed as a replacement for BHA in soybean oil preservation. Hence, extracts from Zingiber officinaie rhizome and Fagara zanthoxyloides roots can be explored as sources of natural antioxidants for application in the food industry.",10.13005/ojc/350239

Its organoleptic characteristics contribute substantially to its high popularity. The pleasant aromas result from the presence of volatile compounds. The objective of the present work was to study the profiles of volatile constituents of fresh fruiting bodies of five strains of L. edodes. The volatile compounds were extracted by solid phase microextraction method and analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The aromatic profiles of the strains revealed variability. Both alcohols and sulfides were the most abundant volatile compounds. LE6 strain presented the highest number of volatile compounds with predominance of sulfides (dimethyl pentasulfide, s-tetrathiane) and for LE2, the aldehydes were the most representative chemical class with the main volatile being (E)-2-octen-1-al.",10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.2019031167
S,"Acevedo, GR; Alcaráz, PB; Pinilla, C; Gómez, KA",Generation of <i>T</i>. <i>cruzi</i>-Specific Primary CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T Cell Lines from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Isolated from Chagas Disease Patients,"Human CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell lines and clones are valuable tools to explore the role of these cells in the context of diseases, especially in cases in which the main underlying actor is the immune response, like Chagas disease. These cell lines and clones provide a good experimental system to address the phenotypic and functional features of specific T cell subpopulations and furthermore settle the framework necessary for analyzing their antigen/peptide specificity. This chapter details a culture method for the establishment of T. cruzi-specific memory T cell lines from mononuclear cells isolated from Chagas disease patients' peripheral blood. The presented protocol comprises (1) enrichment of memory CD4(+) T cells, (2) stimulation with parasite lysate, (3) evaluation of specificity, and (4) expansion and maintenance of specific T cell lines.",10.1007/978-1-4939-9148-8_24

The current studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of complex III inhibition in the SH-SY5Y cell line to delineate the molecular and cellular processes, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of HD. Method: We treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with AntA in order to establish an in vitro mitochondrial dysfunction model for HD. Differential proteome analysis was performed by the nLC-MS/MS system. Protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis. Results: Thirty five differentially expressed proteins as compared to the vehicle-treated controls were detected. Functional pathway analysis indicated that proteins involved in ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway were up-regulated in AntA-treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and the ubiquitinated protein accumulation was confirmed by immunoblotting. We found that Prothymosin alpha (ProT alpha) was down-regulated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein expression was co-regulated with ProT alpha expression, hence knockdown of ProT alpha in SH-SY5Y cells decreased Nrf2 protein level. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that complex III impairment might downregulate ubiquitin-proteasome function and NRF2/Keapl antioxidant response. In addition, it is likely that downregulation of Nrf2 is due to the decreased expression of ProT alpha in AntA-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Our results could advance the understanding of mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative diseases.",10.2174/1570164615666180713110139

We studied HIV-1 CRF63_02A1 integrase (IN_CRF) catalyzing the incorporation of viral DNA into the genome of an infected cell. The consensus sequence was designed, recombinant integrase was obtained, and its DNA-binding and catalytic activities were characterized. The stability of the IN_CRF complex with the DNA substrate did not differ from the complex stability for subtype A and B integrases; however, the rate of complex formation was significantly higher. The rates and efficiencies of 3'-processing and strand transfer reactions catalyzed by IN_CRF were found to be higher, too. Apparently, all these distinctive features of IN_CRF may result from specific amino acid substitutions in its N-terminal domain, which plays an important role in enzyme multimerization and binding to the DNA substrate. It was also found that the drug resistance mutations Q148K/G140S and G118R/E138K significantly reduce the catalytic activity of IN_CRF and its sensitivity to the strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir. Reduction in sensitivity to raltegravir was found to be much stronger in the case of double-mutation Q148K/G140S.",10.32607/20758251-2019-11-1-14-22
