However, few studies have reported the clinical characteristics and correlates of anger attacks among Chinese patients with OCD. Methods: A total of 90 adults with a primary diagnosis of OCD, ranging from 15 to 78 years old, participated in the study. Participants were administered the Rage Outbursts and Anger Rating Scale (ROARS), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale-Second Edition, and Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale by a trained clinician. Patients completed the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Results: A total of 31.3% of participants reported anger outbursts in the past week, and ROARS scores had no significant correlation with age, duration of illness, OCD severity, depression, or stress. However, ROARS scores were negatively related to education level, and positively related to obsessing symptoms and anxiety. Conclusions: These data suggest that anger attacks are relatively common in Chinese patients with OCD. The severity of anger attacks is related to educational level, obsessing symptoms, and anxiety, which may be a latent variable reflecting executive functioning and emotion regulation skills.",10.1631/jzus.B1800450
J,"Zhao, HX; Li, XY; Guan, WY; Han, XT",Impact of co-blocking the costimulatory signals on immune-related genes after high-risk rabbit corneal allograft using 2nd-generation DNA sequencing technology,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact and mechanism of co-blocking of costimulatory signals CD28-B7-CD40-CD40L during immune allograft rejection. Forty-eight recipient rabbits were prepared as a high-risk corneal allograft model. After surgery, the animals were randomly divided into: control group, MR1 group, anti-B7 group, and co-blocking group (n=12, each group). Subconjunctival injection was first performed on the allograft surgery day until post-surgery day five. Four weeks later, or when immune rejection occurred, the cornea was sampled to detect and analyze the gene spectrum. The survival time in the co-blocking group was significantly longer than that in the other three groups (p < 0.05). Gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of genes associated with immune rejection, interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, and IL-2 was down-regulated in the co-blocking group, while IL-10 was up-regulated, but the changes in nuclear factor-kappa B and interferon-gamma were not significant. In conclusion, the co-blocking of costimulatory signals can significantly reduce genes that promote corneal allograft rejection. The inhibition of corneal allograft rejection gene expression was significantly enhanced. These gene expression results can explain the conclusion of previous work at the genetic level.",10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2018-0150

One of the plant responses to stress conditions is expression of a large number of genes whose products are involved in various adaptive functions. Transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of gene expression, modulating the transcription initiation rate of target genes; they are critical components in signal transduction in response to abiotic stress. Our hypothesis is that genotypes with contrasting tolerance signal water deficit through TFs (10 genes of the DREB family and bZIP) with differing degrees of expression. We believe that these genes will have greater expression in the flooded genotype because drought is an atypical condition in these plants. We tested two rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes: BRS Querencia (flooded) and AN Cambara (dryland). When they reached stage V5, the plants were submitted to water deficit, at different levels of soil moisture, 20%, 10% and recovery. In general, we observed that expression varies according to the soil moisture and the genotype. In addition, the coexpression analysis generated seven cluster interactions with several genes. Our hypothesis was confirmed in part; the contrasting genotypes gave different degrees of expression; however, we ca not affirm that the flooded genotype has more significant responses in dry soil because there were variations in expression demonstrating oscillation in metabolism, and the data do not allow us to associate expression with greater drought tolerance.",10.4238/gmr18247
J,"Chen, Q; Zhu, J",Detecting virus-specific effects on post-infection temporal gene expression,"BackgroundDifferent types of viruses have different envelope proteins, and may have their shared or distinctive host-virus interactions which result in various post-infection effects in humans and animals. These effects often do not appear at once but take time to unfold. To characterize the virus-specific effects, we applied a Multivariate Polynomial Time-dependent Genetic Association (MPTGA) method, previously proposed for detecting differences in temporal gene expression traits, to test for the differences in mouse lung transcriptome response to infection of different subtypes of influenza A viruses.ResultsWe compared two methods: the Multivariate Polynomial Time-dependent Genetic Association (MPTGA) method, and the conventional modified t-test, to study the virus-specific effects on mouse lung gene expression. Both methods found H3N2 to be the most different virus among the three viruses tested, with the largest number of genes with H3N2-specific effects. However, the MPTGA method demonstrated much higher power of detection, and the detected genes with virus-specific effects showed better biological relevance.ConclusionsTranscriptome response to virus infection is dynamic. MPTGA which leverages temporal gene expression traits showed increased power in detecting biologically relevant virus-specific effects comparing with conventional t-test method.",10.1186/s12859-019-2653-4

However, the mechanism by which the Akirin1 gene regulates myoblast differentiation still remains unclear. In the present study, we found that ectopic expression of Akirin1 promoted myoblast differentiation by increasing the expression of myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) 4 (MRF4) and myocyte enhancer factor 2B (MEF2B) mRNA. Additionally, we showed that ectopic Akirin1 induced cell cycle arrest by up-regulating p21 mRNA. To further uncover the mechanism by which Akirin1 promotes myoblast differentiation, we showed that the enhanced Akirin1 increased the mRNA expression of P38a. Importantly, the enhanced MRF4 expression by Akirin1 can be abrogated by treatment of SB203580, a p38 inhibitor. Similarly, we found that enhanced MEF2B expression by Akirin1 can be abrogated by treatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. Together, our results indicate that Akirin1 promotes myoblast differentiation by acting on the p38 and PI3K pathways and subsequently inducing the expression of myoblast differentiation factors.",10.1042/BSR20182152
J,"Takaoka, Y; Nagumo, K; Azizah, IN; Oura, S; Iwahashi, M; Kato, N; Ueda, M",A comprehensive <i>in vitro</i> fluorescence anisotropy assay system for screening ligands of the jasmonate COI1-JAZ co-receptor in plants,"The phytohormone (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine regulates many developmental and stress responses in plants and induces protein-protein interactions between COI1, the F-box component of E3 ubiquitin ligase, and jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) repressors. These interactions cause JAZ degradation and activate jasmonate (JA), leading to plant defense responses, growth inhibition, and senescence. Thirteen JAZ subtypes are encoded in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, but a detailed understanding of the physiological functions of these JAZ subtypes remains unclear, partially because of the genetic redundancy of JAZ genes. One strategy to elucidate the complex JA signaling pathways is to develop a reliable and comprehensive binding assay system of the ligands with all combinations of the co-receptors. Herein, we report the development of a fluorescence anisotropy-based in vitro binding assay system to screen for the ligands of the COI1-JAZ co-receptors. Our assay enabled the first quantitative analysis of the affinity values and JAZ-subtype selectivity of various endogenous JA derivatives, such as coronatine, jasmonic acid, and 12-hydroxyjasmonoyl-L-isoleucine. Because of its high signal-to-noise ratio and convenient mix-and-read assay system, our screening approach can be used in plate reader-based assays of both agonists and antagonists of COI1-JAZ co-receptors.",10.1074/jbc.RA118.006639
J,"Liu, YM; Wang, ZH; Zhao, J; Zong, CY; Liu, MY; Niu, YX",Effects of glycerol concentrations on the bioproduction of PGHX by <i>Agrobacterium</i> HX1126,"PGHX is a polymer of beta (1-3)-galactose which posses the gel-forming property. As previously reported in the flask culture experiment, the crude PGHX (24.9 g/L, 48.2% in yield) with the maximum gel strength of 957 g/cm(2) can be generated. However, PGHX produced in the stirred bioreactor had no gel-forming property when using the same medium. Hence, the effects of different glycerol concentrations on both the yield and the gel-forming property of PGHX were investigated and the reason for gel-forming property losing was explored. We proposed a new strategy for the production of PGHX with enhanced gel formation in the stirred bioreactor by mediating both the concentration of carbon source and the duration of fermentation. As a result, we managed to obtain the crude PGHX (22 g/L, 42.4% in yield) with the maximum gel strength of 438 g/cm(2) at 56 h in the bioreactor. This strategy would help the enhancement of PGHX yield in the industrial production.",10.1080/10826068.2019.1591989
J,"Wang, HY; Chen, XB; Zhang, W; Zhou, WH; Liu, X; Rao, ZH",Structural analysis of molybdopterin synthases from two mycobacterial pathogens,"The molybdenum cofactor, composed of molybdopterin and molybdenum, is a necessary compound for the catalytic activity of molybdenum enzymes. Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis is a conserved multistep process involving several enzymes. Molybdopterin synthase, a hetero-tetrameric enzyme composed of a pair of MoaE-MoaD subunits, catalyzes the generation of the cis-dithiolene group of molybdopterin in the second step of the process. The cis-dithiolene group can covalently bind molybdenum. Most mycobacterial species possess several genes encoding the full pathway of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. In M. smegmatis, the moaD2 and moaE2 genes encode the functional molybdopterin synthase. However, M. tuberculosis has genes encoding several molybdopterin synthase subunit homologs, including moaD1, moaD2, moaE1, moaE2, and moaX, which encodes a MoaD-MoaE fusion protein. Previous studies have shown that moaD2 and moaE2 encode functional molybdopterin synthase. Here, we report the crystal structures of two substrate-free molybdopterin synthases from two different mycobacterial pathogens, M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis, at 2.1 angstrom and 2.6 angstrom resolutions, respectively. The overall structure of both molybdopterin synthases was hetero-tetrameric, consisting of a MoaE2 dimer flanked on either side by single MoaD2 subunits. The carboxyl-terminal domain of MoaD2 inserted into MoaE2, forming the active pocket. A comparison with previously reported molybdopterin synthase structures showed that substrate-binding and catalytic residues were conserved, despite low sequence similarity among these enzymes. The low sequence identity at the MoaE-MoaD heterodimer interface may provide the structural basis to explore mycobacterial inhibitors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Gan, L; Chao, YH; Su, HT; Ren, YJ; Yin, SX; Han, LEB",Altered Promoter and G-Box Binding Factor for 1-Deoxy-d-Xylulose-5-Phosphate Synthase Gene Grown from Poa pratensis Seeds after Spaceflight,"In plant cells, the nucleus DNA is considered the primary site of injury by the space environment, which could generate genetic alteration. As the part of genomic mutation, genetic variation in the promoter region could regulate gene expression. In the study, it is observed that there is a deletion in the upstream regulatory region of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 1 gene (PpDXS1) of Poa pratensis dwarf mutant and the PpDXS1 transcript abundance is lower in the dwarf mutant. It is indicated that the deletion in the promoter region between wild type and dwarf mutant could be responsible for the regulation of PpDXS1 gene expression. The PpDXS1 promoter of dwarf mutant shows a lower activity as determined by dual luciferase assay in Poa pratensis protoplast, as well as the GUS activity is lower in transgenic Poa pratensis plant. To further investigate the effect of the deletion in the promoter region on PpDXS1 transcript accumulation, the transient assay and yeast one-hybrid experiment demonstrate that the deletion comprises a motif which is a target of G-box binding factor (GBF1), and the motif correlates with an increase in transactivation by GBF1 protein. Taken together, these results indicate that the deletion in the promoter of PpDXS1 isolated from dwarf mutant is sufficient to account for the decrease in PpDXS1 transcript level and GBF1 can regulate the PpDXS1 gene expression, and subsequently affect accumulation of various isoprenoids throughout the plant.",10.3390/ijms20061398
J,"Li, R; Liang, CH; Jiang, LG; Yuan, C; Huang, MD",Structural determination of group A Streptococcal surface dehydrogenase and characterization of its interaction with urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor,"Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) has caused a wide variety of human diseases. Its multifunctional surface dehydrogenase (SDH) is crucial for GAS life cycle. Furthermore, GAS infection into human pharyngeal cells has been previously shown to be mediated by the interaction between SDH and host urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). However, the structural information of SDH remains to be elucidated and there are few detailed studies to characterize its interaction with uPAR. In-depth research on these issues will provide potential targets and strategies for combating GAS. Here, we prepared recombinant SDH tetramer in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. After purification and crystallization, we determined its crystal structure at 1.74 angstrom. The unique characteristics might be potentially explored as drug targets or vaccine immunogen. We subsequently performed gel filtration chromatography, native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and in vitro pull-down analyses. The results showed that their interaction was too weak to form stable complexes and the role of uPAR involved in GAS infection needs further demonstration. Altogether the current work provides the first view of SDH and deepens the knowledge of GAS infection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.01.102
J,"Jin, X; Zhang, WQ; Shan, BQ",High salinisation risks in a typical semi-arid river network in northern China,"The objective of this study was to investigate the salinisation characteristics of a semi-arid river network in northern China and highlight the influencing factors and risks. The Ziya River Basin, a typical semi-arid river network located in the North China Plain, is studied herein. Overlying water, surface sediment and riparian soil samples were collected in July and December of 2014 in the Ziya River Basin. The results showed that the average concentrations of salt content in the overlying water and surface sediment of 10 rivers in the Ziya River Basin were 1105.64 and 2159.35 mg/L, respectively. High level of salinisation was found in most rivers not only in overlying water, but also in surface sediment. The impact of the salinisation of overlying water on riparian soil diminished with distance away from the shore and had no impact beyond 15 m from the shore. Heavy pollution can contribute greatly to the salinisation of the water column and can cause significant impacts on river sediment and riparian soil. Salinisation in the overlying water affects the sediment and riparian soil, and reveals that the high risk of salinisation in the Ziya River Basin has been underestimated.",10.1080/02757540.2018.1554059
J,"Huang, XJ; Xue, J; Wang, FZ; Li, JF",Enhanced protoplast assay by transfecting PCR-assembled gene expression cassettes with telomeric repeats and thiophosphate modifications,"Transient expression assays are invaluable complements to the stable transgenic assay for studying gene functions by providing desirable time and labor efficiencies and high-throughput potential or circumventing technical difficulties of stable transgenic expression. The protoplast transient expression system is one of the mainstream transient expression assays used in plant research. Here, we developed a PCR amplicon-mediated protoplast transient (PROMPT) assay by using overlapping PCR assembled gene expression cassettes for Arabidopsis protoplast transfection without the need for time- and labor-consuming plasmid construction. When 200 mu l of Arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with 1 mu g of PCR amplicons or plasmid DNA, we detected substantially higher gene expression in the former. Moreover, we found that adding telomeric repeats and thiophosphate modifications to the 5' end of the nonsense strand through the reverse primer could further increase the PCR amplicon-mediated gene expression in protoplasts. Importantly, these improvements could also be applied to the protoplast assays in other dicot and monocot species including tobacco, rice and wheat. In addition, the subcellular localization of immune receptor FLS2 could be analyzed by PROMPT method. The PROMPT assay allows an accelerated and robust transient gene expression in protoplasts from diverse plant species.",10.1016/j.ab.2019.01.003

This analysis involves a total of 70 homologous models of the cruzipain-chagasin complex which were constructed by homology from the combinatory variation of nine papain-like cysteine peptidase structures and seven cysteine protease inhibitor structures (as chagasin-like and cystatin-like inhibitors). Only 32 systems have been evaluated experimentally, Delta G(b)(experimental) values previously reported. Therefore, the result of the multiple analysis in terms of the thermodynamic parameters, are shown as relative energy |Delta Delta G| = |Delta G(b)(from) (FoldX) - Delta G(b)(experimental)|. Nine models were identified that recorded |Delta Delta G| < 1.3, five models to 2.8 > |Delta Delta G| > 1.3 and the other 18 models, values of |Delta Delta G| > 2.8. The energetic analysis of the contribution of Delta H and Delta S to Delta G(b) to the 14-molecular model presents a Delta G(b) mostly Delta H-driven at neutral pH and at an ionic strength (I) of 0.15 M. The dependence of Delta G(b)(I,pH) at 298 K to the cruzipain-chagasin complex predicts a linear dependence of Delta G(b)(I). The computational protocol allowed the identification and prediction of thermodynamics binding energy parameters for cruzipain-chagasin-like heterodimers.",10.3390/ijms20061320

However, study of a coumarin base has not been explored. Using nucleophilic substitution and phosphoramidite chemistry, we synthesized a coumarin base-containing oligonucleotide. Upon exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light, the coumarin-modified oligonucleotide formed ICLs with complementary oligonucleotide containing dT and dC opposite the coumarin base, presumably through a [2 + 2] cycloaddition mechanism. Moderate yields with both bases were observed; though, dT has a higher reactivity than dC. Overall, this work provides new means for biochemical characterization of ICLs formed by coumarins.",10.1080/15257770.2018.1515439

We previously assessed 3244 FDA-approved drugs via ""computational conformer selection"" for inhibiting MDM2 and p53 interaction. Here, we developed a surface plasmon resonance method to experimentally confirm the inhibitory effects of the known MDM2 inhibitor, nutlin-3a, and two drug candidates predicted by our computational method. This p53/MDM2 interaction displayed a dosage-dependent weakening when MDM2 is pre-mixed with drug candidates. The inhibition efficiency order is nutlin-3a (IC50 = 97 nM) > bepridil (206 nM) > azelastine (307 nM). Furthermore, we verified their anti-proliferation effects on SJSA-1 (wild-type p53 and overexpressed MDM2), SW480 (mutated p53), and SaOs-2 (deleted p53) cancer cell lines. The inhibitory order towards SJSA-1 cell line is nutlin-3a (IC50 = 0.8 mu M) > bepridil (23 mu M) > azelastine (25 mu M). Our experimental results are in line with the computational prediction, and the higher IC50 values from the cell-based assays are due to the requirement of higher drug concentrations to penetrate cell membranes. The anti-proliferation effects of bepridil and azelastine on the cell lines with mutated and deleted p53 implied some p53-independent anti-proliferation effects.",10.1016/j.ab.2019.01.012

Identifying the combination of sourcing germline genes is critical to understand the process of antibody maturation, which may facilitate the diagnostics and rapid generation of human monoclonal antibodies in therapeutics. Despite of successful efforts in V and J fragment assignment, method in D segment tracing remains weak for immunoglobulin heavy diversity (IGHD).ResultsIn this paper, we presented a D-sensitive mapping method called DSab-origin with accuracies around 90% in human monoclonal antibody data and average 95.8% in mouse data. Besides, DSab-origin achieved the best performance in holistic prediction of VDJ segments assignment comparing with other methods commonly used in simulation data. After that, an application example was explored on the antibody response based on a time-series antibody sequencing data after influenza vaccination. The result indicated that, despite the personal response among different donors, IGHV3-7 and IGHD4-17 were likely to be dominated gene segments in these three donors.ConclusionsThis work filled in a computational gap in D segment assignment for VDJ germline gene identification in antibody research.

J,"Navarro, J","Fine-Tuning of GPCR Chemokine-Interactions. Design and Identification of Chemokine Analogues as Receptor Agonists, Biased Agonists, and Antagonists","Chemokines play important roles in immune defense by directing migration of leukocytes and serve as key promoters of tumorigenesis and metastasis. This study explores the molecular mechanisms of recognition and activation of two homologous chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, using CXCL8 analogues with residue substitutions in the conserved Glu4LeuSArg6 (ELR) triad. Analysis of the binding of CXCL8 analogues to CXCR1 is consistent with the two-site model for signal recognition of CXCR1, whereas analysis of the binding of CXCL8 analogues to CXCR2 supported a single-site model for signal recognition of CXCR2. The CXCL8-Arg6His analogue stimulated calcium release, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and chemotaxis in cells expressing CXCR1. However, CXCL8-Arg6His failed to stimulate calcium release and chemotaxis in cells expressing CXCR2, although it stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, indicating that CXCL8-Arg6His operated as a classical CXCR2 biased agonist. The CXCL8-Glu4AlaLeuSAlaArg6His analogue was inactive in cells expressing CXCR1 and CXCR2. These findings suggest that the Glu4LeuS motif in CXCL8 is essential for activation of CXCR1 and CXCR2. Importantly, CXCL8-Glu4AlaLeuSAlaArg6His blocked specifically the calcium release and chemotaxis of cells expressing CXCR1 but not of cells expressing CXCR2. CXCL8-Glu4AlaLeuSAlaArg6His was identified as the first specific CXCR1 antagonist. The binding of CXCL8-ELR6H to CXCR1 created a Zn2+ coordination site at the receptor activation domain responsible for calcium release, as ZnCl2 specifically blocked CXCL8-Arg6His-induced calcium release without affecting CXCL8-induced calcium release. This work provides the basis for further exploration of the activation mechanisms of chemokine receptors and will assist in the design of the next generation of modulators of CXCR1 and CXCR2.",10.1021/acs.biochem.8b01266

PE is a multifactorial disorder associated with poor placentation, placental hypoxia, poor angiogenesis and excessive maternal inflammation. Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a multifunctional peptide, plays an important role in the establishment and maintenance of healthy pregnancy, prevents an immune attack at peri-implantation period, vasodilation and promotes angiogenesis. In the present study, we enrolled a total of 600 subjects which includes 300 PE patients and 300 healthy pregnant women from South India to analyse two functional polymorphisms (rs4399321A/G and rs4910118C/T) of ADM gene. The genotype frequencies of these two polymorphisms differed significantly between the PE and control groups (p=0.02 and p=0.03). Individuals carrying the AA genotype of rs4399321A/G were slightly higher in controls (40%) compared to patients (28%) and revealed an OR value of (0.69, CI 0.49-0.98; p=0.05) suggests the protective role.

J,"Fernandes, MT; Caroço, LS; Pacheco-Leyva, I; dos Santos, NR",NF-κB-dependent RANKL expression in a mouse model of immature T-cell leukemia,"Activation of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK) by its ligand (RANKL) is involved in both solid and hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell leukemia. Although RANKL expression has been described in normal T cells, a potential role in T-cell leukemia remains undefined. Here, we used a model of immature T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, the TEL-JAK2 transgenic mice, to assess RANKL expression in leukemic cells and its regulatory mechanisms. We found that Rankl mRNA was significantly overexpressed in leukemic T cells when compared to wild-type thymocytes, their nonmalignant counterparts. Moreover, Rankl mRNA and RANKL surface expression in leukemic cells was induced by T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling activation, dependently on the NFKB signaling pathway. These results indicate that TCR-activated leukemic T cells express high levels of RANKL and are potential inducers of RANK signaling in microenvironmental cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of the thalassemia gene indicated beta(codon 17)/beta(A) (HBB: c.52A>T), while Hb analysis showed significantly increased Hb F levels. The proband was diagnosed to carry beta-TI, and a blood transfusion regimen together with iron chelation treatment was recommended. Due to the difference between the phenotype and genotype, next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed and the proband was found to carry a homozygous mutation on the SPTB gene combined with a heterozygous mutation in KLF1.

The proband was finally diagnosed with HS and HPFH complicated with a beta-thal trait and the high percentage of Hb F was believed to be ascribed to the KLF1 gene mutation, which is frequent in areas where thalassemia is prevalent. For patients with a beta gene mutation accompanying significantly high percentage of Hb F, the diagnosis of beta-TI could be warranted, and the influence of the KLF1 gene mutation should be carefully excluded to avoid misdiagnosis of other types of hereditary hemolytic diseases.",10.1080/03630269.2019.1620764

In this work we have demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide donor NaHS is able to protect both cell types from the negative action of laser irradiation and the magnitude of protection depends on NaHS concentration. The mechanism of cell protection by NaHS is primarily attributable to its effects on intracellular processes occurring after irradiation, since the protective effect does not depend on whether NaHS is added before or after irradiation. Moreover, NaHS is able to exert its protective effect even when added 6 hours post irradiation.",10.1134/S002689331902002X

The second step usually requires a counterselection method, because the efficiency of recombination is not high enough to find recombinants among non-recombinant cells. Most counterselection methods require the introduction of additional mutations into the genome or the use of expensive chemicals. In this paper, we describe the development of a reliable procedure for the removal of an antibiotic resistance marker from the E. coli genome without the need for counterselection. For this purpose, we used dsDNA cassettes consisting of two regions homologous to the sequences that flank the marker on the chromosome. We optimized the length of the homologous regions, the electroporation conditions, and the duration of recovery for the electroporated cells in order to maximize the recombination efficiency. Using the optimal parameters identified, we obtained a rate of 4-6% recombinants among the transformed cells. This high efficiency allowed us to find marker-less, antibiotic sensitive recombinants by replica plating without the need for selection.",10.1016/j.mimet.2019.01.022

In Drosophila there are hundreds of polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA), and various mechanisms are known to achieve this. However, proteins in a same mRNA often work in the same cellular mechanism, this is not the case for Drosophila's Swc6/p18(Hamlet) homolog Dmp18, part of the SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex, who is encoded in a bicistronic mRNA next to Dmp8 (Dmp8-Dmp18 transcript), a structural component of transcription factor TFIIH. The organization of these two genes as a bicistron is conserved in all arthropods, however the length of the intercistronic sequence varies from more than 90 to 2 bases, suggesting an unusual translation mechanism for the second open reading frame. We found that even though translation of Dmp18 occurs independently from that of Dmp8, it is necessary for Dmp18 to be in that conformation to allow its correct translation during cellular stress caused by damage via heat-shock and UV radiation.",10.1002/jcb.27670

Comparison of two papers reporting biological variation results for S100-β and neuron-specific enolase proteins,"The Biological Variation Data Critical Appraisal Checklist (BIVAC) has been designed to evaluate biological variation (BV) studies and the reliability of the associated BV estimates. To illustrate its utility, two studies delivering within-subject BV (CVI) data for S100-beta protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), markers typically used for melanoma and neuroendocrine tumors, respectively, were appraised using BIVAC. Data from the European Biological Variation Study (EuBIVAS) and the recently published Johnson et al. study (ref n 11) were scored using the 14 BIVAC quality items (QI), with alternatives A, B, C and/or D to verify whether the elements required to obtain reliable BV data, were present and appropriately documented. Grade A indicates compliance with all the QIs and D indicates non compliance. The sizes of the confidence interval (CI) around the CVI estimates were also compared. Johnson's study received a BIVAC grade C, EuBIVAS a grade A. EuBIVAS is a large scale study, with 1609 and 1728 results for NSE and S100-beta, respectively. In Johnson's study, only 40 results were available. The EuBIVAS CVI estimates [NSE, 10.9% (10.3-11.5); S100-beta, 10.2% (9.6-10.7)] were clearly lower than Johnson's CV(I)s [NSE, 22.1% (9.9-34.3); S100-beta, 18.9% (8.5-29.4)]. The overlapping CI between the two estimates are caused by Johnson's CI being about 20 times larger than the corresponding EuBIVAS CI. It is likely that studies that do not comply with all BIVAC QI deliver less reliable, and possibly too high, CVI estimates.

Their tasks are to monitor drug abuse, the use of metadone and buprenorphine and the diagnosis and monitoring of alcoholism through the screening of urine and serum samples. From this long-lasting experience, we realized that one of the main critical concern of this activity is the implementation and the maintenance of the custody chain, that is especially needed in the presence of forensic issues. The aim of this paper is to analyze the Italian national and regional laws and administrative indications on this topic. We dedicated a particular interest to the rules established by the Regione Campania, where the laboratory is situated. After considering that a high percentage of samples non-conformities were due to the lack of a proper chain of custody (i.e. 66.7%), we adopted a specific procedure based on the use of a dedicated kit containing both the tubes for a safe sample collection and the related documents.

This approach has more recently been proposed for the detection of oncogenic alterations in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or urine through the use of sensitive technologies, mainly digital PCR (ddPCR) and massive parallel sequencing (MPS). Liquid biopsies have the advantage of overcoming some of the drawbacks associated with tumor biopsies, being blood samples easy to obtain from patients. Plasma ctDNA may better represent the total landscape of oncogenic alterations found across all tumor sites. Several commercially available liquid biopsy platforms based on MPS technology are currently analytically validated, with sensitivities, specificities, false negative rates, false positive rates, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values evaluated in comparison with tissue.

J,"Carugo, O",Globular protein backbone conformational disorder in crystal structures,"Proteins are not static molecules but dynamic entities able to modify their structure for several reasons, from the necessity to recognize partners to the regulation of their thermodynamic stability. Conformational disorder is frequent in protein structures and atoms can have, in protein crystal structures, two or more alternative, equilibrium positions close to each other. Here, a set of protein crystal structures refined at very high resolution (1 angstrom or better) is examined to characterize the conformational disorder of the backbone atoms, which is not infrequent: about 15% of the protein backbone atoms are conformationally disordered and three quarters of them have been deposited with two or more equilibrium positions (most of the others were not detected in the electron density maps). Several structural features have been examined and it was observed that C atoms tend to be disordered more frequently than the other backbone atoms, likely because their disorder is induced by disordered side chains: side-chain disorder is two times more frequent than backbone disorder. Surprisingly, backbone disorder is only slightly more frequent in loops than in helices and strands and this is in agreement with the observation that backbone disorder is a localized phenomenon: in about 80% of the cases, it is observed in one amino acid and not in its neighbors. However, although backbone disorder does not cluster along the polypeptide sequence, it tends to cluster in 3D, since backbone-disordered amino acids distant in sequence are close in the 3D space.",10.1007/s00726-018-2683-7

J,"Chen, H; Gao, YS; Liu, XZ; Zhou, ZX",Imaging through scattering media using semidefinite programming,"A clear image of an observed object may deteriorate into unrecognizable speckle when encountering heterogeneous scattering media, thus it is necessary to recover the object image from the speckle. A method combining least square and semidefinite programming is proposed, which can be used for imaging through scattering media. The proposed method consists of two main stages, that is, media scattering characteristics (SCs) estimation and image reconstruction. SCs estimation is accomplished through LS concept after establishing a database of known object-and-speckle pairs. Image reconstruction is realized by solving an SDP problem to obtain the product of the unknown object image and its Hermitian transposition. Finally, the unknown object image can be reconstructed by extracting the largest rank-1 component of the product. Structural similarity (SSIM) index is employed as a performance indicator in speckle prediction and image reconstruction. Numerical simulations and physical experiments are performed to verify the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method. Compared with the existing phase shift interferometry mean square optimization method and the single-shot phase retrieval algorithm, the proposed method is the most precise to obtain the best reconstruction results with highest SSIM index value. The work can be used for exploring the potential applications of scattering media, especially for imaging through turbid media in biomedical, scattering property measurement, and optical image encryption.

Methods: VhChiP and its mutants were expressed and purified from BL21 (DE3) Omp8 Rosetta strain. After reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers, the ion current fluctuations caused by chitohexaose entering the channel were measured in deuterium oxide and in water. Results: The role of hydrogen-bonding in sugar binding was investigated by comparing channel occlusion by chitohexaose in buffers containing H2O and D2O. The BLM results revealed the significant contribution of hydrogen bonding to the binding of chitohexaose in the constriction zone of VhChiP. Replacing H2O as solvent by D2O significantly decreased the on- and off-rates of sugar penetration into the channel. The importance of hydrogen bonding inside the channel was more noticeable when the hydrophobicity of the constriction zone was diminished by replacing Trp(136) with the charged residues Asp or Arg. The on- and off-rates decreased up to 2.5-fold and 4-fold when Trp(136) was replaced by Arg, or 5-fold and 3-fold for Trp(136) replacement by Asp, respectively. Measuring the on-rate at different temperatures and for different channel mutants revealed the activation energy for chitohexaose entrance into VhChiP channel.

Lowdin partitioning is used to perform the two-state reductions necessary to compute the tunneling matrix element between D and A sites. Here, a method of performing donor and acceptor state analysis for a non-orthogonal basis set in both the weak and strong electronic coupling regimes is developed. The electron tunneling current and coupling are obtained in terms of D-A symmetric and antisymmetric interatomic tunneling elements, and are then used to compare pathway models. These interatomic tunneling elements are both proportional to the Green's function elements of the isolated protein bridge. To facilitate a perturbative treatment of antisymmetric interatomic tunneling currents, we found a well-known expression for the D-A tunneling matrix element in terms of transformed Green's function matrix elements of the isolated protein bridge. Also, the relationship of the tunneling matrix element to BO pathways is discussed using the symmetric interatomic coupling.

From our study, it is evident that the termination of Si-surface via the dehydrogenation of aforementioned ethane and NH3BH3 derivatives is more feasible compared to Ge-surface. For ethane, the investigation shows that the substitution of non-participating hydrogens with +I group (electron donating) causes an enhancement in the kinetic and thermodynamic feasibility of the termination process, whereas the implementation of -I substituent (electron withdrawing) makes an adverse effect. While exploring the termination of Si- as well as Ge-surfaces through the dehydrogenation of NH3BH3 and its derivatives, it is noticed that from both the kinetic as well as thermodynamic perspectives, the termination processes are more feasible than that of ethane and its derivatives. We have further examined the detailed mechanism of each termination process by analyzing the geometrical parameters and NPA charges. From bonding evaluation, it is evident that the hydrogen abstraction from ethane by both the surfaces is symmetric in nature, where both the hydrogens show slightly positive charge. But for NH3BH3 the hydrogen abstraction process becomes asymmetric, where the boron associated hydrogen is abstracted as hydride by the electrophilic surface Si (Ge) and the hydrogen bonded with the N-centre is abstracted as proton by the nucleophilic surface Si (Ge). Overall, the present theoretical work reveals one of the efficient chemical processes for terminating Si as well as Ge(100)-2 x 1 reconstructed surfaces through the formation of non-polar Si-H bonds.

We in this study analyzed the conformations of ligands under the non-specific binding on a protein surface to figure out the differences in the conformational characteristics in aqueous solution using the 55-ns molecular dynamic simulation. As for the protein surface, we constructed an artificial beta-sheet, composed of poly-alanine residues (Ala-sheet). For the ligands, the four alpha-thrombin inhibitors possessing two scaffolds with distinct hydrophobicity profiles were used. During the simulation, all the inhibitors kept interaction with Ala-sheet and had the limited conformational fluctuations compared with in aqueous solution. The representative conformations obtained from the cluster analysis showed that two of hydrophobic inhibitors adopted the extended conformations in aqueous solution and also on Ala-sheet. For the other two hydrophilic inhibitors, the conformations in aqueous solution adopted the bent conformation with two terminal hydrophobic rings closely packed. On Ala-sheet, contrarily, the two hydrophobic rings were open and took the extended conformations, which were placed on the sheet as a foothold. The charged moieties in the hydrophilic inhibitors were protruded into aqueous environment with the extended conformation. The conformational characteristics of the inhibitors in aqueous solution and Ala-sheet varied likely by chemical features or structures of the inhibitors, but each was considered to be physicochemically reasonable.

Identifying post-nerve injury phenomena is key to assessing the merit and timing of surgery as well as to tracking nerve recovery postoperatively. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been investigated in the clinical and research settings as a noninvasive technique to both assess and monitor each patient's unique case of peripheral nerve damage. New method: We identify a MRI-suitable marker for tracking the exact site of either nerve injury or coaptation following surgical repair to aid with DTI analysis. Results: Due to artefact and disruption of tractography, silver wire and microvascular clips were not suitable markers. AxoGuard (R), 4-0 vicryl suture, and 10-0 polyamide suture, although detectable, did not produce a signal easily distinguished from post-surgical changes. Silicone was easily identifiable and stable in both the acute and delayed time points, exhibited negligible impact on DTI parameters, and possessed geometry to prevent nerve strangulation. Comparison with existing method: Prior studies have not assessed the efficacy of other markers nor have they assessed silicone for potential artefact with DTI parameter analysis. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the reliability and compatibility of silicone in the delayed postoperative time period and includes its unique imaging appearance on high-resolution 11.7 MRI. Conclusion: Semi-cylindrical silicone tubing can be used as a safe, reliable, and readily available radiological marker to visualize and monitor a region of interest on a rodent's peripheral nerve for aiding assessments with diffusion tensor imaging.",10.1016/j.jneumeth.2018.12.019

MethodsA total of 36 male monkeys were randomly divided into four groups and fed human diets with high sugar, high fat, double high sugar and fat, and a normal diet. The preclinical diabetes phase was determined by monitoring the metabolic characteristic indices and the results of oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). The mRNA expression of 45 diabetes-related genes in peripheral blood leukocytes was analyzed using real-time PCR. ResultsA total of 22, 25, and 21 genes were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05) and 5, 7, and 5 genes were significantly down-regulated (P < 0.05) in the above three induced groups, respectively, compared with the control group. Of the 45 tested genes, the expression profiles of 21 genes were consistent. Most of the expression levels in the double high sugar-and-fat individuals were slightly lower than those in the high glucose and high fat groups, although the expression patterns of the three groups were essentially similar. ConclusionThe different high energy diets all induced diabetes and shared some phenotypic properties with human T2DM. Most of the expression patterns of the related genes were identical.

J,"Kaiser, F; Labudde, D",Unsupervised Discovery of Geometrically Common Structural Motifs and Long-Range Contacts in Protein 3D Structures,"The essential role of small evolutionarily conserved structural units in proteins has been extensively researched and validated. A popular example are serine proteases, where the peptide cleavage reaction is realized by a configuration of only three residues. Brought to spatial proximity during the protein folding process, such structural motifs are often long-range contacts and usually hard to detect at sequence level. Due to the constantly increasing resource of protein 3D structure data, the computational identification of structural motifs can contribute significantly to the understanding of protein fold and function. Thus, we propose a method to discover structural motifs of high geometrical similarity and desired sequence separation in protein 3D structure data. By utilizing methods originated from data mining, no a priori knowledge is required. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by the identification of the catalytic unit of serine proteases and the ion-coordination center of cupredoxins. Furthermore, large-scale analysis of the entire Protein Data Bank points towards the presence of ubiquitous structural motifs, independent of any specific fold or function. We envision that our method is suitable to uncover functional mechanisms and to derive fingerprint libraries of structural motifs, which could be used to assess protein family association.",10.1109/TCBB.2017.2786250

The miCloud can be easily deployed without any prior bioinformatics expertise on any computing environment, from a laboratory computer workstation to a university computer cluster. Our platform not only provides access to a set of preconfigured RNA-Seq and CHIP-Seq bioinformatics pipelines, but also enables users to develop or install new preconfigured tools from the large selection available on open-source online Docker container repositories. The miCloud built-in analysis pipelines are also integrated with the Visual Omics Explorer framework (Kim et al., 2016), which provides rich interactive visualizations and publication-ready graphics from the next-generation sequencing data.

OSM1 genetically interacts with ERO1, which encodes an essential ER oxidoreductase for disulfide-bond formation under anaerobic conditions. However, the detailed enzymatic mechanisms involved in this interaction and the cellular roles of Osm1 are not fully understood. In this study, monomeric and stable recombinant Osm1 was successfully prepared for structural study. During purification, it was realized that the majority of recombinant Osm1 expressed in Escherichia coli lacked the flavin adenosine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. However, exogenously introduced FAD could be incorporated into recombinant Osm1, generating stable and homogenous holo Osm1.

However, it is unknown if the shifts in these bacterial communities are caused by increased organic carbon. Glucose-induced respiration and high-throughput sequencing were used to assess the microbial activity and bacterial communities, respectively. Glucose addition increased the microbial activity, and glucose + ammonium nitrate addition resulted in slightly higher CO2 emission than did glucose addition alone, suggesting that carbon and nitrogen limited microbial community growth. In neutral pH tailings, the bacterial taxa that increased by glucose addition were assigned to the phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes. However, the bacterial taxa that increased by glucose addition in acidic tailings only belonged to the phylum Actinobacteria (maximum increase of 43.78%). In addition, the abundances of the total nitrogen-fixing genera and of the genus Arthrobacter (representing approximately 97.89% of the total nitrogen-fixing genera) increased by glucose addition in acidic tailings (maximum increase of 46.98%). In contrast, the relative abundances of the total iron-and (or) sulfur-oxidizing bacteria decreased (maximum decrease of 10.41%) in response to the addition of glucose.

The question of the relevancy of the use of medical personnel blood parameters as a control over the health status of chronic tuberculosis patients is discussed. The most pronounced changes were observed in populations of monocytes and CD4(+) T cells, which are directly involved in the protection of the human body against tuberculosis. The number of CD4(+) T cells capable of producing interferon-gamma (IFN-) in response to stimulation by M.tuberculosis antigens was analyzed in the blood of medical personnel. The number of these cells in the blood of the medical staff varied depending on the duration of their work in clinic.

The coiled-coil fold consists of alpha-helices bundle that can be repeated to form larger filament. Hydrophobic residues, distributed following a regular seven-residues' pattern, named heptad pattern, are commonly admitted to be essential for the formation and the stability of canonical coiled-coil repeats. Here we investigated the first three coiled-coil repeats (R1-R3) of the central domain of dystrophin, a scaffolding protein in muscle cells whose deficiency leads to Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophies. By an atomic description of the hydrophobic interactions, we highlighted (i) that coiled-coil filament conformational changes are associated to specific patterns of inter-helices hydrophobic contacts, (ii) that inter-repeat hydrophobic interactions determine the behavior of linker regions including filament kinks, and (iii) that a non-strict conservation of the heptad patterns is leading to a relative plasticity of the dystrophin coiled-coil repeats. These structural features and modulations of the coiled-coil fold could better explain the mechanical properties of the central domain of dystrophin. This contribution to the understanding of the structure-function relationship of dystrophin, and especially of the R1-R3 fragment frequently used in the design of protein for gene therapies, should help in the improvement of the strategies for the cure of muscular dystrophies.",10.1002/pro.3557

However, estimation and quantification of MPIO in vivo is still challenging. This limitation mainly arises from smearing and displacement of the negative contrast of the MPIO, so-called blooming, potentially leading to false-positive detection. Further, the bias field induced by the MR coils also hinders visualization and quantification of the MPIO. To mitigate these drawbacks, a positive contrast image can be generated, for example by using a frequency offset technique, which can significantly improve the accuracy of quantification methods. In this research, we introduce the normalized average range (nAR) as a new way to quantify the relative MPIO content within a study. The method compares the average value of test ROIs to that of a control ROI in range filtered images. The nAR can be used on both positive and negative contrast images. The nAR was tested on agar phantoms containing various MPIO concentrations, and on a rostral migration model for MPIO labeled stem cells in mice. The amount of MPIO was quantified for biased and unbiased data, and both for positive and negative contrast images. In addition, the presence of MPIOs in the olfactory bulb was verified by histology. The results show the nAR can indicate the presence and relative content of MPIO for both negative and positive images. However, the nAR showed slightly higher sensitivity in optimized positive contrast images compared to negative contrast images. In all cases, the bias field played a minor role in the quantification, making debiasing less of a concern. The dependency of the nAR values on the MPIO content in the ROI was further validated histologically. Thus, the nAR provides a robust and reliable tool for quantification of MPIO in mice.

We overcome the stability dilemma by acidified the human plasma with citric acid. Laromustine breaks down on the source of mass spectrometry to give m/z 249 which is the same m/z for VNP4090CE. Because VNP4090CE and laromustine elute at approximate retention time of 1.93 and 2.94 min, respectively, we were able to quantify both of them in one method. VNP40101M, VNP4090CE and the internal standards were extracted from human plasma by liquid-liquid extraction into ethyl ether. The ethyl ether layer was evaporated, reconstituted and analyzed using LC with MS/MS detection. Validation parameters such as selectivity, limit of quantitation, linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery, autosampler viability, freeze-thaw cycles and compounds stability are evaluated for this method. Results were calculated using peak area ratios, and calibration curves were generated using a weighted (1/x(2)) linear least-squares regression.

Reviewing diagnostic processes is increasingly urgent to contain costs and to maintain the quality of the health services provided. The Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine (EBLM) approach allows to identify and eliminate obsolete methods, replacing them with more adequate ones. The EBLM approach can also provide higher diagnostic accuracy, a rationalisation of diagnostic pathways, a reduction of turnaround-time and a decrease of costs. To reach these objectives, a careful analysis of production processes and assessment of the costs are both necessary. The EBLM approach has been applied to the Protein Unit of Laboratory of Modena. The change in the workflow of the Bence Jones protein determination and the consolidation of the measurement of a number of serum proteins on clinical chemistry analysers allowed a better diagnostic accuracy coupled to important economical savings. The savings made it possible to extend the availability of the free light chains measurements (that before was restricted to patients admitted to the haematology department) to the out-patients of the Province of Modena. The EBLM approach is the most effective way to reach such objectives: really, providing better quality performance does not necessarily correspond to an increase of costs.

J,"Oberhofer, J; Noori, HR",Quantitative evaluation of cue-induced reinstatement model for evidence-based experimental optimization,"Cue-induced reinstatement is a widely used model for investigating relapse of reward-seeking behavior with high face validity in relation to clinical observations. Yet, face validity is not sufficient to evaluate an animal model, and quantitative, evidence-based analysis is required to estimate the ultimate applicability of this paradigm. Furthermore, such analysis would allow an accurate and reproducible design of future experiments. Here, we conducted meta-analysis and cluster analysis to characterize the impact of cue type (visual, auditory, olfactory or combinations thereof), intensity (e.g. light frequency, sound volume and odor concentration), reward type (e.g. different drugs of abuse, sucrose and food pellets) and model parameters (e.g. housing condition, age, gender and strain of animals) on reinstatement levels. We selected 184 publications for meta-analysis based on inclusion criteria with a total number of 3889 rats. Our analysis suggested that the exact level of reinstatement depends on neither cue type, nor intensity nor on the type of reward. While all cues induced reinstatement to reward-seeking behavior, it is the model parameters, in particular, the housing conditions, age and strain, that defined the final reinstatement levels. In particular, single-housed, adolescent, Wistar or Lister Hooded rats showed significantly higher reinstatement than adult, Sparague-Dawley rats housed in groups. Our findings suggest that model parameters (for example, single housing) evoke stress-induced behaviors that affect reinstatement more than cue/reward factors.",10.1111/adb.12588

These cases were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (=1.00; P<0.001).ConclusionPCR-REBA is a rapid and reliable method that complements other SNP detection methods.

CNS involvement significantly reduces survival and there are no effective treatments for CNS involvement. Therefore, an appropriate animal model is required to evaluate the inhibitory effects of novel drugs on the progression of ATL with CNS involvement. Here, we established a mouse model of ATL with CNS involvement using NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ mice inoculated with ATL cells intramuscularly in the postauricular region, and these mice showed paraparesis. Of the 10 mice inoculated with ATL cells intramuscularly (I.M.) at 5 weeks of age, 8 (80%) showed paraparesis, whereas none of the 10 mice inoculated with ATL cells subcutaneously (S.C.) showed paraparesis. In the I.M. group, PCR detected HTLV-1-specific genes in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae; however, in the S.C. group, the vertebrae were negative for HTLV-1 genes. Histological analysis revealed a particularly high incidence of tumors, characterized by accumulation of the injected cells, in the thoracic vertebrae of mice in the I.M. group. Tumor cell infiltration was relatively high in the bone marrow. Spinal cord compression caused by invasion of the tumor mass outside the pia mater was observed in the thoracic vertebrae of the spinal cord. In conclusion, we have reported a mouse model of tumor growth with paraparesis that may be used to assess novel therapeutic agents for ATL with CNS involvement.",10.1002/ame2.12053

Rats were fed basal diet, unroasted germinated sorghum-based diet, roasted germinated sorghum-based diet, or a commercial weaning feed (nutrend) for 28 days. Energy, carbohydrate, crude protein, lipids, crude fiber, and ash contents of the sorghum-based diets compared significantly with FAO/WHO recommendations. Contrastingly, moisture content of the germinated sorghum-based diet was higher than the recommendation. Weight gain, feed efficiency ratio, protein efficiency ratio, net protein utilization, biological value, and digestibility of unroasted germinated sorghum-based diet-fed rats compared significantly with Nutrend. Roasted germinated sorghum-based diet produced differential effects on these indices. The unroasted germinated sorghum-based diet significantly raised the antioxidant enzymes in the rat liver and kidney.

TaF is a homology-based gene predictor employing large-scale taxonomic profiling to search for close relatives in genome queries.MethodsTaF pipeline consists of four processing steps; (1) taxonomic profiling to search for close relatives to query, (2) generation of hints for determining exon-intron boundaries from orthologous protein sequence data of the profiled species, (3) gene prediction by combination of ab inito and evidence-based prediction methods, and (4) homology search for gene models.ResultsTaF generates extrinsic evidence that suggests possible exon-intron boundaries based on orthologous protein sequence data, thus reducing false-positive predictions of gene structure based on distantly related orthologs data. In particular, the gene prediction method using taxonomic profiling shows very high accuracy, including high sensitivity and specificity for gene models, suggesting a new approach for homology-based gene prediction from newly sequenced or uncharacterized fungal genomes, with the potential to improve the quality of gene prediction.ConclusionTaF will be a useful tool for fungal genome-wide analyses, including the identification of targeted genes associated with a trait, transcriptome profiling, comparative genomics, and evolutionary analysis.",10.1007/s13258-018-0766-1

One of the tasks of GPs is to identify patients in need of specific laboratory tests, to improve the patient outcomes taking at the same time into consideration the risk of over-diagnosis and treatment and the available resources as well. To support GPs in their decisional process, we developed a dedicated software application (APP) for mobile devices; the APP contents were developed in collaboration with GPs, with students of a GP training course and with laboratory medicine specialists. We identified the laboratory tests useful for the management of the most frequent diseases observed in GPs' offices, that are supported by the best available evidence. The first attempt was made considering blood hypertension. Aim of the paper is the description of the process of the APP development, that includes data available from national and international guidelines. This promising tool could help GPs to prescribe suitable laboratory tests in different clinical scenario (diagnosis, evaluation of therapy, monitoring) and to promote the implementation of the evidence-based practice of laboratory medicine, reducing the requests of inappropriate tests and accurately identifying patients who need a second level referral (nephrologist, endocrinologist).",10.19186/BC_2018.68

The aim of the document is to define a valid process to assess the adoption of a diagnostic test and the consequences of the decision. The framework includes three sections reflecting the main steps of GRADE EtD: formulating the relevant question, making an assessment of the evidence, and drawing conclusions. As a matter of example, the EtD framework is used to present the evidence concerning the molecular diagnosis of sepsis in neonates including seven dimensions: (1) formulating the question; (2) assessment of diagnostic test accuracy; (3) certainty of the evidence; (4) effects of test on the main patient outcome; (5) balance between the desirable and undesirable effects; (6) resource use; (7) equity, acceptability and feasibility. The example is used to better elucidate the concepts and to show how reviewers may complete each dimension with the relevant information avaiable. Several factors could influence the final decisions: the relevance of the problem, the values of diagnostic accuracy, the effects of the test on main patient outcome; other issues may play a role.

If the cells are dissociated into single cells, epithelial structures are disrupted, and rapid apoptosis is induced. The low viability of single cells restricts the passaging and expansion of hPSCs. Here, in order to enhance the single cell viability of hPSCs, we adopted an apoptotic strategy using the 30 Kc6 gene which inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis. With the expression of the 30 Kc6 gene in hiPSCs, no issues related to pluripotency or differentiation occurred. The hiPSC-30 Kc6 showed higher viability after the induction of apoptosis compared with control hiPSCs. Furthermore, hiPSC-30 Kc6 formed more colonies when the cells were enzymatically dissociated into single cells. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the 30 Kc6 gene could facilitate the passage and expansion of hiPSCs, potentially preventing the dissociation-induced apoptosis of single hPSCs.",10.1016/j.procbio.2019.01.017

We have recently documented that a recombinant protein corresponding to the putative DNA-binding region (residues 63-244) of CP2c adopted two different conformers, one of which is dominated by zinc binding. However, in the present study, a longer construct encompassing residues 63-302 appeared to form a single structural domain. This domain could be considered to adopt a functionally relevant fold, as the known specific binding of a dodecapeptide to this protein was evident. Hence, the residues 63-302 region rather than 63-244 can be regarded as a natively folded structural domain of CP2c. In addition, it was confirmed that zinc ions can bind to this putative DNA-binding domain of CP2c, which resulted in reduced stability of the protein. In this context, it is suggested that the mode of action of CP2c would resemble that of tumor suppressor p53.",10.6564/JKMRS.2019.23.1.020

The structures of the molecules were designated by FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR studies, elemental and X-ray crystallographic analysis. The synthesized pure products have been screened for in vitro antibiofilm inhibitory activity towards antibiotic-resistant pathogenic organisms. All the synthesized compounds showed biofilm inhibition. Promisingly, the moieties 3a, 3d and 3h showed higher antibiofilm activity at biofilm inhibitory concentration (BIC) (200 mu g/mL) against bacterial pathogens. Among the three moieties, 3a showed high prospective against E. coli biofilm with minimal and maximal BIC percentage of 32% (10 mu g/mL) and 89% (100 mu g/mL) and chosen lowest BIC for further evaluation. Also, the 3a generate ROS two fold at 1 h treatment in E. coli biofilm. The 3a exhibited no toxic effect on cell viability upto 75 mu g/mL in HEK293 cell lines.

It catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of the beta-carboxylate of D-Asp to the epsilon-amino group of L-Lys in the nucleotide precursor UDP- MurNAc-pentapeptide. The enzyme is of interest as a target of new, potential, narrow-spectrum antibiotics directed against multiresistant E. faecium. The kinetic mechanism of Asl(fm )has not been fully characterized. To determine it, a progress curve analysis of Asl(fm )catalytic process using pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase ATPase detection assay was performed. With an inspection of the shape of measured progress curves and the results of specific qualitative experiments, the Asl(fm )reaction mechanism was singled out. The proposed Asl(fm ) kinetics reaction scheme was evaluated by fitting the parameters of the corresponding differential equations to progress curves using the computer program ENZO. The complete kinetic analysis result is consistent with the substrate binding order 1) ATP, 2) D-Asp, and 3) UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The analysis suggests that slowly establishing non-productive equilibria between the free and ATP-bound enzyme with the participating pentapeptide are responsible for initial reaction burst followed by a steady-state period before the complete depletion of the reactant added in the lowest concentration.

In population genetics, it is widely used to extract part of the information about the evolutionary history of genetic data. The ABC compares the summary statistics computed on simulated and observed data sets. Typically, a forward-in-time approach is used to simulate the genetic material of a population starting from an initial ancestral population and following the evolution of the individuals by advancing generation by generation under various demographic and genetic forces. This approach is computationally expensive and requires a large number of computations making the use of high-performance computing crucial for decreasing the overall response times. In this work, we propose a fully distributed web service-oriented platform for ABC that is based on forward-in-time simulations. Our proposal is based on a client-server approach. The client enables users to define simulation scenarios. The server enables efficient and scalable population simulations and can be deployed on a distributed cluster of processors or even in the cloud. It is composed of four services: a workload generator, a simulation controller, a simulation results analyzer, and a result builder. The server performs multithread simulations by executing a simulation kernel encapsulated in a proposed libgdrift library.

An internal tryptic fragment was identified by MALDI TOF, and this peptide showed a homology (66% sequence identity) with the target sequence found as cysteine endopeptidase from Ricinus communis. The purpose of the present work is to examine the specificity towards synthetic peptide and ester substrates and also to compare with other cysteine proteases. In the present work protease solanain from V. solanacea was immobilized using various matrices such as calcium alginate, polyacrylamide, -carrageenan, chitosan and amberlite MB-150 employing entrapment and adsorption techniques. The purified solanain from the latex of V. solanacea exhibited broad specificity. Like other cysteine proteases it showed peptidase and amidase activity. However considerable difference was noticed in the rate of hydrolysis and also exhibited difference in specificity towards simple peptide substrates. Immobilization of solanain on amberlite MB-150 beads enhanced the enzyme stability against changes of pH and temperature.

Astrocytes in this specialized proliferative zone are supposed to have properties of progenitor cells. Structural features of these cells and their interspecies differences remain understudied, while data on the structural organization of the SGZ in the rabbit (order Lagomorpha, superorder Glires), which is widely used in medical and biological studies, are lacking at all. The present work was focused on the structural and cytochemical organization of astrocytes in the SGZ of the rabbit hippocampal dentate fascia as studied by laser confocal microscopy. The study was carried out on the brain of adult Chinchilla rabbits compared to that of adult Wistar rats. Two morphological astrocyte types were identified in the rabbit SGZ: radial gliocyte-like (type I) and atypical fibrous astrocyte-like (type II) cells. By contrast, the rat SGZ exhibited a predominance of type II astrocytes which lacked long unramified processes penetrating through the granular layer and reaching the molecular layer. SGZ astrocytes, both in the rabbit and rat, were characterized by intense immunoreactivity for glutamine synthetase, most pronounced in the processes that formed the perivascular glia limitans. Importantly, the peculiarities of the astrocyte organization in the dentate fascia of the rabbit hippocampus allowed SGZ delimitation, whereas astrocytes in the rat SGZ exhibited no local morphological distinctions. The latter finding indicates a more complex organization of the neurogenic zone in the hippocampus of lagomorphs in contrast to the same zone in rodents.",10.1134/S002209301902008X

The evolution of the binding energies, the second difference in energy, HOMO-LUMO gaps, vertical detachment energies, vertical ionization potentials, vertical electron affinities, and hardness with the increasing number of Be atoms in the most stable Al10-xBex (x = 0-10) clusters demonstrates that the global minimum of Al8Be2 cluster possesses a special stability. Thus, the electronic structure of the lowest-energy Al8Be2 cluster has been also detected in detail. In addition, it is found that the polarizabilities gradually decrease with increasing number of Be atoms, and the charges always transfer from Al to Be atoms in these nanoalloy clusters.

The inability to filter inline not only poses a risk for process deviations, but can also lead to tank constraints and microbial ingress risk. Here, we evaluated and described a novel approach for identifying filters for inline filtration of protein A eluates at pilot scale. We fractionated the protein A eluates into 0.25 column volume fractions to screen filters under constant pressure or constant flow conditions. We observed that filtration properties for eluate fractions are significantly different from the offline eluate, and the conventional filter sizing study using elution pool is not able to predict inline filtration behavior. Through the submicron particle counts and size distribution in pre- and post-filtration samples, we determined that both attributes contribute to the high pressure across the filters. A successful proof-of-concept experiment on a column 10 cm in diameter inline with the filter train selected validated this fractionation method, and the approach was applied to a different mAb molecule to confirm effectiveness.",10.1002/bab.1713

Glycolysis is one of the main ways of obtaining energy in hypoxia conditions. However, in addition to energy exchange, carbohydrates are also necessary for the posttranslational modification of the protein molecules. Cancer cells are often characterized by an enhanced expression of different glycoproteides. Correct glycosylation defines the structure and activity of such molecules. We demonstrated that under the same cultivation conditions, the intensity of glycosylation does not depend on the total number of potential O-glycosylation sites in one molecule. As a model for the investigation, the tandem repeat region (region with variable number of tandem repeats) of the human mucin MUC1, in which each of the repeats carries four potential O-glycosylation sites, was used. An increase of the tandem repeat number in the recombinant protein did not lead to a proportional increase in the level of sLe(a) glycosides. A consequence of this was a reduction in the number of recombinant proteins associated with the cytoplasmic membrane at an overall high expression level. Prolongation of the cultivation duration led to a reduction in the expression level of the recombinant proteins by up to 30% of the initial level, and the intensity of this reduction was in a direct ratio to the number of tandem repeats in the protein molecule.",10.1002/jcb.27735

The space costs of the algorithms to solve the same problem are quadratic in the literature, and thus our original algorithm is the first linear space and linear average time algorithm to solve the inversion distance problem.",10.1089/cmb.2018.0136
J,"Wang, YD; Wen, QM; Zhou, ZG; Yan, NJ",Cell Modeling Based on Bubbles with Weighted Membranes,"Mathematicization for cell modeling provides an effective tool to verify the biological theory, and the existing research mainly focuses on the description of cell structures. This article then addresses the pattern question of cell division or morphogenesis by means of bubble model with weighted membranes. In this study, we show that cell shapes including intersection angles at junction points depend on weights on membranes. For convenience, adhesion and contractile force are considered together as a factor in construction of patterning model. This model is also used to compare with experimental data. And the consistency between our model and experiments is also obtained consequently. This system of differential equations with their boundary conditions theorizes the existing experimental models, and improves the rationality of these models.",10.1089/cmb.2018.0205
J,"Wang, ZC; Pan, ZC; Shen, HW; Zhou, DS",Neural Mechanisms of Abnormal Surround Suppression in Schizophrenia,"Specific visual processing abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia are well documented and involve high-level and low-level stages in the visual pathway. It is indicated that a portion of patients with schizophrenia may undergo visual processing anomalies that affect either early or late visual information processing or both. These sensory information processing disorders are considered to be associated with advanced cognitive dysfunction and their mechanisms are of great importance to the elucidation of several neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia. Surround suppression is a well-known visual phenomenon, which refers to the inhibition of surround stimuli to center ones, physiologically or perceptually. In this paper, we reviewed the advances in schizophrenia studies on visual surround suppression in behavioral and neural levels. Extensive research on surround suppression in patients with schizophrenia revealed abnormal surround suppression in patients with schizophrenia. However, the results are not consistent, and the neural mechanisms underlying the impaired surround suppression have yet to be identified. Therefore, a systematic and comprehensive investigation combined with multiple neuroscientific technologies is required to further understand the mechanisms underlying these deficits.",10.16476/j.pibb.2018.0211
J,"Winter, M; Mayer, R; Warnken, U; Debus, J; Abdollahi, A; Schnölzer, M",Synthetic phosphopeptides: From spike-in standards to affinity tools for protein-protein interaction studies,"Synthetic isotope labeled phosphopeptides are valuable tools for the quantification and validation of phosphoproteome data. Here, we report that the same set of phosphopeptides, which are used as spike-in standards, can be successfully applied for identification of stimulus specific protein-protein interactions mediated by the respective phosphorylation sites. As a proof-of-concept, binding of two gamma H2AX (pS139) phosphosite specific interaction partners, MDC1 and 53BP1, was confirmed and elevated binding affinity was revealed in response to ionizing radiation. Our strategy is generally applicable and enables multiplexed validation and functional analysis of phosphorylation sites offering great potential for the follow-up of phosphoproteome studies.",10.1016/j.ab.2018.12.018
J,"Wu, FF; Cai, RJ; Chen, T; Zhang, YL; Lu, CR",Solution Analysis of Phage phi29 gp16 Protein C terminal Domain,"Phage phi29, a double-stranded DNA virus, assembles its genome into its protein capsid to near-crystalline density by a highly efficient molecular motor. The motor contains the connector, prohead RNA and ATP hydrolytic enzyme protein gp16. Currently, no structure-function information is available regarding the C-terminal domain of gpl 6. Our research aims to understand its role and interaction with pRNA or DNA. This study provides a method for recombinant gp16 protein synthesis and purification by the E.coli SUMO expression system, and here we report the structural envelope of the C terminal domain of gp16 obtained through small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technology. The gp16 C terminal domain gene was recombinantly expressed using the SUMO tag. The gp16 gene was flanked by an N-terminal 6His-SUMO tag and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. High purity target protein monomer was obtained by size exclusion chromatography. This brings the purity of the target protein to about 95%. Then the concentration of the target protein to 1.3 g/L, and the SAXS data were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) beamline BL19U. The resulting molecular envelop highly resembles the homologous protein FtsK, and the curves calculated by the CRYSOL software are highly coincident with the experimental curves. Through recombinant expression, purification and structure analysis, we obtained the solution structure of the gp16. Structural information derived from this study laid the foundation for future structural and functional research of gp16 C terminal, ultimately targeting the viral mechanisms for infection.",10.16476/j.pibb.2018.0235
J,"Xia, WR; Chen, S; Wang, L",Neural Oscillations Underlying The Extinction of Conditioned Fear Memory,"As part of the self-protection mechanism that individuals use to deal with internal and external risk factors, fear plays an important role in the survival of organisms. However, excessive fear is not only detrimental to the survival of the individual, but also easy to cause mental illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, which seriously affects the quality of life. Clinically, exposure therapy based on behavioral findings is often used to treat fear-related diseases, but these symptoms often recur when the patient break away from the treatment environment. Therefore, the investigation of the information processing in the neural circuits related to fear memory is essential for understanding the occurrence and development of these diseases and establishing new treatments. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the brain regions associated with the extinction of fear memory mainly include the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In the process of fear extinction, these three brain regions show specific patterns of neural oscillations, and their activities are also synchronized, which constitute the neural basis for the successful extinction of fear memory. In the future, non-invasive brain stimulation based on oscillatory entrainment can be used to intervene the neural circuit and promote the extinction of fear memory and avoid the recurrence of fear, which provides new insights into the treatment of clinical fear-related disorders.",10.16476/j.pibb.2018.0251
