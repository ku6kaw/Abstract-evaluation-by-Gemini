J,"Allaire, G; Jouve, F; Toader, AM",Structural optimization using sensitivity analysis and a level-set method,"In the context of structural optimization we propose a new numerical method based on a combination of the classical shape derivative and of the level-set method for front propagation. We implement this method in two and three space dimensions for a model of linear or nonlinear elasticity. We consider various objective functions with weight and perimeter constraints. The shape derivative is computed by an adjoint method. The cost of our numerical algorithm is moderate since the shape is captured on a fixed Eulerian mesh. Although this method is not specifically designed for topology optimization, it can easily handle topology changes. However, the resulting optimal shape is strongly dependent on the initial guess.

J,"Peng, B; Özdemir, SK; Lei, FC; Monifi, F; Gianfreda, M; Long, GL; Fan, SH; Nori, F; Bender, CM; Yang, L",Parity-time-symmetric whispering-gallery microcavities,"Optical systems combining balanced loss and gain provide a unique platform to implement classical analogues of quantum systems described by non-Hermitian parity-time (PT)-symmetric Hamiltonians. Such systems can be used to create synthetic materials with properties that cannot be attained in materials having only loss or only gain. Here we report PT-symmetry breaking in coupled optical resonators. We observed non-reciprocity in the PT-symmetry-breaking phase due to strong field localization, which significantly enhances nonlinearity. In the linear regime, light transmission is reciprocal regardless of whether the symmetry is broken or unbroken. We show that in one direction there is a complete absence of resonance peaks whereas in the other direction the transmission is resonantly enhanced, a feature directly associated with the use of resonant structures. Our results could lead to a new generation of synthetic optical systems enabling on-chip manipulation and control of light propagation.",10.1038/NPHYS2927
J,"Georgescu, IM; Ashhab, S; Nori, F",Quantum simulation,"Simulating quantum mechanics is known to be a difficult computational problem, especially when dealing with large systems. However, this difficulty may be overcome by using some controllable quantum system to study another less controllable or accessible quantum system, i.e., quantum simulation. Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g., condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins, and photons have been proposed as quantum simulators. This review outlines the main theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum simulation and emphasizes some of the challenges and promises of this fast-growing field.",10.1103/RevModPhys.86.153
J,"Bartók, AP; Payne, MC; Kondor, R; Csányi, G","Gaussian Approximation Potentials: The Accuracy of Quantum Mechanics, without the Electrons","We introduce a class of interatomic potential models that can be automatically generated from data consisting of the energies and forces experienced by atoms, as derived from quantum mechanical calculations. The models do not have a fixed functional form and hence are capable of modeling complex potential energy landscapes. They are systematically improvable with more data. We apply the method to bulk crystals, and test it by calculating properties at high temperatures. Using the interatomic potential to generate the long molecular dynamics trajectories required for such calculations saves orders of magnitude in computational cost.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.136403
J,"Moore, JE; Balents, L",Topological invariants of time-reversal-invariant band structures,"The topological invariants of a time-reversal-invariant band structure in two dimensions are multiple copies of the Z(2) invariant found by Kane and Mele. Such invariants protect the ""topological insulator"" phase and give rise to a spin Hall effect carried by edge states. Each pair of bands related by time reversal is described by one Z(2) invariant, up to one less than half the dimension of the Bloch Hamiltonians. In three dimensions, there are four such invariants per band pair. The Z(2) invariants of a crystal determine the transitions between ordinary and topological insulators as its bands are occupied by electrons. We derive these invariants using maps from the Brillouin zone to the space of Bloch Hamiltonians and clarify the connections between Z(2) invariants, the integer invariants that underlie the integer quantum Hall effect, and previous invariants of T-invariant Fermi systems.",10.1103/PhysRevB.75.121306

A phase diagram illustrating the drop size as a function of flow rates and flow rate ratios of the two liquids includes one regime where drop size is comparable to orifice width and a second regime where drop size is dictated by the diameter of a thin ""focused"" thread, so drops much smaller than the orifice are formed.

J,"Zak, AK; Majid, WHA; Abrishami, ME; Yousefi, R",X-ray analysis of ZnO nanoparticles by Williamson-Hall and size-strain plot methods,"ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were prepared by a sol-gel combustion method from a zinc acetate precursor and acetic acid. The ZnO-NPs were synthesized at calcination temperatures of 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C for 1 h. The synthesized ZnO-NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and TEM. The XRD results revealed that the sample product was crystalline with a hexagonal wurtzite phase. High-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed single-crystal ZnO-NPs with nearly spherical shapes. The crystalline development in the ZnO-NPs was investigated by X-ray peak broadening. The Williamson-Hall (W-H) analysis and size-strain plot method were used to study the individual contributions of crystallite sizes and lattice strain on the peak broadening of the ZnO-NPs. The physical parameters such as strain, stress and energy density values were calculated more precisely for all the reflection peaks of XRD corresponding to the wurtzite hexagonal phase of ZnO lying in the range of 20 degrees-100 degrees from the modified form of the W-H plot assuming a uniform deformation model (UDM), uniform stress deformation model (USDM), uniform deformation energy density model (UDEDM) and by the size-strain plot method (SSP). The results obtained showed that the mean particle size of the ZnO-NPs estimated from the TEM, W-H analysis and the SSP method were highly intercorrelated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

J,"Cossi, M; Barone, V",Time-dependent density functional theory for molecules in liquid solutions,"A procedure based on the polarizable continuum model (PCM) has been applied to reproduce solvent effects on electronic spectra in connection with the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). To account for solute-solvent interactions, a suitable operator has been defined, which depends on the solute electronic density and can be used to modify the TD-DFT equations for the calculation of molecular polarizabilities and of electronic transition energies. The solute-solvent operator has been derived from a PCM approach depending on solute electrostatic potential: Recently, it has been shown that such an approach also provides an excellent treatment of the solute electronic charge lying far from the nuclei, being particularly reliable for this kind of applications. The method has been tested for formaldehyde in water and in diethyl-ether, and then applied to the calculation of solvent effects on the n --> pi* transition of diazabenzenes in different solvents. The computed transition energies are in fairly good agreement with experimental values. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.",10.1063/1.1394921
J,"Mathew, K; Sundararaman, R; Letchworth-Weaver, K; Arias, TA; Hennig, RG",Implicit solvation model for density-functional study of nanocrystal surfaces and reaction pathways,"Solid-liquid interfaces are at the heart of many modern-day technologies and provide a challenge to many materials simulation methods. A realistic first-principles computational study of such systems entails the inclusion of solvent effects. In this work, we implement an implicit solvation model that has a firm theoretical foundation into the widely used density-functional code Vienna ab initio Software Package. The implicit solvation model follows the framework of joint density functional theory. We describe the framework, our algorithm and implementation, and benchmarks for small molecular systems. We apply the solvation model to study the surface energies of different facets of semiconducting and metallic nanocrystals and the S(N)2 reaction pathway. We find that solvation reduces the surface energies of the nanocrystals, especially for the semiconducting ones and increases the energy barrier of the S(N)2 reaction.

The discovery of the photolysis of water on the surface of TiO2 in 1972(1) launched four decades of intensive research into the underlying chemical and physical processes involved(2-5). Despite much collected evidence, a thoroughly convincing explanation of why mixed-phase samples of anatase and rutile outperform the individual polymorphs has remained elusive(6). One long-standing controversy is the energetic alignment of the band edges of the rutile and anatase polymorphs of TiO2 (ref. 7). We demonstrate, through a combination of state-of-the-art materials simulation techniques and X-ray photoemission experiments, that a type-II, staggered, band alignment of similar to 0.4 eV exists between anatase and rutile with anatase possessing the higher electron affinity, or work function. Our results help to explain the robust separation of photoexcited charge carriers between the two phases and highlight a route to improved photocatalysts.",10.1038/NMAT3697

After removing the excess of negative charges from the surface of the nanosheets, highly conducting IT phase MoS2 nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward the evolution of hydrogen with a notably low Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec. By partially oxidizing MoS2, we found that the activity of 2H MoS2 is significantly reduced after oxidation, consistent with edge oxidation. On the other hand, IT MoS2 remains unaffected after oxidation, suggesting that edges of the nanosheets are not the main active sites. The importance of electrical conductivity of the two phases on the hydrogen evolution reaction activity has been further confirmed by using carbon nanotubes to increase the conductivity of 2H MoS2.",10.1021/nl403661s

The PEG and graphene coating layers are important to accommodating volume expansion of the coated sulfur particles during discharge, trapping soluble polysulfide intermediates, and rendering the sulfur particles electrically conducting. The resulting graphene sulfur composite showed high and stable specific capacities up to similar to 600 mAh/g over more than 100 cycles, representing a promising cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries with high energy density.",10.1021/nl200658a
J,"Wu, ZJ; Zhao, EJ; Xiang, HP; Hao, XF; Liu, XJ; Meng, J",Crystal structures and elastic properties of superhard IrN<sub>2</sub> and IrN<sub>3</sub> from first principles,"First principles calculations were performed to investigate the structural, elastic, and electronic properties of IrN2 for various space groups: cubic Fm-3m and Pa-3, hexagonal P3(2)21, tetragonal P4(2)/mnm, orthorhombic Pmmn, Pnnm, and Pnn2, and monoclinic P2(1)/c. Our calculation indicates that the P2(1)/c phase with arsenopyrite-type structure is energetically more stable than the other phases. It is semiconducting (the remaining phases are metallic) and contains diatomic N-N with the bond distance of 1.414 A. These characters are consistent with the experimental facts that IrN2 is in lower symmetry and nonmetallic. Our conclusion is also in agreement with the recent theoretical studies that the most stable phase of IrN2 is monoclinic P2(1)/c. The calculated bulk modulus of 373 GPa is also the highest among the considered space groups. It matches the recent theoretical values of 357 GPa within 4.3% and of 402 GPa within 7.8%, but smaller than the experimental value of 428 GPa by 14.7%. Chemical bonding and potential displacive phase transitions are discussed for IrN2. For IrN3, cubic skutterudite structure (Im-3) was assumed. Our calculation indicated that it is also promising to be superhard due to the large bulk modulus of 358 GPa and shear modulus of 246 GPa. The diatomic N-N bond distance is even shorter (1.272 A).",10.1103/PhysRevB.76.054115

The plasmonic molecule shows electromagnetic response that closely resembles the electromagnetically induced transparency in an atomic system. Because of its subwavelength dimension, this electromagnetically induced transparency-like molecule can be used as a building block to construct a ""slow light'' plasmonic metamaterial.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.047401
J,"Ranganathan, SI; Ostoja-Starzewski, M",Universal elastic anisotropy index,"Practically all elastic single crystals are anisotropic, which calls for an appropriate universal measure to quantify the extent of anisotropy. A review of the existing anisotropy measures in the literature leads to a conclusion that they lack universality in the sense that they are nonunique and ignore contributions from the bulk part of the elastic stiffness (or compliance) tensor. Proceeding from extremal principles of elasticity, we introduce a new universal anisotropy index that overcomes the above limitations. Furthermore, we establish special relationships between the proposed anisotropy index and the existing anisotropy measures for special cases. A new elastic anisotropy diagram is constructed for over 100 different crystals (from cubic through triclinic), demonstrating that the proposed anisotropy measure is applicable to all types of elastic single crystals, and thus fills an important void in the existing literature.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.055504
J,"Boescke, TS; Müller, J; Bräuhaus, D; Schröder, U; Böttger, U",Ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide thin films,"We report that crystalline phases with ferroelectric behavior can be formed in thin films of SiO(2) doped hafnium oxide. Films with a thickness of 10 nm and with less than 4 mol. % of SiO(2) crystallize in a monoclinic/tetragonal phase mixture. We observed that the formation of the monoclinic phase is inhibited if crystallization occurs under mechanical encapsulation and an orthorhombic phase is obtained. This phase shows a distinct piezoelectric response, while polarization measurements exhibit a remanent polarization above 10 mu C/cm(2) at a coercive field of 1 MV/cm, suggesting that this phase is ferroelectric. Ferroelectric hafnium oxide is ideally suited for ferroelectric field effect transistors and capacitors due to its excellent compatibility to silicon technology.

Fabrication of such artificial heterostructures with atomically clean and sharp interfaces, however, is challenging. Here, we report a one-step growth strategy for the creation of high-quality vertically stacked as well as in-plane interconnected heterostructures ofWS(2)/MoS2 via control of the growth temperature. Vertically stacked bilayers with WS2 epitaxially grown on top of the MoS2 monolayer are formed with preferred stacking order at high temperature. A strong interlayer excitonic transition is observed due to the type II band alignment and to the clean interface of these bilayers. Vapour growth at low temperature, on the other hand, leads to lateral epitaxy of WS2 on MoS2 edges, creating seamless and atomically sharp in-plane heterostructures that generate strong localized photoluminescence enhancement and intrinsic p-n junctions. The fabrication of heterostructures from monolayers, using simple and scalable growth, paves the way for the creation of unprecedented two-dimensional materials with exciting properties.",10.1038/NMAT4091

Using the nonlinear prediction error and an estimate of an effective correlation dimension in combination with the method of iterative amplitude adjusted surrogate data, we analyze sets of electroencephalographic (EEG) time series: surface EEG recordings from healthy volunteers with eyes closed and eyes open, and intracranial EEG recordings from epilepsy patients during the seizure free interval from within and from outside the seizure generating area as well as intracranial EEG recordings of epileptic seizures. As a preanalysis step an inclusion criterion of weak stationarity was applied. Surface EEG recordings with eyes open were compatible with the surrogates' null hypothesis of a Gaussian linear stochastic process. Strongest indications of nonlinear deterministic dynamics were found for seizure activity. Results of the other sets were found to be in between these two extremes.",10.1103/PhysRevE.64.061907

We have developed a postproduction treatment that improves the performance of solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) by means of a tempering cycle at elevated temperatures in which an external voltage is simultaneously applied, resulting in a significant increase of the short-circuit current. Using this postproduction treatment, an enhancement of the short-circuit cur rent density, I-sc, to 8.5 mA cm(-2) under illumination with white light at an illumination intensity of 800 W m(2) and an increase in external quantum efficiency (IPCE, incident photon to collected electron efficiency) to 70 % are demonstrated.",10.1002/adfm.200390011

We show that the phase diagram of this system contains a Weyl semimetal phase of the simplest possible kind, with only two Dirac nodes of opposite chirality, separated in momentum space, in its band structure. This Weyl semimetal has a finite anomalous Hall conductivity and chiral edge states and occurs as an intermediate phase between an ordinary insulator and a 3D quantum anomalous Hall insulator. We find that the Weyl semimetal has a nonzero dc conductivity at zero temperature, but Drude weight vanishing as T(2), and is thus an unusual metallic phase, characterized by a finite anomalous Hall conductivity and topologically protected edge states.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.127205
J,"Garnett, E; Yang, PD",Light Trapping in Silicon Nanowire Solar Cells,"Thin-film structures can reduce the cost of solar power by using inexpensive substrates and a lower quantity and quality of semiconductor material. However, the resulting short optical path length and minority carrier diffusion length necessitates either a high absorption coefficient or excellent light trapping. Semiconducting nanowire arrays have already been shown to have low reflective losses compared to planar semiconductors, but their light-trapping properties have not been measured. Using optical transmission and photocurrent measurements on thin silicon films, we demonstrate that ordered arrays of silicon nanowires increase the path length of incident solar radiation by up to a Factor of 73. This extraordinary light-trapping path length enhancement factor is above the randomized scattering (Lambertian) limit (2n(2)similar to 25 without a back reflector) and is superior to other light-trapping methods. By changing the silicon film thickness and nanowire length, we show that there is a competition between improved absorption and increased surface recombination; for nanowire arrays fabricated from 8 mu m thick silicon films, the enhanced absorption can dominate over surface recombination, even without any surface passivation. These nanowire devices give efficiencies above 5%, with short-circuit photocurrents higher than planar control samples,",10.1021/nl100161z

Computer: Platforms on which Mathematica is available. Operating system: Operating systems on which Mathematica is available. Classification: 11.1, 11.6. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEDI_v1_1 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 182 (2011) 2404 Nature of problem: The program computes the Feynman rules of any quantum field theory, expressed in four-dimensional space-time, directly from the Lagrangian of the model. Various interfaces to Feynman diagram calculators are included that allow the exportation of the interaction vertices in a format readable by different Monte Carlo event generators or symbolic calculation tools. Solution method: FeynRules works in three steps: 1. If necessary, the model Lagrangian is written in terms of four-component fermions and the usual fields of particle physics, instead of Weyl fermions or superfields. 2. Derivation of the Feynman rules directly form the Lagrangian using canonical commutation relations among fields and creation operators. 3. Implementation of the new physics model into FeynArts as well as into various Monte Carlo programs via dedicated interfaces. Reasons for new version: Bug fixes. Summary of revisions: cleaning of unnecessary files bug related to epsilon tensors bug with multiple interaction order fixed bug when we have one mass parameter for several particles in the UFO Restrictions: Mathematica version 7.0 or higher. The Lagrangian must fulfill basic quantum field theory requirements, such as locality and Lorentz and gauge invariance. Fields with spin 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2 are supported. Unusual features: Translation interfaces to various Feynman diagram generators exist. Superfields are also supported and can be expanded in terms of their component fields, which allows the performance of various sets of superspace computations. Running time: The computation of the Feynman rules from a Lagrangian varies with the complexity of the model, and runs from a few seconds to several minutes.

Little is known, however, about the microstructure of this material. Here we have refined chemical vapour deposition synthesis to grow highly crystalline islands of monolayer molybdenum disulphide up to 120 mu m in size with optical and electrical properties comparable or superior to exfoliated samples. Using transmission electron microscopy, we correlate lattice orientation, edge morphology and crystallinity with island shape to demonstrate that triangular islands are single crystals. The crystals merge to form faceted tilt and mirror twin boundaries that are stitched together by lines of 8- and 4-membered rings. Density functional theory reveals localized mid-gap states arising from these 8- 4 defects. We find that mirror twin boundaries cause strong photoluminescence quenching whereas tilt boundaries cause strong enhancement. Meanwhile, mirror twin boundaries slightly increase the measured in-plane electrical conductivity, whereas tilt boundaries slightly decrease the conductivity.",10.1038/nmat3633

Here we show that high-shear mixing of graphite in suitable stabilizing liquids results in large-scale exfoliation to give dispersions of graphene nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy show the exfoliated flakes to be unoxidized and free of basal-plane defects. We have developed a simple model that shows exfoliation to occur once the local shear rate exceeds 10(4) s(-1). By fully characterizing the scaling behaviour of the graphene production rate, we show that exfoliation can be achieved in liquid volumes from hundreds of millilitres up to hundreds of litres and beyond. The graphene produced by this method performs well in applications from composites to conductive coatings.

J,"Sheberla, D; Bachman, JC; Elias, JS; Sun, CJ; Shao-Horn, Y; Dinca, M",Conductive MOF electrodes for stable supercapacitors with high areal capacitance,"Owing to their high power density and superior cyclability relative to batteries, electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) have emerged as an important electrical energy storage technology that will play a critical role in the large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy sources, smart power grids, and electrical vehicles'. Because the capacitance and charge-discharge rates of EDLCs scale with surface area and electrical conductivity, respectively, porous carbons such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes and crosslinked or holey graphenes are used exclusively as the active electrode materials in EDLCs4-9. One class of materials whose surface area far exceeds that of activated carbons, potentially allowing them to challenge the dominance of carbon electrodes in EDLCs, is metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)(10). The high porosity of MOFs, however, is conventionally coupled to very poor electrical conductivity, which has thus far prevented the use of these materials as active electrodes in EDLCs. Here, we show that Ni-3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)(2) (Ni-3(HITP)(2)), a MOF with high electrical conductivity(11), can serve as the sole electrode material in an EDLC. This is the first example of a supercapacitor made entirely from neat MOFs as active materials, without conductive additives or other binders. The MOF-based device shows an areal capacitance that exceeds those of most carbon-based materials and capacity retention greater than 90% over 10,000 cycles, in line with commercial devices. Given the established structural and compositional tunability of MOFs, these results herald the advent of a new generation of supercapacitors whose active electrode materials can be tuned rationally, at the molecular level.",10.1038/NMAT4766

J,"Jablan, M; Buljan, H; Soljacic, M",Plasmonics in graphene at infrared frequencies,"We point out that plasmons in doped graphene simultaneously enable low losses and significant wave localization for frequencies below that of the optical phonon branch h omega(Oph)approximate to 0.2 eV. Large plasmon losses occur in the interband regime (via excitation of electron-hole pairs), which can be pushed toward higher frequencies for higher-doping values. For sufficiently large dopings, there is a bandwidth of frequencies from omega(Oph) up to the interband threshold, where a plasmon decay channel via emission of an optical phonon together with an electron-hole pair is nonegligible. The calculation of losses is performed within the framework of a random-phase approximation and number conserving relaxation-time approximation. The measured DC relaxation-time serves as an input parameter characterizing collisions with impurities, whereas the contribution from optical phonons is estimated from the influence of the electron-phonon coupling on the optical conductivity. Optical properties of plasmons in graphene are in many relevant aspects similar to optical properties of surface plasmons propagating on dielectric-metal interface, which have been drawing a lot of interest lately because of their importance for nanophotonics. Therefore, the fact that plasmons in graphene could have low losses for certain frequencies makes them potentially interesting for nanophotonic applications.",10.1103/PhysRevB.80.245435

In particular, the reduction of switching current drastically reduces power consumption and results in extreme cycling endurances of over 10(12). Along with the 10 ns switching times, this allows for possible applications to the working-memory space as well.

Additionally, graphene/MnO2//ACN asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits excellent cycling durability, with 97% specific capacitance retained even after 1000 cycles.

The capability to predict phase stability from fundamental properties of constituent elements would benefit the alloy design greatly. The relationship between phase stability and physicochemical/thermodynamic properties of alloying components in HEAs was studied systematically. The mixing enthalpy is found to be the key factor controlling the formation of solid solutions or compounds. The stability of fcc and bcc solid solutions is well delineated by the valance electron concentration (VEC). The revealing of the effect of the VEC on the phase stability is vitally important for alloy design and for controlling the mechanical behavior of HEAs. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

J,"Minami, T",Transparent conducting oxide semiconductors for transparent electrodes,"The present status and prospects for further development of polycrystalline or amorphous transparent conducting oxide (TCO) semiconductors used for practical thin-film transparent electrode applications are presented in this paper. The important TCO semiconductors are impurity-doped ZnO, In2O3 and SnO2 as well as multicomponent oxides consisting of combinations of ZnO, In2O3 and SnO2, including some ternary compounds existing in their systems. Development of these and other TCO semiconductors is important because the expanding need for transparent electrodes for optoelectronic device applications is jeopardizing the availability of indium-tin-oxide (ITO), whose main constituent, indium, is a very expensive and scarce material. Al- and Ga-doped ZnO (AZO and GZO) semiconductors are promising as alternatives to ITO for thin-film transparent electrode applications. In particular, AZO thin films, with a low resistivity of the order of 10(-5) Omega cm and source materials that are inexpensive and non-toxic, are the best candidates. However, further development of the deposition techniques, such as magnetron sputtering or vacuum arc plasma evaporation, as well as of the targets is required to enable the preparation of AZO and GZO films on large area substrates with a high deposition rate.",10.1088/0268-1242/20/4/004

We explain this asymmetry in ZnO via a study of its intrinsic defect physics, including Zn-O, Zn-i, V-O, O-i, and V-Zn and n-type impurity dopants, Al and F. We find that ZnO is n type at Zn-rich conditions. This is because (i) the Zn interstitial, Zn-i, is a shallow, donor, supplying electrons; (ii) its formation enthalpy is low for both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, so this defect is abundant; and (iii) the native defects that could compensate the n-type doping effect of Zn-i (interstitial O, O-i, and Zn vacancy, V-Zn), have high formation enthalpies for Zn-rich conditions, so these ""electron killers"" are not abundant. We find that ZnO cannot be doped p type via native defects (O-i, V-Zn) despite the fact that they are shallow (i.e., supplying holes at room temperature). This is because at both Zn-rich and O-rich conditions, the defects that could compensate p-type doping (V-O, Zn-i, Zn-O) have low formation enthalpies so these ""hole killers"" form readily. Furthermore, we identify electron-hole radiative recombination at the V-O center as the source of the green luminescence. In contrast, a large structural relaxation of the same center upon double hole capture leads to slow electron-hole recombination (either radiative or nonradiative) responsible for the slow decay of photoconductivity.",10.1103/PhysRevB.63.075205

Such graphs are quite unlike real-world networks, which often possess power-law or other highly skewed degree distributions.

The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport.

Based on structure optimization and phonon-mode calculations, we determine that 22 different honeycomb materials are stable and correspond to local minima on the Born-Oppenheimer surface. We also find that all the binary compounds containing one of the first row elements, B, C, or N have planar stable structures. On the other hand, in the honeycomb structures of Si, Ge, and other binary compounds the alternating atoms of hexagons are buckled since the stability is maintained by puckering. For those honeycomb materials which were found stable, we calculated optimized structures, cohesive energies, phonon modes, electronic-band structures, effective cation and anion charges, and some elastic constants. The band gaps calculated within density functional theory using local density approximation are corrected by GW(0) method. Si and Ge in honeycomb structure are semimetal and have linear band crossing at the Fermi level which attributes massless Fermion character to charge carriers as in graphene.

J,"Galanakis, I; Dederichs, PH; Papanikolaou, N",Slater-Pauling behavior and origin of the half-metallicity of the full-Heusler alloys,"Using the full-potential screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method we study the full-Heusler alloys based on Co, Fe, Rh, and Ru. We show that many of these compounds show a half-metallic behavior; however, in contrast to the half-Heusler alloys the energy gap in the minority band is extremely small due to states localized only at the Co (Fe, Rh, or Ru) sites which are not present in the half-Heusler compounds. The full-Heusler alloys show a Slater-Pauling behavior and the total spin magnetic moment per unit cell (M-t) scales with the total number of valence electrons (Z(t)) following the rule M-t=Z(t)-24. We explain why the spin-down band contains exactly 12 electrons using arguments based on group theory and show that this rule holds also for compounds with less than 24 valence electrons. Finally we discuss the deviations from this rule and the differences compared to the half-Heusler alloys.",10.1103/PhysRevB.66.174429
J,"Cohen, R; Erez, K; ben-Avraham, D; Havlin, S",Resilience of the Internet to random breakdowns,"A common property of many large networks, including the Internet, is that the connectivity of the various nodes follows a scale-free power-law distribution, P(k) = ck(-alpha). We study the stability of such networks with respect to crashes, such as random removal of sites; Our approach, based on percolation theory, leads to a general condition for the critical fraction of nodes, p(c), that needs to be removed before the network disintegrates. We show analytically and numerically that for alpha less than or equal to 3 the transition never takes place, unless the network is finite. In the special case of the physical structure of the Internet (alpha approximate to 2.5), we find that it is impressively robust, with p(c) > 0.99.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.4626

Lithium resources are confirmed to be unevenly distributed in South America, and the cost of the lithium raw materials has roughly doubled from the first practical application in 1991 to the present and is increasing due to global demand for lithium-ion accumulators. Since the electrochemical equivalent and standard potential of sodium are the most advantageous after lithium, sodium based energy storage is of great interest to realize lithium-free high energy and high voltage batteries. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no successful reports on electrochemical sodium insertion materials for battery applications; the major challenge is the negative electrode and its passivation. In this study, we achieve high capacity and excellent reversibility sodium-insertion performance of hard-carbon and layered NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 electrodes in propylene carbonate electrolyte solutions. The structural change and passivation for hard-carbon are investigated to study the reversible sodium insertion. The 3-volt secondary Na-ion battery possessing environmental and cost friendliness, Na+-shuttlecock hard-carbon/NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 cell, demonstrates steady cycling performance as next generation secondary batteries and an alternative to Li-ion batteries.",10.1002/adfm.201100854
J,"Lallemand, P; Luo, LS","Theory of the lattice Boltzmann method: Dispersion, dissipation, isotropy, Galilean invariance, and stability","The generalized hydrodynamics (the wave vector dependence of the transport coefficients) of a generalized lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) is studied in detail. The generalized lattice Boltzmann equation is constructed in moment space rather than in discrete velocity space. The generalized hydrodynamics of the model is obtained by solving the dispersion equation of the linearized LEE either analytically by using perturbation technique or numerically. The proposed LEE model has a maximum number of adjustable parameters for the given set of discrete velocities. Generalized hydrodynamics characterizes dispersion, dissipation (hyperviscosities), anisotropy, and lack of Galilean invariance of the model, and can be applied to select the values of the adjustable parameters that optimize the properties of the model. The proposed generalized hydrodynamic analysis also provides some insights into stability and proper initial conditions for LEE simulations. The stability properties of some two-dimensional LEE models are analyzed and compared with each Ether in the parameter space of the mean streaming velocity and the viscous relaxation time. The procedure described in this work can be applied to analyze other LEE models. As examples, LEE models with various interpolation schemes are analyzed. Numerical results on shear how with an initially discontinuous velocity profile (shock) with or without a constant streaming velocity are shown to demonstrate the dispersion effects in the LEE model: the results compare favorably with our theoretical analysis. We also show that whereas linear analysis of the LEE evolution operator is equivalent to Chapman-Enskog analysis in the long-wavelength limit (wave vector k=0), it can also provide results for large values of k. Such results are important for the stability and other hydrodynamic properties of the LEE method and cannot be obtained through Chapman-Enskog analysis.",10.1103/PhysRevE.61.6546

It was found that the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of DSCs increases with increase in the haze of the TiO2 electrodes, especially in the near infrared wavelength region. Conversion efficiency of 11.1%, measured by a public test center, was achieved using high haze TiO2 electrodes.

These active optoelectronic materials produce and harvest light efficiently in the visible spectrum. The same functions are required in the infrared for telecommunications (1,300-1,600 nm), thermal imaging (1,500 nm and beyond), biological imaging (transparent tissue windows at 800 nm and 1,100 nm), thermal photovoltaics (>1,900 nm), and solar cells (800-2,000 nm). Photoconductive polymer devices have yet to demonstrate sensitivity beyond similar to800 nm (refs 2,3). Sensitizing conjugated polymers with infrared-active nanocrystal quantum dots provides a spectrally tunable means of accessing the infrared while maintaining the advantageous properties of polymers. Here we use such a nanocomposite approach in which PbS nanocrystals tuned by the quantum size effect sensitize the conjugated polymer poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexyloxy-p-phenylenevinylene)] (MEH-PPV) into the infrared. We achieve, in a solution-processed device and with sensitivity far beyond 800 nm, harvesting of infrared-photogenerated carriers and the demonstration of an infrared photovoltaic effect. We also make use of the wavelength tunability afforded by the nanocrystals to show photocurrent spectra tailored to three different regions of the infrared spectrum.",10.1038/nmat1299

It is shown that these materials exhibit unique many-electron effects; the electronic structures are dispersive essentially along one dimension, leading to particularly enhanced self-energy corrections and excitonic effects. Additionally, within a wide energy range, including infrared light and part of visible light, few-layer black phosphorous absorbs light polarized along the structures' armchair direction and is transparent to light polarized along the zigzag direction, making them potentially viable linear polarizers for applications. Finally, the number of phosphorene layers included in the stack controls the material's band gap, optical absorption spectrum, and anisotropic polarization energy window across a wide range.",10.1103/PhysRevB.89.235319

For the aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z series the convergence of the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole moment is studied. It is found that, when d-shell electrons cannot be frozen, the cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets converge much slower for third-row elements then they do for first- and second-row elements. Based on the results of these studies criteria are deduced for the accuracy of auxiliary basis sets used in the resolution of the identity (RI) approximation for electron repulsion integrals. Optimized auxiliary basis sets for RI-MP2 calculations fulfilling these criteria are reported for the sets cc-pVXZ, cc-pV(X+d)Z, aug-cc-pVXZ, and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z with X=D, T, and Q. For all basis sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation energy is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the usual basis-set error. For the auxiliary aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the usual basis set error. Therefore extrapolations towards the basis-set limit are possible within the RI approximation for both energies and properties. The reduction in CPU time obtained with the RI approximation increases rapidly with basis set size. For the cc-pVQZ basis an acceleration by a factor of up to 170 is observed.
