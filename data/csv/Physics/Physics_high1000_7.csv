J,"Spergel, DN; Steinhardt, PJ",Observational evidence for self-interacting cold dark matter,"Cosmological models with cold dark matter composed of weakly interacting particles predict overly dense cores in the centers of galaxies and clusters and an overly large number of halos within the Local Group compared to actual observations. We propose that the conflict can be resolved if the cold dark matter particles are self-interacting with a large scattering cross section but negligible annihilation or dissipation. In this scenario, astronomical observations may enable us to study dark matter properties that are inaccessible in the laboratory.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.3760
J,"Mostofi, AA; Yates, JR; Pizzi, G; Lee, YS; Souza, I; Vanderbilt, D; Marzari, N",An updated version of wannier90: A tool for obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions,"wannier90 is a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWFs in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWFs can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 is able to output MLWFs for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. We present here an updated version of wannier90, wannier90 2.0, including minor bug fixes and parallel (MPI) execution for band-structure interpolation and the calculation of properties such as density of states, Berry curvature and orbital magnetisation. wannier90 is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.orgi.",10.1016/j.cpc.2014.05.003
J,"Bernevig, BA; Zhang, SC",Quantum spin hall effect,"The quantum Hall liquid is a novel state of matter with profound emergent properties such as fractional charge and statistics. The existence of the quantum Hall effect requires breaking of the time reversal symmetry caused by an external magnetic field. In this work, we predict a quantized spin Hall effect in the absence of any magnetic field, where the intrinsic spin Hall conductance is quantized in units of 2e/4 pi. The degenerate quantum Landau levels are created by the spin-orbit coupling in conventional semiconductors in the presence of a strain gradient. This new state of matter has many profound correlated properties described by a topological field theory.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.106802
J,"Miller, RE; Shenoy, VB",Size-dependent elastic properties of nanosized structural elements,"Effective stiffness properties (D) of nanosized structural elements such as plates and beams differ from those predicted by standard continuum mechanics (D-c). These differences (D - D-c)/D-c depend on the size of the structural element. A simple model is constructed to predict this size dependence of the effective properties. The important length scale in the problem is identified to be the ratio of the surface elastic modulus to the elastic modulus of the bulk. In general, the non-dimensional difference in the elastic properties from continuum predictions (D - D-c)/D-c is found to scale as alpha S/Eh, where alpha is a constant which depends on the geometry of the structural element considered, S is a surface elastic constant, E is a bulk elastic modulus and h a length defining the size of the structural element. Thus, the quantity S/E is identified as a material length scale for elasticity of nanosized structures. The model is compared with direct atomistic simulations of nanoscale structures using the embedded atom method for FCC A1 and the Stillinger-Weber model of Si. Excellent agreement between the simulations and the model is found.",10.1088/0957-4484/11/3/301
J,"James, DFV; Kwiat, PG; Munro, WJ; White, AG",Measurement of qubits,"We describe in detail the theory underpinning the measurement of density matrices of a pair of quantum two-level systems (""qubits""). Our particular emphasis is on qubits realized by the two polarization degrees of freedom of a pair of entangled photons generated in a down-conversion experiment; however, the discussion applies in general, regardless of the actual physical realization. Two techniques are discussed, namely, a tomographic reconstruction (in which the density matrix is linearly related to a set of measured quantities) and a maximum likelihood technique which requires numerical optimization (but has the advantage of producing density matrices that are always non-negative definite). In addition, a detailed error analysis is presented, allowing errors in quantities derived from the density matrix, such as the entropy or entanglement of formation, to be estimated. Examples based on down-conversion experiments are used to illustrate our results.",10.1103/PhysRevA.64.052312

Since time-reversal symmetry is explicitly broken, the edge of the film constitutes a chiral Majorana wire.

J,"Bartók, AP; Kondor, R; Csányi, G",On representing chemical environments,"We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighborhood environments, and analyze their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighborhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbors increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether different approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions, that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighborhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.",10.1103/PhysRevB.87.184115
J,"Loo, C; Lowery, A; Halas, NJ; West, J; Drezek, R",Immunotargeted nanoshells for integrated cancer imaging and therapy,"Nanoshells are a novel class of optically tunable nanoparticles that consist of a dielectric core surrounded by a thin gold shell. Based on the relative dimensions of the shell thickness and core radius, nanoshells may be designed to scatter and/or absorb light over a broad spectral range including the near-infrared (NIR), a wavelength region that provides maximal penetration of light through tissue. The ability to control both wave length-dependent scattering and absorption of nanoshells offers the opportunity to design nanoshells which provide, in a single nanoparticle, both diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Here, we demonstrate a novel nanoshell-based all-optical platform technology for integrating cancer imaging and therapy applications. Immunotargeted nanoshells are engineered to both scatter light in the NIR enabling optical molecular cancer imaging and to absorb light, allowing selective destruction of targeted carcinoma cells through photothermal therapy. In a proof of principle experiment, dual imaging/therapy immunotargeted nanoshells are used to detect and destroy breast carcinoma cells that overexpress HER2, a clinically relevant cancer biomarker.",10.1021/nl050127s

High power conversion efficiencies of similar to 10% have already been reported in tandem polymer solar cells(3). Here, we report that similar efficiencies are achievable in single-junction devices by reducing the tail state density below the conduction band of the electron acceptor in a high-performance photoactive layer made from a newly developed semiconducting polymer with a deepened valence energy level. Control over band tailing is realized through changes in the composition of the active layer and the structure order of the blend, both of which are known to be important factors in cell operation(4-6). The approach yields cells with high power conversion efficiencies (similar to 9.94% certified) and enhanced photovoltage.",10.1038/NPHOTON.2015.6
J,"Harrow, AW; Hassidim, A; Lloyd, S",Quantum Algorithm for Linear Systems of Equations,"Solving linear systems of equations is a common problem that arises both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems: given a matrix A and a vector (b) over right arrow, find a vector (x) over right arrow such that A (x) over right arrow = (b) over right arrow. We consider the case where one does not need to know the solution (x) over right arrow itself, but rather an approximation of the expectation value of some operator associated with (x) over right arrow, e.g., (x) over right arrow (dagger) M (x) over right arrow for some matrix M. In this case, when A is sparse, N x N and has condition number kappa, the fastest known classical algorithms can find (x) over right arrow and estimate (x) over right arrow (dagger) M (x) over right arrow in time scaling roughly as N root kappa. Here, we exhibit a quantum algorithm for estimating (x) over right arrow (dagger) M (x) over right arrow whose runtime is a polynomial of log(N) and kappa. Indeed, for small values of kappa [i.e., poly log(N)], we prove ( using some common complexity-theoretic assumptions) that any classical algorithm for this problem generically requires exponentially more time than our quantum algorithm.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502
J,"Soref, R","The past, present, and future of silicon photonics","The pace of the development of silicon photonics has quickened since 2004 due to investment by industry and government. Commercial state-of-the-art CMOS silicon-on-insulator (SOI) foundries are now being utilized in a crucial test of 1.55-mu m monolithic optoelectronic (OE) integration, a test sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The preliminary results indicate that the silicon photonics are truly CMOS compatible.

Electrically pumped silicon lasers are under intense investigation, with several approaches being tried; however, lasing has not yet been attained.

However, the acoustic analogue to electromagnetic metamaterials has, so far, not been investigated. We report a new class of ultrasonic metamaterials consisting of an array of subwavelength Helmholtz resonators with designed acoustic inductance and capacitance. These materials have an effective dynamic modulus with negative values near the resonance frequency. As a result, these ultrasonic metamaterials can convey acoustic waves with a group velocity antiparallel to phase velocity, as observed experimentally. On the basis of homogenized-media theory, we calculated the dispersion and transmission, which agrees well with experiments near 30 kHz. As the negative dynamic modulus leads to a richness of surface states with very large wavevectors, this new class of acoustic metamaterials may offer interesting applications, such as acoustic negative refraction and superlensing below the diffraction limit.",10.1038/nmat1644

For use in practical applications, a Si electrode must have high capacity, long cycle life, high efficiency, and the fabrication must be industrially scalable. Here, we design and fabricate a yolk-shell structure to meet all these needs. The fabrication is carried out without special equipment and mostly at room temperature. Commercially available Si nanoparticles are completely sealed inside conformal, thin, self-supporting carbon shells, with rationally designed void space in between the particles and the shell. The well-defined void space allows the Si particles to expand freely without breaking the outer carbon shell, therefore stabilizing the solid-electrolyte interphase on the shell surface. High capacity (similar to 2800 mAh/g at C/10), long cycle life (1000 cycles with 74% capacity retention), and high Coulombic efficiency (99.84%) have been realized in this yolk-shell structured Si electrode.",10.1021/nl3014814

J,"Berthier, L; Biroli, G",Theoretical perspective on the glass transition and amorphous materials,"A theoretical perspective is provided on the glass transition in molecular liquids at thermal equilibrium, on the spatially heterogeneous and aging dynamics of disordered materials, and on the rheology of soft glassy materials. We start with a broad introduction to the field and emphasize its connections with other subjects and its relevance. The important role played by computer simulations in studying and understanding the dynamics of systems close to the glass transition at the molecular level is given. The recent progress on the subject of the spatially heterogeneous dynamics that characterizes structural relaxation in materials with slow dynamics is reviewed. The main theoretical approaches are presented describing the glass transition in supercooled liquids, focusing on theories that have a microscopic, statistical mechanics basis. We describe both successes and failures and critically assess the current status of each of these approaches. The physics of aging dynamics in disordered materials and the rheology of soft glassy materials are then discussed, and recent theoretical progress is described. For each section, an extensive overview is given of the most recent advances, but we also describe in some detail the important open problems that will occupy a central place in this field in the coming years.",10.1103/RevModPhys.83.587

The HCNWs used as anode material for Na-ion batteries deliver a high reversible capacity of 251 mAh g(-1) and 82.2% capacity retention over 400 charge-discharge cycles between 1.2 and 0.01 V (vs Na'/Na) at a constant current of 50 mA g(-1) (0.2 C). Excellent cycling stability is also observed at an even higher charge-discharge rate. A high reversible capacity of 149 rnAh g(-1) also can be obtained at a current rate of 500 rnA g(-1) (2C). The good Na-ion insertion property is attributed to the short diffusion distance in the HCNWIs and the large interlayer distance (0.37 nm) between the graphitic sheets, which agrees with the interlayered distance predicted by theoretical calculations to enable Na-ion insertion in carbon materials.",10.1021/nl3016957
J,"Souza, I; Marzari, N; Vanderbilt, D",Maximally localized Wannier functions for entangled energy bands,"We present a method for obtaining well-localized Wannier-like functions (WF's) for energy bands that are attached to or mixed with other bands. The present scheme removes the limitation of the usual maximally localized WF's method [N. Marzari and D. Vanderbilt, Phys. Rev. B 56, 12 847 (1997)] that the bands of interest should form an isolated group, separated by gaps from higher and lower bands everywhere in the Brillouin zone. An energy window encompassing N bands of interest is specified by the user, and the algorithm then proceeds to disentangle these from the remaining bands inside the window by filtering out an optimally connected N-dimensional subspace. This is achieved by minimizing a functional that measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally localized WF's for the optimal subspace are then obtained via the algorithm of Marzari and Vanderbilt. The method, which functions as a postprocessing step using the output of conventional electronic-structure codes, is applied to the s and d bands of copper, and to the valence and low-lying conduction bands of silicon. For the low-lying nearly-free-electron bands of copper we find WF's which are centered at the tetrahedral-interstitial sites, suggesting an alternative tight-binding parametrization.",10.1103/PhysRevB.65.035109

However, to date, there has been little success in the development of high-performance solid-state batteries using these exceptional materials, the major challenge being the high solid-solid interfacial impedance between the garnet electrolyte and electrode materials. In this work, we effectively address the large interfacial impedance between a lithium metal anode and the garnet electrolyte using ultrathin aluminium oxide (Al2O3) by atomic layer deposition. Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLCZN) is the garnet composition of choice in this work due to its reduced sintering temperature and increased lithium ion conductivity. A significant decrease of interfacial impedance, from 1,710 Omega cm(2) to 1 Omega cm(2), was observed at room temperature, effectively negating the lithium metal/garnet interfacial impedance. Experimental and computational results reveal that the oxide coating enables wetting of metallic lithium in contact with the garnet electrolyte surface and the lithiated-alumina interface allows effective lithium ion transport between the lithium metal anode and garnet electrolyte. We also demonstrate a working cell with a lithium metal anode, garnet electrolyte and a high-voltage cathode by applying the newly developed interface chemistry.",10.1038/NMAT4821

Some ZnO nanoparticles exhibit very strong blue emissions, the intensity of which first increase and then decrease with annealing. These visible emissions exhibit strong and interesting excitation dependences: 1) the optimal excitation energy for blue emissions is near the bandgap energy, but the effective excitation can obviously be lower, even 420 nm (2.95 eV < E-g = 3.26 eV); in contrast, green emissions can be excited only by energies larger than the bandgap energy; and, 2) there are several fixed emitting wavelengths at 415, 440, 455 and 488 nm in the blue wave band, which exhibit considerable stability in different excitation and annealing conditions. Mechanisms for blue emissions from ZnO are proposed with interstitial-zinc-related defect levels as initial states.

J,"Grimme, S",Improved second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory by separate scaling of parallel- and antiparallel-spin pair correlation energies,"A simple modification of second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) to improve the description of molecular ground state energies is proposed. The total MP2 correlation energy is partitioned into parallel- and antiparallel-spin components which are separately scaled. The two parameters (scaling factors), whose values can be justified by basic theoretical arguments, have been optimized on a benchmark set of 51 reaction energies composed of 74 first-row molecules. It is found, that the new method performs significantly better than standard MP2: the rms [mean absolute error (MAE)] deviation drops from 4.6 (3.3) to 2.3 (1.8) kcal/mol. The maximum error is reduced from 13.3 to 5.1 kcal/mol. Significant improvements are especially observed for cases which are usually known as MP2 pitfalls while cases already described well with MP2 remain almost unchanged. Even for 11 atomization energies not considered in the fit, uniform improvements [MAE: 8.1 kcal/mol (MP2) versus 3.2 kcal/mol (new)] are found. The results are furthermore compared with those from density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) and quadratic configuration interaction [QCISD/QCISD(T)] calculations. Also for difficult systems including strong (nondynamical) correlation effects, the improved MP2 method clearly outperforms DFT/B3LYP and yields results of QCISD or sometimes QCISD(T) quality. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for ten diatomic molecules also show consistent enhancements. The uniformity with which the new method improves upon MP2, thereby rectifying many of its problems, indicates significant robustness and suggests it as a valuable quantum chemical method of general use.

However, there has been little effort to engineer the self-destruction of errant nanoparticles into non-toxic, systemically eliminated products. Here, we present luminescent porous silicon nanoparticles (LPSiNPs) that can carry a drug payload and of which the intrinsic near-infrared photoluminescence enables monitoring of both accumulation and degradation in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to most optically active nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, gold nanoparticles and quantum dots), LPSiNPs self-destruct in a mouse model into renally cleared components in a relatively short period of time with no evidence of toxicity. As a preliminary in vivo application, we demonstrate tumour imaging using dextran-coated LPSiNPs (D-LPSiNPs). These results demonstrate a new type of multifunctional nanostructure with a low-toxicity degradation pathway for in vivo applications.",10.1038/NMAT2398

The influence of colloid particle shape and size, composition (Ag or Au) and interparticle separation distance on the wavelength-dependent SERS enhancement factor is reported. Our calculations indicate that the maximum enhancement factor achievable through electromagnetics is of the order 10(11). This is obtained only under special circumstances, namely at interstitial sites between particles and at locations outside sharp surface protrusions. The comparative rarity of such sites, together with the extreme spatial localization of the enhancement they provide, can qualitatively explain why only very few surface sites seem to contribute to the measured signal in single-molecule SERS experiments. Enhancement factors of the order 10(14)-10(15), which have been reported in recent experiments, are likely to involve additional enhancement mechanisms such as chemisorption induced resonance Raman effects.",10.1103/PhysRevE.62.4318

J,"Nicolis, A; Rattazzi, R; Trincherini, E",Galileon as a local modification of gravity,"In the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, the ""self-accelerating"" solution is plagued by a ghost instability, which makes the solution untenable. This fact, as well as all interesting departures from general relativity (GR), are fully captured by a four-dimensional effective Lagrangian, valid at distances smaller than the present Hubble scale. The 4D effective theory involves a relativistic scalar pi, universally coupled to matter and with peculiar derivative self-interactions. In this paper, we study the connection between self-acceleration and the presence of ghosts for a quite generic class of theories that modify gravity in the infrared. These theories are defined as those that at distances shorter than cosmological, reduce to a certain generalization of the DGP 4D effective theory. We argue that for infrared modifications of GR locally due to a universally coupled scalar, our generalization is the only one that allows for a robust implementation of the Vainshtein effect-the decoupling of the scalar from matter in gravitationally bound systems-necessary to recover agreement with solar-system tests. Our generalization involves an internal Galilean invariance, under which pi's gradient shifts by a constant. This symmetry constrains the structure of the pi Lagrangian so much so that in 4D there exist only five terms that can yield sizable nonlinearities without introducing ghosts. We show that for such theories in fact there are ""self-accelerating"" de Sitter solutions with no ghostlike instabilities. In the presence of compact sources, these solutions can support spherically symmetric, Vainshtein-like nonlinear perturbations that are also stable against small fluctuations. We investigate a possible infrared completion of these theories at scales of order of the Hubble horizon, and larger. There are however some features of our theories that may constitute a problem at the theoretical or phenomenological level: the presence of superluminal excitations; the extreme subluminality of other excitations, which makes the quasistatic approximation for certain solar-system observables unreliable due to Cherenkov emission; the very low strong-interaction scale for pi pi scatterings.",10.1103/PhysRevD.79.064036

At liquid helium temperature in undoped crystals the neutral donor bound excitons dominate in the PL spectrum. Two electron satellite transitions (TES) of the donor bound excitons allow to determine the donor binding energies ranging from 46 to 73 meV. These results are in line with the temperature dependent Hall effect measurements. In the as-grown crystals a shallow donor with an activation energy of 30 meV controls the conductivity. Annealing annihilates this shallow donor which has a bound exciton recombination at 3.3628 eV. Correlated by magnetic resonance experiments we attribute this particular donor to hydrogen. The Al, Ga and In donor bound exciton recombinations are identified based on doping and diffusion experiments and using secondary ion mass spectroscopy. We give a special focus on the recombination around 3.333 eV, i.e. about 50 meV below the free exciton transition. From temperature dependent measurements one obtains a small thermal activation energy for the quenching of the luminescence of 10 +/- 2 meV despite the large localization energy of 50 meV. Spatially resolved CL measurements show that the 3.333 eV lines are particularly strong at crystal irregularities and occur only at certain spots hence are not homogeneously distributed within the crystal contrary to the bound exciton recombinations. We attribute them to excitons bound to structural defects (Y-line defect) very common in II-VI semiconductors. For the bound exciton lines which seem to be correlated with Li and Na doping we offer a different interpretation. Li and Na do not introduce any shallow acceptor level in ZnO which otherwise should show up in donor-acceptor pair recombinations. Nitrogen creates a shallow acceptor level in ZnO. Donor-acceptor pair recombination with the 165 meV deep N-acceptor is found in nitrogen doped and implanted ZnO samples, respectively. In the best undoped samples excited rotational states of the donor bound excitons can be seen in low temperature PL measurements. At higher temperatures we also see the appearance of the excitons bound to the B-valence band, which are approximately 4.7 meV higher in energy. (C) 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The plasmon resonance optical spectrum of many individual nanoparticles are then correlated to their size and shape using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find that specific geometrical shapes give distinct spectral responses. In addition, inducing subtle changes in the particles' morphology by heating causes a shift in the individual particle spectrum and provides a simple means of tuning the spectral response to a desired optical wavelength. Improved colloidal preparation methods could potentially lead to homogeneous populations of identical particle shapes and colors.

J,"Guinea, F; Katsnelson, MI; Geim, AK",Energy gaps and a zero-field quantum Hall effect in graphene by strain engineering,"Among many remarkable qualities of graphene, its electronic properties attract particular interest owing to the chiral character of the charge carriers, which leads to such unusual phenomena as metallic conductivity in the limit of no carriers and the half-integer quantum Hall effect observable even at room temperature(1-3). Because graphene is only one atom thick, it is also amenable to external influences, including mechanical deformation. The latter offers a tempting prospect of controlling graphene's properties by strain and, recently, several reports have examined graphene under uniaxial deformation(4-8). Although the strain can induce additional Raman features(7,8), no significant changes in graphene's band structure have been either observed or expected for realistic strains of up to similar to 15% (refs 9-11). Here we show that a designed strain aligned along three main crystallographic directions induces strong gauge fields(12-14) that effectively act as a uniform magnetic field exceeding 10 T. For a finite doping, the quantizing field results in an insulating bulk and a pair of countercirculating edge states, similar to the case of a topological insulator(15-20).

However, the efficiency of their electroluminescence is limited by non-radiative recombination, which is associated with defects and leakage current due to incomplete surface coverage(6-9). Here we demonstrate a solution-processed perovskite light-emitting diode (LED) based on self-organized multiple quantum wells (MQWs) with excellent film morphologies. The MQW-based LED exhibits a very high external quantum efficiency of up to 11.7%, good stability and exceptional highpower performance with an energy conversion efficiency of 5.5% at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). This outstanding performance arises because the lower bandgap regions that generate electroluminescence are effectively confined by perovskite MQWs with higher energy gaps, resulting in very efficient radiative decay.

When chemically modified, HA can be transformed into many physical forms-viscoelastic solutions, soft or stiff hydrogels, electrospun fibers, non-woven meshes, macroporous and fibrillar sponges, flexible sheets, and nanoparticulate fluids-for use in a range of preclinical and clinical settings. Many of these forms are derived from the chemical crosslinking of pendant reactive groups by addition/condensation chemistry or by radical polymerization. Clinical products for cell therapy and regenerative medicine require crosslinking chemistry that is compatible with the encapsulation of cells and injection into tissues. Moreover, an injectable clinical biomaterial must meet marketing, regulatory, and financial constraints to provide affordable products that can be approved, deployed to the clinic, and used by physicians. Many HA-derived hydrogels meet these criteria, and can deliver cells and therapeutic agents for tissue repair and regeneration.

A remarkable and useful property of these materials is that they support unidirectional spin-polarized propagation at their surfaces. Unfortunately topological insulators are rare among solid-state materials. Using suitably designed electromagnetic media (metamaterials) we theoretically demonstrate a photonic analogue of a topological insulator. We show that metacrystals-superlattices of metamaterials with judiciously designed properties-provide a platform for designing topologically non-trivial photonic states, similar to those that have been identified for condensed-matter topological insulators. The interfaces of the metacrystals support helical edge states that exhibit spin-polarized one-way propagation of photons, robust against disorder. Our results demonstrate the possibility of attaining one-way photon transport without application of external magnetic fields or breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Such spin-polarized one-way transport enables exotic spin-cloaked photon sources that do not obscure each other.",10.1038/NMAT3520

J,"Carusotto, I; Ciuti, C",Quantum fluids of light,"This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in the fundamental understanding and active control of quantum fluids of light in nonlinear optical systems. In the presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically nonequilibrium nature. A rich variety of recently observed photon hydrodynamical effects is presented, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While the review is mostly focused on a specific class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of the article is devoted to a review of the future perspectives in the direction of strongly correlated photon gases and of artificial gauge fields for photons. In particular, several mechanisms to obtain efficient photon blockade are presented, together with their application to the generation of novel quantum phases.

The program is designed to emulate a NMR spectrometer by letting the user specify high-level NMR concepts such as spin systems, nuclear spin interactions, RF irradiation, free precession, phase cycling, coherence-order filtering, and implicit/explicit acquisition. These elements are implemented using the TcI scripting language to ensure a minimum of programming overhead and direct interpretation without the need for compilation, while maintaining the flexibility of a full-featured programming language. Basicly, there are no intrinsic limitations to the number of spins, types of interactions, sample conditions (static or spinning, powders, uniaxially oriented molecules, single crystals, or solutions), and the complexity or number of spectral dimensions for the pulse sequence. The applicability ranges from simple 1D experiments to advanced multiple-pulse and multiple-dimensional experiments, series of simulations, parameter scans, complex data manipulation/visualization, and iterative fitting of simulated to experimental spectra.

The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations.

J,"Peres, NMR; Guinea, F; Castro Neto, AH",Electronic properties of disordered two-dimensional carbon,"Two-dimensional carbon, or graphene, is a semimetal that presents unusual low-energy electronic excitations described in terms of Dirac fermions. We analyze in a self-consistent way the effects of localized (impurities or vacancies) and extended (edges or grain boundaries) defects on the electronic and transport properties of graphene. On the one hand, point defects induce a finite elastic lifetime at low energies with the enhancement of the electronic density of states close to the Fermi level. Localized disorder leads to a universal, disorder independent, electrical conductivity at low temperatures, of the order of the quantum of conductance. The static conductivity increases with temperature and shows oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field. The graphene magnetic susceptibility is temperature dependent (unlike an ordinary metal) and also increases with the amount of defects. Optical transport properties are also calculated in detail. On the other hand, extended defects induce localized states near the Fermi level. In the absence of electron-hole symmetry, these states lead to a transfer of charge between the defects and the bulk, the phenomenon we call self-doping. The role of electron-electron interactions in controlling self-doping is also analyzed. We also discuss the integer and fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene, the role played by the edge states induced by a magnetic field, and their relation to the almost field independent surface states induced at boundaries.

J,"Xiao, D; Yao, W; Niu, Q",Valley-contrasting physics in graphene: Magnetic moment and topological transport,"We investigate physical properties that can be used to distinguish the valley degree of freedom in systems where inversion symmetry is broken, using graphene systems as examples. We show that the pseudospin associated with the valley index of carriers has an intrinsic magnetic moment, in close analogy with the Bohr magneton for the electron spin. There is also a valley dependent Berry phase effect that can result in a valley contrasting Hall transport, with carriers in different valleys turning into opposite directions transverse to an in-plane electric field. These effects can be used to generate and detect valley polarization by magnetic and electric means, forming the basis for the valley-based electronics applications.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.236809
J,"Fu, LA",Topological Crystalline Insulators,"The recent discovery of topological insulators has revived interest in the band topology of insulators. In this Letter, we extend the topological classification of band structures to include certain crystal point group symmetry. We find a class of three-dimensional ""topological crystalline insulators'' which have metallic surface states with quadratic band degeneracy on high symmetry crystal surfaces. These topological crystalline insulators are the counterpart of topological insulators in materials without spin-orbit coupling. Their band structures are characterized by new topological invariants. We hope this work will enlarge the family of topological phases in band insulators and stimulate the search for them in real materials.",10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.106802

The optimal adsorption position and orientation of these molecules on the graphene surface is determined and the adsorption energies are calculated. Molecular doping, i.e., charge transfer between the molecules and the graphene surface, is discussed in light of the density of states and the molecular orbitals of the adsorbates. The efficiency of doping of the different molecules is determined and the influence of their magnetic moment is discussed.",10.1103/PhysRevB.77.125416
J,"Heinze, S; von Bergmann, K; Menzel, M; Brede, J; Kubetzka, A; Wiesendanger, R; Bihlmayer, G; Blügel, S",Spontaneous atomic-scale magnetic skyrmion lattice in two dimensions,"Skyrmions are topologically protected field configurations with particle-like properties that play an important role in various fields of science. Recently, skyrmions have been observed to be stabilized by an external magnetic field in bulk magnets. Here, we describe a two-dimensional square lattice of skyrmions on the atomic length scale as the magnetic ground state of a hexagonal Fe film of one-atomic-layer thickness on the Ir(111) surface. Using spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy we can directly image this non-collinear spin texture in real space on the atomic scale and demonstrate that it is incommensurate to the underlying atomic lattice. With the aid of first-principles calculations, we develop a spin model on a discrete lattice that identifies the interplay of Heisenberg exchange, the four-spin and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as the microscopic origin of this magnetic state.",10.1038/NPHYS2045
J,"Xia, T; Kovochich, M; Brant, J; Hotze, M; Sempf, J; Oberley, T; Sioutas, C; Yeh, JI; Wiesner, MR; Nel, AE",Comparison of the abilities of ambient and manufactured nanoparticles to induce cellular toxicity according to an oxidative stress paradigm,"Nanomaterial properties differ from those bulk materials of the same composition, allowing them to execute novel activities. A possible downside of these capabilities is harmful interactions with biological systems, with the potential to generate toxicity. An approach to assess the safety of nanomaterials is urgently required. We compared the cellular effects of ambient ultrafine particles with manufactured titanium dioxide (TiO2), carbon black, fullerol, and polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs). The study was conducted in a phagocytic cell line ( RAW 264.7) that is representative of a lung target for NPs. Physicochemical characterization of the NPs showed a dramatic change in their state of aggregation, dispersibility, and charge during transfer from a buffered aqueous solution to cell culture medium. Particles differed with respect to cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under biotic and abiotic conditions. Spontaneous ROS production was compared by using an ROS quencher (furfuryl alcohol) as well as an NADPH peroxidase bioelectrode platform. Among the particles tested, ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) and cationic PS nanospheres were capable of inducing cellular ROS production, GSH depletion, and toxic oxidative stress. This toxicity involves mitochondrial injury through increased calcium uptake and structural organellar damage. Although active under abiotic conditions, TiO2 and fullerol did not induce toxic oxidative stress. While increased TNF-alpha production could be seen to accompany UFP-induced oxidant injury, cationic PS nanospheres induced mitochondrial damage and cell death without inflammation. In summary, we demonstrate that ROS generation and oxidative stress are a valid test paradigm to compare NP toxicity. Although not all materials have electronic configurations or surface properties to allow spontaneous ROS generation, particle interactions with cellular components are capable of generating oxidative stress.",10.1021/nl061025k
J,"Pan, Y; Neuss, S; Leifert, A; Fischler, M; Wen, F; Simon, U; Schmid, G; Brandau, W; Jahnen-Dechent, W",Size-dependent cytotoxicity of gold nanoparticles,"Gold nanoparticles are widely used in biomedical imaging and diagnostic tests. Based on their established use in the laboratory and the chemical stability of Au, gold nanoparticles were expected to be safe. The recent literature, however, contains conflicting data regarding the cytotoxicity of gold nanoparticles. Against this background a systematic study of watersoluble gold nanoparticles stabilized by triphenylphosphine derivatives ranging in size from 0.8 to 15 nm is made. The cytotoxicity of these particles in four cell lines representing major functional cell types with barrier and phagocyte function are tested. Connective tissue fibroblasts, epithelial cells, macrophages, and melanoma cells prove most sensitive to gold particles 1.4 nm in size, which results in IC50 values ranging from 30 to 56,cm depending on the particular 1.4-nm Au compound-cell line combination. In contrast, gold particles 15 nm in size and Tauredon (gold thiomalate) are nontoxic at up to 60-fold and 100-fold higher concentrations, respectively. The cellular response is size dependent, in that 1.4-nm particles cause predominantly rapid cell death by necrosis within 12 h while closely related particles 1.2 nm in diameter effect predominantly programmed cell death by apoptosis.",10.1002/smll.200700378
J,"Biercuk, MJ; Llaguno, MC; Radosavljevic, M; Hyun, JK; Johnson, AT; Fischer, JE",Carbon nanotube composites for thermal management,"Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) were used to augment the thermal transport properties of industrial epoxy. Samples loaded with 1 wt % unpurified SWNT material showed a 70% increase in thermal conductivity at 40 K, rising to 125% at room temperature; the enhancement due to 1 wt % loading of vapor grown carbon fibers was three times smaller. Electrical conductivity data showed a percolation threshold between 0.1 and 0.2 wt % SWNT loading. The Vickers hardness rose monotonically with SWNT loading up to a factor of 3.5 at 2 wt %. These results suggest that the thermal and mechanical properties of SWNT-epoxy composites are improved, without the need to chemically functionalize the nanotubes.
