J,"Zhang, XL; Yang, W; Luo, TZ; Huang, YY; Lei, L; Li, GJ; Xu, P",Two-dimensional distribution expressions of micro-prism on bottom surface of partial integrated light guide plate,"The design of the microstructure distribution on the bottom surface of the partial integrated light guide plate (PILGP) is one of the key factors to improve the luminance uniformity of the partial integrated backlight module (BLM). In this paper, the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions on the bottom surface of the small-sized PILGP are presented. The two-dimensional micro-prism expressions make the micro-prisms spread out on a two-dimensional scale of the bottom surface of the PILGP. By fitting and analyzing a large number of simulation data, the relationship expressions between the coefficients of the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions and the structural parameters of the PILGP are established. The above expressions are directly applied to the two-dimensional distribution design of micro-prism on the bottom surface of small-sized PILGPs with different structural parameters. Without the help of the designers' experience and the multiple simulations of the software, the average value of luminance uniformity in the partial integrated BLMs is obtained to be 84.94%. The simulation results show that the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions and coefficient relation-expressions presented in this paper have important application value. Take the 5-inch partial integrated BLM for example. The two-dimensional distribution of the micro-prism on the bottom surface of the PILGP with high luminance uniformity can be obtained directly by using the above expressions. By fine-tuning the coefficients of two-dimensional micro-prism expressions, calculated by the coefficient relation-expressions, the utilization of light energy, illuminance uniformity and luminance uniformity of the partial integrated BLM respectively reach 90.69%, 88.02% and 92.17%, which meet the practical requirements. The optimization and design time of the partial integrated BLM are both greatly saved. Further, the two-dimensional micro-prism expressions on the bottom surface of the PILGP are analyzed and the physical mechanism is explained reasonably. This work is of significance for the distribution design of the microstructures on the surface of the LGP.",10.7498/aps.68.20190854
J,"Zhao, J; Tang, DL; Xu, L; Li, PC; Zhang, F; Li, J; Gui, BY",Effect of anode magnetic shield on inner magnetic pole etched in anode layer Hall thruster,"For anode layer Hall plasma thruster, the etching of inner magnetic pole is one of the key factors affecting its service life. In order to solve the problem of inner magnetic pole etching in anode layer Hall plasma thruster, the effect of anode magnetic shield on inner magnetic pole etched in anode layer Hall thruster is studied by combining particle simulation PIC with sputtering simulation. The magnetic shielding of anode changes the distribution of magnetic field configuration on the surface of the anode, and improves the magnetic mirror ratio of the magnetic mirror field of the thruster to the magnetic field width of the positive gradient on the central axis. The ratio of the magnetic mirror is 1.4 times that of the original one, and two additional saddle magnetic fields are added on both sides of the original saddle magnetic field region. It not only is conducive to confining electrons and improving the ionization rate of working gas, but also keeps a certain distance between the anode and the high temperature electron region, which provides the reliable reference data for the design of high power Hall plasma thruster. When the discharge voltage is 900 V and the working pressure is 2 x 10(-2) Pa, the simulation results show that after the anode is shielded by the magnetic shield, the energy range of most of the incident ions on the inner magnetic pole is 40-260 eV, which is 100 eV lower than the energy range 40-360 eV in the case without shielding the anode. The probability distribution of particle energy without magnetically shielding the anode between 260 eV and 600 eV is obviously higher than that of ion energy with magnetically shielding the anode. The maximum probability distribution of cosine value of incident angle is extended from a small range near 0.1 (incident angle 84 degrees) to a large range of 0.1-0.45 (incident angle 84 degrees-63 degrees). The magnetic shielding makes the incident ions disperse on the surface of the inner magnetic pole, which is helpful in reducing the etching of inner magnetic pole. The maximum etching rate of inner magnetic pole after the anode has been magnetically shielded is reduced from 16 x 10(-10) m/s to 6.1 x 10(-10) m/s, which is 2.62 times lower. The comparison of simulation results with experimental results in the case without magnetically shielding the anode shows that they are in good agreement.",10.7498/aps.68.20190654
J,"Zhou, BR; Tan, YD; Shen, XJ; Zhu, KY; Bao, LP",Mechanism of contrast-enhancement in ultrasound-modulated laser feedback imaging with ultrasonic microbubble contrast agent,"Ultrasound-modulated optical imaging technology is a new type of biological tissue optical detection technology, and sensitive to the change of scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient of biological tissue. This technology is a non-ionizing and non-invasive pathological detection method, which has great potential application in early detection of cancer. However, ultrasound-modulated optical imaging technology is insufficient in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and imaging contrast. Frequency-shifted laser feedback technology with microchip laser is a new type of highly sensitive interference technology, whose gain coefficient for weak optical signal can reach 10(6). This technology can greatly improve the SNR of imaging. Combined with the high sensitive laser feedback technology, the ultrasound-modulated laser feedback technology is proposed. The SNR of this technology is better than that of the traditional ultrasound-modulated optical imaging technology. The increase in SNR can achieve greater depth of detection in biological tissue imaging, but there is no significant improvement in imaging contrast. In order to improve the contrast of biological tissue imaging and achieve high resolution imaging of thick biological tissue, we use ultrasound microbubble contrast agent in ultrasound-modulated laser feedback imaging technology. We establish a Monte Carlo photon transport model with microbubbles in order to study the mechanism of contrast enhancement in ultrasound-modulated laser feedback imaging with microbubbles. Finally, we establish an experimental system to verify the correctness of the simulation results. Experimental and simulation results show that in the transparent solution, the ultrasonic microbubble contrast agent can enhance the ultrasound-modulated laser feedback signal and generate harmonic modulation, which can improve the imaging contrast by detecting the enhancement of the fundamental and harmonic signals of the feedback. In the scattering medium, the ultrasonic microbubble contrast agent can significantly attenuate the ultrasound modulated laser feedback signal, and the imaging contrast can be improved by detecting the attenuation of the fundamental and harmonic signal.",10.7498/aps.68.20190770

J,"Harvey, AH",Influence of Isotopologue Dipole Moments on Precision Dielectric-Constant Measurements,"Measurements of the relative permittivity (static dielectric constant) of fluids such as methane have been interpreted with the assumption of zero dipole moment. This assumption is not strictly true, due to the presence of isotopologues with small, nonzero dipole moments. We investigate the significance of this effect by analyzing the effect of the dipole of CH3D on the static dielectric constant of methane. It is found that the isotopologue effect is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty of the best existing measurements. Similar estimates for other compounds such as H-2 and CO2 produce even smaller effects. Therefore, the interpretation of these measurements with a dipole moment of zero remains valid.",10.6028/jres.124.031

A more unified view is thereby obtained of the effect of environmental inhomogeneity on the motion of a diffusing particle, in particular, whether a drift is induced, covering both passive and active particles.

As a prototype, we study effective spins induced in an impunity sites doped AKLT model by constructing the exact ground state in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We characterize their responses to external fields by studying an extended Zeeman interaction. We also study the antiferromagnetic bond-alternating Heisenberg chain with defect structures. For this model, an MPS representation similar to that for the AKLT model, ""a uniform MPS with windows,"" is constructed, and it gives a good approximation of the ground state. We discuss the trade-off relation between the window length and the precision of the MPS ansatz. The effective exchange interaction between the induced spins is also investigated by using this representation.",10.1103/PhysRevB.100.195105

More precisely, we show that the trace of the random interlacements process on two disjoint finite sets, F and its translated F + x, can be coupled with high probability of success, when parallel to x parallel to is large, with the trace of a process of independent excursions, which we call the noodle soup process. As a consequence, we obtain an upper bound on the covariance between two [0, 1]-valued functions depending on the configuration of the random interlacements on F and F + x, respectively. This improves a previous bound obtained by Sznitman (Ann Math 2(171):2039-2087, 2010).",10.1007/s10955-019-02418-w
J,"Montilla, CA; González, HA; Kallewaard, V; Tristancho, JL",Corrosion Behavior of an AISI/SAE Steel Cut by Electropulsing,"The effect of electropulsing treatment (EPT) on the surface general corrosion behavior of an AISI/SAE 1045 steel under different machining regimes is studied. In the study, the following variables are alternated: high-speed steel (HSS) vs. hard metal (HM), and with and without the assistance of high-density electropulses. The corrosion rates are determined using comparative studies such as gravimetric analysis, salt spray chamber test, electrochemical polarization curve techniques (PC), and linear polarization resistance (LPR). Differences in surface microhardness were evaluated by applying optical microscopy and planimetric procedures. Specimens subjected to electropulses and turned with HM reported greater reductions of corrosion rates. Changes in corrosion behavior can be explained in terms of grain shape factor h variation. The present study demonstrates that electropulsing affects the corrosion behavior of AISI/SAE 1045 steel after the turning process.",10.3390/ma12223782

J,"Chiu, CH; Chen, PY; Chen, ACY; Chan, YS; Hsu, KY; Higashikawa, R; Lei, KF",The Susceptibility of Tenocytes from Different Ages of Donors Towards Dexamethasone and Ascorbic Acid can be Screened in a Microfluidic Platform,"Hamstring tendon is one of the best graft choices for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The upper age limit of reconstruction is not determined because tenocytes from old individuals have less proliferative ability than young ones. Dexamethasone is commonly used to deal with musculoskeletal disorder with dose-dependent cytotoxicity toward tenocytes. Ascorbic acid is essential for tenocytes culture and collagen secretion and can alleviate the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone. In the current study, a microfluidic platform was used to screen the best dexamethasone and ascorbic acid combination treatment for tenocytes from young and old donors because it has been proven to provide a high throughput analysis platform. Comparison of their proliferation under three concentrations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone was performed. Tenocytes proliferation among young and old donors was also measured when exposed to nine combinations of ascorbic acid and dexamethasone. The result confirmed the differences in cells proliferation when hamstring tenocytes from different ages of donors are exposed to different concentrations of dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. Tenocytes from old donors are not always more susceptible to dexamethasone and ascorbic acid. An optimal dose of ascorbic acid in decreasing the cytotoxic effect of dexamethasone can be screened by a high throughput microfluidic platform.",10.3390/app9224765
J,"Han, JJ; Hwang, SJ",Surface Topography-Based Positioning Accuracy of Maxillary Templates Fabricated by the CAD/CAM Technique for Orthognathic Surgery without an Intermediate Splint,"Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)-based maxillary templates can transfer a surgical plan accurately only when the template is positioned correctly. Our study aimed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the CAD/CAM-based template for maxillary orthognathic surgery using dry skulls. After reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual skull model, a surface-based surgical template for Le Fort I osteotomy was designed and fabricated using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology. To determine accuracy, the deviation of the template between the planned and the actual position and the fitness of the template were evaluated. The mean deviation was 0.41 +/- 0.30 mm in the medio-lateral direction, 0.55 +/- 0.59 mm in the antero-posterior direction, and 0.69 +/- 0.59 mm in the supero-inferior direction. The root mean square deviation between the planned and the actual position of the template was 1.21 +/- 0.54 mm. With respect to the fitness of the template, the mean distance between the inner surface of the template and the underlying bone surface was 0.76 +/- 0.24 mm. CAD/CAM-based templates showed precise positioning and good fitness. These results suggest that surface topography-based CAD-CAM templates can be considered as an alternative solution in replacing the traditional intermediate splints for the transfer of surgical plans.",10.3390/app9224928
J,"Kajiya, D",An agar sandwich method for patterning transparent conducting oxides,"Transparent electrodes are frequently used to drive opto-electronic devices, and the patterning of these electrodes is essential. The present work demonstrates a facile means of removing transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) from a glass substrate in selected areas. When agarose gel (agar), a material typically used in desserts, is sandwiched between two TCO-coated glass substrates and connected to a dry cell, the TCO is removed from the glass at the agar stamping area within 2 min. This method allows etching of TCOs using acid-free, inexpensive, and readily available starting materials. Analyses by optical microscopy, transmission spectroscopy, electrical resistance measurements, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that this etching occurs as a result of reduction of the TCO in conjunction with the electrolysis of water at the interface between the TCO and agar surfaces. Using this technique, high-throughput patterning of TCOs with an edge resolution of several micrometres was achieved. Furthermore, the shape of the agar template can be readily changed simply by cutting the agar using scissors. Therefore, this method provides a useful means for both researchers and students to easily fabricate patterned substrates for use in electronics and related technologies.",10.1007/s10854-019-02440-4
J,"Kang, D; Jeong, J; Ko, SW; Kwon, T; Kim, Y",Physics-Based Vehicle Simulation Using PD Servo,"In this paper, we introduce a novel system for physics-based vehicle simulation from input trajectory. The proposed system approximates the physical movements of a real vehicle using a proportional derivative (PD) servo which estimates proper torques for wheels and controls a vehicle's acceleration based on the conditions of the given trajectory. To avoid expensive simulation calculation, the input trajectory is segmented and compared to the optimized trajectories stored in a path library. Based on the similarity of the curve shape between the input and simulated trajectories, an iterative search method is introduced to generate a physically derivable trajectory for convincing simulation results. For an interaction with other objects in the virtual environment, the surface of the vehicle is subdivided into several parts and deformed individually from external forces. As demonstrated in the experimental results, the proposed system can create diverse traffic scenes with multiple vehicles in a fully automated way.",10.3390/app9224949

The existence of specific interactions in the mixture is revealed by excess properties, and further supported by partial molar properties.

To capture the slope and the fluctuation pattern, data of the first lines along the horizontal and vertical axes on the stage were used. A corrective function was then utilized to improve the accuracy of reference phase extraction. The method was then corroborated by demonstrating tumor discrimination in mice skin by means of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). B16-F10 melanoma cells were used to grow the tumor. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was applied for histology characterization of the sample. A comparison of both acoustics and histology was conducted.

J,"Niyaz, F; Gallagher, TF",Forced autoionisation in the Yb 6<i>snd</i> series,"We have observed the conversion of a level perturbing the Yb series into a forced autoionisation resonance by the application of a static field. The perturbing level is barely visible in the zero field excitation spectrum, leading us to expect the forced autoionisation resonance to be manifested as a dip in the spectrum as a Fano 0 feature. Instead, we observe a pronounced peak with a 3. As shown by a quantum defect theory analysis, the zero field spectrum is consisitent with 3. The apparent discrepancy arises from the combination of the rapid radiative decay of the perturbing level, the weakness of the configuration interaction and the discreteness of the zero field spectrum.",10.1080/00268976.2019.1597197

In this study, the tensile behavior of a steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was evaluated in the joint of a modular flexural member. The modular specimen was fabricated with a 400 mm joint, and an integral specimen was fabricated with the same specifications as the modular specimen, without a joint. The largest crack width of the integral specimen was measured at the center of the beam, and that of the modular specimen was measured at the discontinuity interface. The maximum crack width of the modular specimen was greater than that of the integral specimen. The strain of the steel reinforcement was estimated using the measured crack width and six formulas for evaluating the crack width. The estimated strain of the modular specimen was higher than that of the integral specimen, and the deformation of the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was accelerated with the increasing load. Therefore, the tensile load was concentrated at the discontinuity interface in the modular specimen, and the steel reinforcement at the discontinuity interface was likely to yield earlier than the integral specimen.",10.3390/app9224922

Three-dimensional visualization of information is expected to facilitate visual search for radiologists. However, as the differences in user performance, depending on radiologist experience, have not yet been assessed for real three-dimensional images, it is difficult to estimate the usability of new visualization systems for radiologists with different amounts of professional search experience. In this study, we aimed to determine how three-dimensional visual search is affected by radiologist experience and the physical properties of stimuli. Radiologists, residents, and medical students accomplished visual search tasks with varying set sizes and target-distractor similarities. Search items were presented on multiple display planes and image manipulation was conducted using a computer keyboard. We compared the search outcome and strategy among three groups of participants. All three groups submitted a similar number of correct responses depending on target-distractor similarity. However, in contrast to radiologists and residents, it took a considerably longer time for students to find the targets. The major differences were evident in search strategy when comparing the image manipulations of radiologists with those of residents and students. Our results demonstrated that experienced radiologists' search performance benefited from seeing the entire three-dimensional view of an image, whereas residents and students focused instead on reducing the amount of information and searched in a selective manner. These findings should be taken into account when planning the implementation of new workstations with three-dimensional visualization in radiology.",10.3390/app9224929
J,"Shao, CP; Li, HY; Wang, Z; Fang, JY",A Generic Block-Level Error Confinement Technique for Memory Based on Principal Component Analysis,"Nanoscale CMOS technology has encountered severe reliability issues especially in on-chip memory. Conventional word-level error resilience techniques such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC) suffer from high physical overhead and inability to correct increasingly reported multiple bit flip errors. On the other hands, state-of-the-art applications such as image processing and machine learning loosen the requirement on the levels of data protection, which result in dedicated techniques of approximated fault tolerance. In this work, we introduce a novel error protection scheme for memory, based on feature extraction through Principal Component Analysis and the modular-wise technique to segment the data before PCA. The extracted features can be protected by replacing the fault vector with the averaged confinement vectors. This approach confines the errors with either single or multi-bit flips for generic data blocks, whilst achieving significant savings on execution time and memory usage compared to traditional ECC techniques. Experimental results of image processing demonstrate that the proposed technique results in a reconstructed image with PSNR over 30 dB, while robust against both single bit and multiple bit flip errors, with reduced memory storage to just 22.4% compared to the conventional ECC-based technique.",10.3390/app9224733

The results show that the decay rate of the WTDs of the cavity for short and long time limits can be effectively tuned by the driving external field Rabi frequency, the frequency of the cavity photon, and the detuning between the microwave driving frequency and the energy-splitting of the DQDs. The photon emission energy current will flow from the thermal reservoir to the system of the DQDs when the average photon number of the cavity in a steady state is larger than that of the thermal reservoir; otherwise, the photon emission energy current will flow in the opposite direction. This also demonstrates that the effect of the DQDs can be replaced a thermal reservoir when the rate difference of a photon absorbed and emitted by DQDs is larger than zero; otherwise, it is irreplaceable. The results deepen our understanding of the statistical properties of photon emission counting. It has a promising application in the construction of nanostructured devices of photon emission on demand and of optoelectronic devices.",10.3390/app9224934

Andrzej Bachowicz using an obstacle lighting lamp that is currently in production. The developed simulation model, which has been verified experimentally, was used to determine the influence of changes in meteorological parameters on the temperature distributions on the surface of the lamp. It will be used in the future to optimize the geometry of the heat sink used in the lamp in terms of electricity consumption and thermal resistance. It is planned to extend the application of the lamp under difficult climatic conditions. Abstract The article presents the results of experimental and theoretical works aimed at determining the distribution of heat emitted by an obstacle lighting lamp. These kind of lamps are commonly applied as a warning for air traffic vehicles. There is a need for lighting devices with various intensities, whose application depends on the location and operating conditions. The overall aim of the author's work is to develop a computer model that would enable us to conduct research aimed at determining the optimal parameters of lamp operation without the need to build many physical models. Measurements of heat emitted by a currently manufactured lamp were made, and based on these, a numerical model of the lamp operating under laboratory conditions was developed. The considered lamp has two heat sources, one of which is light-emitting diodes (LEDs), while the other heat source consists of stabilizers and other elements of the lamp power supply system. After positive experimental verification of the numerical model, theoretical analyses of heat emission under various meteorological conditions were carried out, while the values of ambient temperature and airflow velocity were changed; then, the influence of these parameters on the temperature distribution on the surface of the lamp was determined.",10.3390/app9224951

J,"Adderson, R; Hubbard, T",Millipixel image correlation for sub nm measurement of MEMS motion,"A 1D digital image correlation algorithm capable of measuring the motion of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices with sub nm resolution is presented. Successive micro photographic images are recorded, then subsets of the images are column averaged and the resulting 1D profiles arc cross correlated. Factors that limit the correlation resolution are examined and methods for achieving millipixel level repeatability are discussed.

J,"Ahmad, S; Arshad, MJ",Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP: Rapid Bandwidth Utilization after Fast-Recovery Phase,"The purpose of this study is to enhance the performance of Multistream Fast Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keeping in view the recent web-based applications that are being deployed on long-range, high-speed, and high-bandwidth networks. To achieve the objective of the research study, a congestion control after fast-recovery module for congestion control scheme of Multistream Fast TCP is proposed. The module optimized the performance of the protocol by reducing the time that is required to consume the available bandwidth after a fast-recovery phase. The module is designed after studying additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease and rate-based congestion window management schemes of related transport protocols. The module adjusts the congestion window on receipt of each individual acknowledgment instead of each round trip time after the fast-recovery phase until it consumes vacant bandwidth of the network link. The module is implemented by using Network Simulator 2. Convergence time, throughput, fairness index, and goodput are the parameters used to assess the performance of proposed module. The results indicate that Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP with congestion control after fast recovery recovers its congestion window in a shorter time period as compared to multistream Fast TCP, Fast TCP, TCP New Reno, and Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Consequently, Enhanced Multistream Fast TCP consumes the available network bandwidth in lesser time and increases the throughput and goodput. The proposed module enhanced the performance of the transport layer protocol. Our findings demonstrate the performance impact in the form of a decrease in the convergence time to consume the available network bandwidth and the increase in the throughput and the goodput.",10.3390/app9214698

J,"Baek, YJ",On Non-Completeness and G-Equivariance,"With the growing threat of the side-channel attack (SCA) to the cryptographic algorithm's implementations, the masking method has become one of the most promising SCA countermeasures for securely implementing, for example, block ciphers. The basic principle of the masking method is that if the sensitive variable (which, by definition, depends on sensitive information) is split into some random variables and they are manipulated in a secure manner, then the relationship between the random variables and the corresponding side-channel information may look independent from the outside world. However, after the introduction of the glitch attack, there has been a lot of concern about the security of the masking method itself. And, to mitigate the threat of the glitch attack, the threshold implementation (TI) and G-equivariant gates were independently introduced as countermeasures. In this paper, we consider the main notions of two such independent glitch attack's countermeasures, say, non-completeness and G-equivariance, and investigate their relationship. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show that the widely-circulated proof that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs guarantees the security against the 1st order DPA even in the presence of glitches is not satisfactory. Next, using the extended notion of G-equivariance to the higher-order setting, we prove that non-completeness implies G-equivariance, which, in turn, means that the non-complete TI with uniform inputs has resistance against the glitch attack. Thirdly, we prove that the set of non-complete gates is a proper subset of the set of G-equivariant gates by showing there is a gate that is G-equivariant but not non-complete.",10.3390/app9214692

The spatial inhomogeneity corresponds to a spatially dependent scaling of the sine-Gordon potential term. The uncoupled inhomogeneous sine-Gordon equation has stable stationary front solutions that persist in the coupled system. Carrying out a numerical investigation it is found that these inhomogeneous sine-Gordon fronts loose stability, provided the coupling between the two inhomogeneous sine-Gordon equations is strong enough, with new stable fronts bifurcating. In order to analytically study the bifurcating fronts, we first approximate the smooth spatial inhomogeneity by a piecewise constant function. With this approximation, we prove analytically the existence of a pitchfork bifurcation.

The absorption coefficient reached 0.15 cm(-1), and transmission in the medium was restored during 15-35 ns for phosphate glass and 5-10 ns for silicate glass. The physical bases of this effect of the appearance and relaxation of absorption in glasses have not been previously presented. An analysis of the experimental data showed that the absorption jump is due to the fast population of the I-4(11/2) level of Nd3+ ions in glasses when nonlinear processes occur in the SSSF channel such as stimulated Raman scattering and broadening of the laser pulse spectrum. The relaxation time of the population at the I-4(11/2) level and the restoration of transmission in glasses after the termination of the laser pulse are determined by the characteristic sizes of the Nd3+ ions excitation regions arising in the samples upon interference of the laser and scattered radiation, as well as the thermophysical characteristics of the glasses.",10.1134/S1063783419110106

To solve this problem, the effects of immunization probability on the maximal infected density and the average infected density are investigated, and it's found that large immunization probability will depress the maximal infected density sharply. Moreover, it's proved that small immunization probability is of great importance, which could not only reduce the cost of immunization at low risk but also decrease the outbreak risk of the next year by making the average infected density larger in the current year. Besides, a generalized immunization strategy is presented, which makes the immunization strategy easy to carry out and meanwhile keeps the maximal and the average infected density almost as good as those in the original dynamic immunization strategy.

J,"Chen, HJ; Gao, Q; Qian, BL; Zhao, LS",Unusual Response of Thin LiTaO<sub>3</sub> Films to Intense Microwave Pulses,"Fundamentally different responses of a LiTaO3 thin film detector are observed when it is subjected to short microwave pulses as the pulse intensity is altered over a wide range. We start from weak microwave pulses which lead to only trivial pyroelectric peak response. However, when the microwave pulses become intense, the normally expected pyroelectric signal seems to be suppressed and the sign of the voltage signal can even be completely changed. Analysis indicates that while the traditional pyroelectric model, which is a linear model and works fine for our data in the small regime, it does not work anymore in the large signal regime. Since the small-signal model is the key foundation of electromagnetic-wave sensors based on pyroelectric effects, such as pyroelectric infrared detecters, the observation in this work suggests that one should be cautious when using these devices in intense fields. In addition, the evolution of detector signal with respect to excitation strength suggests that the main polarisation process is changed in the large signal regime. This is of fundamental importance to the understanding on how crystalline solids interact with intense microwaves. Possible causes of the nonlinear behaviour is discussed.",10.3390/ma12213588

To measure the concentration of the radionuclides, we obtained a spectrum by analyzing the gamma-rays emitted from the radionuclides for a measurement time of 8,000 seconds. The results show that of all the radionuclides, Tl-208 had the highest radioactivity at five of the seven beaches which K-40 had the highest radioactivity at the other two beaches. In conclusion, the radionuclides that were detected in the coastal sand samples from South Korea's East Coast are natural radionuclides; however, they can affect of the human body internally. Therefore, the radioactivity levels need to be reduced and to be investigate further.",10.3938/jkps.75.660

In inverted OPVs, the top anode must have a high work function to match the highest occupied molecular orbital level of a p-type organic semiconductor. Therefore, a functional interlayer with a high work function is inserted between the light-absorbing layer and anode. OPVs with a dual-anode buffer layer have been reported to exhibit a superior performance than those with a single-anode buffer layer. Herein, the device performance of inverted OPVs with a poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester light-absorbing layer and dual-anode buffer layer of MoO3 and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) is investigated. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPV with the HAT-CN/MoO3/Al anode system is lower than that with the conventional MoO3/Al anode system. However, the PCE of the OPV with MoO3/HAT-CN/Al is slightly higher than that with MoO3/Al. The change in the device performance by varying the deposition sequence of HAT-CN and MoO3 is discussed based on the built-in potential.",10.5757/ASCT.2019.28.6.217

We demonstrate that the gauge invariant transition amplitudes for the bare-bare transitions, which is the case in the majority of experiments, are identical to the conventional results with the velocity form interaction Hamiltonian. Under the electric dipole approximation, the gauge invariant formalism derives the modified length form interaction Hamiltonian in any gauge. We propose a simple experiment that one can perform to verify our prediction. On the other hand, the gauge invariant transition amplitudes for the dressed-dressed transitions, which is the case in the Lamb shift experiment, are identical to the conventional results with the length form interaction Hamiltonian. There is no preferred gauge in the calculations of transition amplitudes.

The UV-blue emission bands have the following characteristics: (i) the 290 run waveband could be due to defects-sites by the presence of Na ions; (ii) the 380 nm band, caused by intrinsic defects in the lattice (i.e. Non-Bridging Oxygen Hole Centers (NBOHCs), [AlO4]degrees centres, alkali planar defects and Oxygen Defect Centers (ODCs), among others); (iii) the 420 nm waveband, linked to the recombination on a centre formed from a hole-oxygen atom adjacent to two aluminum atoms (Al-O-Al) and Al-O-Si complexes; (iv) the 460 nm band, associated with the presence of Ti4+ in the plagiclase crystal lattice. The green waveband could be linked to de-excitation of Mn2+ ions.

J,"Cui, W; Gao, L",Development of a parameterization image stitching algorithm for ultrashort throw laser MEMS projectors,"We present a novel design of a parameterization image stitching algorithm for ultrashort throw laser MEMS projectors. The resultant method allows the use of projectors with short or even long throw ratios to achieve ultrashort throw projection through a parameterized algorithm to stitch multiple images into one single frame, alleviating the trade-off between the resolution and frame rate in conventional laser MEMS displays. To evaluate the effectiveness, we construct a test system that consists of three off-the-shelf projectors with a throw ratio of 1.3 and three planar reflective mirrors. Using our method, the integrated system yields an ultrashort throw ratio of 0.26, greatly reducing the projection distance from 12 to 2.6 ft for the 120-in. screen in diagonal.

The experiments have shown that the temperature behavior of resistance of bulk MgB2:LSMO samples during the transition to the superconducting state is described by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) model for 2D superconductors. The observed features of the transport properties are most likely due to two characteristic spatial scales in the system: 1) a significant difference between the geometrical dimensions of the constituent components (micrometer-sized MgB2 particles and LSMO nanoparticles), and 2) the coherence length of the triplet superconducting state of half-metal manganite LSMO contacting with MgB2. Resistive losses in such nanostructures are due to the flow of current through ferromagnetic LSMO nanogranules that cover MgB2 microgranules.

J,"De Gregorio, P",On the Definition of Energy Flux in One-Dimensional Chains of Particles,"We review two well-known definitions present in the literature, which are used to define the heat or energy flux in one dimensional chains. One definition equates the energy variation per particle to a discretized flux difference, which we here show it also corresponds to the flux of energy in the zero wavenumber limit in Fourier space, concurrently providing a general formula valid for all wavelengths. The other relies somewhat elaborately on a definition of the flux, which is a function of every coordinate in the line. We try to shed further light on their significance by introducing a novel integral operator, acting over movable boundaries represented by the neighboring particles' positions, or some combinations thereof. By specializing to the case of chains with the particles' order conserved, we show that the first definition corresponds to applying the differential continuity-equation operator after the application of the integral operator. Conversely, the second definition corresponds to applying the introduced integral operator to the energy flux. It is, therefore, an integral quantity and not a local quantity. More worryingly, it does not satisfy in any obvious way an equation of continuity. We show that in stationary states, the first definition is resilient to several formally legitimate modifications of the (models of) energy density distribution, while the second is not. On the other hand, it seems peculiar that this integral definition appears to capture a transport contribution, which may be called of convective nature, which is altogether missed by the former definition. In an attempt to connect the dots, we propose that the locally integrated flux divided by the inter-particle distance is a good measure of the energy flux. We show that the proposition can be explicitly constructed analytically by an ad hoc modification of the chosen model for the energy density.",10.3390/e21111036

The joining by vulcanization of the conveyor belts allows to obtain superior performances, but it has been found that at the vulcanizing joint of the conveyor belts, there is a ""bell""-type defect. This type of defect can cause the quick removal of the conveyor belts from use; thus, within this paper, we realized the constructive optimization of vulcanization installations using the finite element method (FEM). Thus, the FEM analysis was performed for the installation used at the present time, which has four spacers for stiffening, moving to the next stage to a stiffening system with seven spacers and, in the last stage, it was proposed to use a stiffening plate. The joined conveyor belts were of type ST 2000, and by the constructive optimization of the vulcanizing press type DSLQ, the bell-type defect was greatly reduced.

We also investigate how the set of constrains relates to the domain of the microcanonical thermodynamic limit entropy. We then show that, for fixed constraints, the parameters of the corresponding grand canonical distribution converge, as volume increases, to the corresponding parameters (derivatives, when they exist) of the thermodynamic limit entropy. The results hold when the energy is the sum of any stable, tempered interaction potential that satisfies the Gibbs variational principle (e.g. Lennard-Jones) and the kinetic energy.

We investigate the application of DFM to the linear dispersion of single layer graphene. We derive the gap equation of DFM for a Dirac cone and calculate the critical temperature as a function of carrier density. This is done using an interaction potential that utilizes the Random Phase Approximation dielectric function and thus allows for plasmonic interactions. Our results show a significantly different behaviour of the critical temperature as a function of carrier density when compared to the BCS result.

In the past, the Nucleation Theorem has been applied to determine the number of molecules in the critical nuclei of a single-component crystal via variation of the crystal growth rate with dilution by the non-crystallizable component. In this work, we extend the method to the three-component co-crystal poly (ethylene oxide)/urea/thiourea inclusion compound.

The results reveal that the secondary nuclei of the poly (ethylene oxide)/urea/thiourea inclusion compound consist mainly of ethylene oxide repeating units and urea molecules. We propose that only urea molecules and ethylene oxide repeating units are selected to form the secondary nuclei while co-crystallization of the three components happens at the lateral spreading stage.

It is shown that the results obtained for the weak interface conditions in the continuous case, lead directly to stability of the fully discrete problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The calculated lattice parameters and atomic fractional coordinates were in agreement with previous calculations and experimental data. A set of isotropic elastic parameters and related properties, namely the module and shear moduli, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, average sound velocity and Debye temperature were numerically estimated in the frame work of the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation. The absorption, energy-loss and dielectric function were calculated. We studied the main contribution to the optical spectra from the transition from the top four valence bands towards the lower three first one of conduction based on the electronic structures.",10.3938/jkps.75.678
J,"Ghose, P",A unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism: Classical and quantum aspects,"A unified classical theory of gravity and electromagnetism with a torsion vector Gamma(i) not equal 0, proposed by S N Bose in 1952, is introduced. In this theory, the torsion vector acts as a magnetic current and it is shown that (i) the electromagnetism is invariant under continuous Heaviside-Larmor transformations and (ii) the electric and magnetic charges are topologically quantised, satisfying the Dirac quantisation condition, without implying any Dirac string provided Gamma(i) is curl-less.",10.1007/s12043-019-1841-0
J,"Ghosh, D; Samanta, S; Samanta, S",Chaos based novel non-invasive approach to assess intracranial pressure in the brain using ECG and arterial BP data,"The study explores the applicability of a multifractal cross-correlated method to assess the degree of correlation of intracranial pressure (ICP) signals with ECG and ABP in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Multifractal width (w) and cross-correlation exponent (yx) estimated using multifractal detrended cross-correlation (MFDXA) method describe interesting features about the complexity of ICP signals of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. The degree of multifractality (w) of ECG signals reveal that even without going into complicated ICP signal measurement which is not only invasive but costly procedure, the trauma suffered due to brain injury can easily be assessed. With the help of two quantitative parameters w and yx appropriate software can easily be developed and coupled with ECG system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Giménez-Santamarina, S; Cardona-Serra, S; Baldoví, JJ",Exploring the transport properties of equatorially low-coordinated erbium single ion magnets,"Single-molecule spin transport represents the lower limit of miniaturization of spintronic devices. These experiments, although extremely challenging, are key to understand the magneto-electronic properties of a molecule in a junction. In this context, theoretical screening of new magnetic molecules provides invaluable knowledge before carrying out sophisticated experiments. Herein, we investigate the transport properties of three equatorially low-coordinated erbium single ion magnets with C-3 nu symmetry: Er[N(SiMe3)(2)](3) (1), Er (btmsm)(3) (2) and Er(dbpc)(3) (3), where btmsm = bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl and dbpc = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresolate. Our ligand field analysis, based on previous spectroscopic data, confirms a ground state mainly characterized by M-J = +/- 15/2 in all three of them. The relaxation of their molecular structures when placed between two Au (1 1 1) electrodes leads to an even more symmetric similar to D-3h environment, which ensures that these molecules would retain their single-molecule magnet behavior in the device setup. Hence, we simulate spin dependent transport using the DFT optimized structures on the basis of the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, which, in 1 and 2, suggests a remarkable molecular spin filtering under the effect of an external magnetic field.",10.1016/j.jmmm.2019.165455
J,"Gladkov, SO",On a Nonlinear Effect in the Superconductivity Theory,"Based on the solution of the hydrodynamic equations and Maxwell's equations, we show that an external quasi-homogeneous magnetic field leads to the emergence of a secondary electric field that is resulted from a nonlinear effect over magnetic potential A. This field is proved to exist in the region with a depth of , where delta is the London penetration depth. The hydrodynamic flow velocity is estimated.",10.1134/S1063783419110167
J,"Golipour, J",A note on noncommutative Einstein-Hilbert action,"We show the nonpositivity of the Einstein-Hilbert action for conformal flat Riemannian metrics on noncommutative 4-torus. In addition, we prove that this action vanishes only when the metric is constant flat. This recovers an earlier result of Fathizadeh-Khalkhali in the setting of spectral triples on noncommutative 4-torus. We also give a new proof of their result. Furthermore, computations of the gradient flow and the scalar curvature of noncommutative 4-torus are given.",10.1142/S0219887819501664
