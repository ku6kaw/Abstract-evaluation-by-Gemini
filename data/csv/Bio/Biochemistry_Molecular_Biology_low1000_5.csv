J,"Harada, Y",New Developments on the Early Stage of the Biosynthesis of Asparagine-Linked Glycans,"Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation occurs on most secretory and membrane proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which functions to modulate protein folding, degradation and intracellular trafficking. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying N-linked glycosylation remain largely elusive, hindering our integrative understanding of the physiological and pathological functions of this posttranslational modification. In this article, I will introduce recent advances on our understanding of regulation of N-linked glycosylation and a newly discovered inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation reaction.",10.4052/tigg.1945.2SE

J,"Havrysh, OH; Kholodovych, V; Andreev, EA",Modeling of atomic-molecular structures by contiguous filling of space with Frank-Kasper atomic domains,"An application of contiguous filling of space with convex polyhedra, also known as Frank-Kasper (FK) atomic domains is demonstrated here for modeling of atomic molecular structures. Both regular, when all polyhedron edges have equal length, and strained, depending on the topology of the polyhedron the length of its edges may slightly fluctuate from the common length, polyhedra are used. Polyhedra are connected to each other in agreement with Plateau's laws to form a contiguous uninterrupted space. An application of a new approach is demonstrated for a modeling of structures of graphite, graphene, graphane, diamond and two types of ice. The proposed approach allows to demonstrate a mutual arrangement of atoms in graphite layers, transitions between allotropic states of carbon atoms, to calculate the distances between layers in graphene and positions of water molecules in a square ice.

J,"Iasakov, TR; Anisimova, LG; Zharikova, NV; Zhurenko, EI; Korobov, VV; Markusheva, TV",Evolution and Comparative Genomics of the pSM22 Plasmid of the IncF/MOB<sub>F12</sub> Group,"A new plasmid, pSM22, was isolated from Serratia marcescens and sequenced. Its 43 190-bp sequence with an average GC-content of 58% contains 31 open reading frames (ORFs) which form replication, conjugation, stability, and adaptive modules. The replication module includes a site of initiation of leading-strand synthesis in plasmid replication, a replication termination site (terC), the repA (=repA1) and repA4 genes, and the copA sequence, which codes for an antisense RNA (asRNA). These structures are functionally integrated in an FII replicon (incompatibility group IncFII). Based on the significant differences between the FII replicon and the canonical sequences of the R plasmids R1 and NR1 (=R100=R222), pSM22 was assigned to a new subtype. The conjugation module includes 13 genes with a high identity to the genes responsible for conjugation of the F plasmid. A comparative genomic analysis showed that the conjugation modules of pSM22 and F are structurally similar. By the conjugation system and the presence of three conserved motifs in relaxase (TraI), pSM22 belongs to the F12 clade of the MOBF type. The stability module includes the resD and parA genes, which are responsible for the resolution of multimeric plasmid forms and their subsequent segregation between daughter cells. The adaptive module contains the microcin H47 (MccH47) secretion/processing and UV resistance genes. The mosaic structure of pSM22 and reductive evolution of its modules suggest high genomic plasticity for the genus Serratia. An analysis of the architecture of the pSM22 modules clarifies the evolutionary relationships among IncF/MOBF12 group plasmids in bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae and opens a novel avenue for further comparative genomic studies of Serratia plasmids.",10.1134/S0026893319040162

J,"Itano, N",Multifaceted Roles of Hyaluronan in Cancer Stem Cell Regulation: From Microenvironment Formation to Metabolic Reprogramming,"Hyaluronan acts as a major extracellular matrix component in regulation of tissue organization and cellular functions, and its production is markedly increased with cancer progression. Since the discovery of hyaluronan synthase (HAS) genes, manipulation of HAS gene expression has led to better understanding of the altered hyaluronan biosynthesis in cancer. We have demonstrated that hyaluronan overproduction promotes cancer progression by modulating tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we recently discovered that hyaluronan production regulates cancer stem cell (CSC) properties via the metabolic reprogramming of glycolysis and hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. These findings strongly suggest that hyaluronan plays a regulatory role in cellular metabolism coupled with its biosynthesis, in addition to its function as a conventional extracellular signal. In this review, I discuss multifaceted roles of hyaluronan in CSC regulation.",10.4052/tigg.1914.2SE
J,"Izumikawa, T",Biological Functions of Xylose 2-<i>O</i>-Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation in the Glycosaminoglycan-Linkage Region Tetrasaecharide,Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear polysaccharide chains covalently attached to core proteins to form proteoglycans (PGs). GAG chain assembly begins with the synthesis of the common protein linkage region tetrasaccharide attached to the serine residues of specific core proteins. Previous structural analyses have shown that the GAG-protein linkage region tetrasaccharide of PGs is transiently modified by xylose 2-O-phosphorylation. We previously identified a Xyl kinase that phosphorylates C-2 of the xylose residue and phosphoxylose phosphatase.

J,"Salvo, LJ; Coiana, L; Dobrecky, C; Tripodi, V; Flor, S; Lucangioli, S",Development and validation of a capillary electrophoresis method applied to the analysis of l-citrulline in an oral formulation for pediatric use,"A simple and highly sensitive CE-UV method was applied in the determination of l-ctrulline, which was developed from an oral formulation for pediatric use. The novel method was based on the analysis of l-citrulline for direct ultraviolet detection at 198 nm. The BGE consisted of 10 mM sodium tetraborate and 50 mM SDS at pH 9, and the electrophoretic parameters were optimized. The method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, LOD, LOQ, precision, accuracy, and robustness. The LOD and LOQ obtained were 1.36 and 4.54 mu g/mL, respectively. In addition, the method offers higher sensitivity and specificity compared with the results obtained from HPLC method using UV-detectors, in which l-citrulline needs to be derivatizated. Furthermore, low cost and simplicity of the system allowed the rapid and simple quantitation of l-citrulline in the oral formulation for quality control and stability indicated method.",10.1002/elps.201900008
J,"Jha, B; Vyas, R; Bhushan, J; Sehgal, D; Biswal, BK","Structural insights into the substrate specificity of SP_0149, the substrate-binding protein of a methionine ABC transporter from <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>","Successful pathogenesis is a cumulative effect of the virulence factors of a pathogen and its capability to efficiently utilize the available nutrients from the host. Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen, may either reside asymptomatically as a nasopharyngeal commensal inside the human host or cause lethal diseases, including pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. S. pneumoniae is known to acquire methionine (Met) from its host through a Met importer. Here, the crystal structure of the substrate-binding protein (SBP; SP_0149) of an ABC importer with Met bound is reported at a resolution of 1.95 angstrom. The three-dimensional structure of SBP shows that it is composed of two distinct domains, each consisting of a mixed beta-sheet flanked by helices. The substrate, Met, is bound in the central part of the interface between the two domains. The overall structure of SP_0149 resembles those of SBPs from other reported bacterial Met and Gly-Met dipeptide transporters. However, a detailed analysis of these structures shows notable variations in the amino-acid composition of the substrate-binding pockets of the SP_0149-Met and GmpC-Gly-Met structures. In particular, SP_0149 harbors Thr212 and Tyr114, whereas the corresponding residues in GmpC are Gly and Val. This difference is likely to be the underlying basis for their differential substrate specificity. In summary, the structure of the SP_0149-Met complex provides insights into the transport function of SP_0149 and its interactions with methionine. It opens up avenues for the rational design of inhibitors of SP_0149 through a structure-mediated approach.",10.1107/S2053230X19009038

ZTP riboswitches bind the purine-biosynthetic intermediate 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside 5'-monophosphate (ZMP) and its triphosphorylated form (ZTP). Ligand binding to this riboswitch ultimately upregulates genes involved in folate and purine metabolism. Using an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL), the room-temperature structure of the Fusobacterium ulcerans ZTP riboswitch bound to ZMP has now been determined at 4.1 angstrom resolution. This model, which was refined against a data set from similar to 750 diffraction images (each from a single crystal), was found to be consistent with that previously obtained from data collected at 100 K using conventional synchrotron X-radiation. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of time-resolved XFEL experiments to understand how the ZTP riboswitch accommodates cognate ligand binding.",10.1107/S2053230X19008549

Many signaling molecules accumulate there, and glycolipid composition greatly influences signal transmission efficiency. Therefore, analyzing the dynamics and structure of glycolipid microdomains is very important in understanding life phenomena.

J,"Kanie, O",An Orthogonal Point of View,"My research was initiated when studying oligosaccharide synthesis. Besides my poor attitude toward this area of study, too many synthetic steps are required for the functional group protection and key coupling reactions in oligosaccharide synthesis. When starting an actual experiment, another difficulty that arises is the complex techniques used in the synthesis of oligosaccharides, which is experienced by most students. Despite these difficulties, oligosaccharide synthesis has already become a widely studied research topic; yet, its successful automation is still to be accomplished. An ideal oligosaccharide synthesis utilizes a simple yet flexible synthetic strategy, which is urgently required. Thus, to overcome the limitations associated with its synthesis and to satisfy the need of an ideal process, I came up with an idea of orthogonal coupling strategy for the synthesis of oligosaccharides.",10.4052/tigg.1909.2SE
J,"Kim, J; Hajam, IA; Lee, JH",Human antigen presenting cells stimulated with <i>Salmonella</i> delivered influenza antigens induce cytokine production and proliferation of human CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells <i>in vitro</i>,"This study aimed to investigate whether the human antigen presenting cells (APCs) can process and present Salmonella expressing H7N9 hemagglutinin (Sal-HA), neuraminidase (Sal-NA) or M2 ectodomain (Sal-M2e) to T cells and subsequently activate CD4(+) T cell responses in vitro. In this study, APCs generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were first treated with mitomycin-C, followed by stimulation with Sal-HA, Sal-M2e, Sal-NA or Salmonella alone for 24 h. Subsequently, stimulated APCs were coincubated with untreated PBMCs (1:10) of the same individual for 24 or 72 h and then analysed for cytokine induction and T cell proliferations by qRT-PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Our results demonstrated that APCs stimulated with Sal-HA, Sal-M2e or Sal-NA induced significantly (p < .05) higher CD3(+) CD4(+) T cell proliferations compared to the APCs treated with Salmonella alone. Our data further revealved that APCs treated with Sal-HA induced significantly (p < .05) higher CD3(+) CD4(+) T cell responses compared to the APCs treated with either Sal-M2e or Sal-NA, which both induced almost comparable levels. The T cell proliferation responses were further measured by lymphocyte proliferation assay and the results showed that Sal-HA and Sal-M2e stimulated APCs induced significantly (p < .05) higher proliferations in T cells compared to the APCs stimulated with either Sal-NA or Salmonella alone. With respect to cytokine inductions, APCs treated with either Sal-HA or Sal-M2e induced significantly (p < .05) higher mRNA transcription levels of proinflammatory (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23), Th1 (IFN-gamma), Th17 (IL-17 and IL-21) and Th2 (IL-10 and TGF-beta) cytokines in T cells compared to Sal-NA or Salmonella alone treated APCs. In conclusion, we show that Salmonella system can efficiently deliver vaccine antigens to APCs and is, thus, capable to elicit heterologous antigen-specific adaptive immunity.",10.1016/j.jim.2019.04.006

The number of glycan branches and formation of glycan epitopes at non-reducing ends afford a wide variety of glycan structures. In particular, in the nervous system, many structurally unique glycans are expressed, which ensures that complex neural functions are maintained. We have focused on neural specific glycans such as HNK-1. branched O-mannose glycans, and bisecting GIcNAc, and revealed that expression of these neural glycans is tightly regulated. Moreover, studies by us and other groups have clarified that aberrant expression of these glycans is associated with various neural diseases, including dementia.

J,"Kwak, HJ; Um, JY; Lee, SS",Mild NO preconditioning protects H9c2 cells against NO-induced apoptosis through activation of PI3K/Akt and PKA-dependent pathways,"Backgrounds: Nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in cardioprotection. Its role against cardioprotection is dependent on the level of NO. Although it is well known that NO preconditioning has cardioprotective effects, but its mechanism remains unsatisfactory.Methods: To induce NO preconditioning, H9c2 cells were treated with low NO concentration and subsequently induced apoptosis by high NO. The signalling and anti-apoptotic effects of NO preconditioning were monitored by Western blotting, facs analysis.Results: Sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced cytotoxicity was inhibited by low SNP (0.3 mM) preconditioning. Furthermore, low SNP phosphorylated Akt/FoxO1 in the presence of high SNP (1.5 mM), while phosphorylated Akt/FoxO1 and viability were reversed by PI3K inhibitor. Also, low NO-induced CREB phosphorylation with high NO was inhibited by PKA inhibitor, indicating that NO preconditioning protects NO-induced cytotoxicity in PKA dependently. Apoptotic inhibition with NO preconditioning was accompanied with increased Bcl-2, decreased Bax, and caspase3 activation, which was all reversed by LY294002.Conclusion: Our results indicate that low NO preconditioning prevent subsequent high NO-induced apoptosis via Akt/PKA/CREB activation in H9c2 cells.",10.1007/s13273-019-0033-9
J,"Lee, W; Choi, M; Kim, S; Tang, WXF; Kim, DH; Kim, HS; Liang, P; Han, K",A comprehensive analysis of the Baboon-specific full-length LINE-1 retrotransposons,"BackgroundLong interspersed elements-1 (LINE-1s or L1s) and Alu elements are most successful retrotransposons that have generated genetic diversity and genomic fluidity in the primate genome. They account for similar to 27.7% of the primate genome. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that the retrotransposition rate of Alu elements is nine times higher in baboons than in humans.ObjectiveThe expansion of Alu copies could be dependent on the activity of L1-encoded proteins. Thus, we aimed to investigate full-length baboon-specific L1s and characterize structurally and functionally intact baboon-specific L1s (ORF1p/ORF2p and ORF2p only) that could induce trans-mobilization of Alu elements in the baboon genome.ResultsA total of 673 baboon-specific L1 candidates (>4kb) were identified through the comparative genomic analysis. Applying the baboon-specific correction value obtained from the experimental validation, it demonstrated that approximately 446 baboon-specific L1s (>4kb) were present in the baboon reference genome (papAnu2). In addition, we observed phylogenetic relationship of the baboon-specific L1s through the neighbor-joining method and they diverged from the L1PA6 consensus sequence. Finally, we identified 36 full-length baboon-specific L1s that were intact both ORF1p and ORF2p.ConclusionThe number of baboon-specific full-length L1s is fewer than the number of human-specific full-length L1s. Therefore, there is possibility that the L1 master gene or L1 source gene is more abundant in the baboon genome, or that in trans retrotransposition activity of baboon-specific L1s is relatively stronger than in the other genomes.",10.1007/s13258-019-00794-x
J,"Li, CJ; Sun, YF; He, B; Sun, L",Mining Implicit Treatment Concepts for Neural Precision Medicine,"Precision medicine (PM) is regarded as an information retrieval (IR) task in which biomedical articles containing treatment information about specific diseases or genetic variants are retrieved in response to patient record for the purpose of providing medical evidence to the point-of-care. In existing PM approaches, manual keywords, such as ""treatment"" and ""therapy,"" are considered direct indicators of treatment information and are thereby introduced to expand the original query. However, the common medical concepts that are implicitly related to treatment (such as ""oncogene"" and ""tumor""), and differ the relevant documents from the non-relevant ones, are yet to be utilized. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose an extension of the state-of-the-art neural IR (NIR) models, including K-NRM and DRMM, to encapsulate the PM solutions within a neural network framework, referred to as NIRPM Specifically, the proposed approach mines a global list of common medical concepts from documents that are judged pertinent to different queries. Thereafter, the mined implicit concepts are incorporated within an NIR framework to enhance the effectiveness of PM.

J,"Li, YY; Wang, GZ; Chen, LM; Xie, L",The Workflow of Neoantigen Identification Based on Proteogenomic Methodology,"Tumor neoantigens are important targets for immunotherapy. Based on high-throughput tumor genomic analysis, each missense mutation can potentially give rise to multiple neopeptides, numerous false positive neoantigens will be produced, experimental verification would require immense time and experience. Specific identification of immunogenic candidate neoantigens is consequently a major challenge. Here we introduce a workflow to predict and filter neoantigens of breast cancer with proteogenomic methodology, which can be beneficial to high quality identification of neoantigens. We found that C2 (IFN - gamma dominant) immunophenotype possessed the most number of neoantigens. C2 immunophenotype shows the highest M1/M2 macrophage polarization, a strong CD8 signal and the greatest T cell receptor(TCR) diversity, which may lead to more neoantigen number than in other immunophenotypes of breast cancer. In addition, we also observed that there is a positive linear relationship between neoantigen number and tumor mutation burden. By further screening for predicted tumor mutant peptides using mass spectral data of breast cancer, we found that more than 20 000 predicted neoantigens were reduced to dozens of mutant peptides in protein expression level, the corresponding mutant genes could be further analyzed. Finally, in order to define which neoantigens were more likely to be immunogenic, TCR recognition probability was calculated using blastp method. In this study, proteomics data was used to further screen the predicted neoantigens, which improved the prediction accuracy of neoantigens, and could greatly reduce the validation scope of potential subsequent experiments. This workflow provides a new insight for tumor neoantigen prediction and screening.",10.16476/j.pibb.2018.0304

It has been reported that phospholipids can act as agents to improve the absorption of antioxidants. Therefore, EGCG3''Me phospholipid complex (EPC) was utilized in this study to investigate its activity on gut flora of an obesity mouse model. After the administration of the complex for 8 weeks, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was significantly increased (p < 0.05); meanwhile, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was decreased, suggesting the potential anti-obesity effect of the complex. Furthermore, the expression of Muc2 and Reg3g were directly upregulated by EPC intervention. Practical applications Although EGCG3''Me has shown excellent biological benefits, the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and high polar properties hindered its application.

The hypothetical protein encoded by the mgl2 gene was found to be similar to methyltransferases (MTases). Protein homology and template-based modeling facilitated prediction of the Mgl2 structure, which greatly resembled class I MTases with a S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding cleft. The Mgl2 protein was engaged in exopolysaccharide, but not lipopolysaccharide, synthesis. The mgl2 deletion mutant produced exopolysaccharide comprised of only low molecular weight fractions, while overexpression of mgl2 caused overproduction of exopolysaccharide with a normal low to high molecular weight ratio. The deletion of the mgl2 gene resulted in disturbances in biofilm formation and a slight increase in motility in minimal medium. Red clover (Trifolium pratense) inoculated with the mgl2 mutant formed effective nodules, and the appearance of the plants indicated active nitrogen fixation. The mgl2 gene was preceded by an active and strong promoter. Mgl2 was defined as an integral membrane protein and formed homodimers in vivo; however, it did not interact with Pss proteins encoded within the Pss-I region.

I was interested in this epitope and investigated the biosynthetic enzymes for this epitope. I fortunately received the JSCR Young Investigator Award 1998.

J,"Okajima, T",Extracellular <i>O</i>-GlcNAc: From Discovery to Current Developments,"My group has discovered extracellular O-GlcNAc on the epidermal growth factor repeats of Notch receptors. Unlike OGT-dependent O-GlcNAcylation, extracellular O-GleNAc occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum by the action of EOGT. Genetic inactivation of eogt in Drosophila revealed that extracellular O-GlcNAc is essential for developmental processes and appears to regulate the function of apical extracellular molecules such as Dumpy. In contrast, extracellular O-GlcNAc is required for the precise control of Notch signaling in mammals. Eogt mutant mice show defects in retinal vascular integrity. Importantly, mutations in EOGT cause Adams-Oliver syndrome, a congenital disorder in humans. These findings indicate diverse but essential biological functions of extracellular O-GlcNAc in Drosophila and mammals. In this article, I will give an overview of the biochemical and biological studies of extracellular O-GlcNAc, summarizing previous findings and current developments.",10.4052/tigg.1927.2SE

It is a real-time, label-free and non-invasive optical detection technique that has found wide applications in pharmaceutical industry as well as the biological and medical fields. Combining transmission measurement with optical trapping has emerged as a powerful tool allowing stable sample trapping, while also facilitating transmittance data analysis. In this study, a near-infrared laser beam emitting at a wavelength of 1064 nm was used for both optical trapping and transmission measurement investigation of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected and uninfected TZM-bl cells. The measurements of the transmittance intensity of individual cells in solution were carried out using a home built optical trapping system combined with laser transmission setup using a single beam gradient trap. Transmittance spectral intensity patterns revealed significant differences between the HIV-1 infected and uninfected cells. This result suggests that the transmittance data analysis technique used in this study has the potential to differentiate between infected and uninfected TZM-bl cells without the use of labels. The results obtained in this study could pave a way into developing an HIV-1 label-free diagnostic tool with possible applications at the point of care.",10.1002/jbio.201800349

Chemically pure standards of the beta-O-glucuronide of ethylene glycol (EG-GLUC) and a deuterated analog (d(4)-EG-GLUC) were synthesized. A high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry method for determination of EG-GLUC in serum after ultrafiltration was validated. Inter-assay precision (%RSD) was 3.9% to 15.1% and inter-assay %bias was -2.8% to 12.2%. The measuring range was 2-100 mu mol/L (0.48-24 mg/L). Specificity testing showed no endogenous amounts in routine clinical samples (n = 40). The method was used to analyze authentic, clinical serum samples (n = 31) from patients intoxicated with ethylene glycol. EG-GLUC was quantified in 15 of these samples, with a mean concentration of 6.5 mu mol/L (1.6 mg/L), ranging from 2.3 to 15.6 mu mol/L (0.55 to 3.7 mg/L). In five samples, EG-GLUC was detected below the limit of quantification (2 mu mol/L) and it was below the limit of detection in 11 samples (1 mu mol/L). Compared to the millimolar concentrations of ethylene glycol present in blood after intoxications and potentially available for conjugation, the concentrations of EG-GLUC found in clinical serum samples are very low, but comparable to concentrations of ethyl glucuronide after medium dose ethanol intake. In theory, EG-GLUC has a potential value as a biomarker for ethylene glycol intake, but the pharmacokinetic properties, in vivo/vitro stability and the biosynthetic pathways of EG-GLUC must be further studied in a larger number of patients and other biological matrices.",10.1002/dta.2584

Previously, we developed Conditional by Inversion (COIN), an allele design that utilizes an exon-splitting intron and an invertible genetrap-like module (COIN module) to create null alleles upon Cre-mediated inversion. Here we build upon COINs by generating a new Multifunctional Allele (MFA), that utilizes a single gene-targeting step and three site-specific recombination systems, to generate four allelic states: 1. The initial MFA (generated upon targeting) functions as a null with reporter (plus drug selection cassette) allele, wherein the gene of interest is inactivated by both inversion of a critical region of its coding sequence and simultaneous insertion of a reporter gene. MFAs can also be used as 'reverse-conditional' alleles as they are functionally wild type when they are converted to COIN alleles. 2. Null with reporter (minus drug selection cassette), wherein the selection cassette, the inverted critical region, and the COIN module are removed. 3. COIN-based conditional-null via removal of the selection cassette and reporter and simultaneous re-inversion of the critical region of the target. 4.

Asp-132 and Asp-201 are located in the structure near the pyridine NH of the PLP, with Asp-201 forming a hydrogen bond. Mutation of Asp-132 to alanine and glutamate and Asp-201 to glutamate results in reduced catalytic activity with L-kynurenine and beta-benzoyl-L-alanine, but not O-benzoyl-L-serine. D132A, D132E D201E and S36A mutant Pfkynases all can form quinonoid and vinylogous amide intermediates with beta-benzoyl-L-alanine, similar to wild-type enzyme. D132A, D132E, and D201E Pfkynase react more slowly with beta-benzoyl-L-alanine and benzaldehyde to form an aldol product absorbing at 490 nm than wild-type, with D132E reacting the slowest. The H-1 NMR spectra of wild-type and D201E Pfkynase are very similar in the low field region from 10 to 18 ppm, but that of D132A Pfkynase is missing a resonance at 13.1 ppm. These results show that these residues modulate the reactivity of the PLP at different stages during the reaction cycle. Ser-36 is located near the expected location of the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate. Mutation of Ser-36 to alanine results in a 230-fold reduction of k(cat) and 30-fold reduction in k(cat)/K-m with L-kynurenine, but very little effect on the reaction of O-benzoyl-L-serine. Thus, the rate-determining step in the reaction of S36A Pfkynase is the C-beta-C-gamma bond cleavage. These results support the hypothesis that Ser-36 together with Tyr-226 is part of an oxyanion hole that polarizes the carbonyl of the substrate in the catalytic mechanism of Pfkynase.",10.1016/j.bbapap.2019.05.005

The unidirectional movement is coupled with the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and product release cycle. With the progress of experimental techniques and the enhancement of measuring directness, detailed knowledge of the motility of myosin V has been obtained. Following the ATPase cycle, the 4-state mechanochemical model of the myosin V's processive movement is used. The transitions between various states take place in a stochastic manner. We can use the master equation to analyze and calculate quantitatively. Meanwhile, the effect of the reverse reaction is taken fully into account. We fit the mean velocity, the mean dwell time, the mean run length, and the ratio of forward/backward steps as a functionof ATP, ADP, and Pi concertration. The theoretical curves are generally in line with the experimental data. This work provides a new insight for the characteristic of myosin V.",10.1109/TCBB.2017.2669311

Based on the crystal structure of MTH1, de novo design was employed to construct a series of new MTH1 inhibitors by means of fragment-based strategy. ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) were used to assess the pharmacokinetic profiles; pharmacophore screening and molecular docking were carried out to obtain 9 candidate molecules. Then, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to learn the stability of receptor-ligand complexes, which have the lowest binding energy in docking, and the binding model was analyzed. Finally, using reverse virtual screening, potential targets of query compounds, especially those enzymes participating in various cancer-related pathways, were found.

However, the inherent complexity of such biological assemblies comprising dozens of moving parts often limits the resolution of structural models and leaves the puzzle as to how each functional configuration transitions to the next. Orthogonal biochemical information is crucial to understanding the molecular interactions that drive those rearrangements. We present a two-step method for chemical probing detected by tandem mass-spectrometry to globally assess the reactivity of lysine residues within purified macromolecular complexes. Because lysine side chains often balance the negative charge of RNA in ribonucleoprotein complexes, the method is especially useful for detecting changes in protein-RNA interactions. By probing the E. coli 30S ribosome subunit, we established that the reactivity pattern of lysine residues quantitatively reflects structure models derived from X-ray crystallography. We also used the strategy to assess differences in three conformations of purified human spliceosomes in the context of recent cryo-electron microscopy models. Our results demonstrate that the probing method yields powerful biochemical information that helps contextualize architectural rearrangements of intermediate resolution structures of macromolecular complexes, often solved in multiple conformations.",10.1080/15476286.2019.1632777

Increasing evidence reveals that smoking-related cancers have distinct molecular characteristics from non-smoking cancers. Until now, the role of ATM rs189037 in cancer risk stratified by smoking status still remains unclear. To evaluate the association between ATM rs189037 and cancer risk based on smoking status, we performed this meta-analysis by a comprehensive literature search via databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and CNKI, updated till January 2019. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from eligible studies if available, to assess the relationship strengths. A total of seven eligible studies were included, comprising 4294 cancer patients (smokers: 1744 [40.6%]) and 4259 controls (smokers: 1418 [33.3%]). Results indicated a significant association of ATM rs189037 with cancer risk. In non-smokers, compared with GG genotype, AA genotype increased a 1.40-fold risk of overall cancer (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.15-1.70, P-heterogeneity=0.433, I-2 = 0.0%).

This, however, is a computationally challenging task. This task is further complicated as biological interactions depend on limited resources, i.e., a reaction takes place if the reactant molecule concentrations are above a certain threshold level. This biochemical property implies that network edges can participate in a limited number of motifs simultaneously. Existing motif counting methods ignore this problem. This simplification often leads to inaccurate motif counts (over- or under-estimates), and thus, wrong biological interpretations.ResultsIn this paper, we develop a novel motif counting algorithm, Partially Overlapping MOtif Counting (POMOC), that considers capacity levels for all interactions in counting motifs.ConclusionsOur experiments on real and synthetic networks demonstrate that motif count using the POMOC method significantly differs from the existing motif counting approaches, and our method extends to large-scale biological networks in practical time. Our results also show that our method makes it possible to characterize the impact of different stress factors on cell's organization of network. In this regard, analysis of a S. cerevisiae transcriptional regulatory network using our method shows that oxidative stress is more disruptive to organization and abundance of motifs in this network than mutations of individual genes. Our analysis also suggests that by focusing on the edges that lead to variation in motif counts, our method can be used to find important genes, and to reveal subtle topological and functional differences of the biological networks under different cell states.",10.1186/s12859-019-2838-x

However, there is no consensus about the effect of MBL2 polymorphism and MBL levels in leishmaniasis infections. We investigated the implications of MBL2 gene variants as well as MBL serum levels and occurrence of visceral leishmaniosis (VL) caused by Leishmania chagasi. A case-control analytic study was performed on 161 patients with VL and 161 healthy individuals in a northeast region of Brazil. The alleles of exon 1 (MBL2*A, MBL2*B, MBL2*C and MBL2*D) and promoter region (-550L/H, -221Y/X and +4P/Q) were identified by automatic sequencing and the MBL serum levels were determined using an ELISA kit. MBL serum levels were similar in VL patients compared to the healthy controls. Also, allelic, genotype and haplotype frequencies of variants in exon 1 and promoter region did not significantly differ between case and control groups. Overall, our data show that MBL2 polymorphisms within the structural gene as well as the promoter region influence functional MBL serum levels but are not associated with susceptibility to L. chagasi infection in this population.

Most bioinformatics methods for studying fused genes are based on the sequence similarity search. However, if the ancestral sequences were lost during evolution or changed too much, it is impossible to detect the fusion. Previously, we have developed a method of searching for triplet periodicity (TP) change points in protein-coding sequences (CDS) and showed the possible relation of this phenomenon with gene formation as a result of fusion. In this study, we improved the TP change point detection method and studied the genes of six eukaryotic genomes. At the level of 2%-3% of the probability of type I error, TP change points were found in 20%-40% of genes. Further analysis showed that about 30% of the TP change points can be explained by amino acid repeats. Another 30% can be potentially fused genes, alignment for which was detected by the BLAST program. We believe that the rest of the results can be fused genes, the ancestral sequences for which have been lost. The method is more sensitive to TP changes and allowed us to find up to two to three times more cases of significant TP change points than our previous method.",10.1089/cmb.2019.0122

Protein engineering plays an important role in the optimization of desired therapeutic properties such as reducing immunogenicity, increasing stability for storage, increasing target specificity, etc. One category of protein therapeutics is nature-inspired bioengineered cystine-dense peptides (CDPs) for various biological targets. These engineered proteins are often further modified by synthetic chemistry. For example, candidate mini-proteins can be conjugated into active small molecule drugs. We refer to modified mini-proteins as Optides (Optimized peptides). To efficiently serve the multidisciplinary lab scientists with varied therapeutic portfolio research goals in a non-commercial setting, a cost effective extendable laboratory information management system (LIMS) is/was needed.ResultsWe have developed a LIMS named Optide-Hunter for a generalized engineered protein compounds workflow that tracks entities and assays from creation to preclinical experiments. The implementation and custom modules are built using LabKey server, which is an Open Source platform for scientific data integration and analysis. Optide-Hunter contains a compound registry, in-silico assays, high throughput production, large-scale production, in vivo assays and data extraction from a specimen-tracking database.

Histone H3 lysine methylation is a potential epigenetic code for the chromatin organization and transcriptional control. Recognition of histone methylation is achieved by evolutionary conserved reader modules known as chromodomain, identified in several proteins, and is involved in transcriptional silencing and chromatin remodelling. Genetic perturbations within the structurally conserved chromodomain could potentially mistarget the reader protein and impair their regulatory pathways, ultimately leading to cellular chaos by setting the stage for tumor development and progression. Here, we report the structural conservations associated with diverse functions, prognostic significance and functional consequences of mutations within chromodomain of human proteins in distinct cancers. We have extensively analysed chromodomain containing human proteins in terms of their structural-functional ability to act as a molecular switch in the recognition of methyl-lysine recognition. We further investigated the combinatorial potential, target promiscuity and binding specificity associated with their underlying mechanisms. Indeed, the molecular mechanism of epigenetic silencing significantly underlies a newer cancer therapy approach. We hope that a critical understanding of chromodomains will pave the way for novel paths of research providing newer insights into the designing of effective anti-cancer therapies.

In this regard, Hsp90 and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) mediated firefly luciferase (FLuc) kinetics was investigated using apyrase and FLuc as client proteins. Bioluminescent assay containing Hsp90, ATP, and apyrase led to complete loss of luminescence at 50 degrees C which indicates the protective role of Hsp90 against thermal denaturation. Similarly, the assay sample comprising Hsp90, ATP, and FLuc showed 2 fold increments in luminescence than their counterparts. Introduction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the pre-incubated assay mixture led to an initial rise in the luminescence (28%) in comparison to the sample containing Hsp90, ATP and FLuc. Therefore, FLuc based HTS assays are not suitable for clinical samples which may contain stabilizing agents. However, thermally denatured FLuc and apyrase could not regain their active conformation even when Hsp90 and ATP were introduced in the assay system. This observation justifies the role of Hsp90 to be protective rather than a reparation agent when acts without co-chaperones. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The majority of these techniques have been only focused on the prediction of beta-turn location in proteins. We developed a hybrid approach for analysis and prediction of different types of beta-turn. Results A two-stage hybrid model developed to predict the beta-turn types I, II, IV and VIII. Multinomial logistic regression was initially used for the first time to select significant parameters in prediction of beta-turn types using a self-consistency test procedure. The extracted parameters were consisted of 80 amino acid positional occurrences and 20 amino acid percentages in beta-turn sequence. The most significant parameters were then selected using multinomial logistic regression model. Among these, the occurrences of glutamine, histidine, glutamic acid and arginine, respectively, in positions i, i+1, i+2 and i+3 of beta-turn sequence had an overall relationship with 5 beta-turn types. A neural network model was then constructed and fed by the parameters selected by multinomial logistic regression to build a hybrid predictor. The networks have been trained and tested on a non-homologous dataset of 565 protein chains by nine fold cross-validation. It has been observed that the hybrid model gives a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.473 and 0.124, respectively, for beta-turn types II and VIII which are best among previously reported results. Our model also distinguished the different types of beta-turn in the embedded binary logit comparisons which have not carried out so far.

To clarify the cytotoxic mechanism of MA1, we screened for the genes involved in the cytotoxicity of MA1 in monocytoid U937 cells by using a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide knockout library. Screening was performed by positive selection for cells that were resistant to MA1 treatment, and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) integrated into MA1-resistant cells were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. As a result of the evaluation of sgRNAs that were enriched in MA1-resistant cells, SQLE, which encodes squalene epoxidase, was identified as a candidate gene.

During wound healing (WH), alpha 6 integrin showed dynamic expression, first greatly upregulated in unclosed wounds and then downregulated upon re-epithelialization. Further analysis of different wound regions confirmed alpha 6 integrin significantly increased in migratory cells and migration was coupled with differentiation.

J,"Morris, D; Maximova, T; Plaku, E; Shehu, A",Attenuating dependence on structural data in computing protein energy landscapes,"Background: Nearly all cellular processes involve proteins structurally rearranging to accommodate molecular partners. The energy landscape underscores the inherent nature of proteins as dynamic molecules interconverting between structures with varying energies. In principle, reconstructing a protein's energy landscape holds the key to characterizing the structural dynamics and its regulation of protein function. In practice, the disparate spatio-temporal scales spanned by the slow dynamics challenge both wet and dry laboratories. However, the growing number of deposited structures for proteins central to human biology presents an opportunity to infer the relevant dynamics via exploitation of the information encoded in such structures about equilibrium dynamics. Results: Recent computational efforts using extrinsic modes of motion as variables have successfully reconstructed detailed energy landscapes of several medium-size proteins. Here we investigate the extent to which one can reconstruct the energy landscape of a protein in the absence of sufficient, wet-laboratory structural data. We do so by integrating intrinsic modes of motion extracted off a single structure in a stochastic optimization framework that supports the plug-and-play of different variable selection strategies. We demonstrate that, while knowledge of more wet-laboratory structures yields better-reconstructed landscapes, precious information can be obtained even when only one structural model is available. Conclusions: The presented work shows that it is possible to reconstruct the energy landscape of a protein with reasonable detail and accuracy even when the structural information about the protein is limited to one structure. By attenuating the dependence on structural data of methods designed to compute protein energy landscapes, the work opens up interesting venues of research on structure-based inference of dynamics. Of particular interest are directions of research that will extend such inference to proteins with no experimentally-characterized structures.",10.1186/s12859-019-2822-5

In many prokaryotes, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DSBs relies on a two-component machinery constituted by the ring-shaped DNA-binding Ku that recruits the multicatalytic protein Ligase D (LigD) to the ends. By using its polymerization and ligase activities, LigD fills the gaps that arise after realignment of the ends and seals the resulting nicks. Here, we show the presence of a robust AP lyase activity in the polymerization domain of Bacillus subtilis LigD (BsuLigD) that cleaves AP sites preferentially when they are proximal to recessive 5-ends. Such a reaction depends on both, metal ions and the formation of a Watson-Crick base pair between the incoming nucleotide and the templating one opposite the AP site. Only after processing the AP site, and in the presence of the Ku protein, BsuLigD catalyzes both, the in-trans addition of the nucleotide to the 3-end of an incoming primer and the ligation of both ends. These results imply that formation of a preternary-precatalytic complex ensures the coupling of AP sites cleavage to the end-joining reaction by the bacterial LigD.",10.1093/nar/gkz265

They comprise two or more tumor-targeting peptides and an immune-stimulating effector peptide connected by inert polymer linkers. They are produced by solid phase peptide synthesis and share the specific targeting activities of antibodies (IgGs) but are much smaller in size and exploit a different immune-stimulating mechanism. Two ISErs (Y-9 and Y-59) that bind to the cancer cell markers integrin alpha 3 and EphA2, respectively, are analyzed here with respect to their immune cell stimulation. We have previously shown that they activate formyl peptide receptors on myeloid immune cells and induce respiratory burst in neutrophils and myeloid chemotaxis in solution. It remained, however, unclear whether these molecules can stimulate immune cells while bound to tumor cells, an essential step in the hypothesized mode of action. Here, we demonstrate that ISEr Y-9 induced respiratory burst and caused a change in the shape of neutrophils when bound to the surface of protein A beads as a model of tumor cells. More importantly, tumor cell lines carrying receptor-bound Y-9 or Y-S9 also activated neutrophils, evidenced by a significant change in shape. Interestingly, similar activation was induced by the supernatants of the cells incubated with ISEr, indicating that ISErs released from tumor cells, intact or degraded into fragments, significantly contributed to immune stimulation. These findings provide new evidence for the mode of action of ISErs, namely by targeting cancer cells and subsequently provoking an innate immune response against them.",10.1021/acs.biochem.9b00169
J,"Antholine, WE; Myers, CR",Concentration of Fe(3+)-Triapine in BEAS-2B Cells,"An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) method was used to determine the concentration of the antitumor agent Triapine in BEAS-2B cells when Triapine was bound to iron (Fe). Knowledge of the concentration of Fe-Triapine in tumor cells may be useful to adjust the administration of the drug or to adjust iron uptake in tumor cells. An EPR spectrum is obtained for Fe(3+)-Triapine, Fe(3+)(Tp)(2)(+), in BEAS-2B cells after addition of Fe(3+)(Tp)(2)(+). Detection of the low spin signal for Fe(3+)(Tp)(2)(+) shows that the Fe(3+)(Tp)(2)(+) complex is intact in these cells. It is proposed that Triapine acquires iron from transferrin in cells including tumor cells. Here, it is shown that iron from purified Fe-transferrin is transferred to Triapine after the addition of ascorbate. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the EPR method has been used to determine the concentration of an iron antitumor agent in cells.",10.3390/ijms20123062

The impact of CPB on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes' activity is the key factor. The metabolic rates of caffeine, dextromethorphan, midazolam, omeprazole, and Losartan to the CYP-specific metabolites are validated measures of in vivo CYP 1A2, 2D6, 3A4, 2C19, and 2C9 activities, respectively. The study aim is to assess the activities of major CYPs in patients on extracorporeal circulation (EC). This is a pilot, prospective, open-label, observational study in patients undergoing surgery using EC and patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a control group. CYP activities will be measured on the day, and 1-2 days pre-surgery/3-4 days post-surgery (cardiac surgery and Laparoscopic cholecystectomy) and 1-2 days after starting ECMO, 1-2 weeks after starting ECMO, and 1-2 days after discontinuation from ECMO. Aforementioned CYP substrates will be administered to the patient and blood samples will be collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h post-dose. Major CYP enzymes' activities will be compared in each participant on the day, and before/after surgery. The CYP activities will be compared in three study groups to investigate the impact of CYPs on EC.",10.3390/mps2020038

The objective of our investigation is the study of probable consequences of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from Wi-Fi router devices on the short-term memory, and attention's levels. A population consisting of 312 female college students (14 to 17 years old) was elected by cluster random sampling. Teenagers were divided into two groups of control group (Wi-Fi nonusers; n=138), and experiment group (Wi-Fi users; n=174). Both groups have been examined using short-term memory tests; selective attention, and also divided attention tests. According to the results, there was no significant difference between using Wi-Fi router devices on levels of selective attentions and short-term memory of the sample students with the control group. However, analyses revealed that there is a significant correlation between the use of Wi-Fi routers and declining levels of divided attentions. Our investigation has demonstrated the adverse consequences of 2.4-2.48GHz radiofrequency electromagnetic fields of Wi-Fi router devices on divided attention levels of female university students that should be mentioned as a technological risk factor and taken into account by healthcare organizations.",10.1002/jcb.28343
J,"Burrows, JE; Paulson, MQ; Altman, ER; Vukovic, I; Machonkin, TE","The role of halogen substituents and substrate pK<sub>a</sub> in defining the substrate specificity of 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone 1,2-dioxygenase (PcpA)","2,6-Dichlorohydroquinone 1,2-dioxygenase (PcpA) is a non-heme Fe(II) enzyme that is specific for ortho-dihalohydroquinones. Here we deconvolute the role of halogen polarizability vs. substrate pK(a) in defining this specificity, and show how substrate binding compares to the structurally homologous catechol extradiol dioxygenases. The substrates 2,6-dichloro- and 2,6-dibromohydroquinone (polarizable halogens, pK(a1)=7.3), 2,6-difluorohydroquinone (nonpolarizable halogens, pK(a1)=7.5), and 2-chloro-6-methylhydroquinone (polarizable halogen, pK(a1)=9.0) were examined through spectrophotometric titrations and steady-state kinetics. The results show that binding of the substrates to the enzyme decreased pKa1app by about 0.5, except for 2,6-difluorohydroquinone, which showed no change. Additionally, the K-d values of 2,6-dichloro- and 2,6-dibromohydroquinone are about equal to their respective KmAapp. For comparison, with catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (XylE), the substrates 4-methyl- and 3-bromocatechol are bound to the enzyme exclusively in the monoanion form over a wide pH range, indicating a pKa1app of at least -2.9 and -1.2, respectively. The steady-state kinetic studies showed that 2,6-difluorohydroquinone is a poor substrate, with kcatapp/KmAapp approximately 40-fold lower and KmAapp 20-fold higher than 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone, despite its similar pK(a1). Likewise, the pH dependence of kcatapp for 2-chloro-6-methylhydroquinone is nearly identical to that of 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone, despite its very different pK(a1). These results show that (1) it is clearly the halogen polarizability and not the lower substrate pK(a) that determines the substrate specificity of PcpA, and (2) that PcpA, unlike the catechol extradiol dioxygenases, lacks an active site base that assists with substrate deprotonation, highlighting a key functional difference in what are otherwise similar active sites that defines their different reactivity.",10.1007/s00775-019-01663-4
J,"Chen, QY; Zhang, XZ; Wan, Y; Zobel, J; Verspoor, K",Search Effectiveness in Nonredundant Sequence Databases: Assessments and Solutions,"Duplicate sequence records-that is, records having similar or identical sequences-are a challenge in search of biological sequence databases. They significantly increase database search time and can lead to uninformative search results containing similar sequences. Sequence clustering methods have been used to address this issue to group similar sequences into clusters. These clusters form a nonredundant database consisting of representatives (one record per cluster) and members (the remaining records in a cluster). In this approach, for nonredundant database search, users search against representatives first and optionally expand search results by exploring member records from matching clusters. Existing studies used Precision and Recall to assess the search effectiveness of nonredundant databases. However, the use of Precision and Recall does not model user behavior in practice and thus may not reflect practical search effectiveness. In this study, we first propose innovative evaluation metrics to measure search effectiveness. The findings are that (1) the Precision of expanded sets is consistently lower than that of representatives, with a decrease up to 7% at top ranks; and (2) Recall is uninformative because, for most queries, expanded sets return more records than does search of the original unclustered databases. Motivated by these findings, we propose a solution that returns a user-specified proportion of top similar records, modeled by a ranking function that aggregates sequence and annotation similarities. In experiments undertaken on UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, the largest expert-curated protein database, we show that our method dramatically reduces the number of returned sequences, increases Precision by 3%, and does not impact effective search time.",10.1089/cmb.2018.0198
J,"Clarke, S; Nagan, Y; Prinsloo, E; Oosthuizen, V",An acidic loop within the human soluble CD23 protein may direct the interaction between sCD23 and the α<sub>X</sub>β<sub>2</sub> integrin,"CD23 is involved in a myriad of immune reactions. It is not only a receptor for IgE, but also functions in the regulation of IgE synthesis, isotype switching in B cells, and induction of the inflammatory response. These effector functions of CD23 arise through its interaction with another leukocyte-specific cell surface receptor - the beta(2) integrin subfamily. It has been shown that CD23 is also capable of interacting with the beta(3) and beta(5) integrin beta-subunit of integrins via a basic RKC motif in a metal cation-independent fashion. In this study the interaction was probed for whether or not the RKC motif governs the interaction between CD23 and the a(X)beta(2) integrin as well. This was done by performing bioinformatic docking predictions between CD23 and a(X)beta(2) integrin aI domain and SPR spectroscopy analysis of the interaction. This revealed that in the absence of cations, the RKC motif is involved in interaction with the integrin aI domain. However, in the presence of divalent metal cations the interaction showed the involvement of a novel acidic motif within the CD23 protein. This same pattern of interaction was seen in docking predictions between CD23 and the beta I-3-like domain. This study thus presents an alternative site as a possible contributor to the CD23-integrin interaction exhibiting cation-dependence.",10.1016/j.bbapap.2019.03.004

We used hair analysis for monitoring pain medications in 12 women with chronic migraine and drug overuse. Hair samples were collected at baseline and after 4 and 8 months and analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Intra-patient variability of the hair-level-to-dose ratio was <20% in most cases. The hair analysis detected changes in the dose taken by the same patient over time, both occasionally and chronically. The agreement between the changes in hair drug levels and those of taken doses was excellent. Therefore, hair analysis appeared advantageous for long-term monitoring of pain medications, which is otherwise difficult to determine in conventional matrices. In the same sample, multiple medications could be simultaneously determined, and with three samples, nine months of therapy were objectively documented.",10.1002/dta.2560

J,"Graham, LL; Feero, SE",The <i>Campylobacter fetus</i> S layer provides resistance to photoactivated zinc oxide nanoparticles,"The antimicrobial activity of metal-based compounds, including metal oxides, has resulted in numerous agricultural, industrial, and medical applications. Zinc oxide nanoparticles are toxic to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as to some fungi. In this study we assess the sensitivity of Campylobacter fetus, a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen of humans and animals, to ZnO nanoparticles and determine whether the S layer protects C. fetus from the antibacterial action of these nanoparticles. Broth and agar dilution assays revealed that ZnO nanoparticles at 100 mu g/mL were bacteriocidal for C. fetus. Resazurin reduction assays confirmed the absence of metabolic activity, indicating that C. fetus cells had not entered into a viable but nonculturable state. Photoactivation of ZnO nanoparticles greatly enhanced their antibacterial activity, as evidenced by minimum bacteriocidal concentration (MBC) values decreasing to 16-62.5 mu g/mL as a function of strain. MBC assays completed in the presence and absence of catalase revealed that H2O2, a product of ZnO nanoparticle photoactivation, contributed to C. fetus but not to C. jejuni cell death. S-layer-expressing C. fetus strains were more resistant to H2O2-mediated cell killing than were isogenic S-layer-deficient strains. These data indicate that C. fetus is sensitive to the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles and that the C. fetus S layer imparts protection against photoactivated nanoparticles.",10.1139/cjm-2018-0451

Here, we characterized two paralogs Cited3 genes (Cited3a and Cited3b) from blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala), which is a hypoxia-sensitive species. Both genes have an open reading frame of 756 and 723bp; encoded a protein of 251 amino acid and 240 amino acid, respectively; and they shared a sequence identity of 67%. In adult fish, both Cited3a and Cited3b mRNAs were highly expressed in kidney tissues. In contrast, they were detected in the skin, muscle, and gonad at extraordinarily low levels. During embryogenesis, both Cited3a and Cited3b mRNAs were maternally deposited in eggs and fluctuated from the zygote to the 44-hpf (hours post-fertilization) larvae. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that both Cited3a and Cited3b mRNAs were transcribed in the brain, gut, and tailbud at 12hpf, and at the brain and gut at 24hpf, and at the brain at 36hpf embryos. Hypoxic treatment led to upregulated expression of the Cited3 genes during embryogenesis. Under hypoxia, both Cited3a and Cited3b genes in the kidney and brain and Cited3a genes in the liver were significantly upregulated. These results suggest that hypoxia was associated with increases in mRNA levels for both Cited3a (kidney, brain, liver) and Cited3b (kidney and liver).",10.1007/s10695-019-00625-6

The AVB2 model was formulated and parameterized for porphyrin and porphycene using results of quantum mechanical computations at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level. The DFT potential energy, its gradients, and the Hessian-matrix elements, as well as effective atomic charges at local energy minima and transition states, were used for the parameterization of the AVB2 Hamiltonian matrix. The AVB2 method, and in particular its anharmonic version, very well reproduce the potential energy maps for all representative geometries of the studied systems, including harmonic frequencies, and possible proton translocations. For validation of the method, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for isolated molecules accounting for internal double proton transfer processes, which are strongly correlated with changes of the electronic charge density. The simulated power spectra were compared with the experimental infrared spectra. More precise simulations of IR spectra at the classical and quantum dynamics levels, as well as extensions of the AVB2 parameterization to electronic excited states, are the subject of further research.",10.1007/s00894-019-4022-7

Plasma low-density lipoprotein levels are correlated to the occurrence of atherosclerosis, and their control is critical for both the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is one of the key regulators of lipoprotein metabolism; PLTP-deficient mice exhibit decreased apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoprotein secretion and atherosclerosis, indicating the validity of PLTP as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput screening (HTS) method to identify a novel chemotype of PLTP inhibitors. Instead of using recombinant proteins, we used human plasma as a source of enzymes in the first screening, so as to efficiently exclude promiscuous inhibitors. The selected compounds were further confirmed to target PLTP both biochemically and biophysically and were shown to inhibit apoB secretion from hepatic cells with no apparent toxicity. We believe that our approach is suitable for filtering out nonspecific inhibitors at an earlier stage of screening campaigns and that these compounds should have potential to be developed into drugs to treat dyslipidemia.",10.1177/2472555219842210

On the contrary, whole metagenomic data obtained by the shotgun sequence method have not often been fully analyzed through a homology search because the genomic data in databases for living organisms on earth are insufficient. In order to complement the results obtained through homology-search-based methods with shotgun metagenomes data, we focused on the composition of protein domains deduced from the sequences of genomes and metagenomes, and we utilized them in characterizing genomes and metagenomes, respectively. First, we compared the relationships based on similarities in the protein domain composition with the relationships based on sequence similarities. We searched for protein domains of 325 bacterial species produced using the Pfam database. Next, the correlation coefficients of protein domain compositions between every pair of bacteria were examined. Every pairwise genetic distance was also calculated from 16S rRNA or DNA gyrase subunit B. We compared the results of these methods and found a moderate correlation between them. Essentially, the same results were obtained when we used partial random 100 bp DNA sequences of the bacterial genomes, which simulated raw sequence data obtained from short-read next-generation sequences. Then, we applied the method for analyzing the actual environmental data obtained by shotgun sequencing. We found that the transition of the microbial phase occurred because the seasonal change in water temperature was shown by the method.

Using the Tyr substituted mutants, we first assigned the respective signals of four Tyr residues. In the titration experiments with NADH, the four Tyr signals changed uniquely; changes in chemical shift and signal broadening were observed. The NADH binding affinity, determined from the plots of the H-1 and N-15 chemical shift changes, was comparable to those reported previously. Together with the crystal structure information for Ps3 alpha HSD in the NADH-free and -bound states, site-specific conformational changes including environmental changes could be deduced.",10.1016/j.ab.2019.03.009

Given the increasing amount of biological data available and the recent discoveries showing that many diseases are related to the disruption of cellular signal transduction cascades, in silico discovery of signaling pathways in cell biology has become an active research topic in past years. However, reconstruction of signaling pathways remains a challenge mainly because of the need for systematic approaches for predicting causal relationships, like edge direction and activation/inhibition among interacting proteins in the signal flow. We propose an approach for predicting signaling pathways that integrates protein interactions, gene expression, phenotypes, and protein complex information. Our method first finds candidate pathways using a directed-edge-based algorithm and then defines a graph model to include causal activation relationships among proteins, in candidate pathways using cell cycle gene expression and phenotypes to infer consistent pathways in yeast. Then, we incorporate protein complex coverage information for deciding on the final predicted signaling pathways.
